<h1>rk Is Not Yet Finished” - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
It's always a humbling experience to speak at a BYU devotional. I think this is especially true for those of us who attended this university. I remember when President David O. McKay came and spoke. At that time our devotionals were held in the George Albert Smith Fieldhouse. I was sitting close to the pulpit, and when President and Sister McKay came in, they walked right by me. I was awestruck. Now here I stand at the pulpit, thinking, "You deserve so much more."<br><br>As I pondered what I should present, I settled on discussing an experience I've had during this last year that is unique and perhaps qualifies me to broaden your perspective at this key time in your life. It has certainly broadened mine. With your indulgence I will recount this personal experience.<br><br>One year ago I entered the hospital after having a heart attack that resulted in considerable damage. The operation seemed to go very well, considering I needed six bypasses. However, one hour after the operation, I had a second attack. My heart stopped beating for more than three minutes, and I went into shock for six hours. I was placed on life support. It was five days before my heart began to beat on its own, and I was on a respirator for over two weeks. The doctors were concerned that I might have suffered serious kidney and brain damage (the jury is still out on the brain). I lost from one-third to one-half of my heart muscle, and things looked bleak. The doctors and some of the Brethren prepared my wife and our children for the worst. Technically I was gone, but then I got sent back. My cardiologist calls me Elder Lazarus. Etched indelibly in my soul to this day are the words "Your work is not yet finished."<br><br>I don't know how much time I've got left. As a CPA with a master of accountancy degree from Brigham Young University, I have concluded that I must live 20 more years to get a decent return on my insurance company's investment.<br><br>There is a challenge and a blessing with not knowing how much time you've got left--or why you've been sent back. You become alert to everything around you, because one of the reasons you've been given more time may be right in front of you when you least expect it. King Benjamin's admonition has taken on a deeper and more personal meaning to me:<br><br><i>I say unto you</i> [Glenn] <i>that if ye should serve him who has created you from the beginning, </i>and is preserving you from day to day, by lending you breath, that ye may live and move and do according to your own will, and even supporting you from one moment to another--<i>I say, if ye should serve him with all your whole</i> [soul] <i>yet ye would be</i> [an] <i>unprofitable</i> [servant]. [Mosiah 2:21; emphasis added]<br><br>Please excuse that self-indulgence. You may be asking, "What does this have to do with me?" To each of you I say that your work is not yet finished either, and I regret to inform you that you don't know how much time you've got left. Pondering that reality should raise some questions in your mind as to what you should be doing with that time. What is the Lord expecting of you during your sojourn on this planet?<br><br>It is therapeutic to step back from the details of life and reacquaint ourselves with the big picture. A few years ago our family was vacationing at Colter Bay in Grand Teton National Park. One beautiful, clear night we were walking down a trail that led to Jackson Lake. I happened to look up at the sky and was overwhelmed at the clarity of the stars and the magnitude of the universe. I wondered how long it had been since I had stared at the sky and let the grandeur of eternity and the glory of God's creations wash over me. It had been too long, and therefore I repented and soaked it in. Later that year I was reading some excerpts from John A. Widtsoe's <i>A Rational Theology</i>, which brought back some feelings of that night:<br><br><i>Earth, stars and the vastness of space; yesterday, today and tomorrow. . . . Only in general outline can the universe be understood. In its infinite variety of expression, it wholly transcends the human mind. . . .</i><br><br><i>Nevertheless, conscious man can not endure confusion. . . . Especially is he driven, by his inborn and unalterable nature, to know if possible his own place in the system of existing things.</i> [John A. Widtsoe, <i>A Rational Theology: As Taught by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints </i>(Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1937), 1]<br><br>What is your place in the system of existing things?<br><br>"The Family: A Proclamation to the World" simply and clearly states: "All human beings--male and female--are created in the image of God. Each is a beloved spirit son or daughter of heavenly parents, and, as such, each has a divine nature and destiny" (<i>Ensign,</i> November 1995, 102).<br><br>We were promised that the way would be prepared for us to reach our divine destiny and become like our heavenly parents. Every person who has ever lived or will ever live on this earth is a spirit child of heavenly parents. We have lived with them and have been taught by them. Their ultimate purpose has always been "to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man" (Moses 1:39).<br><br>While still in premortality we were taught the gospel and knew the difference between right and wrong. We also had the agency to choose our path. The account of the War in Heaven provides evidence that we had been taught the truth and had been given the agency to accept or reject what we had been taught.<br><br>Whenever numerous people with unique talents are given a set of rules or laws, along with the freedom to either obey or disobey and to work at their own speed, a diversity of progress in those individuals will result. When we are dealing with a population as numerous as the "sand of the sea," we cannot imagine the variety of children our Father in Heaven is dealing with (Genesis 32:12; Jeremiah 33:22). The wonderful thing is that He loves us in our diversity. Our diversity helps Him to bring to pass His purposes here on the earth. With His complete understanding of each of us, He devised a plan for the time and place of our lifework on earth. We learn in Acts 17:26: "[He] hath made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on all the face of the earth, and hath determined the times before appointed, and the bounds of their habitation."<br><br>With His omniscience He determined the precise time and place of our sojourn on earth that would give us the opportunity to continue to progress as well as to be of assistance to others in their progression.<br><br>Elder Bruce R. McConkie explained foreordination as follows:<br><br><i>To carry forward his own purposes among men and nations, the Lord </i>foreordained<i> chosen spirit children in pre-existence and assigned them to come to earth at particular times and places so that they might aid in furthering the divine will. These pre-existence appointments, made "according to the foreknowledge of God the Father" (1 Pet. 1:2), simply designated certain individuals to perform missions which the Lord in his wisdom knew they had the talents and capacities to do.</i> [<i>MD, </i>290, s.v. "foreordination"; emphasis in original]<br><br>So here we are in the Marriott Center this morning knowing that we are not on earth at this time by accident or through the luck of the draw. Once we understand and have a conviction of this reality, we can obtain the faith to move forward and overcome any obstacle that stands in the way of fulfilling our foreordained destiny. We can and will make a difference.<br><br>Again, with your indulgence, let's return to my circumstance. Knowing that the bounds of my habitation were set by a being who is omniscient, omnipotent, and omnipresent, even Jesus Christ, I also know that I've got things I need to do and that perhaps I'm running out of time. This gives me a sense of urgency, which I'm trying to pass along to you.<br><br>You have been sent to earth at a very troublesome time. One can hardly watch the news without becoming depressed and cynical. It's enough to drive you to watch <i>Lawrence Welk</i> reruns. President Gordon B. Hinckley is one of the most positive people I know, but the world saddens and worries him. Last January, in the Worldwide Leadership Training Meeting, he said:<br><br><i>No one need tell you that we are living in a very difficult season in the history of the world. Standards are dropping everywhere. Nothing seems to be sacred any more. . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . I do not know that things were worse in the times of Sodom and Gomorrah. . . . We see similar conditions today. They prevail all across the world. I think our Father must weep as He looks down upon His wayward sons and daughters.</i> [Gordon B. Hinckley, "Standing Strong and Immovable," in <i>Worldwide Leadership Training Meeting: The Priesthood and the Auxiliaries of the Relief Society, Young Women, and Primary,</i> 10 January 2004 (Salt Lake City: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 2004), 20]<br><br>Knowing these conditions exist, and understanding the doctrine of foreordination, you should be looking for opportunities to use your unique set of talents in making the world better and building the kingdom of God. You have not come to this earth in these troubled times by coincidence. You have not been sent to the earth during this wicked period of the earth's history to fail because of it but to succeed in spite of it--and to help others do the same.<br><br>There's an important message that you've heard from various leaders of the Church over and over again, but I'm not sure you have a conviction of it. It is that you belong to the finest generation we've ever had in the Church (see Gordon B. Hinckley, <i>CR,</i> April 1992, 96; or "A Chosen Generation," <i>Ensign,</i> May 1992, 69; see also <i>CR,</i> April 1995, 93; or "This Is the Work of the Master," <i>Ensign,</i> May 1995, 70). It is my observation that the young men and women of the Church today are much more spiritually advanced than those of my generation. This idea ties in to the plan we have been discussing. You have been reserved to come to the earth at this time. There is no question about the seriousness of the condition of the world. Keep in mind, however, that you were foreordained to come to the earth at this precise season.<br><br>With this sobering thought you can't afford to let the distractions of life, let alone the decadence all around you, make you swerve off course. You can't become cynical about the state of the world rather than doing your part to improve it. This kingdom will never again be taken from the earth, and you are going to help build it.<br><br>At your age you are facing several critical forks in the road that will have a lifetime impact on your ability to fulfill your foreordained assignments. You may be trying to decide on a major or what career path you want to take when your education is complete. Many of you are in the process of finding a spouse who will walk at your side through this life and beyond. All of these are important steps in the direction of your foreordained mission here upon the earth.<br><br>You simply cannot afford to cut off the inspiration needed in making these decisions by veering off into forbidden areas, jamming the communication lines. Don't even flirt with sin. Most frequently this will end in disaster. All too often those who flee from temptation leave a forwarding address.<br><br>Where do you fit in the eternal scheme of things? I don't think you should be overly concerned about that. It is enough to know you do fit, and therefore you should be looking for ways you can fulfill your divine destiny.<br><br>First and foremost I would point out that the most important of all assignments is within your own families. President David O. McKay often taught, "No success in life can compensate for failure in the home" (see <i>CR,</i> April 1935, 116; quoting James Edward McCulloch, ed., <i>Home: The Savior of Civilization</i> [Washington, D.C.: Southern Co-operative League, 1924], 42). And President Harold B. Lee taught, "The greatest of the Lord's work you brethren will ever do as fathers will be within the walls of your own home" (<i>CR,</i> April 1973, 130; or "Follow the Leadership of the Church," <i>Ensign</i>, July 1973, 98).<br><br>After saying this, I would emphasize that your choice of a career is very important and will equip you with the tools to provide a living for your family as well as present oppor-tunities for building the kingdom. I have a strong testimony of this fact. I was first alerted to the possible synergism of a chosen occupation and the building of the kingdom of God when I was 19 years old. I received my patriarchal blessing, which stated that the Lord's purposes would be brought to pass through my chosen profession in the daily activities of my life. I was quite perplexed at first, because I was majoring in accounting and thought the most I could do for mankind in this profession was bore people to sleep. In hindsight, however, I can clearly see the Lord's hand in various career choices I have made. I can also see those choices have given me numerous opportunities to be of service. Choose your career carefully, with much study and prayer.<br><br>As far as Church callings are concerned, my counsel would be to not waste precious time wondering about any particular assignment that lies ahead. We should worry less about what we will be assigned to do in the future and more about how we are fulfilling the assignments we already have been given. We need to bloom where we are planted, because the Lord is the gardener.<br><br>Again referring to my situation, He who sent me back is perfectly capable of inspiring my leaders on where to use me. Your leaders will be inspired in a like manner as to where your unique set of talents can be used.<br><br>Whatever those callings are, you have great joy and fulfillment in store as you are magnified in your callings. Speaking from experience, I can tell you the assignments I had prior to becoming a General Authority were just as fulfilling as those I have been given as a General Authority. There are many things I miss about my prior life in my own ward.<br><br>I will give one example. As an elders quorum presidency we had some success in preparing couples to go to the temple for the first time to receive their endowments and be sealed for time and all eternity. For the past 20 years I have been blessed with the authority to perform sealings for numerous couples. Although this is a great and sacred honor, I can say without reservation that the gratification I feel in doing so is not as great as that which I felt sitting in an obscure corner of the sealing room watching another sealer perform the ceremony for a couple with whom I had worked to prepare for that occasion. As General Authorities we travel from place to place and have limited opportunities to get personally involved with members.<br><br>Whatever formal callings come our way, I can testify that each of us will have the same accountability to the Lord for what we do with our callings as the prophet will with his. Furthermore, in performing our assignments we have access to the same Spirit he does and can receive the same joy therein.<br><br>President Gordon B. Hinckley has taught:<br><br><i>I wish to remind you that we are all in this together. It is not a matter of the General Authorities on one hand and the membership of the Church on the other. We are all working as one in a great cause. We are all members of the Church of Jesus Christ. </i><br><br><i>Within your sphere of responsibility you have as serious an obligation as do I within my sphere of responsibility. Each of us should be determined to build the kingdom of God on the earth and to further the work of righteousness.</i> [<i>CR,</i> October 2003, 85; or "An Ensign to the Nations, a Light to the World," <i>Ensign</i>, November 2003, 82]<br><br>Over the last year an understanding of my unfinished business is gradually settling in. It extends far beyond being true to my current and future formal assignments. Obviously I need to be performing these with all my heart (what's left of it), might, mind, and strength. But the area in my life that needs the most improvement is outside the more visible, formal assignments--like speaking at a BYU devotional. I need to give more attention to what I am or what I am becoming. The Lord said, "Therefore, what manner of men ought ye to be? Verily I say unto you, even as I am" (3 Nephi 27:27).<br><br>I have been asking myself some hard questions. "Glenn, you've been a General Authority for 20 years. You've learned how to talk the talk. Have you become what you teach? When you are released as a Seventy and the mantle of your calling is gone, what will be left?" This is sobering when you've come as close to passing through the veil as I have. When I reflect on these questions, I sometimes wonder whether I was sent back or simply turned away. There is a difference.<br><br>I didn't come back any more pure than I was when I walked into the hospital, but I have come back humbled--to the dust--and hopefully this will give rise to future purification. I want to be as true to the Lord's expectations of me as He was to the Father's expectations of Him. Prior to coming to this earth, under the direction of God the Father, He created worlds without number. He was the Great Jehovah of the Old Testament.<br><br>With all this power and all this majesty, He nevertheless condescended to come to the earth in humble circumstances. Here "Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favour with God and man" (Luke 2:52). At the appointed hour He was baptized to fulfill all righteousness. He went about doing good and yet was despised for it. He entered the Garden of Gethsemane and took upon Himself our sins through the things He suffered. He was arrested, scourged, and crucified. I've often wondered how He was able to discipline Himself not to use His infinite powers to escape the terrible pain inflicted on Him. I've long since realized it wasn't a matter of discipline at all but of love for each of us. He knew His foreordained assignment. He knew our salvation depended on His successful completion of it.<br><br>He was triumphant. The Savior was true to His assignment. Are we going to be true to ours?<br><br>It is my prayer that these remarks will be of some help to you in coming to understand where you fit in the eternal scheme of things. It is also my prayer that you will do those things while at this university that will make you equal to the task, because your work is not yet finished. It has only just begun. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Glenn L.

<h1> My Servant Joseph Smith - Cecil O. Samuelson - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I am grateful, with Sister Samuelson, to be with you as we begin a new year and a new semester. I hope you share my enthusiasm for our opportunities and prospects in 2005. I also hope you have not yet broken all of your New Year's resolutions!<br><br>As you know, the year 2005 is the bicentennial anniversary of the birth of the Prophet Joseph Smith. During this year, throughout the Church and here at BYU, we will hear much and be reminded frequently of the life and mission of our Prophet of the Restoration. I am grateful to be able to add my voice to the millions of others who will honor this great man in so many ways in the days ahead.<br><br>Just last November we were privileged to hear from Sister Heidi Swinton, who spoke at our campus devotional on the topic "Joseph Smith: Lover of the Cause of Christ." It was a masterful address that presented history, facts, truth, and testimony. Now that our devotional presentations are so readily available, I'll not take time to repeat much of what she said. I do want to draw attention to one of those lines or phrases that has caused me to reflect, assess, think, and recommit myself. It is one that evokes sweet memories and striking insights.<br><br>Sister Swinton mentioned a verse from section 6 of the Doctrine and Covenants that was given to Oliver Cowdery during the time he served as Joseph's scribe while he was translating the Book of Mormon. She also reminded us that this instruction was not just for Oliver but is for all of us as well (see D&amp;amp;C 25:16). This is what the Lord said: "Therefore be diligent; stand by my servant Joseph, faithfully, in whatsoever difficult circumstances he may be for the word's sake" (D&amp;amp;C 6:18).<br><br>The phrase "stand by my servant Joseph" is the one that especially caught my attention. What did it mean to Oliver, and what should it mean to us?<br><br>The word <i>stand</i> has many meanings. The footnote in our scriptures suggests two words as possible synonyms for our special consideration. They are <i>diligence</i> and <i>loyalty.</i> I believe there are other definitions or constructions that might also apply. I intend to consider some of them with you.<br><br>Before I do, let me mention some of the things we know very well about the Prophet Joseph. From the very beginning, even before the Church was organized, it became clear that Joseph Smith was no ordinary young man. Although born into modest means and circumstances, he quickly was identified as someone very special. You are aware of his early experiences. The First Vision was an unexpected occurrence that not only changed his life forever but literally changed the history of the world. His initial interview with the angel Moroni, occurring while he was just 17 years old, taught him that his life and work would not be usual by any measure.<br><br>Listen to these words from his history:<br><br><i>He called me by name, and said unto me that he was a messenger sent from the presence of God to me, and that his name was Moroni; that God had a work for me to do; and that my name should be had for good and evil among all nations, kindreds, and tongues, or that it should be both good and evil spoken of among all people.</i> [JS--H 1:33]<br><br>That is an amazing prophecy for any 17year-old. Think of the statistical improbability of the assertion that his "name should be had for good and evil" so broadly around the world. Yet the name of Joseph Smith is widely known among virtually all of the nations of the earth.<br><br>Of those who have heard of Joseph, their knowledge and understanding are highly variable and usually incomplete in very important ways. The Church and its leaders, missionaries, and other representatives are doing, and will do, much to improve what the world knows and understands of Joseph Smith. All of us will have parts to play, and our roles will be important.<br><br>The understanding that people have of him occurs at different levels. Let me mention a few. I hope as I mention these that you might mentally note where you stand and which level best describes you.<br><br><i>Recognition:</i> Increasingly, people recognize the name Joseph Smith and are able to relate him to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, the Book of Mormon, and other basics of our faith. Some know enough, or believe that they know enough, to have developed opinions about him--positive or negative. Probably most people throughout the world fit into this category and are not exercised about him sufficiently to try and learn more. It is important that this group should not include any of us.<br><br><i>Appreciation:</i> Of those who recognize the Prophet Joseph by name, there are those who know that he accomplished some things that have made a difference. They know that he organized a church and movement that has grown dramatically and has influenced many lives. Although they may or may not believe in his work or admire his contributions, they acknowledge that the world is different because of his life and efforts.<br><br><i>Admiration:</i> Many who appreciate that Joseph made a difference also admire many of his accomplishments and contributions. Although still not necessarily subscribing to his teachings or his mission, they admire what he did in Kirtland, Missouri, and Nauvoo. They admire his ability to enlist a following and to inspire people to sacrifice greatly for the cause he espoused. Again, not all who admire his accomplishments necessarily endorse his positions, even when they speak with admiration of some of the fruits of the gospel as he taught it.<br><br><i>Testimony:</i> A subset of those who recognize, appreciate, and admire the Prophet Joseph are those who have a testimony of the truthfulness of his mission, his teachings, and his accounts of encounters with heavenly beings. They have no reservations about him or the doctrines he revealed, but they may not have fully internalized what this should mean to them.<br><br><i>True loyalty (or those who stand by him):</i> Some, and I hope this includes you, have a testimony of the Prophet Joseph Smith and his unique and special mission. It is to you that I frame my question: What does it mean to "stand by my servant Joseph"? It means more than just recognition, appreciation--even admiration, belief, and testimony. The counsel given to Oliver Cowdery is illustrative of what I mean. To Oliver's great credit, he never denied his testimony of the events and experiences he had with Joseph Smith. Unfortunately, he did not live up to what the Lord required of him and lost his place to one more faithful (see D&amp;amp;C 124:95).<br><br>Another who was trusted and given great privileges and responsibility--as well as being instructed to stand by Joseph--was John C. Bennett (see D&amp;amp;C 124:16). Unfortunately, he not only was disloyal to Joseph, he lost his testimony as well, which is not uncommon with those who transgress (see D&amp;amp;C 68:16).<br><br>As you know, the one called to replace Oliver and enjoy the privileges, responsibilities, and destiny with the Prophet Joseph was his brother Hyrum. Without contrasting Hyrum with others unnecessarily, let us examine how Hyrum responded to his charge to stand by Joseph. There are many examples. Let me focus on just one for now (see D&amp;amp;C 11).<br><br>Even before the Church was organized, Hyrum, Joseph's older brother by five years, knew the truthfulness of what Joseph was teaching and reporting. He wanted to do his part and hoped and pled to be called as a missionary. I believe that you will want to study carefully the entire 11th section of the Doctrine and Covenants, which is the answer given by the Lord through Joseph Smith to Hyrum's entreaty. A useful exercise is to count the number of times in these verses that Hyrum is told that his work is to "keep the commandments." Let me just repeat part of the oft-quoted verse that must have been both a test and a trial for Hyrum.<br><br>"Seek not to declare my word, but first seek to obtain my word" (D&amp;amp;C 11:21). I suppose, had Hyrum been inclined, that he could have been just as offended as were Oliver and others when Joseph, acting in his role as president and prophet, had to tell them the hard truth as well. To Hyrum's everlasting credit, in spite of his initial disappointment that he was not to be a missionary at that time, he stood by Joseph and received the blessings God reserves for those most loyal and trusted. These blessings included, less than a year later, the exact opportunity that Hyrum had initially sought (see D&amp;amp;C 23:3).<br><br>Another who stood by Joseph was Brigham Young. Think of his loyalty. He said, "I feel like shouting hallejujah [<i>sic</i>], all the time, when I think that I ever knew Joseph Smith" (<i>JD </i>3:51). We don't have time today to catalog all of the times Brigham demonstrated his complete fealty to Joseph, but the Prophet recognized and appreciated it. Near the end of his life Joseph said, "Of the [original] Twelve Apostles chosen in Kirtland, . . . there have been but two but what have lifted their heel against me--namely Brigham Young and Heber C. Kimball" (<i>HC</i> 5:412).<br><br>Grateful are we that there were others besides Hyrum, Brigham, and Heber C. Kimball who stood by Joseph even when it may have seemed to many to be folly to do so. Interestingly, but not surprisingly, it was from this group who stood by Joseph that replacements for the Twelve and other key leadership responsibilities were later selected. Let me mention just two of them.<br><br>John Taylor, who would follow Brigham Young as Joseph's successor, was converted to the Restoration by an apostle who later wavered for a period before returning to stand by Joseph. John Taylor, however, was stalwart from the time of his baptism in 1836. During the dark days in Kirtland he attended a meeting where President Joseph Smith, not in attendance, was severely criticized by apostates who once had been Joseph's friends and associates. John Taylor courageously offered this defense:<br><br><i>It was Joseph Smith, under the Almighty, who developed the first principles, and to him we must look for further instructions. If the spirit which he manifests does not bring blessings, I am very much afraid that the one manifested by those who have spoken, will not be very likely to secure them. The children of Israel, formerly, after seeing the power of God manifested in their midst, fell into rebellion and idolatry, and there is certainly very great danger of us doing the same thing.</i> [In B. H. Roberts, <i>The Life of John Taylor</i> (Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1963), 41]<br><br>John Taylor saw what had happened to his colleagues and recognized the attendant spiritual risks that they faced. I submit that the danger to us as well is both great and real should we also fail to stand by Joseph.<br><br>Another who stood steadfast in the chilling wind of a contagious apostasy was Wilford Woodruff. He, like John Taylor, was called to replace those who had fallen, and he himself later succeeded President Taylor as the prophet. In discussing these matters and instruction given to him at the time of his call to the Twelve, he had the following to say:<br><br><i>He</i> [meaning Joseph Smith] <i>taught us some very important principles, some of which I here name. . . . Brother Joseph laid before us the cause of those men's turning away from the commandments of God. He hoped we would learn wisdom by what we saw with the eye and heard with the ear, and that we would be able to discern the spirits of other men without being compelled to learn by sad experience. He then remarked that any man . . . who pursued a course whereby he would ignore or in other words refuse to obey any known law or commandment or duty--whenever a man did this, neglected any duty God required at his hand in attending meetings, filling missions, or obeying counsel, he laid a foundation to lead him to apostasy and this was the reason those men had fallen.</i> [<i>JD</i> 21:190]<br><br>Note with care the risk attendant to violating commandments and covenants.<br><br>On another occasion, Brother Woodruff bore this testimony, which witness of Joseph and his mission was consistent throughout his life:<br><br><i>It has been my faith and belief from the time that I was made acquainted with the Gospel that no greater prophet than Joseph Smith ever lived on the face of the earth save Jesus Christ. He was raised up to stand at the head of this great dispensation--the greatest of all dispensations God has ever given to man.</i> [<i>JD </i>21:317]<br><br>This testimony was beautiful and clear, but what was even more impressive and helpful was the steady and stalwart behavior that Wilford Woodruff demonstrated in clearly and consistently standing by Joseph Smith.<br><br>Some of that original group of apostles and other followers seemed to have lost their testimonies, although Oliver and others apparently had not, in spite of their differences with Joseph. They just were not able to stand by Joseph when the heat and pressure became so severe.<br><br>What does it mean to us to stand by Joseph? We do not have a doctrine of infallibility. Joseph himself was quick to admit his own shortcomings, but he was also a very good and stable boy and man. In describing his own situation and occasional errors, he said: "No one need suppose me guilty of any great or malignant sins. A disposition to commit such was never in my nature" (JS--H 1:28). His openness on these matters was lifelong, and shortly before his death he said: "I never told you I was perfect; but there is no error in the revelations which I have taught" (<i>Teachings, </i>368).<br><br>Our testimonies are vital, but not sufficient by themselves. The Bible reminds us that even the devils believe in Jesus (see James 2:19). Our love and respect for Joseph Smith is important, but if it is not incorporated into our lives internally and consistently, we cannot stand by Joseph. We may not expect to have the same experiences that Oliver Cowdery and others had with Joseph Smith, but we can expect to have the same convictions--and to demonstrate them in the same way that Brigham Young, Heber C. Kimball, John Taylor, Wilford Woodruff, and countless more anonymous thousands have since the Restoration of the gospel.<br><br>Such conviction comes to us by study, by faith, and by always acting appropriately--and it is hard work. Those who I have named, as well as legions of others, have obtained this witness and internalized it through the manifestations of the Holy Ghost. The Holy Ghost is anxious to confer this sustaining knowledge to us because the testimony of Joseph's work and mission is key and central to our testimony of that which is most important of all: that Jesus is the Christ, our Savior and Redeemer, and the literal living Son of our living Heavenly Father.<br><br>How grateful we are to Joseph for his worthiness to witness what he did for us. How grateful we should be that we are allowed to "stand by" Joseph with our own actions and testimonies of the Father and the Son.<br><br>I have come to believe that this attitude is in large part the crux of the matter when the question of "Why BYU?" is asked. You know the account of our origins and our history. You know that our people, in their absolute poverty, have always sacrificed so that those who follow will have opportunities for excellent education in both things of the spirit and of the world. I hope you know that this is still the case. Although our collective circumstances are better than ever, we are still the beneficiaries of significant sacrifice on the part of many. Why should this be the case when the opportunities we enjoy are available to only a fraction of the worthy and desirous who wish to be where we are? I hope you are constantly thinking about this as I am.<br><br>Elder Neal A. Maxwell, in his last visit to BYU in the spring of 2004, shed some significant light on this matter. In his comments he included our excellent faculty and generous donors, as well as you special students, in his expressions of gratitude for what has been and is being accomplished here. Listen carefully to his words:<br><br><i>In a way LDS scholars at BYU and elsewhere are a little bit like the builders of the temple in Nauvoo, who worked with a trowel in one hand and a musket in the other. Today scholars building the temple of learning must also pause on occasion to defend the Kingdom. I personally think this is one of the reasons the Lord established and maintains this University. The dual role of builder and defender is unique and ongoing. I am grateful we have scholars today who can handle, as it were, both trowels and muskets.</i> ["Blending Research and Revelation," remarks at the BYU President's Leadership Council meeting, 19 March 2004]<br><br>We are here not only to achieve academically, not only spiritually, but also to do our parts in establishing the Church throughout the world and defending the kingdom. Happily, in our day we do not often actually use either trowels or muskets. We must, however, keep the metaphor in mind as we build our own knowledge while contributing as we can to the expansion of understanding in the world broadly. Likewise, we are here to strengthen faith and testimony, both personally and in the lives of those we are privileged to influence. In other words, we are here to do what Brigham Young and Gordon B. Hinckley expect us to do: to "stand by" Joseph.<br><br>We proclaim that the mission of Brigham Young University "is to assist individuals in their quest for perfection and eternal life" ("The Mission of Brigham Young University"). To this end, BYU seeks to develop students of faith, intellect, and character who have the skills and the desire to continue learning and to serve others throughout their lives. As has been stated repeatedly, these are the common aims of all education at BYU. We want everyone to achieve personally as much as is possible, but we do so with the important understanding that this goal is motivated by the desire to help each one of us be more effective in serving others.<br><br>Let me return to the counsel of the Lord to Oliver that provides the basis for my message today: "Therefore be diligent; stand by my servant Joseph, faithfully, in whatsoever difficult circumstances he may be for the word's sake" (D&amp;amp;C 6:18). In that context, Oliver Cowdery was given this additional counsel that I share with you now as you strive to incorporate into your own lives the necessary characteristics and determination that will allow you always and forever to stand by Joseph: "Be patient; be sober; be temperate; have patience, faith, hope and charity" (D&amp;amp;C 6:19). To these I would add also the necessity of the "mighty change" of heart (Alma 5:12–14) that gives one the perspective and conviction to stand by Joseph always--meaning being true constantly and consistently to the principles he taught and the Church that he established.<br><br>May we always be worthy and willing to "stand by my servant Joseph" is my prayer. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Cecil O. Samuelson was BYU president when this devotional address was delivered on 18 January 2005.</i><br><br><i>© Intellectual Reserve, Inc.

<h1>s of Our Lives - Sharon G. Samuelson - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
My dear brothers and sisters, it is indeed a privilege to be with you this morning. It is now a new year--2005--as well as the beginning of a new semester here at Brigham Young University. My sincerest desire is that you have a wonderful experience as you flourish in the academic and spiritual atmosphere here and live amidst the outstanding students with whom you associate.<br><br>There are many aspects of getting a valuable education, and one of these is having your head in books, books, and more books a great deal of the time. Perhaps most of these books at this stage of your life are textbooks assigned to you by your professors. However, I do hope you also have the opportunity and desire for some recreational reading. I have loved books and received joy from reading them for as long as I can remember. I recall my parents reading to me as a young child as well as taking me to the library, giving me the opportunity to leave with an armload of simple books to read as fast and as often as I wanted.<br><br>When I went to bed at night I always took a trusted companion with me that I had hidden in my bedroom: a flashlight! When it would get late into the evening and I was still reading, my parents would say, "Lights out. It's time to go to sleep." Since I had my flashlight, I could get under the covers or go into the closet so they couldn't see the light under my bedroom door and I could keep on reading.<br><br>I had some very favorite books as a young girl. I have read them several times, and I can still identify these stories by hearing the first sentence or two of the narrative. Here are examples of three of them:<br><br>"'Christmas won't be Christmas without any presents,' grumbled Jo, lying on the rug."<sup>1</sup><br><br>"It was the best of times, it was the worst of times."<sup>2</sup><br><br>"I have just returned from a visit to my landlord--the solitary neighbour that I shall be troubled with."<sup>3</sup><br><br>You may have been able to identify these books as <i>Little Women, A Tale of Two Cities,</i> and <i>Wuthering Heights.</i> Upon hearing or seeing one or two sentences that introduce a book that I have so enjoyed reading, then the plot, characters, locale, message, and emotions I felt while reading that novel are vividly recalled.<br><br>I believe that a book is like a life. A book has a beginning and a conclusion--as does our earthly existence. Some books are lengthy and some are short. Most are composed of several chapters. Each chapter adds to the previous one with more knowledge and experience. Some chapters are filled with the joy and success of life. However, there are also chapters containing sadness, challenge, and tragedy. Each one of us here is writing the book of his or her life, and reading, learning, loving, serving, and worshipping are integral parts of the process.<br><br>In his book <i>Protocols of Reading,</i> Robert Scholes said:<br><br><i>If a book or a story or any other text is like a little life, and if our reading actually uses up precious time in that other story we think of as our lives, then we should make the most of our reading just as we should make the most of our lives. Reading reminds us that every text ends with a blank page and that what we get from every text is precisely balanced by what we give. Our skill, our learning, and our commitment to the text will determine, for each of us, the kind of experience that text provides. Learning to read . . . is not just a matter of acquiring information from texts, it is a matter of learning to read and write the texts of our lives.</i><sup>4</sup><br><br>If one sentence can cause me to recall a book and what it meant to me, I might ask, "What one sentence would I want to summarize my life's story and thus cause others to remember me and the life I led?" How do you want to be remembered and described by those who knew you during your sojourn here on earth?<br><br>Upon my reading the following short descriptions of four men and women, I believe that you could identify them by one or two sentences.<br><br>For example, "[He] has done more, save Jesus only, for the salvation of men in this world, than any other man that ever lived in it" (D&amp;amp;C 135:3). Of course this is a description of the Prophet Joseph Smith by John Taylor following the Prophet's martyrdom.<br><br>Another description is: "If all men had been, and were, and ever would be, like unto [him], behold, the very powers of hell would have been shaken forever; yea, the devil would never have power over the hearts of the children of men" (Alma 48:17). This is a description found in the Book of Mormon of Captain Moroni as he prepared to lead his people in defending their country and religion. In one sentence we are told the character and stature of each of these men.<br><br>Here are two descriptions of women we honor as described by Bruce R. McConkie: "She, as the mother of all living, set the pattern for all future mothers with reference to bringing up their children in light and truth."<sup>5</sup> And, next, "[She] is one of the greatest women who has ever lived on earth; the spirit daughter of God our Father, she was chosen to provide a body for his son."<sup>6</sup> Of course these short sentences describe Eve and Mary, the mother of Jesus Christ.<br><br>Another statement that is a beautiful summation of a woman's life was made by her son:<br><br><i>Blessed is my mother, for her soul is ever filled with benevolence and philanthropy; and notwithstanding her age, she shall yet receive strength and be comforted in the midst of her house: and thus saith the Lord. She shall have eternal life.</i><sup>7</sup><br><br>What a wonderful tribute the Prophet Joseph Smith paid to his mother, Lucy Mack Smith. We know that she played a significant and vital role in his development and life.<br><br>As our lives are unfolding today, we have completed several chapters and are moving forward with anticipation to those that lie ahead. You are in an exciting and very important chapter at the present time. What occurs here will determine and define future chapters, just as preceding ones brought you here to Brigham Young University. Why exactly your book is being written at this time in the latter days we do not know, but prophets and Church leaders have stated that you have been saved to come at this time and in this dispensation.<br><br>President Ezra Taft Benson delivered this message to the students at this university in 1979. It is also applicable to you in 2005:<br><br><i>For nearly six thousand years, God has held you in reserve to make your appearance in the final days before the Second Coming of the Lord. Every previous gospel dispensation has drifted into apostasy, but ours will not. . . . God has saved for the final inning some of his strongest children, who will help bear off the Kingdom triumphantly. . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . Make no mistake about it--you are a marked generation. There has never been more expected of the faithful in such a short period of time as there is of us. Never before on the face of this earth have the forces of evil and the forces of good been as well organized. . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . Each day we personally make many decisions that show where our support will go. The final outcome is certain--the forces of righteousness will finally win. What remains to be seen is where each of us personally, now and in the future, will stand in this fight--and how tall we will stand. Will we be true to our last-days, foreordained mission?</i><sup>8</sup><br><br>How privileged you are to be writing the chapters of your lives right now. With that privilege, however, there is a responsibility to be living in accordance with the teachings of Jesus Christ.<br><br>Each one of us is valuable in the sight of God. The scriptures tell us that "God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life" (John 3:16). In your book of life you have so much to offer. As each of us writes his or her book, hopefully we will strive to become the man or woman we want to be as the last chapter closes. In our past, present, and future, we did not--and do not--have control over many occurrences and circumstances that come therein, but we do have our agency to choose which of the many available paths to take. J. M. Barrie wrote, "The life of every man is a diary in which he means to write one story, and writes another; and his humblest hour is when he compares the volume as it is with what he vowed to make it."<sup>9</sup><br><br>We are accountable for our actions and choices and have a personal accountability to the Savior for them. As we write the text of our lives and the one sentence that describes it, we have an eternal perspective. How blessed we are to have the guidance of a prophet of the Lord, President Gordon B. Hinckley, as well as a loving Father in Heaven and Savior, Jesus Christ. That we reflect their teachings and love by always standing tall as we "go forth to serve" in every chapter of our lives would be my prayer in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Sharon G.

<h1> of God: Suffering Tribulation in the Redeemer’s Name - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
What a privilege it is to be here at Brigham Young University and to be able to address all of you wonderful students. Whether you know it or not, you convey a great spirit and are having and will have a great impact upon the world. As a result of the training you receive here and your personal righteousness, you truly are, as Jesus said, a <i>"light ... on</i> [a] <i>hill" </i>(Matthew 5:14).<br><br>Sister Cook and I have been privileged to have all of our children attend BYU--six of whom have graduated and two others who are preparing to do so. At least they hope so. I hope we are all very appreciative of the First Presidency, who feel strongly about education and provide such a wonderful institution, even the Lord's university.<br><h2><b>Loving God Even in the Face of One's Trials</b></h2><br>This morning I would like to address a topic entitled "The Love of God: Suffering Tribulation in the Redeemer's Name." Above all else, I desire that you know that God loves you. He loves all of His children across the world, and in spite of the very difficult problems being encountered worldwide these days, as well as in your individual lives, the love of God permeates all.<br><br>During a terrible war between the Lamanites and the Nephites where thousands were dying on both sides, Alma recorded:<br><br><i>Many had become hardened, because of the exceedingly great length of the war; and many were softened because of their afflictions, insomuch that they did humble themselves before God, even in the depth of humility.</i> [Alma 62:41]<br><br>Our trials can either end up hardening our heart or humbling us. How true the saying that suffering in life is inevitable, but misery is of our own making. In other words, because of the plan that we all agreed upon in the premortal life, we are going to suffer, whether we want to or not. However, if you can find how to suffer that tribulation in the Redeemer's name, you will bear it well and perhaps even do it with an understanding, happy heart.<br><br>Let's look first at some catastrophic kinds of trials, and then later perhaps at some personal trials we all face.<br><h2><b>Catastrophic Suffering</b></h2><br>Some weeks ago a devastating tsunami took the lives of more than 160,000 of the Lord's children. How does one understand an event such as that and even see the Lord's hand in developing additional love and trust in Him as a result of that event?<br><br>Many do not understand God and His purposes, as reflected in the following observations by current writers:<br><br>1. "In the aftermath of a cataclysm, with pictures of parents sobbing over dead infants ... , faith-shaking questions arise: Where was God? Why does a good and all-powerful deity permit such evil and grief to fall on so many thousands of innocents? What did these people do to deserve such suffering?" (William Safire, "Where Was God?" <i>New York Times, </i>10 January 2005, A23).<br><br>2. Another one: "How do people of faith make sense of the senseless? The answer is, we can't. The problem of suffering in this world has never been fully understood and cannot be completely explained" (Tom Schaefer from the <i>Wichita</i> [Kansas] <i>Eagle,</i> in "Why Did God Allow Tsunami Disaster?" <i>Deseret News,</i> 1 January 2005, E2).<br><br>3. One last one: A reverend said, "The disaster has shaken my faith." A member of another Christian church said it had "made him 'hate God.'... [He] now says that if God existed, this tragedy would have been prevented" (in Karen Mazurkewich and Geoffrey A. Fowler, "When Faith Is Tested," <i>Wall Street Journal,</i> 7 January 2005, W1, W10).<br><br>Certainly none of us as Latter-day Saints should be unduly surprised by prophesied last-day events such as these. The Lord said:<br><br><i>And there shall be signs in the sun, and in the moon, and in the stars; and upon the earth distress of nations, with perplexity; the sea and the waves roaring. </i>[Luke 21:25]<br><br><i>And the ... waves of the sea heaving themselves beyond their bounds. </i>[D&amp;amp;C 88:90]<br><br>I bear testimony that often, in the midst of suffering trials, afflictions, and discouragement, those very circumstances tutor us in developing increasing love and trust in God. Consequently, what a great blessing those trials are!<br><h2><b>Individual Suffering</b></h2><br>My purpose here today is not to focus so much on worldwide events but more so on individual suffering and trials, although the principles we discuss can apply to both.<br><br>If I could catalog suffering and trials among young people of your age, it probably would include some of the following entries:<br><ul><br> 	<li>"I have prayed fervently for something, but it has never occurred. Why won't God help me?"</li><br> 	<li>"Why did my father have to die and leave my mother and us alone?"</li><br> 	<li>"Why am I struggling with this chronic illness that makes me miserable most of the time?"</li><br> 	<li>"Why am I not worth anything? It seems that others feel that way about me, and I do too. I feel worthless."</li><br></ul><br>Brothers and sisters, is not that kind of suffering very real for many of us, and very intense as well? Here are some more:<br><ul><br> 	<li>"I have prayed and fasted for an eternal companion, but no one has come."</li><br> 	<li>"Why did he break up with me? Things were going so well. My heart is broken."</li><br> 	<li>"We thought the purpose of marriage was to have children. We have prayed for years, and none have come."</li><br> 	<li>"I failed another algebra test. Why am I so dumb?"</li><br> 	<li>"I am so discouraged. I'm not sure where my life is going. I feel surrounded in darkness, depressed, and have little or no hope."</li><br> 	<li>"Where will the money come from for our apartment, our food, our books, our insurance, our car?"</li><br> 	<li>"Why am I so heavy? They say I'm bigboned, but the truth of it is, I'm just downright fat."</li><br></ul><br>Well, we could add a lot more suffering to that list, could we not? A struggling missionary asked me, "Elder Cook, when will this 'happiest two years of my life' be over?"<br><br>A suffering friend once said, "I have been keeping the commandments and trying to do what is right. Why do they even call this plan 'the plan of happiness'?"<br><br>Those are some very real questions. Unlike some in the world who do not understand the purposes of suffering, Latter-day Saints, thanks to the Restoration of the gospel, in large measure <i>do</i> understand. Why then do even the righteous suffer?<br><h3><em><b>The Righteous Suffer but the Lord Delivers Them</b></em></h3><br><i>Many are the afflictions of the righteous: but the Lord delivereth him out of them all.</i> [Psalm 34:19]<br><h3><em><b>"After Much Tribulation Come the Blessings"</b></em></h3><br><i>Ye cannot behold with your natural eyes, for the present time, the design of your God concerning those things which shall come hereafter. ...</i><br><br><i>For after much tribulation come the blessings.</i> [D&amp;amp;C 58:3–4]<br><br>It is interesting to note that there would be even more suffering if it were not for the righteous in the land:<br><br><i>If it were not for the prayers of the righteous, who are now in the land, that ye would even now be visited with utter destruction. ...</i><br><br><i>But it is by the prayers of the righteous that ye are spared.</i> [Alma 10:22–23]<br><br>Will you, right now, those of you here listening to me, humble your heart and prayerfully consider these additional words I am going to quote from the Lord? Do it with the Spirit, and I am confident that they <i>will</i> humble your heart, strengthen your faith, and increase your love for Him, in spite of some of your current trials. Here are some of the Lord's answers as to <i>why</i> He allows such suffering.<br><h3><em><b>Suffering Is to Prove Oneself</b></em></h3><br><i>Therefore, be not afraid of your enemies, ... I will prove you in all things, whether you will abide in my covenant, ... that you may be found worthy. </i>[D&amp;amp;C 98:14]<br><h3><em><b>Suffering Creates a Witness Against Sin</b></em></h3><br>When the Saints were being cast into the fire in Alma's day, he said:<br><br><i>And he</i> [the Lord] <i>doth suffer that they may do this thing ... that ... the blood of the innocent shall stand as a witness against them.</i> [Alma 14:11]<br><h3><em><b>Suffering Teaches Obedience</b></em></h3><br><i>And my people must needs be chastened until they learn obedience, if it must needs be, by the things which they suffer. </i>[D&amp;amp;C 105:6]<br><h3><em><b>Suffering Teaches Patience and Faith</b></em></h3><br><i>Nevertheless the Lord seeth fit to chasten his people; yea, he trieth their patience and their faith.</i> [Mosiah 23:21]<br><h3><em><b>Suffering Assists One to Repent and Be Forgiven</b></em></h3><br><i>Verily, thus saith the Lord unto you whom I love, and whom I love I also chasten that their sins may be forgiven, for with the chastisement I prepare a way for their deliverance in all things out of temptation, <b>and I have loved you.</b></i> [D&amp;amp;C 95:1; emphasis added]<br><br>Isn't it wonderful that the Lord's motive in allowing suffering truly is love, and He will even prepare a way for our deliverance? Truly He has loved us during these serious trials, in spite of what some may think.<br><br>It is evident, brothers and sisters, that the Lord will use tragedy and sorrow to help humble His people and thereby cause them to repent and be saved. Listen carefully to this: <i>He loves you more than your being perfectly happy day by day, and thus He will do what is required to purify you so you can return to Him.</i><br><h3><em><b>Suffering Can Occur from the Lord Hedging Up Your Way</b></em></h3><br><i>I will not succor my people in the day of their transgression; but I will hedge up their ways that they prosper not; and their doings shall be as a stumbling block before them. </i>[Mosiah 7:29]<br><h3><em><b>Suffering Brings Forth Righteousness</b></em></h3><br><i>For whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth. ...</i><br><br><i>Now no chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous, but grievous: nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them. </i>[Hebrews 12:6, 11]<br><h3><em><b>Be Patient in Suffering</b></em></h3><br><i>Be patient in afflictions, for thou shalt have many; but endure them, for, lo, I am with thee, even unto the end of thy days.</i> [D&amp;amp;C 24:8]<br><br><i>The Lord did strengthen them that they could bear up their burdens with ease, and they did submit cheerfully and with patience to all the will of the Lord. </i>[Mosiah 24:15]<br><h3><em><b>Lightening Your Burdens Through Christ</b></em></h3><br><i>That they should suffer no manner of afflictions, save it were swallowed up in the joy of Christ. </i>[Alma 31:38]<br><br><i>And then may God grant unto you that your burdens may be light, through the joy of his Son. And even all this can ye do if ye will.</i> [Alma 33:23]<br><br>Aren't these profound answers clarifying why the righteous suffer? We, of all people, ought to stand and humbly bear testimony of how God's great love can be found in the suffering of individuals, as well as of nations, and be able to explain to a large degree why much of that is occurring. Of course, no man knows all the purposes of God, and thus does not fully understand the full purpose of suffering. That is only known by the Lord.<br><br>On a personal note, I think in my own life of what a challenge my wife and I had when we were first married and went for nearly five years without having children, even though we fasted, prayed, and had numerous priesthood blessings concerning that challenge. We suffered much. However, in time, after adopting our first son, seven others came naturally, and we now stand as the parents of those eight children, plus 21 grandchildren.<br><br>Does the Lord fulfill His promises? He does. Be patient. Wait upon the Lord. He does love us.<br><br>Here is another personal example showing the uniqueness of the Lord's gifts. All of my adult life I have suffered with very difficult health problems, some of which have been life-threatening. What lessons were taught in the process of all those years! I believe they could not have been learned any other way. They have helped me to be more Christlike. Truly the Lord knows the end from the beginning and will tutor, correct, mold, and even refine you in the furnace of affliction. He will do so until He has accomplished His purposes in purifying you, sanctifying you, and helping you draw closer to Him.<br><br>These kinds of gifts from the Lord are not always easy to understand, but I count them as priceless gifts to me and my family. One can sense the deep feelings of the Lord when He spoke these words:<br><br><i>For what doth it profit a man if a gift is bestowed upon him, and he receive not the gift? Behold, he rejoices not in that which is given unto him, neither rejoices in him who is the giver of the gift. </i>[D&amp;amp;C 88:33]<br><br>I pray that the Lord will help us to recognize even these unique gifts of suffering and to always be found giving thanks for them to the Giver of the gifts.<br><h2><b>The Lord Sews a Spiritual Tapestry into All Our Lives</b></h2><br>How little does man understand the purposes of God! How true these words:<br><br><i>For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, saith the Lord.</i> [Isaiah 55:8]<br><br><i>Great is his wisdom, marvelous are his ways, and the extent of his doings none can find out. </i>[D&amp;amp;C 76:2]<br><br>President Thomas S. Monson has spoken recently of "small hinges" upon which the very history of our lives turn ("Choose You This Day," <i>Ensign,</i> November 2004, 67). A few weeks ago my family and I discussed that thought, and we were deeply humbled to see how the Lord had directed all of our lives.<br><br>One married son said, "Had I not been the best man in my older brother's marriage, I would have missed meeting my future wife."<br><br>His wife responded, "If 15 years earlier my family had not determined to move to Ecuador, where they met your family, they would not have been invited to the reception and thus perhaps I never would have met my husband-to-be."<br><br>How does the Lord sew that kind of life tapestry to bring about such wonderful blessings?<br><br>Another son mentioned, "Dad, had you not <i>happened</i> to be assigned to a particular stake conference, you would not have met my future wife and facilitated our meeting one another."<br><br>His wife said, "I just <i>happened</i> to go to that conference, where my father presided that day, instead of my own stake."<br><br>And I must add, how was it that the president of the Quorum of the Twelve <i>happened</i> to assign me to that particular conference that weekend?<br><br>My wife and I commented on the fact that had we not felt inspired to move from Arizona to Utah 35 years ago, much of what has just been said would not have happened. We concluded that in many ways our children's "small hinges" were dependent upon our "small hinges" as their parents.<br><br>Of course, as Latter-day Saints we know that all those events are not predestined, but it is the Lord's loving hand in our lives attempting to bless us with the very best that we can receive.<br><br>Add to all of this the times the Lord has used daily experiences to mold your personality, to refine your attributes, to help you be more Christlike. How complex it appears to man. How difficult it would be to influence all within one man's life in one day, let alone throughout his whole life. Think of the orchestration that is going on among your whole family, the whole community, and the whole world. Could any man ever comprehend the love and works of the Lord? I think not.<br><br>Brigham Young once said, "Every trial and experience you have passed through is necessary for your salvation" (<i>JD</i> 8:150). How blessed are we, my dear brothers and sisters, to recognize the Lord sewing this spiritual tapestry of our lives to produce a more Christlike individual. I remind you of these words:<br><br><i>Wherefore, brethren, seek not to counsel the Lord, but to take counsel from his hand. For behold, ye yourselves know that he counseleth in wisdom, and in justice, and in great mercy, over all his works. </i>[Jacob 4:10]<br><br>Could any man think to counsel the Lord on anything, even having a small view of what has just been described? All of this causes me to feel deeply the need to always pray more fervently for the will of the Lord in my life and, whatever I ask, to be sure to condition it upon His holy, divine, all-knowing will.<br><br>How great is the wisdom of God! How great is His love! I stand humbled--in absolute awe of my Heavenly Father, His love for us, and His glorious plan of happiness.<br><h2><b>The Lord Will Help Us with Our Suffering</b></h2><br>Prayerfully listen to these words:<br><br><i>In all their afflictions he was afflicted. And the angel of his presence saved them; and in his love, and in his pity, he redeemed them, and bore them, and carried them all the days of old. </i>[D&amp;amp;C 133:53]<br><br>No trial or suffering will separate us from the love of God, said Paul the Apostle:<br><br><i>Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword? ...</i><br><br><i>For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come,</i><br><br><i>Nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.</i> [Romans 8:35, 38–39]<br><h2><b>Men Can Bring Suffering upon Themselves</b></h2><br>We have spoken of the suffering of the righteous--now a word regarding the suffering of the unrighteous. The Lord said:<br><br><i>But if they would not repent they must suffer even as I.</i> [D&amp;amp;C 19:17]<br><br>Also, one could surely increase his suffering by not keeping the commandments of the Lord, couldn't he? The Lord said:<br><br><i>Remember to sin no more, lest perils shall come upon you.</i> [D&amp;amp;C 29:3]<br><br><i>And thus we see that except the Lord doth chasten his people with many afflictions, yea, except he doth visit them with death and with terror, and with famine and with all manner of pestilence, they will not remember him. </i>[Helaman 12:3]<br><br>It ought to be easy to see in the case of those who sin that they bring much suffering and misery upon themselves by not keeping the commandments of the Lord. That is unfortunately true of some of us who know better but who are either not keeping the commandments or are just skirting the edges of some.<br><br>How many are suffering right now as a result of not keeping the Word of Wisdom--not only physically but spiritually being alienated from the Lord? How many other evil sins--such as robbery, abuse, or immorality--and thereby great suffering, result from someone not obeying the Word of Wisdom?<br><br>What great blessings are promised to those who obey the Sabbath day, even <i>"the fulness of the earth"</i> (D&amp;amp;C 59:16; see also verses 15 through 21). What great losses, spiritually and temporally, come our way if we disobey?<br><br>What about the suffering that comes from those who do not pay an honest tithe and offering and therefore struggle with debt and financial hardship all the days of their lives?<br><br>What about the suffering that results from dishonesty or involvement in risky financial endeavors--even loss of trust, divorce, and imprisonment?<br><br>What great chastisement comes to one who disobeys the law of chastity and is involved in immodesty, petting, pornography, and fornication. He loses his faith, loses the Spirit, and even could lose his membership in the kingdom of God.<br><br>What suffering comes to one who skips his Church meetings and avoids having a Church calling? He not only loses the opportunity to give needed service but also retards the growth and development of his own soul.<br><br>Incorporated in all of the laws of the Lord are blessings that will be yours when you keep them and consequences causing you to suffer when you do not. When we disobey the Lord, we truly learn that <i>"wickedness never was happiness"</i> (Alma 41:10).<br><h2><b>A Few Suggestions on Cheerfully Suffering Tribulation in the Redeemer's Name (D&amp;amp;C 138:13)</b></h2><br>1. <i>Keep the commandments of the Lord with exactness.</i> By so doing you will avoid the suffering of the wicked and reap the blessings the Lord has promised to the obedient.<br><br>2. <i>Endeavor to see more fully the Lord's hand in your life and in the lives of those around you.</i> The Lord loves you. Each day He adds to the beautiful spiritual tapestry being sewn of your life, if you allow Him to do so.<br><br>3. <i>When faced with adversity, trial, or suffering, do your best to increase your faith in the face of the trial.</i> Many of less faith, when faced with a serious trial, become angry, weaken their faith, and thereby struggle and suffer more. Perhaps the real test of your faith is how to increase your faith and your love when trials come your way.<br><br>4. <i>Be patient. Wait on the Lord. Plead fervently for understanding and the ability to endure.</i> Remember, we are not to counsel Him; He will counsel us. Be patient. Trust in Him for that which you do not know, and you will come to know much more. You will feel more profoundly of His personal love for you. Remember the words "even this will pass" and these sacred words: <i>"The Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away; blessed be the name of the Lord"</i> (Job 1:21).<br><br>5. <i>Do not be discouraged along the way. </i>My young friends, the devil delights in discouraging people and causing them to feel inadequate, unworthy, unneeded, and unloved. Discouragement is a tool of the devil. He uses much of our suffering and misery to bring about discouragement and thus fulfill his purpose. May I say with a smile: <i>Cheer up, pray, read in the scriptures, bear your testimony, sing, express love to God and to others, serve, obtain a priesthood blessing if need be, and do away with discouragement, the devil's influence upon you.</i><br><br>6. <i>Humble yourself and repent of your personal sins</i>. Humility before the Lord, a broken heart, and a contrite spirit truly seem to be the offering and sacrifice required of the Lord. The peace of the Spirit will then rest upon you and the love of God will fill your soul.<br><h2><b>Final Testimony</b></h2><br>Well, brothers and sisters, let us return to where we began: "Where is God in all of the suffering that is going on in the world?" I testify of my certainty of His loving involvement. He uses trying circumstances for His purposes to develop true disciples of Christ, even a Zion people.<br><br>I express gratitude for the Lord's hand upon me through the years. He has answered all of my prayers--even though at times I had no idea what His purpose was, nor perhaps still do. He has blessed me with many wonderful days--more of those than of difficult days of suffering and despair. And yet even in those difficult days I have felt the Lord reach out to me, felt the darkness disperse, and felt His personal love fill my very soul.<br><br>I bear witness that He is a God of love. He does love His children in spite of what many in the world may think. I bear testimony that the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ is sufficient for all men.<br><br>May God bless us to be more humble, more repentant, more filled with faith, more trusting, and more loving to one another and to Him. This is His work. This is the true Church of Jesus Christ. The Church and the fullness of the gospel have been restored.<br><br>Living apostles and prophets of the Lord Jesus Christ walk the earth in our day. Of these things I humbly bear testimony, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Gene R.

<h1> and Faith: Blessings of Marriage and Children - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Brothers and sisters, I am delighted to be with you on this special occasion. I am sorry that Sister Nelson has a cold and a cough that has kept her at home. I am overwhelmed by this large congregation of young adults. Many more are gathered throughout North America, Central America, South America, Europe, Asia, Africa, and the isles of the sea. I pray for the Spirit of the Lord to be with us. Since these proceedings are being translated into 28 languages, we also pray for our translators.<br><br>To each young adult I bring greetings and love from President Gordon B. Hinckley, President Thomas S. Monson, President James E. Faust, and my Brethren of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. We thank you for your faith, your devotion, and your desire to serve the Lord. We love each one of you.<br><br>I would like you to stop taking notes, just for a moment, and do some personal soul-searching. Tonight you are eager and young. Most of you are students with great ambitions for the future. Now I want you to think. I want you to think about yourself, not as you are, but as you may become--50 years from now. Through your imaginary time tunnel, look at yourself as you will be then. Your broad minds and narrow waists have traded places. You are finished with your career. Your working days are over--no more time clocks to punch or paychecks to collect. Are you with me?<br><br>Now, here are my questions: What do you <i>see</i> in yourself 50 years from now? What do you want <i>to be</i> 50 years from now? What do you <i>really want,</i> most of all, 50 years from now?<br><br>I think I can hear your minds working. Some of you might say, "I just want to be alive 50 years from now." Not a bad idea. Accidents and illnesses are part of mortality, which means that some of you won't be here 50 years from now. But most of you will. So plan for the rule, not the exception. Some of you see fame or fortune in your future. And most of you want families.<br><br>If Sister Nelson were here, I would invite her to stand beside me. As you know, man is not without the woman in the Lord.<sup>1</sup> Perhaps our being together could help you in your planning and achieving what you want to become. The title of my message tonight is "Faith and Families." Purposely, I have listed faith first. That has always been the lodestar for our married life: to have faith to seek <i>first</i> the kingdom of God. We have learned that unshakable faith in the Lord enriches married life and love. Faith in Him increases one's very capacity to love, both quantitatively and qualitatively.<br><br>More than 50 years ago we were young adults, as you are now. This photograph was taken at that time. We were both university students. [A photograph of them as a young couple was shown.] I was a sophomore premedical student; she was a freshman on a scholarship. We were very much in love. I think you can sense that in the photo. Brethren, you can't blame me for being in love with her, can you?<br><br>Thank you for showing the photo. We really don't look like that anymore. But to me, Sister Nelson is now even more beautiful!<br><br>My career as a doctor of medicine has been completed. All of my many surgical operations have been done. Likewise, Sister Nelson has had extremely demanding responsibilities as a mother of 10 children. I forgot to mention that our first nine children were all little girls. Our home was like a girls' dormitory, until our one and only son came along. Poor boy! He didn't know who his real mother was for his first couple of years.<br><br>Now Sister Nelson's life has matured. She has taken on a less rigorous role as grandmother of our grandchildren, many of whom are here this evening. Would all members of our family please stand for a moment? I would like the cameramen to focus upon you so others can see you as well. We are blessed with 56 grandchildren and 14 great-grandchildren. Our newest grandchild is here--only two weeks old. Those numbers are likely to increase.<br><br>I considered showing photos of each of our 106 family members. Then I thought of the grandmother traveling in an airplane beside a stranger. Her animated conversation about her family led to her asking, "Did I show you a picture of my grandchildren?"<br><br>Her seatmate replied, "No! And thank you!"<br><br>I won't show you any more pictures. That wouldn't help anyway. The beauty of our family is much more than physical. It is spiritual. No two members are alike. Each is unique and special.<br><br>What is most important to Sister Nelson and me now? That we are husband and wife, wedded for time and all eternity. Our children are born in the covenant and are sealed to us forever. What joy that knowledge brings!<br><br>When we married in the temple, we didn't know many scriptures. But we did know Matthew 6:33: "Seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you." As mentioned earlier, that became the lodestar for every decision we made together. Only years later did we learn that the Joseph Smith Translation of that verse was even more compelling and clear: "Seek not the things of this world but seek ye first to build up the kingdom of God, and to establish his righteousness, and all these things shall be added unto you" (JST, Matthew 6:38). We have been guided well by that scripture! I have been inspired well by this woman of faith who stood beside me all these years. Blessings that mean the most to me have come because of her.<br><br>Times have changed in half a century. The world is ailing spiritually. That sickness is rapidly becoming more rampant. Temptations to sin go way beyond anything we knew at your age. You are entering a consumer culture obsessed with materialistic goals. Multitudes worship at the shrine of selfishness. Loud voices defend the fallacious doctrine that all lifestyles are of equal value. People want more rights than responsibilities. They seem more concerned with entitlement than enlightenment. Responsible fatherhood is being defined as a weekly visit and financial support. In short, we face a mind-boggling moral inversion.<br><br>Against this backdrop of spiritual decay, you young adults of the Church enter the stage. You have a firm foundation of faith. You are role models, both in courtship and in marriage. You know what's right and what's wrong! You hold the line! You know the Lord's teachings. And you will teach them to your own children and grandchildren. You are the "Hope of Israel, Zion's army, Children of the promised day."<sup>2</sup> You have far more spiritual power than we did at your age. As you go forward on life's battlefield, you are numbered with "the covenant people of the Lord, . . . scattered upon all . . . the earth; . . . armed with righteousness and with the power of God in great glory" (1 Nephi 14:14). We are very, very proud of you!<br><br>As Sister Nelson and I look back, we can honestly say that our family and membership in the Church are most important to us. How thankful we are that we heeded the counsel of Church leaders to marry in the temple, to invite children into our family, and to serve the Lord! If we had placed our education <i>ahead</i> of our family, we would not be so blessed now. Education was a lengthy process for us. Earning two doctor's degrees took me a long time. Then we struggled through many more years of surgical specialization. I did not send a bill for surgical services until I had been out of medical school for more than 12 years! By then we had five children. But somehow we managed.<br><br>I pay tribute to Sister Nelson, who never murmured because she had to make do with very little. I recall an experience one night in downtown Boston. We were walking along Boylston Street. There we passed a furniture store. Sister Nelson pressed her nose against the windowpane and asked, "Do you think we will ever be able to afford a lamp?"<br><br>Brethren, I suggest that you look for a companion with long-range vision, like Sister Nelson. To each sister I suggest that you motivate your husband to become all he can become, even if it takes a long time.<br><br>We have tasted of life's successes and sorrows. We have dealt with disappointment, disease, and death among our children. But death cannot divide families sealed in the temple. That period of separation is only temporary. Thanks to the Lord's great plan of happiness, we can all face the future with great faith and optimism.<br><br>Sister Nelson and I have learned that life is not a one-act play. There really is a premortal period. And there really is life after death. Premortal and mortal portions are but preludes to our postmortal life. Knowledge of the three degrees of glory, as revealed to prophets, gives us a glimpse of our postmortal potential.3 Eternal life is glorious and well worth the quest.<br><br>The premortal period has important doctrinal underpinnings that fortify our faith. Then, the everlasting gospel was set in place. Before the foundation of the earth, the plan of salvation was prepared.4 It included the glorious possibility of a divine inheritance for us in the kingdom of God.5<br><br>Central to that plan of salvation is the Atonement of Jesus Christ. In premortal councils He was foreordained by His Father to atone for our sins and break the bands of physical and spiritual death.6 Jesus declared: "I . . . was prepared from the foundation of the world to redeem my people. . . . In me shall all mankind have life, and that eternally, even they who shall believe on my name" (Ether 3:14). Later, Paul added that the Church is "built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner stone" (Ephesians 2:20).<br><br>Also pivotal to God's plan is the family. In fact, a purpose of the plan is to exalt the family. The earth was created so that we as premortal spirit children of our Father in Heaven could come to the earth and obtain physical bodies. We are here to be tried and tested.7 We are here to "choose liberty and eternal life, . . . or to choose captivity and death" (2 Nephi 2:27). And best of all, we are allowed to fall in love, to be married, and to invite children into our families.<br><br>Certain blessings were to be reserved for the latter days. The Lord had planned to reveal "things which have been kept secret from the foundation of the world" (Matthew 13:35). Those things included revelations as recorded in the Book of Mormon.8 They also included ordinances and covenants of the holy temple.9 To the Prophet Joseph Smith the Lord declared, "I deign to reveal unto my church things which have been kept hid from before the foundation of the world, things that pertain to the dispensation of the fulness of times" (D&amp;amp;C 124:41).<br><br>"The ordinance of baptizing for the dead . . . was [also] instituted from before the foundation of the world" (D&amp;amp;C 124:33). Salvation was thus to be made available for those "who should die without a knowledge of the gospel" (D&amp;amp;C 128:5). A welding link between generations was provided, that a whole, complete, and perfect union of dispensations, keys, powers, and glories should take place.10 This welding together of generations is so important that the purposes of the earth and the purposes of the Church both would be defeated if families were not sealed in holy temples.<sup>11</sup><br><br>Preparation for our mortal life began even in the premortal realm. Before the foundation of the world, each of us existed as spirit children with our heavenly parents. Among us were the noble and great.<sup>12</sup> Abraham,<sup>13</sup> Jeremiah,<sup>14</sup> Joseph Smith,<sup>15</sup> and others<sup>16</sup> were destined to become prophets of God, some of whom would become martyrs in His holy cause.<sup>17</sup> The manner of conferring the priesthood was to come "down from the fathers, from the beginning of time, . . . even . . . before the foundation of the earth" (Abraham 1:3).<br><br>The Lord teaches that<br><br><i>in order to obtain the highest</i> [degree of celestial glory], <i>a man must enter into this order of the priesthood [meaning the new and everlasting covenant of marriage];</i><br><br><i>And if he does not, he cannot obtain it.</i> [D&amp;amp;C 131:2–3]<br><br>Sisters were given a special gift. They were enabled, according to the Lord, "to multiply and replenish the earth, . . . and to fulfil the promise which was given by my Father before the foundation of the world, . . . for their exaltation in the eternal worlds, that they may bear the souls of men; . . . herein is the work of my Father continued, that he may be glorified" (D&amp;amp;C 132:63). Think of the majesty of that decree. When a mother worthily bears and cares for a child, she not only helps the earth answer the end of its creation,<sup>18</sup> she glorifies God!<br><br>We, as children of the covenant, were chosen to serve the Savior. The Apostle Paul taught that the Lord "hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world" (Ephesians 1:4).19 As part of that foreordination, God established conditions that allowed us to receive His blessings. Those blessings were to be conferred upon obedience to the laws upon which His blessings are predicated.<sup>20</sup><br><br>One of those conditions pertains to our need to overcome worldly temptations.<sup>21</sup> Before the world was formed, opposition was allowed to come from Satan.<sup>22</sup> He has always fought against the Savior's sacred work and will continue to do so. He has opposed the prophets and the scriptures of the Restoration. And in our day Satan has chosen to wage war directly at the heart of God's plan, which is the family. Signs of his attacks are all about us. The proportion of mature adults who are married is declining,<sup>23</sup> as are birth rates.<sup>24</sup> The age at which couples get married is increasing,<sup>25</sup> as are the numbers of unmarried couples.<sup>26</sup> Immorality and pornography are pervasive and pernicious.<sup>27</sup><br><br>With such spiritual sickness all about us, it takes real faith in the Lord and in His gospel to withstand attacks from the adversary. I urge you to deny yourselves of all ungodliness, both physical and spiritual.<sup>28</sup> Keep a firm grasp on the iron rod of the gospel!<br><br>Brothers and sisters, before the world was, the gospel was central to God's eternal plan. It is an everlasting gospel--now restored in its fulness.<sup>29</sup> With such a foundation, this Church will not be moved from its place,<sup>30</sup> even through the Millennium.<sup>31</sup> The gospel of Jesus Christ is a sure foundation upon which we can build our individual faith. Some of us are weak; some are strong. We can waffle "like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed" (James 1:6), or we can anchor ourselves with cords of spiritual steel, rooted and grounded to the eternal truths of the gospel.<sup>32</sup><br><br>Such faith will not prevent life's problems but will help when things go wrong. Bad things happen to good people. Accidents occur. Some married couples may not be blessed with children. Others may not marry in this life, or they may find themselves married to one who fails to keep the commandments of God. The Lord is aware of these circumstances. He will bestow all the blessings that He has in store for His faithful children--in His own way and in His own time.<sup>33</sup> Be righteous, be patient, keep an eternal perspective, and you will be protected.<sup>34</sup><br><br>Through the years you will note that apostles and prophets teach the rule. We don't teach exceptions to the rule. Exceptions are left to individual agency and accountability. The Lord knows we live in an imperfect world. He knows it is "ripening in iniquity" (D&amp;amp;C 18:6). His judgments will be fair, just, and merciful.<br><br>A decade ago the First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, foreseeing this spiritual slide, prepared a proclamation to the world on the family. It is even more relevant today. We proclaim<br><br><i>that marriage between a man and a woman is ordained of God and that the family is central to the Creator's plan for the eternal destiny of His children.</i><br><br><i>All human beings--male and female--are created in the image of God. Each is a beloved spirit son or daughter of heavenly parents, and, as such, each has a divine nature and destiny. Gender is an essential characteristic of individual premortal, mortal, and eternal identity and purpose. . . .</i><br><br><i>The first commandment that God gave to Adam and Eve pertained to their potential for parenthood as husband and wife. We declare that God's commandment for His children to multiply and replenish the earth remains in force. We further declare that God has commanded that the sacred powers of procreation are to be employed only between man and woman, lawfully wedded as husband and wife.</i><br><br><i>We declare the means by which mortal life is created to be divinely appointed. We affirm the sanctity of life and of its importance in God's eternal plan.</i><br><br>Now, dear friends, note this warning:<br><br><i>Individuals who violate covenants of chastity, . . . or who fail to fulfill family responsibilities will one day stand accountable before God. Further, we warn that the disintegration of the family will bring upon individuals, communities, and nations the calamities foretold by ancient and modern prophets.</i> ["The Family: A Proclamation to the World," <i>Ensign,</i> November 1995, 102]<br><br>If you will heed that proclamation, brothers and sisters, you will be blessed. God lives and loves us.<sup>35</sup> With His help, we can foster our faith and families. We can qualify for this promise from the Lord: "If a man marry a wife by my word, . . . and by the new and everlasting covenant, and it is sealed unto them by the Holy Spirit of promise, . . . [they] shall inherit thrones, kingdoms, principalities, . . . powers, [and] dominions" (D&amp;amp;C 132:19).<br><br>I testify that your faith and your families will bring you great joy, here and hereafter. God lives. Jesus is the Christ. His Church has been restored. We are led by His prophet, President Gordon B. Hinckley. Upon each of you beloved young adults of the Church, I leave my love and blessing, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Russell M.

<h1>ons on the BYU Experience - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
As I contemplated my theme for this talk, I was reminded of a clever cartoon that was published in the <i>Daily Universe</i> when I was a BYU student in the 1970s. It illustrated a part of our culture--the BYU experience--that we continue to share in 2005.<br><br>The scene is the BYU campus. A BYU security officer is standing over a student who has been bloodied and bruised, apparently by several stones that lie next to him. The officer is dutifully taking careful notes. The caption reads, "And then I said ... he who is without sin, let him cast the first stone."<br><br>My recollection is that Elder Dallin H. Oaks, then president of BYU, referred to this cartoon in a <a href="https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/dallin-h-oaks_student-body-president/">devotional address</a>. He regarded it as one of his favorite humorous entries in the <i>Daily Universe</i>. He reminded us that although we are not perfect, the standards we set at BYU are so unusual, even peculiar, that it's easy to let a spirit of self-righteousness appear on our campus. He also reminded us that it's all right to laugh at ourselves occasionally as we strive to live these standards.<br><br>I have good memories of my BYU experience as a student--ward activities, teaching at the MTC, intramural football games, challenging business classes, and weekly devotionals here in the Marriott Center. But I didn't really appreciate what BYU offered until I had graduated and left the campus.<br><br>Since returning to BYU in 1994, I have started to understand the unique opportunities offered to students that make this campus different from our peer institutions.<br><br>In a campus devotional seven years ago, President James E. Faust made the following statement:<br><br><i>Brigham Young University is a continuing experiment on whether an institution--the majority of whose trustees are prophets, seers, and revelators--can continue to be true to its trust by the world's changing standards and yet be a first-class university academically.</i> [James E. Faust, "<a href="https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/james-e-faust_learning-eternity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Learning for Eternity</a>," <i>BYU 1997–98 Speeches</i> (Provo: BYU, 1998), 75–76]<br><br>We indeed are part of a grand experiment as we study, work, and live on this campus. This morning I will discuss three observations about the BYU experience. Hopefully, as we understand these points, we can appreciate and even enrich this experience we share together.<br><br>Observation number one: Sacred tithing funds given by faithful members of the Church are used to support the operation of this university. I believe this first observation is one of the reasons why this campus is holy ground as we consecrate our efforts to your education and preparation for life after graduation.<br><br>The Gospel of Mark in the New Testament teaches the doctrine of the widow's mite:<br><br><i>And Jesus sat over against the treasury, and beheld how the people cast money into the treasury: and many that were rich cast in much.</i><br><br><i>And there came a certain poor widow, and she threw in two mites, which make a farthing.</i><br><br><i>And he called unto him his disciples, and saith unto them, Verily I say unto you, That this poor widow hath cast more in, than all they which have cast into the treasury:</i><br><br><i>For all they did cast in of their abundance; but she of her want did cast in all that she had, even all her living.</i> [Mark 12:41–44]<br><br>In 1985 President Gordon B. Hinckley, then second counselor in the First Presidency, shared a devotional message on this campus entitled "<a href="https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/gordon-b-hinckley_widows-mite/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Widow's Mite</a>." Let me summarize some of his thoughts from that talk.<br><br>President Hinckley began:<br><br><i>Some time back a small, bent, elderly woman came to my office. For the purpose of this talk I shall call her Mary Olsen, although that is not her name and she would not wish her identity disclosed. She said she had just come over from the temple. She took from her purse her checkbook. She said that she had been a widow for many years, that life had not been easy for her. She had a great love for the Lord and his Church. She had faithfully paid her tithing all her life. She felt she would not live much longer. Now, she said, she felt she ought to be doing more to help than she had done. In a hand shaky with age, she wrote a check for $5,000. She handed it to me. I noted the address where she lived. It was in a poor neighborhood. I confess that as I looked at that check tears came into my eyes. I have held many larger checks than that in my hands. But as I held the check of this widow woman, I was almost overcome by her faith and the seriousness of the trust that was mine in the expenditure of her consecrated contribution. </i><br><br><i>... She gives her offering to the Lord, and she is then released from responsibility. The responsibility then becomes mine--</i>and yours!<br><br><i>What might she expect of you</i> [at this institution, which is supported by tithing funds]?<br><br>President Hinckley then shared five points that he believed this faithful widow, Mary Olsen, would expect of you as students of Brigham Young University:<br><br>First, [you will have] <i>a deep sense of gratitude and appreciation</i> [for] <i>the sacred funds of the Church</i> [that are appropriated to operate this university]<i>....</i><br><br>Second, [you will]<i> save, protect, and do all you can to preserve these remarkable facilities that have cost so much....</i><br><br>Third,<i> ... you will experience an increase in faith and a strengthened knowledge of the things of God, and, more particularly, of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ....</i><br><br>Fourth,<i> ... many of you will find your companions here....</i><br><br>Fifth,<i> ... you will better qualify yourselves to fill positions of responsibility in the world of which you will become a part.</i> [Gordon B. Hinckley, "The Widow's Mite," <i>BYU 1985–86 Devotional and Fireside Speeches</i> (Provo: BYU, 1986), 10–11]<br><br>I've read this talk by President Hinckley several times. I often reflected upon the Mary Olsens whom I have met in my life:<br><ul><br> 	<li>A poor widow in Argentina who lived in a humble house made of cinder-block walls and a simple tile floor. She was faithful in paying her Argentine mites, and the Spirit of the Lord was present in her home.</li><br> 	<li>A six-year-old boy who came to his bishop sitting on the stand before sacrament meeting and handed him a tithing envelope. As the bishop felt the few coins in the envelope, he shook the young boy's hand. The young boy looked into the bishop's eyes and seemed to say, "Be careful with this money. This is a lot of money to me."</li><br> 	<li>A father and mother sitting in the bishop's office committed to pay a full tithe so they could return to the temple some time in the future. As they gave the bishop an envelope with their first payment, their eyes seemed to cry out, "Please reassure us that this is right. We barely have enough money for our young family. Are you sure the Lord will bless us?"</li><br></ul><br>All of us know one or two Mary Olsens in our lives. They are the humble and faithful members of the Church who, despite their want, do cast in all that they have, "even all [their] living" (Mark 12:44), because they love the Lord and obey His commandments. Such are the funds that are used to operate this university.<br><br>Do we really recognize and appreciate the sacrifices of Mary Olsen and other faithful members of the Church that allow you students to participate in the BYU experience?<br><br>President Hinckley's invitation applies to all of us--students as well as faculty and staff. We should have a deep sense of gratitude and appreciation for the widow's mite. When I am filled with gratitude and appreciation, a spirit of humility is invited into my heart. I am then more ready to be taught and to serve with the Spirit of the Lord.<br><br>Although the amount of tithing funds appropriated to the university is significant, it's not as important for us to know the amount of such appropriations as it is for us to follow President Hinckley's counsel and receive these funds with "a deep sense of gratitude and appreciation." I'm pleased to work with colleagues, both in Salt Lake City and on this campus, who have taught me over the years how to translate this gratitude and appreciation into an efficient use of funds. So what can you students do to show your gratitude and appreciation for these sacred funds?<br><br>Talking to full-time missionaries in the Washington, D.C., area, President Hinckley stated, "If each of you is the kind of missionary your mother thinks you are, then you are all right" (Gordon B. Hinckley, News of the Church, "<a href="https://www.lds.org/ensign/1996/02/news-of-the-church/president-hinckley-visits-us-president-others-during-busy-period?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">President Hinckley Visits U.S. President, Others During Busy Period</a>," <i>Ensign</i>, February 1996, 74). In a similar way, if each of you is the kind of student your mother or even your bishop thinks you are, then you are probably showing gratitude and appreciation for these sacred funds.<br><br>I firmly believe that the Brethren want BYU to offer you, the students, an excellent education. I also believe that adequate funds will always be available to fulfill that objective if we are wise and unselfish with our use of resources on this campus.<br><br>May I comment briefly on one other point in President Hinckley's talk: He encouraged the students in 1985 to save, protect, and preserve the facilities on this campus. I believe his counsel continues to be heeded by many of you students today. Let me relate a recent experience.<br><br>I was walking toward the Wilkinson Student Center last summer. A group of visitors had finished eating lunch, but not all of their garbage had been properly disposed of. A pile of trash was conspicuously in the patio area and needed to be removed. As I reached down to grab an armful of boxes, I noticed a BYU coed next to me picking up the rest of the boxes. She looked at me and said with a smile, "Some of our visitors don't appreciate what it takes to keep this campus clean." I think her mother and bishop would be pleased with the kind of student she had become. Her actions showed the gratitude and appreciation she had for the tithing funds allocated to BYU.<br><br>As a matter of fact, a letter to the editor in this morning's <i>Daily Universe</i> reads:<br><br><i>BYU is a phenomenal school--our facilities, faculty, and students are among the best in the world. What a privilege it is to attend such a school and receive a higher education. I personally hope that there is a spirit of gratitude in every student's heart and mind for the chance to be here. </i>--Adam Olsen<br><br>My second observation is that it is a great blessing to have prophets, seers, and revelators lead the board of trustees of this institution. President J. Reuben Clark Jr. stated:<br><br><i>Some of the General Authorities have had assigned to them a special calling; they possess a special gift; they are sustained as prophets, seers, and revelators, which gives them a special spiritual endowment in connection with their teaching of the people. They have the right, the power, and authority to declare the mind and will of God to his people.</i> ["When Are the Writings or Sermons of Church Leaders Entitled to the Claim of Scripture?" address delivered 7 July 1954 for the summer session of seminary and institute teachers at Brigham Young University, 9; also reprinted as "When Are Church Leaders' Words Entitled to Claim of Scripture?" <i>Church News,</i> 31 July 1954, 9; quoted in Boyd K. Packer, "<a href="https://www.lds.org/ensign/2005/09/the-twelve-apostles?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Twelve Apostles</a>," <i>Ensign</i>, November 1996, 6]<br><br>Elder Charles A. Callis of the Quorum of the Twelve once remarked to Harold B. Lee that<br><br><i>the gift of discernment was an awesome burden to carry. To see clearly what is ahead and yet find members slow to respond or resistant to counsel or even rejecting the witness of the apostles and prophets brings deep sorrow.</i> [In Boyd K. Packer, "The Twelve Apostles," <i>Ensign</i>, November 1996, 7]<br><br>Do we truly recognize and appreciate the blessing of having prophets, seers, and revelators preside over Brigham Young University? Are we prepared to listen with an open heart and apply their counsel in our lives without hesitation?<br><br>BYU's board of trustees currently consists of the First Presidency (who are the board officers), three members of the Quorum of the Twelve, one of the Presidents of the Seventy, and the presidents of the General Relief Society and Young Women. Through my assignment at BYU I have occasionally attended meetings of the board of trustees or interacted with board members in other settings. It is my strong conviction that these men and women understand all aspects of higher education and, through their love for the young adults of the Church, are very wise and diligent in this part of their stewardship. We will be blessed both individually and as an institution as we listen to and follow the counsel of our board of trustees, which is led by prophets, seers, and revelators.<br><br>My third observation relates to why we faculty and staff elect to work at BYU. Those of us who serve on this campus do so because of the love we have for you students. Universities are traditionally known for developing close and personal relationships between a professor and a student--referred to as student mentoring. BYU is no exception to this tradition, but it also has the spirit of the gospel on its campus to enrich mentoring experiences.<br><br>When you graduate you most likely will have a professor or perhaps a job supervisor who has made a difference in your life--not only in your academic preparation but in broadening your perspective of life, enlightening your knowledge of the gospel, and preparing you for leadership positions in the future.<br><br>As a student I was blessed with caring mentors in the School of Business, the MTC, and my BYU ward. One such mentor was H. Verlan Andersen, who taught business law. I took my business law classes from him, and we had several good discussions in his office.<br><br>Ten years after I graduated, I ran into Elder Andersen, then a General Authority, in Salt Lake City. I was a new bishop, and we began to chat. He invited me to his office. He then took an hour out of his busy schedule to offer counsel for me as a new bishop, young father, and former student. He had not forgotten me, and he remained interested in my success.<br><br>Do you have a professor or job supervisor who is your mentor and friend as part of your BYU experience? Are you taking the initiative to develop such relationships with these individuals who serve professionally on this campus?<br><br>The Aims of a BYU Education suggest different ways in which student mentoring will offer you a total BYU experience: "A BYU education should be (1) spiritually strengthening, (2) intellectually enlarging, and (3) character building, leading to (4) lifelong learning and service" (<i>The Mission of Brigham Young University </i>and<i> The Aims of a BYU Education</i> [Provo: BYU, 1996], 3). Our success as mentors is chiefly measured by your happiness and success as you strive to live gospel principles.<br><br>Let me offer an example of how the Aims of a BYU Education affect the daily operations of this university. To my knowledge BYU has more student employees than any other institution of higher education in the United States. This is by design. Not only does it provide you students the opportunity to pay for your education, but it also allows you to develop and nurture a work ethic, leadership skills, a sense of responsibility, and an appreciation for the widow's mite that we've previously discussed. During the fall and winter semesters we employ more than 12,000 students to operate this campus as library assistants, grounds workers, custodians, secretaries, research assistants, tutors, cafeteria workers, and computer technicians. And the list goes on.<br><br>This does not go unnoticed by visitors to our campus. Each year quality assessment reviews are done in selected departments across campus, including my area of responsibility. These reviews include an individual from another university who is expert in that area. The outside observers often suggest that we are using student employees in positions that should be staffed by full-time professionals.<br><br>"You're asking these young people to do jobs that would be done better by those who are professionally trained and who can offer continuous service over many years," they suggest.<br><br>"You're right," I usually respond, "but we have a different mission at BYU that offers a complete educational experience for our students. We believe that with proper training and supervision, our students can provide a service to this campus that will enhance our operation while allowing them to build their character."<br><br>Having such a large labor force of young adults on this campus does not go without challenges. However, as we reflect upon the mission statement of Brigham Young University--"to assist individuals in their quest for perfection and eternal life," (<i>Mission </i> and<i> Aims,</i> 1)--and as we listen to that still small voice within us, we remember the love that we have for you students and pledge to ourselves that we will exercise a little more patience, provide a little more training, and still strive for excellent service to this campus community.<br><br>If you are a student employee, are you taking full advantage of the mentoring opportunities with your supervisor?<br><br>With your permission I would like to share a personal experience that helped me appreciate the joy of associating with you students.<br><br>As I began my fourth year working on this campus, I felt a hollow commitment to my job. Everyone else on campus seemed thrilled to associate with the students. However, my experiences consisted of contact with those students who were upset because they wanted an exception to policy or were having problems with part of my area of responsibility. Looking back, I realize this was a very small group of students, but they were the only ones with whom I had personal interaction.<br><br>I mentioned my feelings to a good friend, Larry Dahl, who was then associate dean of Religious Education. He replied, "Brad, what you need to do is teach a freshman Book of Mormon class."<br><br>I remember reacting, "That's just what I need--another thing to do."<br><br>But after prayerful reflection, I accepted his invitation and taught my first class the winter semester of 1998. I have taught this class every winter semester since. I'm beginning to appreciate the joy and satisfaction that comes from associating with you wonderful students.<br><br>In my first semester of teaching we were studying 3 Nephi 11, and, as we had done all semester, the students were taking turns reading aloud verses from our assigned reading. As you know, chapter 11 of 3 Nephi records the appearance of the resurrected Savior on the American continents. As we approached verse 15, it was the turn of a young freshman girl to read. I hardly knew her voice since she sat in the back and was too shy to participate. She began reading:<br><br><i>And it came to pass that the multitude went forth, and thrust their hands into his side, and did feel the prints of the nails in his hands and in his feet; and this they did do, going forth one by one until they had all gone forth, and did see with their eyes and did feel with their hands, and did know of a surety and did bear record.</i> [3 Nephi 11:15]<br><br>Then she paused. She could no longer read. There was silence in the class. The other students and I recognized that the peaceful spirit of the Holy Ghost was manifesting to her that what she was reading really did happen. Our Savior did appear in the Western Hemisphere. The Book of Mormon was true.<br><br>Several weeks later I was grading the final exams. I came to the exam of this young freshman girl. On the last page she had written: "Brother Farnsworth, thanks for asking me to read in 3 Nephi that day."<br><br>I recognize that such experiences happen continually on this campus because of dedicated faculty and staff who enjoy their association with you students.<br><br>Our board of trustees also has great love for the students of this institution. Perhaps their greatest display of love for you is to have one of their Brethren, a General Authority, preside over Brigham Young University. It is with no small sacrifice that the leaders of the Church assign to this campus one of their most able leaders when there are so many pressing needs in the operation of the worldwide Church. I hope that we show our appreciation for this love by praying for our president, Elder Cecil O. Samuelson, and his family during this wonderful but challenging assignment.<br><br>May I share a lesson from the Book of Mormon? The prophet Alma and his missionary companions were faced with many afflictions. But these afflictions "were swallowed up in the joy of Christ" because Alma "prayed in faith" (Alma 31:38).<br><br>In a similar way we can lighten the load of our president and can lighten the loads of each other as we offer prayers of faith and express gratitude for the opportunity to learn and to serve on this campus. I believe that a BYU education, now extended through three separate campuses, is like no other academic experience.<br><br>In summary, my three observations of the BYU experience are:<br><ul><br> 	<li>Receiving sacred funds to operate this campus places us on holy ground.</li><br> 	<li>Prophets, seers, and revelators lead the board of trustees of Brigham Young University to show us the way if we are prepared to listen to and follow their counsel.</li><br> 	<li>Those of us who work at BYU are here because of our love for you students and our desire to prepare you for future service throughout the world.</li><br></ul><br>I pray that our hearts will be filled with a deep sense of gratitude and appreciation for these spiritual blessings as we share the BYU experience. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Brad W.

<h1> the Church? In Our Hearts - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Some time ago I was walking in the center of Salt Lake City on my way to City Creek Canyon. A car with an out-of-state license plate was driving by. The driver pulled over and asked, "Where is the church of the Mormons?" I assumed that he was thinking of some place or building. I took time to point out the tall Church Office Building, the stately Church Administration Building, the magnificent temple, and the historic tabernacle (the Conference Center had not yet been built). He thanked me and went on his way.<br><h2><b>Is It in Our Buildings?</b></h2><br>A few years ago my wife and I were in the temple in Kirtland, Ohio. It was late fall, and the afternoon sun was streaking through the old, wavy, handblown windowpanes. The building was light and airy and magnificent. Since some of my forebears were involved in its construction, I was humbled and honored to be under its roof. Within its walls and under its spell, I was enchanted by its beauty.<br><br>However, as President Boyd K. Packer correctly pointed out, "We do not have that building. When our people left, they took with them that which was important. They preserved the keys of the ordinances, the covenants, and the sealing power. They took with them all the essentials which we have today."<br><br>So the Church cannot, in and of itself, be the temples, magnificent as they are, because the temple buildings alone do not bless. They are the exquisite containers for the pearls of great price administered therein by the priesthood of God.<br><br>Thanks to my wonderful wife, the Spirit of the Lord has often been in our various dwelling places. While we have lived within them, each has been a holy place for me. In our married life we have lived in single rooms with bathrooms down the hall and in small apartments. We have also owned three different houses. In a sense the Church has been in each, but I would not want to go back and live in our former homes, even though we spent much of our happy lives in them. The kingdom of God is not there.<br><h2><b>Is It in Our Families?</b></h2><br>Is the Church then in our families? We are getting close to the correct answer here. In a sense a family can foster the teachings of the Savior better than any other institution. In large measure the Church exists to strengthen families. I wish to define <i>family </i>very broadly. In the Church we have traditional families and single-parent families. Furthermore, each single member is considered to be, in a sense, a Church family. We also have ward families in which the bishop serves as a spiritual father.<br><br>Because of the erosion of family life and family values, we frequently hear urgent pleas requesting the Church as an organization to take over activities formerly considered family activities. I wonder if our maturing youth can hold everything together without family home evening, daily prayer, and daily scripture study. I say this because I am persuaded that family activities can be more effective in fostering the eternal values of love, loyalty, honesty, chastity, industry, self-worth, and personal integrity than any other institution.<br><br>Lou Holtz, the successful football coach from Notre Dame, stated:<br><br><i>The family is where our healthy values are formed and shaped. I know no greater challenge or more important role in life than in preparing our children to take their places as contributing citizens. We cannot relinquish this most important responsibility to gang leaders, drug leaders or even our own government. Nothing can destroy individuals or our country as quickly as drugs. It is not confined to a segment of our society, and it has created more damage than anything else I have witnessed in my lifetime. I have never heard a successful man or woman get up and say, "I owe my success to drugs and alcohol." Yet I know thousands of people who have said publicly or in the press that they have ruined their lives because of drugs and alcohol. Suffice it to say, government can't stop it, police can't</i>, <i>but the family can.</i><br><br>Because of the complexity of the problem of drug and alcohol abuse, some may feel that it is an oversimplification to say that strong family leadership can solve the problem. Certainly not all families can, but I am persuaded that families with enough internal caring, discipline, commitment, and love somehow, someway, can handle the majority of their problems. However strong or weak the family may be, it can usually provide a better solution to most challenges than can any other institution in society or the government no matter how well intentioned it may be.<br><br>I believe that the principle reason that a caring family is the best antidote for drug and alcohol abuse and other problems is that unqualified love can flow from kinship relationships. Successful families usually have a strong, caring head. Ideally this would be a holder of the priesthood whose power and influence is maintained "by persuasion, by long-suffering, by gentleness and meekness, and by love unfeigned" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/121.41?lang=eng#p40">D&amp;amp;C 121:41</a>).<br><br>Priesthood is desirable because whomsoever is blessed by this power, God will bless. But there have been many successful caring heads of families who are mothers, grandmothers, and others. What seems to distinguish a successful family is that the members of the family continue to care. They don't give up. They never quit. They hang together through hardships and death and other problems.<br><br>I know of a close-knit family that is wonderfully successful in keeping everyone together. When the parents feel they are losing influence with teenagers, the help of cousins is enlisted to exert some counter peer pressure.<br><br>I would urge members of extended families--grandparents, uncles, aunts, nephews, nieces, cousins--to reach out in concern, to succor. Mostly what is needed from grandparents, aunts, and uncles is unreserved love manifest as interest and concern. It builds confidence, self-esteem, and self-worth. Reproving and chastening adult family members should be rare indeed. We are told that it should happen only when a person is moved upon by the Holy Ghost. But I have been grateful for those in my family who have loved me enough to give me both the gentle and strong reproof on occasion as needed. We read in Proverbs: "He that refuseth reproof erreth" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/prov/10.17?lang=eng#p16">Proverbs 10:17</a>).<br><br>The fact that some members do not have functioning traditional families is no reason to move in a direction that would diminish or abandon family activities among those who can and should foster them. With the increased onslaught of forces that cause families to disintegrate, we ought to dig in our heels to preserve all that is great and good in the family. We are reminded that in times of tribulations, the Nephites were not fighting for a political cause such as monarchy or power; rather, they "were inspired by a better cause, ... they were fighting for their homes and their liberties, their wives and their children, and their all, yea, for their rites of worship and their church" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/43.45?lang=eng#p44">Alma 43:45</a>). Some may find it strong doctrine, but I quote again from Alma in the Book of Mormon: "And again, the Lord has said that: Ye shall defend your families even unto bloodshed" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/43.47?lang=eng#p46">Alma 43:47</a>).<br><br>As a corollary to defending the family, we have a duty to teach our family members that the commandments of God may not be broken without drawing a penalty.<br><br>President Stephen L Richards said: "I want this taught to youth so that they may comprehend it. It is their due and their right to have these things given to them without dilution or apology. This is justice and mercy. Neither shall rob the other."<br><br>President Richards went on to state that it is no "kindness to any youth to whitewash [various sins such as] lying and deceit," which are so prevalent today. "Perhaps the greatest of all [is] that robbery which steals virtue from either woman or man" (<i>CR, </i>April 1957, 99).<br><h2><b>Is It in Our Hearts?</b></h2><br>So the family is and must always be an important part of the Church. But the Lord's kingdom ultimately must be found in our hearts before it can be anywhere else. Paul gave us a key when he said to the Romans: "He that searcheth the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the Spirit" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/rom/8.27?lang=eng#p26">Romans 8:27</a>). He also said, "The love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/rom/5.5?lang=eng#p4">Romans 5:5</a>).<br><br>In the story of David, who was called in his youth to be the future king of Israel, we learn how much the Lord judges by what is in the heart. We all remember how the Lord sent the prophet Samuel to the house of Jesse, saying, "For I have provided me a king among his sons" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/1-sam/16.1?lang=eng#primary">1 Samuel 16:1</a>). One by one, Jesse had his seven oldest sons pass before Samuel. In considering each one, Samuel was instructed by the Lord to "look not on his countenance, or on the height of his stature; ... for the Lord seeth not as man seeth; for man looketh on the outward appearance, but the Lord looketh on the heart" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/1-sam/16.7?lang=eng#p6">1 Samuel 16:7</a>). And so, as the seven sons passed before him, Samuel said to Jesse, "The Lord hath not chosen these."<br><br><i>And Samuel said unto Jesse, Are here all thy children? And he said, There remaineth yet the youngest, and, behold, he keepeth the sheep. And Samuel said unto Jesse, Send and fetch him: for we will not sit down till he come hither.</i><br><br><i>And he sent, and brought him in. Now he was ruddy, and withal of a beautiful countenance, and goodly to look to. And the Lord said, Arise, anoint him: for this is he.</i><br><br><i>Then Samuel took the horn of oil, and anointed him in the midst of his brethren: and the Spirit of the Lord came upon David from that day forward. </i>[<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/1-sam/16.10-13?lang=eng#p9">1 Samuel 16:10–13</a>]<br><br>Like Daniel of old, what we do or do not do in life originates in our hearts. As Daniel stood in the court of Nebuchadnezzar, the great king of Babylon who captured Jerusalem, "Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the portion of the king's meat, nor with the wine which he drank" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/dan/1.8?lang=eng#p7">Daniel 1:8</a>). From then on Daniel held to that purpose. It eventually brought him the highest of heavenly and earthly honors.<br><br>The greatness of Willard Richard's heart was manifest just before the martyrdom of the Prophet:<br><br><i>Joseph said to Dr. Richards, "If we go into the cell, will you go in with us?" The doctor answered, "Brother Joseph you did not ask me to cross the river with you--you did not ask me to come to Carthage--you did not ask me to come to jail with you--and do you think I would forsake you now? But I will tell you what I will do; if you are condemned to be hung for treason, I will be hung in your stead, and you shall go free." Joseph said, "You cannot." The doctor replied, "I will."</i> [<i>HC</i> 6:616]<br><br>Alma teaches us the necessity for having the good seed of faith planted in our hearts:<br><br><i>Now, we will compare the word unto a seed. Now, if ye give place, that a seed may be planted in your </i>heart,<i> behold, if it be a true seed, or a good seed, if ye do not cast it out by your unbelief, that ye will resist the Spirit of the Lord, behold, it will begin to swell within your breasts; and when you feel these swelling motions, ye will begin to say within yourselves--It must needs be that this is a good seed, or that the word is good, for it beginneth to enlarge my soul; yea, it beginneth to enlighten my understanding, yea, it beginneth to be delicious to me. </i>[<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/32.28?lang=eng#p27">Alma 32:28</a>; emphasis added]<br><br>Revelation comes to us in our minds, but it also comes in our hearts. In a revelation to Oliver Cowdery in section 8 of the Doctrine and Covenants, the Lord says, "Yea, behold, I will tell you in your mind and in your <i>heart,</i> by the Holy Ghost, which shall come upon you and which shall dwell in your <i>heart"</i> (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/8.2?lang=eng#p1">D&amp;amp;C 8:2</a>; emphasis added). To me it is very interesting that the dwelling place of the Holy Ghost is in our hearts.<br><br>What if the Lord appeared to each of us as He did to Solomon and said, "Ask what I shall give thee"? How would you answer? Would you ask for a new car? A new home? A blessing of health? A station in life? Solomon did not ask for anything like these. Neither did he ask for fame or for fortune. Rather, he responded: "Give therefore thy servant an understanding <i>heart."</i> This reply pleased the Lord.<br><br><i>And God said unto him, Because thou hast asked this thing, and hast not asked for thyself long life; neither hast asked riches for thyself, nor hast asked the life of thine enemies; but hast asked for thyself understanding to discern judgment;</i><br><br><i>Behold, I have done according to thy words: lo, I have given thee a wise and an understanding </i>heart;<i> so that there was none like thee before thee, neither after thee shall any arise like unto thee.</i><br><br><i>And I have also given thee that which thou hast not asked, both riches, and honour: so that there shall not be any among the kings like unto thee all thy days. </i>[<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/1-kgs/3.5,9,11-13?lang=eng#p4">1 Kings 3:5, 9, 11–13</a>; emphasis added]<br><br>There is some strong language in section 64 of the Doctrine and Covenants regarding who has claim upon our hearts: "I, the Lord, require the hearts of the children of men" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/64.22?lang=eng#p21">D&amp;amp;C 64:22</a>).<br><br>So when the inquirer in the car with the out-of-state license plate asked, "Where is the church of the Mormons?" I could have answered differently. I could have pointed to my chest and said that the Church should be first and foremost in our hearts. Then the traveler would surely have been somewhat bewildered. But that response would have been more accurate than my directing him to our beloved, magnificent, sky-piercing spires; the great majestic dome; and the other world-famous monuments and edifices--wonderful and unique and great as they are. It would have been more correct because the Lord said, "The kingdom of God cometh not with observation: Neither shall they say, Lo here! or, lo there! for, behold, the kingdom of God is within you" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/luke/17.20-21?lang=eng#p19">Luke 17:20–21</a>).<br><br>The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints should be in our hearts, and, when it is in our individual hearts, it will also be in our great buildings of worship, in our lovely educational institutions, and in our magnificent temples, as well as in our homes and families.<br><br>But the <i>keys</i> of the kingdom rest with the president of the Church. It is that authority that activates and governs all Church activities. Without priesthood keys and authority, there would be no church.<br><br>Paul's prayer was that Christ may dwell in our hearts by faith (see <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/eph/3.13-19?lang=eng#p12">Ephesians 3:13–19</a>). That is my prayer also. I feel like Peter when some of the early Saints had begun to fall away. The Savior was troubled and said to the Twelve, "Will ye also go away?"<br><br>Peter responded for the Twelve by remarking:<br><br><i>Lord, to whom shall we go? thou hast the words of eternal life.</i><br><br><i>And we believe and are sure that thou art that Christ, the Son of the living God.</i> [<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/john/6.67-69?lang=eng#p66">John 6:67–69</a>]<br><br>Of that I testify in his sacred name, even Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>James E.

<br>
I would like to express my appreciation to all the priesthood leaders and their wives who are here with us this evening. I'm especially grateful that Elder and Sister Cecil O. Samuelson are here. It was a great privilege to labor with Elder Samuelson in the Temple Department for many years. I can assure the students at Brigham Young University, as well as the faculty, that they are blessed under the able leadership of President and Sister Samuelson.<br><br>Tonight as I've thought about what I wanted to say to you, the young people of the Church, it has occurred to me that many are students. The reality is, my dear young friends, that we are all students of the gospel, aren't we?<br><br>There was a man who worked for the United States Treasury Department. His job was investigating cases where counterfeit money was involved. He was so good at what he did that all it took was a quick look at a bill and he could tell if it was genuine or counterfeit. One evening at a press conference following his breaking up of a major counterfeit ring, one of the reporters directed this statement to him: "You must spend a lot of time studying counterfeit bills to recognize them so easily."<br><br>His reply to this was, "No, I don't ever study counterfeit bills. I spend my time studying genuine bills; then the imperfection is easy to recognize."<br><br>So it is with the gospel, dear brothers and sisters. We are here to teach the gospel of Jesus Christ. There is no need to study the counterfeit, for we have the truth. As you study the true Church and allow the Spirit to work within you, you will have the answers and come to know how to respond to the various situations you will face. Concerning the Book of Mormon, a young missionary shared this thought with me, which I have found to be true over the years: Remember that the Book of Mormon is not on trial--we are.<br><br>This evening I would like to speak with you concerning one of the most essential principles of the entire gospel. I speak of the doctrine of work. It is my hope that what I say will help guide you in the work you are now doing or may be doing in the future.<br><br>Those of you who are graduating from high school or college, or are otherwise in the work force, may be asking yourselves questions like this when you apply for employment: "What are my working hours? What are my fringe benefits? What holidays will I have off? Will I have enough time to hang out with my friends or pursue my hobbies?" With questions like these, however, when you focus on your leisure hours instead of your working hours, you may be prevented from seeing a much greater opportunity.<br><h2><b>God's Work</b></h2><br>Work is an eternal principle. Whom do you know who has all the riches of the earth and more and yet is continually working? Our Heavenly Father! He is a worker. Our Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ have shown us by Their examples and teachings that work is important in heaven and on earth. Jehovah <i>worked</i> to create the heavens and the earth. He called the waters together in one place and caused the dry land to appear. He created the sun, the moon, and the stars. He created every living thing in the sea and on the land. Then the Father placed Adam and Eve on the earth to take care of it and to govern the other creatures. (See Genesis 1:1–28.)<br><br>But Their work did not end with the Creation. In the Pearl of Great Price we read, "This is my <i>work</i> and my glory--to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man" (Moses 1:39; emphasis added). This, of course, includes every man, woman, and child. Of all the things He could concern Himself with, our Heavenly Father has chosen to labor for the benefit of our eternal souls--your soul and my soul.<br><br>Jesus said, "My Father worketh hitherto, and I work" (John 5:17). He also said, "I must work the works of him that sent me" (John 9:4).<br><h2><b>Work Is a Blessing</b></h2><br>You and I also have a work to accomplish. Satan would tempt us to believe that our work is not worthwhile or that we have no need to work at all. He is wrong on both counts. We do have a need to work. We have a responsibility to take care of our own needs and the needs of our families. This tradition of being self-sufficient has been the Lord's way since Adam and Eve left the Garden of Eden. The Lord said to Adam, "In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread" (Genesis 3:19). Adam and Eve worked in the fields so they could provide for their own needs and the needs of their children (see Moses 5:1).<br><br>But providing for ourselves is not the only purpose of work. Suppose you were given a great sum of money or for whatever reason became instantly financially self-sufficient. Even then the command to labor has not been lifted. The Lord said to the people of Israel, "Six days shalt thou labour" (Exodus 20:9). He did not include any exceptions in that commandment for those who had enough and to spare! As Elder Neal A. Maxwell described, "Work is always a spiritual necessity even if, for some, work is not an economic necessity" (<i>CR,</i> April 1998, 50; or "Put Your Shoulder to the Wheel," <i>Ensign,</i> May 1998, 38).<br><br>Work is not a curse but a blessing; by work we not only obey the commandment of God but also enable ourselves to participate in God's saving grace. The Savior said, "If ye love me, keep my commandments" (John 14:15). So Christ made it clear that if we love Him and wish to be with Him, we must obey His commandments, including that early commandment to Adam to work.<br><br>The Lord told the Latter-day Saints at the beginning of the Restoration, "Now, I, the Lord, am not well pleased with the inhabitants of Zion, for there are idlers among them" (D&amp;amp;C 68:31). And still later, in the 20th century, President Heber J. Grant, a prophet of God, said, "Work is to be re-enthroned as the ruling principle of the lives of our Church membership" (<i>CR,</i> October 1936, 3).<br><br>Have you ever thought about what would happen if people did not work? Would our schools function? Would our government run? Would our televisions have programming? Although we sometimes think it would be nice to have all the money we ever wanted and never have to work again, I can assure you that is not the path to true happiness. Some of the most miserable people I have met have been those who, for one reason or another, have not been able to work for extended periods of time.<br><br>Work is a family responsibility. I know some of you are away from home. I remind you that right now you are benefiting from the work of your family. Your parents have worked hard to provide for your physical, spiritual, and emotional well-being. They do not expect anyone else to take over this responsibility for them. They <i>do</i> expect <i>you</i> to share some of the load.<br><br>When I attended my son's graduation from the Harvard Business School, Dean Kim Clark, who is a member of the Church, asked each of the graduating students gowned and seated in the front rows to look behind them at their loved ones. As the graduates turned around, Dean Clark paused and said, "Were it not for the support of your family members, you would not be receiving this honor today." And so it is for each of you. You have received much. In turn, you are expected--even required--to offer similar support and love to your own children and families. This does not mean (using the vernacular of the day) continually "hanging out." As you grow older, your parents expect you to provide for yourselves and become independent.<br><br>We all share in the work. Remember it is important to start early in life to teach your children that they should do their part in the work of a family. Those of you who have had the experience of growing up in a home where you were taught to work can bear testimony to its value in your life today. As a matter of fact, just last Thursday Elder Samuelson said to me how grateful he was that his father taught him to work and that his wife's mother and father taught her to work.<br><br>So far as we are able, Church members should do their best to provide the basic necessities of life--food, clothing, and shelter for their families.<br><br>We understand that in some places in the world you may encounter hardships when trying to provide for your families. These trials could include chronic illness, the loss of a spouse, the addition of an elderly parent, or providing for your children's education. Our Heavenly Father is mindful of families in these situations. It is my conviction that He will give you the strength to carry on. He will always bless us if we ask Him in faith.<br><h2><b>Work Is a Service</b></h2><br>Good work attitudes, habits, and skills are learned through successful work experiences. Let me illustrate. On the ranch where I grew up, the cows had to be milked before dawn every day. It didn't matter if it was Sunday or Christmas or any other holiday. It didn't matter if it was cold. It didn't matter if someone had the flu. It didn't matter whether the sun was shining or a blizzard was raging. Every morning and every evening it was the same--the cows had to be milked.<br><br>Before my brothers were called off to war, they did most of the milking. But in 1943, when I was just 10 years old, I would enter our barnyard where there were about 10 to 12 cows waiting for me to let them into the milking barn. My mother and father used to say out loud to the cows, "Good morning. It's good to see you!" I have to confess that as a young boy I didn't feel quite the same way toward the cows.<br><br>After each cow was milked, I poured the milk from the pail into a 10-gallon can. Each can weighed about 80 pounds when full. It made me stretch my young muscles as I carried them to the road for the dairy to pick up.<br><br>My father quite frequently helped me with milking the cows, and occasionally Mother helped. I remember my father and mother continued to milk until they were in their late 80s. But Father didn't milk the cows because he had to; he milked them because they needed to be milked. There is a difference. To him these animals were not just cows--they were Big Blackie and Bossie and Sally and Betsy. He wanted them to be contented. He always said that contented cows give good milk. To my father, milking cows--as unsophisticated as it may seem--was not an imposition; it was an opportunity. Milking was not a job for him; it was a service.<br><br>This philosophy is something that helped me as I grew up. It helped me to find out that all honest work is honorable. Within a few years I realized that routinely performing these chores actually began to give me a sense of confidence and empowerment. I took pride in my work. I found out that no one could make me feel inferior about the kind of work that I did. As Eleanor Roosevelt said, "No one can make you feel inferior without your consent" (Points to Ponder, <i>Reader's Digest,</i> February 1963, 261). You control your own attitudes--especially you young people--in your attitude about work. Self-confidence and empowerment can serve you well--in the classroom, on State Street, or on Wall Street.<br><br>Instead of thinking of our daily work as an imposition, we should think of it as an opportunity. That's just the way my father taught me to feel about the cows. Those teachings have remained with me all my life, and I continue to visit the ranch and its memories as often as possible.<br><br>Think about it. If my father could find purpose in a few cows, surely each of us can find purpose in our work.<br><h2><b>Learn to Love Work</b></h2><br>One of the best ways I know to enjoy life is to learn to love work. My wife, Verla, is the perfect example. She began to work for her sickly Aunt Bertha at age 10 washing the dishes and cleaning her house. She has been working ever since. The type of work she has done has been different at different stages of her life. She has excelled as a student, taught first grade for a few years, reared our seven children, worked in the PTA, served on the local school board, labored in the mission field, given hundreds of Church talks, and served on many community boards and as a volunteer.<br><br>Some of her work has been what the world may consider mundane, such as keeping a large household running. Some of her work has been the more intellectual pursuit of taking graduate courses, and much of it has been the spiritual effort of teaching the gospel. But always, no matter what the task, she has given it her whole effort. She has found great joy in her work. She told me just today that she hoped to be like her Aunt Vera, who when she was 90 said that she hoped she never got too old to work. The happiest people I know are those who enjoy their work--whatever it is.<br><br>You may remember the story that shows how our attitude about work can make all the difference.<br><br>A traveler passed a stone quarry and saw three men working. He asked each man what he was doing. Each man's answer revealed a different attitude toward the same job.<br><br>"I'm cutting stone," the first man answered.<br><br>The second replied, "I'm earning three gold pieces per day."<br><br>The third man smiled and said, "I am helping to build a house of God."<br><br>Remember the old saying, "Your attitude determines your altitude."<br><br>We should be able to find ample purpose in our work, no matter what it is. In any honest work we can serve God. King Benjamin, the Nephite prophet, said, "When ye are in the service of your fellow beings ye are only in the service of your God" (Mosiah 2:17). Even if our work simply helps to provide for the necessities for our families, we are still helping God's children.<br><br>The Lord is not pleased with those who are lazy or idle. He said, "The idler shall not have place in the church, except he repent and mend his ways" (D&amp;amp;C 75:29). He also commanded, "Thou shalt not be idle; for he that is idle shall not eat the bread nor wear the garments of the laborer" (D&amp;amp;C 42:42).<br><br>From the very earliest days of the Church prophets have taught Latter-day Saints to be independent and self-sustaining and to avoid idleness. True Latter-day Saints will not voluntarily shift the burden of their own support to someone else. You should determine, young friends, right here and now, that to the extent possible in your own situation, you will be selfreliant all of your life.<br><br>Many of you young women are now or will become mothers and may be blessed to spend many years at home raising children. Others of you sisters may not be able to become mothers or, if you are mothers, may not be able to stay at home full-time. Whatever your situation, I would encourage all of you young women to follow our prophet's counsel and get as much education as you can. Education itself is valuable. Your education will give you a sense of security if you are home raising children. Should your future lead you into the paid workforce, generally speaking, education will allow you to have more meaningful and more rewarding employment.<br><br>Our work itself must have integrity and be for worthy purposes. Our Heavenly Father is not happy when we receive gain from evil or idle pursuits. President Spencer W. Kimball put it this way: "I feel strongly that [those] who accept wages or salary and do not give [fair] time, energy, devotion, and service are receiving money that is not clean" (<i>CR,</i> October 1953, 52). Pretty strong words, aren't they? He also said that money obtained by evil or idle practices such as theft; gambling, including lotteries; graft; sale of illegal drugs; oppression of the poor; and the like is unclean money.<br><br>President Kimball defined the difference between honorable work and evil work:<br><br><i>Clean money is that compensation received for a full day's honest work. It is that reasonable pay for faithful service. It is that fair profit from the sale of goods, commodities, or service. It is that income received from transactions where all parties profit.</i><br><br><i>Filthy lucre is . . . money . . . obtained through theft and robbery . . . gambling . . . sinful operations . . . bribery, and . . . exploitation.</i> [<i>CR,</i> October 1953, 52]<br><br>Today there are many who offer the lure of easy money, suggesting shortcuts to quick riches and a life of ease. We hear about them all of the time. These offers are illusions, and the prophets have consistently counseled against falling prey to the temptation of "easy money." We must not lose the ability to make sound judgments, to weigh risks and benefits, and to grasp the larger messages in life.<br><br>In the workaday world there are many who are spiritually insensitive because they are carnally minded. Try to avoid them. How tragic it would be if, because of our employment, we were put in contact with those who would destroy our spirituality. "For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?" (Mark 8:36). The Lord has told us that "the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned" (1 Corinthians 2:14).<br><br>Naturally we should find the proper balance between work, rest, and relaxation. Without work, rest and relaxation have no meaning. There's an old saying: "Doing nothing is the hardest work of all." Not only is it pleasant and necessary to rest, but we are commanded to rest on the Sabbath day (see Exodus 20:10). To those who observe the Sabbath day, the Lord promises that "the fulness of the earth is yours" (D&amp;amp;C 59:16).<br><br>Some of you may know that Sister Sorensen and I spent a few years in Asia. While living there we heard an old adage: "Choose a job you love and you will never have to work a day in your life." For the most part I believe that is wishful thinking. I do not want to sound dismal. But the reality is that work is not always naturally appealing. I think a more appropriate maxim might be President Thomas S. Monson's counsel. He said, "Choose your love; love your choice" (<i>CR,</i> October 1988, 82; or "Hallmarks of a Happy Home," <i>Ensign,</i> November 1988, 71). He was actually speaking about marriage, but I would submit that this advice applies to your chosen vocation as well. Choose the job you love, then love your choice.<br><br>What I'm getting at here is many people get stuck in the rut of thinking their work ought to be more rewarding or more glamorous or at least less monotonous! When the going gets tough--as it inevitably will--they start thinking that perhaps their chosen work isn't really all they thought it would be. They begin believing the grass is greener on the other side of the fence. You'll find these folks saying, "If I only had decided to study medicine instead of the law, I could have been a great doctor." Or perhaps, "I wish I had his high-power job. If I were the boss like him, I'd work at it really hard and treat people well and be successful."<br><br>People who can't get out of this rut often have difficulty achieving excellence in <i>any</i> profession. They fall in love with a career but then become disenchanted with the small and simple things and end up quitting to pursue their fantasy over the next horizon. They drift from job to job, never settling long enough to truly achieve excellence. (If my remarks are bothering some of you, I invite you to repent.)<br><br>Once you have chosen your work, love it! No job is perfect. Every job has its challenges and its days of drudgery. Just like marriage, success and excellence at your work will likely require years and years of <i>dedicated</i> and <i>persistent</i> effort.<br><br>Let me give you an example. Michelangelo, the virtuoso painter and sculptor, shared this profound insight about his work. He said, "If people knew how hard I had to work to gain my mastery, it would not seem so wonderful at all." Some of you may have seen firsthand Michelangelo's brilliant work. But how many of us have stopped to think of the literally backbreaking, tedious job of chiseling the statue of David out of a single slab of solid marble! And to create a 14-foot statue of David! And certainly David was not Michelangelo's first sculpture. Undoubtedly he struggled and labored with hundreds and thousands of sculptures before achieving that masterpiece. Wouldn't it be tragic if Michelangelo had decided after his first few grueling years of sculpting marble that it was just too hard, too tedious, and too boring--that he'd much rather be a writer? The irony is, had he made that change, he would have likely discovered that writing can be tedious and boring too!<br><br>You will find more success if you enthusiastically persist in your work despite the shortcomings of your job and despite the daily small and simple things. Focus on the career at hand and resist the temptation of wandering eyes. In fact, I am so bold as to say it doesn't matter so much what job you choose. I promise you that if you stick with it and pursue excellence in your chosen career, you will indeed enjoy a large measure of success and <i>you will end up loving your work</i> more than you might have imagined.<br><h2><b>Words of Counsel</b></h2><br>Let me add a few additional words of counsel.<br><br><i>First,</i> work hard to get along with others. Be part of the solution, not part of the problem. Indeed, be a light, not a judge. Studies confirm over and over that people generally do not lose their jobs because they lack the technical know-how or skills. More frequently, the difficulty is that they can't get along with other people. I realize that you may not please all of the people all of the time, but you can please most of the people most of the time--especially if one of those people is your boss.<br><br><i>Second,</i> remember that people seldom improve when they have only their own yardstick to measure themselves by. I can assure you that I have made more improvements in my life and in my business as a result of others' criticism than from their praise. Learn to measure yourself with someone else's yardstick occasionally. If your boss comments that you lose your temper too easily, take it seriously. If your spouse comments that you lose your temper too easily, and your friends comment that you lose your temper too easily, it is likely that you lose your temper too easily. When you hear such feedback, listen before you deny it. Evaluate it. Weigh it. Do you think changes are in order? Regardless of criticism, learn to get along with other people. If you want to get along with them, you can.<br><br><i>Third,</i> be an optimist. Do not accept pessimism, especially when it is directed at you personally. Do not accept pessimistic statements about your Heavenly Father. Consider their source--they come from Satan. Do not accept pessimistic statements about the leaders of this Church or the Church as an institution. It takes work to reject Satan's messages, but such work will lead to happiness.<br><br>A word to the returned missionaries: Do not abandon the principles or the habits or the great experiences that you learned in the mission field. Do not abandon your appearance. The Brethren do not expect you to wear a white shirt and tie and a dark blue suit now that you are back in school, but you should maintain the good grooming you learned in the mission field. Dress for success! When your personal habits reflect the cleanliness, the dignity, and the principles of the gospel you taught as a young missionary, they will serve you well in the workplace.<br><h2><b>Summary</b></h2><br>My message this evening could be summed up in two statements. The first is from President David O. McKay. He said, "Let us realize that the privilege to work is a gift, that power to work is a blessing, that love of work is success" (<i>Pathways to Happiness</i> [Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1957], 381).<br><br>The second is from our own dearly beloved living prophet, President Gordon B. Hinckley. He said:<br><br><i>The major work of the world is not done by geniuses. It is done by ordinary people, with balance in their lives, who have learned to work in an extraordinary manner.</i> ["Our Fading Civility," Brigham Young University inauguration and spring commencement exercises, 25 April 1996, 15]<br><br>It is a given that there will be disappointment and discouragement along the way, brothers and sisters.<br><br>Orson F. Whitney comforts us:<br><br><i>No pain that we suffer, no trial that we experience is wasted. It ministers to our education, to the development of such qualities as patience, faith, fortitude and humility. All that we suffer and all that we endure, especially when we endure it patiently, builds up our characters, purifies our hearts, expands our souls, and makes us more tender and charitable, more worthy to be called the children of God . . . and it is through sorrow and suffering, toil and tribulation, that we gain the education that we come here to acquire and which will make us more like our Father and Mother in heaven.</i> [Quoted in Spencer W. Kimball, <i>Faith Precedes the Miracle</i> [Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1972], 98]<br><br>As a humble servant of the Lord, I promise you and bless you that as you work at keeping the standards the Lord has set through the scriptures and His prophets, as you study, as you pray, as you pay your tithes and offerings from the money you earn from your work, you will be more successful in all of your life as well as in your daily work. You will become a better worker. You will be a more productive worker. You will be a more effective worker. All because the Spirit of the Lord will be with you and aid and strengthen you.<br><br>I bring to you a special greeting from our beloved prophet, President Hinckley. Not long ago, in a speech to the members of his home stake, President Hinckley said: "Things are not as bad as we sometimes think. . . . I have great optimism concerning this Church. I have tremendous optimism concerning the youth of this Church. We do not need to fear. We have nothing to fear if we will live the gospel, if we will make our decisions in the light of the gospel. If we will get on our knees and pray to the Lord for His enlightenment, understanding, direction, and courage, we do not need to fear."<br><br>So tonight, my dear young friends, I would like to bear my testimony to you today. I believe in this Church. I believe in Jesus Christ. I believe in what He said. I believe what He said when He told the Nephites, "I created the heavens and the earth, and all things that in them are. I was with the Father from the beginning" (3 Nephi 9:15). I know that He is the Son of Elohim, the Father who created Adam and Eve. I know, my dear young friends, that He, the Son, was born of Mary in Bethlehem of Judea. I know His birth to be as Matthew said in the days of Herod the King. Jesus Christ said, "I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life" (John 8:12). I believe in Jesus Christ wherein He said, "If a man keep my saying, he shall never see death" (John 8:51). I know that He and His Father appeared to the boy prophet Joseph Smith.<br><br>I know Jesus Christ can help each of us in our work if we will help Him in His work.<br><br><i>For the names of the righteous shall be written in the book of life, and unto them will I grant an inheritance at my right hand. And now, my brethren, what have ye to say against this? I say unto you, if ye speak against it, it matters not, for the word of God must be fulfilled.</i> [Alma 5:58]<br><br>I know and testify that we have a living prophet, Gordon B. Hinckley, who can help us in our work if we heed his counsel.<br><br>You, my dear young friends, are the hope of this Church. You are the hope of the communities where you live. You will become the future leaders of this Church, the future leaders of the communities, of the world. I bear you my humble testimony that if you will work for our Heavenly Father and His Son, Jesus Christ, that He will bless you and watch over and keep you all the days of your life. And I bear you this testimony in His holy name, even our Lord, our Redeemer, our Savior, even the Holy One of Israel, Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>David E.

<h1>: A Gift of Life, a Gift of Love - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
It is a great honor to speak to you today. I have known this overwhelming task was coming my way for the last year or so. The Spirit has whispered it to me. And I, well, I have tried to ignore those feelings. It seemed too important a task to fall to me, so I tried to push the thought aside. But it returned from time to time and I thought, "Oh my, what could I ever talk about that would be worthy of the whole student body?" I would think about a few possible ideas but then quickly push them out of my mind again. I thought, "No! No! No! They're not going to call me."<br><br>So when the dreaded phone call came, I was not surprised. Not really. Vice President Skousen said I could speak on any subject I'd like--maybe something from my profession or my research, maybe something else. He left it completely up to me! And within 10 minutes of hanging up--as I sat there somewhat stunned--I knew clearly what I must speak about.<br><br>I was reminded of the fact that I had once heard that the topics for talks at general conference are not assigned. This is a wonderful testimony to me: our leaders leave the inspiration up to the speakers. I asked myself, "What is the greatest blessing I have received from the Lord?" And I knew the answer and I had a detailed outline in my mind of what I should say, something that I might be uniquely qualified to speak about.<br><br>It is truly humbling to stand at this podium, for this is the place where prophets stand to speak perhaps more than any other place except Temple Square. I served on a committee a few years ago that looked at "the university experience." I had access there to research done by the university, including surveys of alumni who had graduated in the past five years, 10 years, or 20 years. The university experience uniformly rated the highest by all groups was that of the weekly devotionals.<br><br>I remember some of the devotionals from my own experience as a student here 30 years ago. I remember a talk by Elder Hinckley--then a junior member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles--entitled "The Loneliness of Leadership" (4 November 1969). It was an interesting talk and quite revealing of the way the Lord works with our leaders. Since that time, as I've watched our General Authorities, I have thought of that talk and my admiration for our leaders has grown.<br><br>I remember a talk by Marion D. Hanks when he said, "Blossom where you are planted." He spoke of life in these times, when we may get employment that takes us to the ends of the earth--sometimes quite literally. He spoke of moving to a place where we may study or have some training and only plan to be there for a few years or sometimes only a few months. He said that wherever we are, we should settle in as if we were going to stay for a long time. Don't live out of your suitcase, he said. Move in. Blossom where you are planted.<br><br>In the years since I heard that talk, I've moved to Charlestown, Massachusetts; Greenville, South Carolina; Cortland, New York; Somerville, Massachusetts; Dryden, New York; Urbana, Illinois; Seoul, Korea; three different houses in Provo, Utah; Pusan, Korea; and finally back to Provo--and then six study abroad sessions and a one-semester sabbatical in Korea. From time to time I would think of Elder Hanks' advice as I saw some others who apparently missed that devotional, because they would moan about moving "back home," "back to Utah," "back to California," "back to wherever." I think of my nephew in Illinois who grew up in Illinois. He says his ward is full of people from "out West" who constantly run down his hometown because it doesn't measure up somehow to their hometown. Elder Hanks' advice given in that devotional years ago is still valid: "Blossom where you are planted."<br><br>Thinking of the great talks that have been offered from this podium, I therefore speak to you with a great sense of humility. I hope some of you will remember and be benefited by something I say here today. I am certain that my message will have special meaning to some of you, but I hope that it will have some meaning for all of you.<br><br>The title of my talk today is "Adoption: A Gift of Life, a Gift of Love." I am going to speak about three aspects of adoption. Each will have a varying degree of interest to you, I suppose. I wrote a book about adoption as it has been practiced in Korea and in much of the rest of Asia. I will tell you about some of my own experiences with adoption and adoption in this country and in the Church, and finally I will speak about adoption as it pertains to all of us as the seed of Abraham.<br><br>I think this message will have particular meaning for some of you: those of you who are adopted, those of you who will someday adopt a child or two, and those of you who have siblings who are adopted. I think my message will be helpful to some of you who in future years may be bishops or Relief Society presidents or home teachers or visiting teachers who may be called upon to advise a single mother who is trying to decide what to do. Your advice might mean a life saved, a life blessed, and a life loved.<br><br>But aside from these specific cases, I am going to speak to all of you about your adoption into the house of Israel and into the covenant of Abraham. In fact, "Father Abraham" is our father and the one with whom Jehovah established the covenant--and with it the priesthood.<br><br>You'll remember I had been told that I might talk about some of my professional work if I so chose. As it turns out, I wrote a PhD dissertation and later had it published as a book entitled <i>Korean Adoption and Inheritance.</i> The title could be misleading to the general public, but it fits into a genre of literature in east Asian studies on family and lineage and history. The subtitle tells you more of what the book is about: <i>The Creation of a Classic Confucian Society.</i> It deals with 17th-century Korea and how Korea became thoroughly indoctrinated by Confucian ideology as reflected in changes in the family structure and as seen in adoption and inheritance practices.<br><br>In a nutshell, what happened in the late 17th century under growing influence from neo-Confucianism was that the inheritance pattern changed from one where sons and daughters received property from their parents equally to a system where the eldest son, by the rule of primogeniture, received nearly all of the property. Daughters became disinherited. This change affected the ancestor ceremonies that were so important in Confucianism. Once shared by all sons and daughters, now they were controlled by the eldest son. This change affected the structure of the village, which originally included sons and their wives and daughters with their husbands, with the sons-in-law having all kinds of surnames. Then it became a classic patrilineal village where everyone had the same surname, for they were all <i>agnates,</i> a term meaning "men related to men through men."<br><br>Part of this social change in Korea--this new emphasis on the male line--meant that if a couple had only daughters or had no children, they would surely adopt. But adoption in traditional Korea was what is technically known as agnatic adoption--meaning one would adopt the son of one's brother or one's cousin. It had to be a son from within the lineage, someone of the same bloodline. I have a graph in my book showing the increase in the practice of adoption. I have another graph showing how daughters were disinherited. A third graph shows how the two lines crisscrossed and the adopted son came to replace the daughter as an heir in the household. This type of adoption was also practiced in China and Japan, but the Koreans were the most orthodox in their application of the principle.<br><br>The Chinese were more flexible. In an interesting example from China the preface to one book of genealogy says that only agnatic adoptions would be included in the genealogy and that other adoptions--referred to as adoptions arranged in the marketplace--would not be written in the book. Yet within the book itself were recorded three cases of nonagnatic adoption.<br><br>The Japanese, in the Tokugawa period, practiced some agnatic adoption, but they were more open to other forms, and son-in-law adoption--<i>mukoyoshi--</i>was a favored one. Sometimes the Japanese would adopt a daughter so that they could get a son-in-law, who would then become heir to the family name and estate.<br><br>In summary, we can say that in traditional Asia many adoptions were inspired by Confucianism, and this is a manifestation of a special gift of life: to keep life going in the family line. It is also a gift of love: a method of maintaining loving ties in a family as expressed in Confucian ceremonies. Some people criticize Confucianism for its suppression of women--and that is certainly an issue--but given the fact that Confucianism became the controlling ideology in Korea, we can certainly find virtue within the Confucian system. One of its strong points was the care and keeping of the family line.<br><br>Adoption in Asia is quite different then from adoption in the West. In Korea only a son is adopted, and he must be from within the surname group. A relative from the mother's side was not adequate; it had to be a son from the father's side. Only one son was adopted. There was no need for two or more. And the main purpose was so that ceremonies could be carried out for the father and grandfather and the other male ancestors.<br><br>Adoption in the West is just the opposite. Either sons or daughters can be adopted. There is no need to quit after one child; rather, one can adopt two or three or--as did my neighbor--nine. The focus is the child, not the ancestors.<br><br>Our own adoption case began, I guess, when my wife and I married. Most children come in nine months, if they are on time. Our children took 18 years. The Lord finally took us by the hand and gave us an answer to our prayers. He called us together to preside over a mission in Pusan, Korea. Toward the end of the mission we finally mustered the courage to apply for an adoption. Thankfully an angelic woman who worked at the adoption agency thought we would be good parents. She knew me from a committee we had served on in Seoul a few years before. I paid her a call and told her we were finally ready. She said she would let us know when an appropriate child was available. Five days later she called: "We have a baby for you to look at." We flew to Seoul, held that baby in our arms, and our hearts melted. Most couples take nine months. It took us five days. Well, 18 years and five days.<br><br>That little baby transformed our mission. She transformed us. We carried her everywhere we went, and we did not slacken in our care for our missionaries.<br><br><i>Be thou humble; and the Lord thy God shall lead thee by the hand, and give thee answer to thy prayers.</i> [D&amp;amp;C 112:10]<br><br>Through a long and complicated series of events, the Lord provided us the answer to our prayers. We knew it was a great blessing, but we did not know how many lives and many events and many others had done this or that to bring us together to make us a happy family. That little baby grew into a wonderful little girl and is now a lovely young woman. We are grateful and proud to be her parents and feel so blessed that she came into our home.<br><br>The adoption of our second child was just as miraculous. The opportunity to go to Korea for a semester came about unexpectedly. It came just when I was coming up for tenure, and when I told my wife we needed to go, not for research or teaching but for an administrative assignment, she said it didn't make sense. It didn't. But I told her I had a strong feeling that we should go. Two weeks later, after she had wrestled with the idea, she told me that she finally agreed; we needed to go. Then she said, "There is another baby waiting for us."<br><br>My jaw fell open. I was flabbergasted, but it suddenly made sense. Things fell into place. I went to see my department chair and told him that I needed an emergency leave and that I needed to go to Korea. He was surprised--and skeptical. But I put all my cards on the table and told him about the adopted daughter that would soon be born, and he completely supported my request. As it turns out, he had special sympathies for me--he, too, was adopted. On short notice I found a perfect replacement to teach my classes. Details on the Korean side were much more complicated, and a series of obstacles appeared in our path, but one by one everything fell into place.<br><br>My wife's mother had died the previous year, and my wife and I are convinced that somehow--I don't know how these things work--she engineered the details from her side of the veil. Our second baby is the sweetest child a set of parents could ever hope to have. She is a joy to us, and she has become our second greatest blessing. We love these gifts from heaven. They have given us life. They have given us love. We have been sealed for time and all eternity, and we enjoy all the blessings of the temple.<br><br>The history of adoption in the restored Church goes back to Joseph Smith. He had two adopted children. Today, LDS Family Services maintains an active Web site as part of its program of matching birth mothers with hopeful parents. If you go to the lds.org page, within just a few clicks you can see a page for birth mothers who are thinking about--as the slogan says--"not giving a child up" but "giving the child more." On that page are couples looking for their first child and families looking for one more child. I've heard of remarkable things that have happened in matching a child with parents. These are little miracles--little miracles that match lives and love in the most marvelous way.<br><br>There is a passage in the proclamation on the family that says:<br><br><i>The family is ordained of God. Marriage between man and woman is essential to His eternal plan. Children are entitled to birth</i> [or adoption] <i>within the bonds of matrimony, and to be reared by a father and a mother.</i> ["The Family: A Proclamation to the World," <i>Ensign,</i> November 1995, 102]<br><br>We understand that the birth mother who believes that statement and who chooses to give her child more is a woman who will most likely--by a very high percentage--end up married in the temple and active in the Church. On the other hand, the birth mother who chooses to keep her child to be raised alone most often does not end up married in the temple or active in the Church. Sometimes well-meaning but ill-informed grandparents offer to help when <i>all</i> concerned would be happier if the birth mother chose to give her child more.<br><br>When a child comes into a home--whether adopted or born naturally--the mother and father will kneel in prayer and offer the sweetest prayer that it is possible to utter. They thank their Heavenly Father for the baby and for the opportunity to raise the baby, and then in deep, deep gratitude they ask for help. In the case of adoptive parents, they offer another important part of the prayer: They thank the Lord for the gift given by the birth mother and then ask Heavenly Father to bless the woman who has in a very real sense been an angel to them--an angel who has literally carried a spirit from heaven into the home of the new parents. In a unique way, the phrase from the hymn "As Sisters in Zion" that says "the errand of angels is given to women" has special meaning when applied to the birth mother (<i>Hymns,</i> 1985, no. 309). And the pleas of the new parents to bless the birth mother are answered in rich and unique blessings that are available to her.<br><br>Adoptive parents often hear praise or congratulations for taking in a child, but adopted parents never feel deserving of any praise. We even feel such praise is misguided. We feel grateful that the child, a child of God, has entered our lives to bless us--not the other way around. This may sound odd, but it is true. In a sense parents are not as altruistic as they are self-serving. It is we, the parents, who are blessed by the action of adoption. And that blessing lasts throughout life and eternity. Adoption is a gift of life--not just for the child who has life but also for the parents who have life added to them.<br><br>Adoptive parents sometimes dislike hearing someone ask about the "real father" or the "real mother." Our unspoken response is, "What? I'm not real? Why, I'm as real as it gets!" Actually, it is not a simple matter to be a <i>real</i> father or mother. A real father <i>becomes</i> a real father by tenderly caring for the baby; changing diapers; feeding the baby baby food; cleaning up after feeding the baby; sitting up late at night tending an ill child; laughing; playing; taking the growing child to the first day of school and to many days of school thereafter and to games, to movies, to church. That is what is real. No, don't make a mistake about who the real father is. The <i>real</i> father is the one who is there hour after hour, day after day, year after year.<br><br>What I have said about adopted children is true in cases of stepchildren as well. In remarriage and starting families anew are great blessings of love and life that can come to the parents and the children in those situations as well.<br><br>At times a single parent must raise his or her children on their own. And some saintly women have that challenge. One such woman was the mother of Elder Dallin H. Oaks and Elder Merrill Oaks--one of the rare sets of brothers who serve as General Authorities. Another such woman was my grandmother, who raised my father and three other children alone. At times a single father has that challenge. Single parents are entitled to special blessings to assist them in their saintly duties.<br><br>Let me share with you a story of one of the more meaningful experiences I have had at BYU. It is a story within a story. Every year in late August, just before the start of the fall semester, we faculty have a meeting in the de Jong Concert Hall. It is the duty of the academic vice president to speak to us. The burden must weigh heavily on his shoulders, for he has to say something worthwhile to a bunch of people who know a lot of things. We faculty are not a bunch of "know-it-alls," but we tend to think we know a lot.<br><br>I shall never forget the talk given one year when Todd Britsch was our academic vice president. Professor Britsch has recently retired as a professor of humanities from the Humanities, Classics, and Comparative Literature Department in our College of Humanities. Not long after I came to BYU, Todd became our dean. Then he was promoted to academic vice president. I knew he had two adopted children. One day we got the word that his son had died.<br><br>In Professor Britsch's talk to the faculty that day in August 1994, he told us of a dream he had had. Here is what he said:<br><br><i>When Dan died at conference time last year, shortly after his 20th birthday, we held his funeral on a Friday. The next Monday, as you would have done, I returned to school and to a busy schedule. But family, church, and BYU responsibilities so occupied my time that I felt I had not really had a chance to mourn his death. Finally, in November, I caught a mild case of flu that forced me to stay home on a Sunday. After a morning filled with reflection, I fell asleep and had the following dream:</i><br><br><i>I was in a parking lot (probably by the JKHB) walking with my arms full of books and other materials. As I approached my 1967 Volvo, the car I drove to campus for 23 years, I noticed that exhaust was coming from the tailpipe. This concerned me, because I knew that the car keys were in my pocket. I opened the front passenger door because I wanted to put my books on the seat. As I did so, I saw Dan in the back seat, surrounded by his books, writing in a notebook. I told him that I had been surprised that the engine was running, and he replied that he wanted to heat the car while he was studying because it was cold to him. After an exchange about car keys, Dan said, "Just sit down there. I'll come up and drive." As he moved from the back seat and opened the driver's door, I realized that he was dead. I leaned forward, and we embraced. I felt his whiskers against my cheek and said, "I miss you so much." With that, I awoke, weeping but strangely and deeply comforted.</i><br><br><i>As I described this comfort to my wife, she remarked that it was very natural: "It's because he was at BYU. For years, one of your strongest wishes was for Dan to be a student here." Dorothy was right. Like many of you, I longed for the time that circumstances would be such that my son could enroll at BYU. It was here that I wanted him to learn the beauty of mathematical formulae. It was at BYU that I hoped he could develop a profound understanding of the scriptures. It was from you</i> [that is, my colleagues on the faculty] <i>that I wanted him to study humanities, biology, the fine arts, sociology, and all of the other wonderful things we get to deal with every day. I believed that his whole life could be changed if he could be a student here. For a moment, at least, it seemed that this had happened.</i><br><br><i>Now when I look across the campus, I see tens of thousands of students whose parents' wishes are much the same as mine. They see in BYU the one place where their children's eternal education can take place. I hope that we will never take casually the extraordinary faith they place in us.</i> [Todd A. Britsch, 23 August 1994, "Excellence, Charity, and the University," <i>Addresses Delivered at the 1994 Annual University Conference</i> (Provo: BYU, 1994), 24–25]<br><br>There was not a dry eye in the de Jong Concert Hall as we faculty listened to Professor Britsch. I have not looked at my duties at BYU the same since. I marveled at how an academic vice president could speak with such feeling and such power. And I thought, "Only at BYU."<br><br>Todd Britsch--as an adoptive father--might have additional sensitivities that have helped all of us who teach here to understand our roles as fathers and mothers and to see you as sons and daughters of parents who love you very much and have sent you to college with great hopes riding with you.<br><br>I told a friend who has two biological children and one adopted daughter that I was preparing this talk. He said, "You know, I've done a lot of things in my life. I graduated from BYU, attended the top-ranked business school in the country, got a great job with a great bank, and was assigned to work in Korea. I thought it was all about me. But now I know I did all those things so that we could be in the right place at the right time to meet Lori. It wasn't about me. It was about her and our family becoming complete."<br><br>I called my friend and read what I had written about him and asked if it was correct. He said it was not only correct but the truth of that statement becomes clearer with each year that passes and that we are only beginning to understand what an eternal family means.<br><br>Adoption is truly a gift. It is a gift from our Heavenly Father. It is a gift of life, a gift of love.<br><br>But adoption is not limited to the special cases we call "adopted." It pertains to all of us. The Apostle Paul made several references to adoption. He spoke of adoption as the process by which we become members of the covenant, part of the family of Abraham. In five instances Paul used the term <i>adoption</i> to indicate the process by which Gentiles and Jews become part of the covenant and members of the family of Abraham. To Paul, the term <i>adoption</i> was used to show that those who believe in Jesus become part of a very special family. This is true for all of us who are baptized into the Church today. We become brothers and sisters.<br><br>It is perhaps clearest in Galatians:<br><br><i>For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ.</i><br><br><i>There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female: for ye are all one in Christ Jesus.</i><br><br><i>And if ye be Christ's, then are ye Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the promise.</i> [Galatians 3:27–29]<br><br>The vision of the olive tree, with its branches "grafted in," as recorded in Jacob 5, is another way of looking at this same adoption process.<br><br>Becoming a part of the house of Israel is expressed to us in specific terms when we receive our patriarchal blessings. Therein we are told which lineage is ours. This, too, in many cases, is a manifestation of family creation through the process of adoption. Sometimes within one family are some who are of the lineage of Ephraim whereas another might be of Judah or Dan or Manasseh. Membership in each of these lineages is often part of the adoption process of which Paul spoke. When we choose obedience and repentance and partake of the blessing of the covenant, we are welcomed into the household of faith, the Church. We are no more strangers and foreigners but fellow citizens, brothers, and sisters with the Saints.<br><br>The principle of adoption also helps us understand one complex and sometimes confusing aspect of our doctrine. I am speaking of the times when Jesus is referred to as our Father. We love the simplicity of Joseph Smith's First Vision. When Joseph walked out of the Sacred Grove, mankind had a clear understanding of the nature of God our Father and of God the Son, Jesus Christ. Our understanding of this point is clear, and we like to think of Jesus as our Elder Brother. But then there are places in the scripture where the term <i>God the Father</i> means Jesus. In Mosiah 16:15, Abinadi said, "Teach them that redemption cometh through Christ the Lord, who is the very Eternal Father. Amen."<br><br>Let's look at Zeezrom debating Amulek:<br><br><i>Now Zeezrom saith again unto</i> [Amulek]: <i>Is the Son of God the very Eternal Father?</i><br><br><i>And Amulek said unto him: Yea, he is the very Eternal Father of heaven and of earth, and all things which in them are; he is the beginning and the end, the first and the last;</i><br><br><i>And he shall come into the world to redeem his people; and he shall take upon him the transgressions of those who believe on his name; and these are they that shall have eternal life, and salvation cometh to none else.</i> [Alma 11:38–40]<br><br>Here the gift of being an heir--a son or a daughter--means not only a gift of life but also a gift of eternal life. When we choose to obey the gospel, to repent and be baptized, we become sons and daughters of Christ. It is a process not unlike that of adoption.<br><br>Abinadi spoke of this process as becoming the sons or the "seed" of Christ (Mosiah 15:10, 11).<br><br>And finally, in section 84 of the Doctrine and Covenants:<br><br><i>For whoso is faithful unto the obtaining these two priesthoods of which I have spoken, and the magnifying their calling, are sanctified by the Spirit unto the renewing of their bodies.</i><br><br><i>They become the sons of Moses and of Aaron and the seed of Abraham, and the church and kingdom, and the elect of God.</i> [D&amp;amp;C 84:33–34]<br><br>This is the ultimate gift of life, the ultimate gift of love.<br><br>It helps me understand my relationship with my Elder Brother, who is also the Father of this earth, the God who chose "To walk upon his footstool / And be like man, almost" ("O God, the Eternal Father," <i>Hymns,</i> 1985, no. 175). He is my Savior and the very Eternal Father. Our biological fathers are really our brothers, too, are they not? We have "fathers of our flesh" and fathers of our spirit--again quoting from Paul (Hebrews 12:9).<br><br>I am grateful for the blessings of adoption. I am grateful that one form of adoption has blessed the lives of those who follow Confucianism. I am grateful for another form of adoption that has blessed my life and the lives of many of you. And I am grateful that we have a Father in Heaven whose Only Begotten Son is a Father to those of us who have covenanted to follow Him.<br><br>Adoption is a principle with a promise. It is a blessing for me; it is a blessing for you. In one way or another it is a gift of life--sometimes eternal life--and a gift of love that blesses all of us. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Mark A.

<h1>of War - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Thank you, President Samuelson. I consider it an honor to speak today to the students of our great university. I am grateful that my family has joined us, and I appreciate that my sons accepted the invitation to offer the prayers for this devotional. One of the great blessings in my life has been a supportive family. I enjoyed the musical number and am grateful for the abundant talent exhibited in student performances. In keeping with the spirit and intent of our university devotionals, I pray that what I will share now will be helpful as you prepare to live in an uncertain world.<br><br>At one point in my reading of the Book of Mormon, I pondered why the Lord called a warrior to prepare a sacred text. He could have chosen a merchant, a teacher, or some other from any of a number of professions. Nevertheless, he did not. He chose a warrior, Mormon, who during his lifetime had beheld "a continual scene of wickedness and abominations" (Mormon 2:18). I wondered how these experiences particularly prepared him to author a book of scripture for our day. I found some insight in his son's report of what Christ had revealed about our day. Because of this knowledge, Moroni felt that he could<i> "</i>speak unto [us] as if [we] were present<i>" </i>(Mormon 8:35).<br><br>It appears that Mormon and Moroni understood that we, like them, would live in an age characterized by wars and the rumors of war. Certainly our own latter-day prophecies speak "of wars, and rumors of wars. . . . For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom" (JS--M 1:28–29).<br><br>In a time of wars and rumors of war we cannot expect to escape the realities described by Mormon and Moroni. Throughout our history members of the Church have accepted the call to the battlefront. Those who have fought understand all too well what Mormon felt when he reported that "it is impossible for the tongue to describe, or for man to write a perfect description of the horrible scene of the blood and carnage which was among the people" (Mormon 4:11).<br><br>My purpose today is not to debate the issues related to past wars or the conflicts that currently rage throughout the world. Nor is my intent to provide further evidence of the horrible scenes of war evident in our time. Rather, my intent is to invite you to consider what President Hinckley described as the "silver thread" of war.<br><br>In 1966 there were over 2,000 Latter-day Saint servicemen in Vietnam. Elder Gordon B. Hinckley visited the troops in Saigon to hold a district conference. During this visit a servicemen's conference was held in Saigon, where Elder Hinckley dedicated the land of Vietnam for the preaching of the gospel. This trip was only one of several he made to Vietnam to strengthen the Latter-day Saint servicemen stationed there.<br><br>During his address at general conference in April 1968, he spoke of his trips to Vietnam:<br><br><i>One cannot have been to Vietnam as I have on a number of occasions, and felt in some small measure the dreadful sorrow of the land, without making a plea for peace a part of his daily prayers. This war, like others, is fraught with terrible evil and unspeakable tragedy. I minimize none of these.</i><br><br><i>But notwithstanding the evil and the tragedy, I see a silver thread shining through the dark and bloody tapestry of conflict. I see the finger of the Lord plucking some good from the evil designs of the adversary. I see coming out of this conflict . . . an enlargement of the Lord's program. . . .</i><br><br><i>I hope that some of you parents who grieve over your sons who could not go on missions because of the demands of the draft will derive some small measure of comfort from the assurance that your sons may perform an effective missionary labor through their examples, and that they may assist in lifting the veil in lands of darkness in which the gospel must someday be taught.</i> [<i>CR, </i>April 1968, 21–23]<br><br>The "silver thread" that Elder Hinckley described was woven in by efforts of faithful Latter-day Saint servicemen, young men of the age to serve missions who had responded to their nation's call. Their acts of faith and courage provide us with numerous examples that can help us prepare to meet our own unique challenges in these last days.<br><br>Ariel Barrus, an LDS veteran of World War II, has given a lifetime of service to the Church. He is one of many faithful LDS servicemen who wove the silver thread into the tapestry of World War II. Personal accounts of veterans such as Brother Barrus are found in the <i>Saints at War</i> archive housed in the L. Tom Perry Special Collections of the BYU Harold B. Lee Library. In drawing from these accounts for my presentation, I wish to recognize the contribution of my colleague Dr. Robert C. Freeman, whose work in preserving the accounts of our LDS servicemen has been monumental.<br><br>I believe that from the examples of faithful LDS servicemen we can understand basic principles that will enable us to endure our particular season of war. For the purposes of this devotional, I would like to limit my remarks to three important principles. I believe these will help us live in a time of wars and rumors of war. The first principle recognizes that "without faith [we] can do nothing" (D&amp;amp;C 8:10).<br><br>I have in my hand a letter written during World War II by a young soldier to an LDS chaplain, Eldin Ricks, that illustrates his simple faith.<br><br>Let me read from the letter Chaplain Ricks received from Boyd Colby:<br><br><i>Our church on Sunday is swell. That is what we go the week for. I have had to miss twice, and those weeks seemed like they never would end.</i><br><br><i>My home is in Manti, Utah. From my bedroom window I can see the temple. I think that it is the most beautiful sight that there is.</i><br><br><i>If you should see any boys from my hometown, would you give them my address? Would you please send me the Book of Mormon and</i> Principles of the Gospel<i>?</i> [Letter to Eldin Ricks from Boyd H. Colby dated 14 February 1944; <i>Saints at War</i> archive, L. Tom Perry Special Collections, Harold B. Lee Library, Brigham Young University, Provo, Utah]<br><br>In the letter, Brother Colby requested the pocketbooks prepared by the Church. They were of a size that would fit the front pocket of an infantry field jacket. Since their introduction in World War II, they have provided an invaluable source of faith for LDS servicemen throughout each succeeding conflict.<br><br>James D. Martin, an aircraft mechanic during the Korean War, described how the Lord blessed him because of his faith:<br><br><i>Because the men of the squadron did not keep the standards, which I was striving to diligently keep, . . . I often wished that I could find the companionship of other LDS men. . . . One night after everyone had gone to bed, I went to the squadron line shack. . . . I knew that no one would be there at that time of night and I would not be bothered. There I poured out my heart to God as I had never done before. I pled with Him to help me find the companionship I felt so desperately in need of. I begged His forgiveness of my sins and weaknesses. Tears freely flowed. As I left the room, I felt a peace and calm I had never felt before. I knew that somehow the Lord would help me.</i> [James D. Martin, interviewed by the author; <i>Saints at War</i> archive, L. Tom Perry Special Collections, Harold B. Lee Library, BYU]<br><br>One of my first interviews with an LDS serviceman was with Horst Hilbert. As a young member of the Church in Germany, Horst was part of the largest congregation of Church members outside North America. Like other German members, he feared that as a soldier he would be forced to fight his American brothers. He prayed that this would not happen. He laughed as he explained that the Lord answered his prayers by sending him to the Russian front.<br><br>Horst described how his family gathered in prayer before he entered the German army. He recalls how that experience gave him the faith and courage he needed at a particularly difficult moment during the war. Finding himself hiding in a small shed surrounded by Russian soldiers, he knelt in prayer asking for protection. Trusting in his faith and that of his family, he prayed while bullets whistled around him without harming him.<br><br>Following the retreat from Russia, American forces captured his unit and placed the men in a fenced POW compound. Horst caught the attention of a guard and asked him in English if there were any Mormons in the camp. Surprised that Horst could speak English, the guard said he knew one.<br><br>"Get him, it is important," Horst said excitedly.<br><br>Soon a GI appeared smoking a cigarette.<br><br>"Are you the Mormon?" Horst asked with some surprise.<br><br>"Yes, but I am not really active," he replied.<br><br>Upon further questioning, Horst learned that several other Mormons met to worship each Sunday. He made contact with one of these men, who obtained permission for Horst to attend their church service. Tears came as Horst described kneeling for the first time in years before a makeshift sacrament table:<br><br><i>There I was</i> [he described]<i> in my dirty German uniform passing the sacrament to my American brothers. I knew at that moment that for me the war was over. I was so grateful to my Father in Heaven for my membership in the Church and the blessings that were mine that day.</i><br><br>Upon returning home after the war, Horst related his experiences on the Russian front to his family. He was surprised when they questioned him in detail about his experience in the shed. Seeming satisfied, his father then told of the night when his wife woke him, worried about their son. Waking all the family, they had knelt in prayer pleading with the Lord to spare their son. Horst believed that his family had prayed at the same time that his life was threatened. (From notes by Dennis A. Wright of interview with Horst K. Hilbert, Mesa, Arizona, October 1971; see also Robert C. Freeman and Dennis A. Wright, <i>Saints at War: Experiences of Latter-day Saints in World War II</i> [American Fork, Utah: Covenant Communications, 2001], 135–36.)<br><br>It is interesting to note that Elder Neal A. Maxwell reported a similar experience. While he was under fire on a Pacific island, his mother woke her family to pray for her son, whom she felt was in danger. Elder Maxwell said of this experience, "Mothers just know" (Neal A. Maxwell, interviewed by the author).<br><br>Sustained by their faith, young Latter-day Saints have faced the most difficult of experiences. They have succeeded because of their faith in Christ and their testimony of the gospel. It is natural that armed with such faith they would learn to trust in the Spirit.<br><br>Our first principle was that we can do nothing without faith. The second principle I would like to illustrate is the counsel of the Lord to trust that the Spirit will lead us "to do good" (D&amp;amp;C 11:12).<br><br>Wilford Fischer served as a marine in World War II. His assignment was to find enemy targets and radio their position for naval bombardment. When I first met Brother Fischer, he was somewhat frail with age. As the interview progressed, his eyes brightened and his countenance changed as he bore witness of how the Spirit had blessed him during the battle of Saipan.<br><br>Brother Fischer related that "one by one we knocked out the enemy artillery except for one large 16-inch gun." During this time Wilford felt an impression to move his men from their location in the trees. He ordered his men into an open spot on the hill. They complained because it was so hot in the jungle sun. Nevertheless Wilford persisted, and they obeyed. As soon as they settled in their new location, Japanese mortar shells began to fall on their former position in the shade below. Wilford's patrol would have all died had they not moved. With tears in his eyes, Wilford shook his head and testified, "If I had not listened to the Spirit that day, it would have cost all of our lives. I am so grateful for the Spirit that helped me that day to save the lives of those wonderful young men." (From Wilford A. Fischer oral interview notes, Provo, Utah, November 2000; <i>Saints at War</i> archive, L. Tom Perry Special Collections, Harold B. Lee Library, BYU; see also <i>Saints at War: Experiences of Latter-day Saints in World War II,</i> 2001, 321–23.)<br><br>In our effort to understand how the Spirit leads us to do good, we need to recognize that it sometimes works in mysterious ways. The account of Brenner Hall, an army marksman in World War II, known by his friends as "Dead-eye Dick," illustrates this point.<br><br>Fearing that a German patrol of two soldiers would discover their position, Brenner and his comrades decided to confront and capture them. One German soldier attempted to fire on the Americans and was immediately gunned down. The second turned and ran. The leader of the American unit turned to Brenner, a company sharpshooter, and asked him to shoot the fleeing German. Brenner took careful aim and squeezed the trigger. Much to the surprise of his friends, Brenner repeatedly missed his target.<br><br>Another American patrol captured the fleeing German and returned him for questioning. As the GIs approached the house, they shouted out that they had caught Brenner's friend. Still smarting from the embarrassment of having failed to hit his target, Brenner demanded to know what they meant.<br><br>"Well," they reported, "he must be your friend, because we found him praying on his knees, and you are the only one that we have seen do that." "He must be your friend," they teased.<br><br>Speaking through an interpreter, the German soldier explained that he had a friend in Arizona. No one was more surprised than Brenner when the German told of his friend, a Mormon elder from Mesa, Arizona, who had baptized his family before the war. Brenner recognized the name of his high school friend and knew that he had served his mission to Germany.<br><br>"I know that guy," Brenner exclaimed.<br><br>"Hey," one of the GIs laughed, "Brenner's a Mormon, too."<br><br>"Brudder Hall!" the German said with a big smile. Brenner embraced the German solider as a brother in the gospel, thankful that for once he had missed every shot. (From Brenner Hall video interview in DVD and VHS versions of <i>Saints at War</i> [American Fork, Utah: Covenant Communications, 2001].)<br><br>The final principle I would like to illustrate is the Lord's desire to establish the Church through our individual efforts (see D&amp;amp;C 31:7).<br><br>One characteristic of our LDS servicemen has been their desire to share the gospel with their comrades.<br><br>One of the more creative examples was that of Roland Wright, a fighter pilot in World War II. He named his plane <i>The Mormon Mustang</i> in an attempt to create interest in the Church.<br><br>Stan Shultz used a similar approach during the Vietnam War. When assigned a Jeep for his use, Stan discovered it covered with graffiti. After painting over the crude words and phrases, Brother Shultz decided to rename his Jeep after the brother of Jared. It was his effort to create opportunities to discuss the gospel.<br><br>Wherever the LDS servicemen went, they organized units of the Church. They often met in the open or in buildings provided by the military. When occasion permitted, they even built their own chapels. While simple, the first LDS chapel built in Korea served the purposes of the LDS troops stationed nearby.<br><br>Even on the deck of a battleship in World War II, LDS sailors managed to hold a sacrament meeting. On the USS <i>Cambria</i> in 1944, John A. Larsen was the presiding group leader.<br><br>In addition to these activities, member servicemen also organized choirs, produced newsletters, and made every effort to provide a Church experience even in the most difficult situations. By establishing the Church in such difficult settings, they wove in the silver thread that proved to be a crucial lifeline for those seeking the truth in a time of darkness.<br><br>Virgil N. Kovalenko was a U.S. officer assigned as a consultant to the Vietnamese air force. During much of his tour of duty he also served as the president of an LDS servicemen's branch.<br><br>He related how he was able to establish the Church in his assignment by responding to a member referral card sent by a wife who desired her husband to join the Church. Virgil told of his gospel discussion with John Parr. Following the discussion, his new friend walked Virgil home:<br><br><i>As we went inside the Spirit told me, "You need to close this day with prayer." So I said, "John, would you mind if we end the day with prayer?" . . .</i><br><br><i>We knelt down on the cold concrete floor . . . and I asked him if he would mind saying the prayer, which he did. At the end of that prayer . . . we shook hands and embraced. And just as he was going out I said, "Well, John, you've heard the truth tonight. Your spirit has heard the testimony of the Holy Ghost."</i><br><br><i>He looked me right in the eye and said, "Yes. I know."</i><br><br><i>I said, "Well, that means then that you're responsible for what you've heard and you have to make a decision, don't you?"</i><br><br><i>He said, "Yep. I'll let you know."</i><br><br><i></i>John called a week later and said he wanted to be baptized. A baptism was arranged for the base swimming pool for Saturday morning at 6:00 a.m. Afterward he received the Aaronic Priesthood and was able to pass the sacrament the next day. He did not tell his family, preferring to wait until he saw them when he met them in Hawaii for R&amp;amp;R (rest and recuperation).<br><br><i>On the Sunday that John arrived, his wife heard noises</i> <i>in the kitchen and went out to see her husband dressed in a suit and tie, . . . fixing himself some breakfast. She was used to him sleeping in on Sunday and then watching football all day while she took the children to </i>[church].<i> She asked him where he was going. He replied, "Where else should I go on a Sunday morning? I'm going to priesthood."</i><br><br>He then explained that he had been baptized in Vietnam and now wanted to prepare to take her and their young son to the temple. (From Robert C. Freeman and Dennis A. Wright, <i>Saints at War: Korea and Vietnam</i> [American Fork, Utah: Covenant Communications, 2003), 347, 350–51.)<br><br>John D. Russell, a World War II army paratrooper, told of another effort to establish the Church. One time during some extremely hard fighting, John curled up in a foxhole trying to get some sleep. Two soldiers nearby asked him if he wanted to join them for church. He was dumbfounded that these two rough, tough guys would even mention church at a time like this. They spoke with sincerity and in terms that really touched him. John watched as they broke up K-ration crackers into pieces and put them in a helmet. They then said a prayer and passed the helmet, each taking a piece of cracker. John followed their example. Then they passed around a canteen after saying another prayer, and they all took a drink. Following this they took turns sharing how they felt about their faith. John tried, unsuccessfully, to fight back tears even though he knew little about their religion.<br><br>When the war ended, John returned to Council, Idaho, where he met a young girl named Betty. They dated for a couple of weeks. Betty invited John to her church, and he accepted, not knowing which church she attended. During the meeting he watched two young men administer the sacrament. He recognized the Spirit that came over him and knew that this was what he had felt in the foxhole in Europe.<br><br>"What church is this?" he asked. "I want to know more!"<br><br>He joined the Church, and he and Betty were married and sealed in the temple.<br><br>"How grateful I am," he declared, "for those young men who invited me to my first sacrament meeting in that foxhole so far away." (John D. Russell, interviewed by the author, in <i>Saints at War</i> archive, L. Tom Perry Special Collections, Harold B. Lee Library, BYU; see also <i>Saints at War: Experiences of Latter-day Saints in World War II,</i> 2001, 175–76.)<br><br>A horrible scene unfolded at the end of the Vietnam War. About 250 Vietnamese nationals such as Brother Thach and his family had joined the Church.<br><br>What hope did the members of the Church have as the North Vietnamese army swept southward over their homeland? They could not turn to their American allies for help because they had fled the land, leaving the members to an awful fate. The president of the Saigon branch, The Van Nguyen, wrote of this moment:<br><br><i>On Sunday, April 27, 1975, with the enemy at our very gates, members of the Saigon branch met to discuss our collective fates. Cut off by the war from our lines of Church authority, we were afraid and felt utterly helpless. We reverently and humbly bowed our heads for opening prayer and then sang "Come, Come, Ye Saints" from the depths of our souls. Our tiny branch, so far away from the main body of the church, conducted its own funeral. . . . As we drew together at this perilous moment, we only knew that each of us, in addition to the gospel, had one thing in common: life as we knew it was over. . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . As the highest ranking Church leader residing in Vietnam, my job was to effect the evacuation of as many branch members as possible--hopefully all of them--before Saigon fell. Even though my feelings of inadequacy nearly overwhelmed me, I was determined to do all I could to ensure the safety of those who had embraced the gospel in Vietnam. I could only place my trust in the Lord to help me do the right thing.</i><br><br><i>While the sacrament was blessed and passed, I could not help but reflect back on the events in my life that brought me to this awful crisis. I paused in the serenity of the sacrament to ponder my unenviable situation. In a long moment of self-pity, I tried to say in my heart, "All is well, all is well," but instead I recalled the words of the Savior as He hung upon the cross: "My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?"</i> [Personal account of The Van Nguyen in The Van Nguyen and David L. Hughes, "The Saigon Shepherd and the Scattered Flock," unpublished manuscript, 11–12; in <i>Saints at War</i> archive, L. Tom Perry Special Collections, Harold B. Lee Library, BYU; see also The Van Nguyen and David L. Hughes, <i>When Faith Endures: One Man's Courage in the Midst of War</i> (American Fork, Utah: Covenant Communications, 2004), 1–18]<br><br>In the years that followed, the Vietnamese members of the Church were unable to practice their religion. Some fled their homeland while others quietly endured. However, the story does not end here. Following the end of the war, a group of American servicemen organized an effort to identify and assist the scattered Vietnamese members of the Church. These valiant Latter-day Saint veterans helped many members reestablish contact with the Church and in some cases find refuge in other countries. President The Van Nguyen and some of the members of his branch now live in the United States, free to enjoy their membership in the Church. Other members still in Vietnam have recently organized branches of the Church there. It is no surprise that President Hinckley has returned to Vietnam and met with the emerging membership there.<br><br>This effort to establish the Church has continued in the conflicts of the present day. The silver thread still winds its way through the crimson tapestry of war as LDS servicemen exercise their faith in present conflicts around the world. These faithful young men listen to the spirit that leads them to do good and are successful in establishing units of the Church wherever they serve.<br><br>Recent Church activity in Afghanistan is evidence of this effort in our present conflict. A young marine corporal accepted baptism there after hearing the gospel from a friend while stationed at a remote firebase.<br><br>In conclusion I would like to express my gratitude for the privilege to address you. I am strengthened by your faith and awed by the responsibility that is yours. You will live in a period of time characterized by wars and rumors of wars. I pray that, like the young Latter-day Saint servicemen we have talked about today, you will stand firm in your faith and hearken to the spirit that will lead you to do good. Remember it is by your hands that the Lord will establish His Church throughout the earth.<br><br>While it is true that you may not be called to the battlefront, the Lord will have need of your faith in the difficult times we will face in the last days. It is your heritage to weave the silver thread through these challenging times and, by doing so, bring hope to our Father's children. The Lord has uniquely prepared you, like others before you, for this, your finest hour. May the Lord bless you to be true to your divine appointment.<br><br>I wish to now stand as a witness of the reality of the only true and living Church, restored by the Prophet Joseph Smith to prepare the world for the glorious Second Coming of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ. I invite you to stand with me in this witness, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Dennis A.

<br>
Look above you and you will see the massive beams of the Marriott Center roof structure. This collection of steel beams weighs over 4,000,000 pounds. We occupy the building today with no fear that the roof will collapse, because it was designed by licensed engineers. The chief engineer was BYU professor Arnold Wilson. His job was to analyze how much force each beam would carry and then design the beams to be large enough to bear the force. When completed in 1972, the Marriott Center was the nation's largest on-campus basketball arena. It seats more than 23,000 people--definitely overkill for today's devotional assembly. The roof is 340 feet wide and 380 feet long--big enough to cover four Salt Lake Tabernacles. The distance from the playing floor to the top of the roof is the height of a 10-story building. Some of those steel beams sustain forces of up to 2,000,000 pounds.<br><br>The statistic that astonishes me most, however, is the number <i>one.</i> That's how many basic engineering principles Dr. Wilson said he relied on in designing this large structure. Think of it! One basic principle. If you are interested, the basic principle I refer to states that the forces acting on any part of a structure must sum to zero.<br><br>That principle, though easily stated, takes years to master. Engineering students are introduced to it in their freshman year, and they learn to apply it to simplified problems. In later courses they learn how to use the principle in a wide variety of real-world situations. They grow confident in their own ability to successfully apply it to design any structure. When confronted with a new, unfamiliar problem, they instinctively resort to that basic principle. They know that to ignore or violate it when designing an actual building could imperil themselves and others who will occupy the building. They enjoy the satisfaction of acquiring a skill with which they can serve mankind.<br><br>Many parallels can be drawn between this basic engineering principle and the basic gospel principle of faith. Faith is so simple a concept that a child can understand and practice it. As our lives unfold we learn how to apply the principle of faith to an ever-broadening range of experiences. Our confidence in the principle of faith grows, along with our confidence in our own ability to exercise faith. When challenges arise, we learn to instinctively rely on the principle of faith for guidance and strength. To ignore or violate the principle of faith will hamper our own progression and diminish our spiritual influence on others. The mastering of faith gives us joy as we become more effective instruments in doing the Lord's work.<br><br>In one of the first devotional addresses I attended in this building as a BYU student, Elder Gordon B. Hinckley spoke on the topic of faith. He said:<br><br><i>If there is any one thing you and I need in this world it is faith, that dynamic, powerful, marvelous element by which, as Paul declared, the very worlds were framed (Hebrews 11:3). We need it in our studies. We all know that university work, as it is structured, is a grind. Our academic pursuits are spoken of as disciplines, and so they are. But somewhere out there for you seniors and away out there for you freshmen is a field to be cultivated, and you are here today to learn to use the necessary tools. </i>[Gordon B. Hinckley, "<a href="https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/gordon-b-hinckley_god-shall-give-unto-knowledge-holy-spirit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">God Shall Give unto You Knowledge by His Holy Spirit</a>," <i>Speeches of the Year, 1973</i> (Provo: Brigham Young University, 1974, 109]<br><br>The new guidebook for missionaries, entitled <i>"Preach My Gospel,"</i> reads:<br><br><i>Faith is a principle of power. God works by power, but His power is usually exercised in response to faith. . . .</i><br><br><i>Your faith will increase through diligent study, prayer, dedicated service, and obedience to the promptings of the Holy Ghost and the commandments.</i> [<i>"Preach My Gospel" (D&amp;amp;C 50:14): A Guide to Missionary Service</i> (Salt Lake City: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 2004), 116]<br><br>I will now elaborate on these five ways whereby we can increase our faith and will point out how each of these activities can bring rich joy into our lives.<br><h2><b>Diligent Study</b></h2><br>First, faith is strengthened through diligent study of both the scriptures and the teachings of Church leaders. Study that is diligent invites the companionship of the Holy Ghost, and the Lord told Adam that when we have the Holy Ghost with us, we can and should "enjoy the words of eternal life" (Moses 6:59).<br><br>Nephi enjoyed the words of eternal life. He said, "My soul delighteth in the scriptures . . . ; and my heart pondereth continually upon the things which I have seen and heard" (2 Nephi 4:15–16).<br><br>One way that diligent scripture study can help us to enjoy the words of eternal life is by providing a private setting in which the Spirit can gently point out our weaknesses and strengthen us (see Ether 12:27). In the Lord's preface to the Doctrine and Covenants, He declared:<br><br><i>These commandments are of me, and were given unto my servants in their weakness. . . .</i><br><br><i>And inasmuch as they erred it might be made known;</i><br><br><i>And inasmuch as they sought wisdom they might be instructed;</i><br><br><i>And inasmuch as they sinned they might be chastened, that they might repent;</i><br><br><i>And inasmuch as they were humble they might be made strong, and blessed from on high, and receive knowledge from time to time.</i> [D&amp;amp;C 1:24–28]<br><br>Another way the Spirit helps us enjoy the words of eternal life is by simply teaching what the words mean.<br><br>My wife and I taught our then two-year-old son and three-year-old daughter to recite by heart Matthew 5:9. One day the children got into an argument that escalated into a fight. Sensing a teaching moment, I asked, "Now children, what does Matthew 5:9 say?"<br><br>They both recited, "Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called the children of God."<br><br>I then asked, "And what does a peacemaker do?"<br><br>They looked at me with puzzled expressions, and finally the two-year-old ventured, "Make pieces of gingerbread?"<br><br>I gave my children a simple definition of <i>peacemaker,</i> but I realize now that my own understanding of the word is growing.<br><br>For example, it is written of King Benjamin that<br><br><i>he had somewhat of contentions among his own people. . . .</i><br><br><i>For behold, king Benjamin was a holy man, and he did reign over his people in righteousness; and . . . did speak the word of God with power and with authority. . . .</i><br><br><i>Wherefore . . . king Benjamin, by laboring with all the might of his body and the faculty of his whole soul, . . . did once more establish peace in the land.</i> [Words of Mormon 1:12, 17–18]<br><br>When I ponder this, or when I reflect on the Prince of Peace, I realize that the concept symbolized by the word <i>peacemaker</i> is far deeper than I currently understand. Diligent study, aided by the Spirit, will broaden our understanding of specific words of eternal life such as <i>peacemaker</i> or <i>faith.</i> It will etch them in our hearts.<br><br>Another aspect to enjoying the words of eternal life is the promise that if we will "treasure up" the scriptures in our minds, "it shall be given" us in the very moment what we shall say (D&amp;amp;C 84:85). Years ago one of our family home evenings got off to a rough start. A young son was playing with a pencil, and it flew out of his hand, striking a sibling in the face. Immediately the whole family chastised the boy. Didn't he know he could put someone's eye out? What a foolish act. How thoughtless.<br><br>At that moment a scripture popped into my mind. I scooped the little boy up in my arms and said, "Okay, everyone. We have reproved with sharpness. The scriptures tell us that now we need to show forth an increase of love" (see D&amp;amp;C 121:43).<br><br>The Spirit quickly returned to our family home evening, and my son snuggled up to me. That night my wife tucked the boy into bed. He looked up at her and said, "Mom, do you know what my favorite month is?"<br><br>She said, "December? Because of Christmas?"<br><br>"No."<br><br>"How about July, because it's your birthday?"<br><br>He answered, "No, it's August, because that's Dad's birthday."<br><br>Great enjoyment of the words of eternal life comes when we use them to serve others.<br><h2><b>Prayer</b></h2><br>Second, we can increase our faith through prayer.<br><br>Several years ago I had a student from Kyrgyzstan and a visiting professor from China. We worked for over two years on a challenging and, for us, important research problem. We made good progress the first year, but then we hit a wall. For the entire second year we looked at the problem from every angle and focused all of our combined mental exertion on the problem; yet it refused to yield.<br><br>One evening as I drove to campus to work with my colleagues, I wondered if we ought to give up on the problem. I felt mentally exhausted, and the thought of yet again grappling with the problem seemed pointless. We desperately needed help! We needed the Lord's help. So when I got to my office, I suggested that we begin with a prayer, which we did. We then rolled up our sleeves and worked hard on the problem for several hours. As we worked, a few small but promising insights occurred. I felt encouraged, and as we were leaving for the night, I enthusiastically remarked that it had been a very fruitful evening. We had made more progress than we had in a long time. My Kyrgyz student quickly reminded me, "Of course, Tom, it was because of the prayer."<br><br>We decided that from then on we would begin each research session with a prayer. My colleagues also took their turns, even though prayer was not a part of their respective backgrounds. Within a few weeks an astonishingly simple and elegant solution to our problem emerged. We were filled with joy and amazement.<br><br>In that devotional President Hinckley taught:<br><br><i>This is one university where students can be told that faith--the kind of faith that moves one to get on his knees and plead with the Lord and then get on his feet and go to work--is an asset beyond compare, even in the acquisition of secular knowledge. I do not minimize the need for study and labor. I would add to these faith and prayer, with the sacred promise that "God shall give unto you knowledge by his Holy Spirit, yea, by the unspeakable gift of the Holy Ghost."</i> [Hinckley, "God Shall Give," 109]<br><h2><b>Dedicated Service</b></h2><br>Third, dedicated service strengthens faith.<br><br>The Prophet Joseph gave us an intriguing glimpse into a time that predates even the Council in Heaven:<br><br><i>God himself, finding he was in the midst of spirits and glory, because he was more intelligent, saw proper to institute laws whereby the rest could have a privilege to advance like himself.</i> [<i>Teachings, </i>354]<br><br>The Book of Mormon says of the Savior:<br><br><i>He doeth not anything save it be for the benefit of the world; for he loveth the world, even that he layeth down his own life that he may draw all men unto him. Wherefore, he commandeth none that they shall not partake of his salvation.</i> [2 Nephi 26:24]<br><br>Notice how those two statements beautifully support the following teaching of President Marion G. Romney:<br><br><i>Service is not something we endure on this earth so we can earn the right to live in the celestial kingdom. Service is the very fiber of which an exalted life in the celestial kingdom is made.</i><br><br><i>. . . Oh, for the glorious day when these things all come naturally because of the purity of our hearts. In that day there will be no need for a commandment because we will have experienced for ourselves that we are truly happy only when we are engaged in unselfish service.</i> [Marion G. Romney, "<a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/1982/10/the-celestial-nature-of-self-reliance?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Celestial Nature of Self-Reliance</a>," <i>Ensign, </i>November 1982, 93]<br><br>In a 1995 BYU devotional address, President Hinckley counseled:<br><br><i>I know that you are engrossed with your studies. This is important, but in a sense it is a selfish pursuit. Take a little time, now and again, to reach out to help others--there are those right around you, students in need of a little kindness, a little attention, a little appreciation. You who are extremely able, you who learn with comparative ease, reach down to those who have greater difficulty in mastering academic material that is relatively easy for you. In so doing you will bless your own life as you bless the lives of those you help. A little tutoring can do wonders for someone who does not quite comprehend. It will do wonders for you as you give of yourself and your knowledge to bless another.</i> [Gordon B. Hinckley, "<a href="https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/gordon-b-hinckley_man-done-church-expects-us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">To a Man Who Has Done What This Church Expects of Each of Us</a>," <i>BYU 1995–96 Speeches</i> (Provo: BYU, 1996), 54]<br><h2><b>Obedience to the Commandments</b></h2><br>Fourth, obedience to the commandments strengthens faith.<br><br>You are now at an age when you face some of life's most important decisions. An invaluable gospel principle for you is that obedience invites the guidance of the Lord. Nephi learned through experience that the pointers on the Liahona worked "according to the faith and diligence and heed which [he gave] unto them," and the writing on the Liahona "changed from time to time, according to the faith and diligence which [they] gave unto it" (1 Nephi 16:28–29).<br><br>Using a different metaphor, the Lord reiterated to Nephi the connection between obedience and guidance:<br><br><i>And I will also be your light in the wilderness; and I will prepare the way before you, if it so be that ye shall keep my commandments; wherefore, inasmuch as ye shall keep my commandments ye shall be led towards the promised land; and ye shall know that it is by me that ye are led.</i> [1 Nephi 17:13]<br><br>Joseph Smith put it this way:<br><br><i>God has created man with a mind capable of instruction, and a faculty which may be enlarged in proportion to the heed and diligence given to the light communicated from heaven to the intellect; and that the nearer man approaches perfection, the clearer are his views, and the greater his enjoyments.</i> [<i>Teachings,</i> 51]<br><br>While obedience to the commandments strengthens faith, disobedience diminishes faith, for the Lord declared, "That wicked one cometh and taketh away light and truth, through disobedience, from the children of men" (D&amp;amp;C 93:39). The Internet is a powerful technology that can greatly assist us in fulfilling gospel responsibilities such as family history work. On the other hand, when misused, it can be highly destructive of faith. A worrisome statistic is that currently 58 of the top 100 most common Internet search terms--the words we type into Google--are pornographic (see wordtracker.com).<br><br>When Henry Eyring's father crossed the border from the Mexican colonies to the United States, the customs man asked him, "Son, do you have any pornography in your suitcase or trunks?"<br><br>He responded, "No sir, we don't even own a pornograph." (In Vaughn J. Featherstone, "<a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/1999/10/one-link-still-holds?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">One Link Still Holds</a>," <i>Ensign,</i> November 1999, 13–14.)<br><br>People who do use a "pornograph," be it desktop or laptop, are sampling the river of filthiness spoken of in Lehi's dream. Interestingly, Lehi described the rod of iron as extending along the very banks of the river of filthiness. Thus, in Lehi's dream, the rod of iron and river of filthiness are in close proximity. The Internet has narrowed that distance. The two are now separated by a mere mouse click.<br><br>Feel the power with which Nephi encouraged his brothers:<br><br><i>And they said unto me: What meaneth the rod of iron which our father saw, that led to the tree?</i><br><br><i>And I said unto them that it was the word of God; and whoso would hearken unto the word of God, and would hold fast unto it, they would never perish; neither could the temptations and the fiery darts of the adversary overpower them unto blindness, to lead them away to destruction.</i><br><br><i>Wherefore, I, Nephi, did exhort them to give heed unto the word of the Lord; yea, I did exhort them with all the energies of my soul, and with all the faculty which I possessed, that they would give heed to the word of God and remember to keep his commandments always in all things.</i> [1 Nephi 15:23–25]<br><h2><b>Obedience to the Promptings of the Holy Ghost</b></h2><br>Fifth, obedience to the promptings of the Holy Ghost strengthens faith.<br><br>My mother and I are converts to the Church, and we worked together diligently for many years on our genealogy. Our ancestors emigrated from Scandinavia three or four generations ago. My mother and I had compiled a record of our American-born ancestors, but we failed in repeated attempts to find birth records of any Scandinavian-born ancestors. As a BYU student I drove several times to the Church's Family History Library in Salt Lake City--but to no avail.<br><br>As I began my final year as a BYU student, I registered for a full load of classes. On the first day of the semester I was walking up the stairs in the Clyde Building when I felt a clear impression that I should drop one of my classes. I also felt an assurance that if I would devote the time that I would have spent in that class to doing genealogy, the Lord would bless me with success.<br><br>So I dropped the class, and a few days later a Norwegian-born friend and I drove to Salt Lake City. We spent several fruitless hours studying microfilms of Norwegian church records, then took a break for supper. As we returned from supper I felt an anticipatory thrill, and within a few minutes of searching a microfilm, the marriage record of my great-great-grandparents, Ole and Agathe Fladebo, seemed to jump off the screen at us. Once that discovery was made, it was relatively easy to find birth records for them and their parents and grandparents.<br><br>For the rest of that year I spent 12 hours each week in the Salt Lake City Family History Library--the amount of time I would have spent on the class I had dropped. I found the records of all 16 of my great-great-grandparents, plus hundreds of their ancestors. Those of you who have felt the sweet spirit that comes from searching in solitude for your ancestors will appreciate how profoundly my faith was nurtured by this experience--the result of obeying a prompting of the Holy Ghost.<br><br>In the Doctrine and Covenants the Lord instructed:<br><br><i>Put your trust in that Spirit which leadeth to do good--yea, to do justly, to walk humbly, to judge righteously; and this is my Spirit.</i><br><br><i>Verily, verily, I say unto you, I will impart unto you of my Spirit, which shall enlighten your mind, which shall fill your soul with joy;</i><br><br><i>And . . . by this shall you know, all things whatsoever you desire of me. </i>[D&amp;amp;C 11:12–14]<br><br>We have now discussed five ways to increase our faith: diligent study, prayer, dedicated service, obedience to the commandments, and obedience to the promptings of the Holy Ghost. We have observed how each of these five activities leads to joy. We have overlooked a most profound source of joy.<br><br>One night many years ago, my wife and I were sleeping soundly when our then five-year-old son, Timothy, entered our bedroom and proclaimed, "Wake up, everybody! Wake up! I've got good news! I thought I was smoking a cigarette, and then I woke up and realized it was only a dream!" We hugged Timmy, sent him back to bed, and have cherished this tender incident ever since.<br><br>A few months ago I asked Tim if he remembered that dream. He answered that the dream was one of the most poignant of his life, and he still remembered it vividly, even though 13 years had elapsed. He then filled in some details. In his five-year-old mind he was walking in front of our house when he saw a lighted cigarette on the ground. Even though he knew better, he inexplicably picked up the cigarette and took a few puffs. He immediately felt bad about it and went inside to confess his misdeed to his mother. In this surreal dream his mom cried out in bitter anguish, "Oh, Timmy! You have broken a commandment! Now there is no way for you to return to Heavenly Father's presence!" In his dream Timmy ran over to the kitchen sink and frantically washed his mouth. But he discovered to his horror that there was nothing he could do to erase the fact that he had transgressed and was therefore cut off eternally from the presence of God.<br><br>In his dream Timmy had experienced an imaginary world in which the Atonement did not exist, and he discovered it to be a nightmare of indescribable horror. Little wonder that when he awoke and discovered that it was merely a very bad dream, he simply had to share his good news with his parents, even though it was two in the morning. I imagine he must have felt like shouting his good news to the world! In fact, just last month, Elder Timothy Sederberg began his mission to declare "the good news" to the people of the Dominican Republic.<br><br>The angel asked Nephi:<br><br><i>Knowest thou the meaning of the tree which thy father saw?</i><br><br><i>And</i> [Nephi] <i>answered him, saying: Yea, it is the love of God, which sheddeth itself abroad in the hearts of the children of men; wherefore, it is the most desirable above all things.</i><br><br><i>And</i> [the angel] <i>spake unto</i> [Nephi], <i>saying: Yea, and the most joyous to the soul.</i> [1 Nephi 11:21–23]<br><br>Elder Neal A. Maxwell taught, "To partake of the love of God is to partake of Jesus' Atonement and the emancipations and joys which it can bring" ("<a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/1999/10/lessons-from-laman-and-lemuel?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lessons from Laman and Lemuel</a>," <i>Ensign,</i> November 1999, 8).<br><br>May you find an ever-deepening joy as your understanding of the glorious truths of the gospel expands; as you build your faith through study, prayer, service, and obedience; and as you press forward in faith to draw nearer to the Savior and partake of His love. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Thomas W. Sederberg was a professor of computer science when this devotional address was given on 29 March 2005.</i><br><br><i>© Brigham Young University.

<h1>Our Homes, Renew Our Powers - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I love the Book of Mormon! I first read it from cover to cover the summer I turned 13. There was a lot I didn't understand, but I remember distinctly that I did not enjoy the descriptions about the wars. Since then I have read the book many times. Usually I have skimmed the parts about the wars, especially the lengthy section in the last 20 chapters of Alma. I have wondered, "Why does someone like me need to know all this detail about the wars between the Lamanites and Nephites?"<br><br>This past year as I taught Sunday School to the 16- and 17-year-olds, we came once again to Mormon's account of these fierce wars. This time when I studied, I came across <i>Mormon's Map</i> by BYU professor emeritus John Sorenson and decided to follow Mormon's descriptions of the geography of the wars.<sup>1</sup> As I did so, I noticed several important patterns:<br><br>First, the battles were between people who were either for or against the kingdom of God.<br><br>Second, the enemy attacked the edges before the main center of Zarahemla was finally captured.<br><br>Third, the attacks were unrelenting over a period of time.<br><br>Fourth, dissenters from within the Nephites were most effective in helping the enemies succeed.<br><br>Fifth, and finally, the attacks initially gave the Nephites a cause, but eventually they lost sight of their goals.<br><br>Why did Mormon include this long history of warfare at this important time just before the Savior's birth and subsequent appearance on the American continent? I believe one reason is to help us recognize the "war" we are waging today--once again just before the coming of the Savior. When the invitation was extended to speak at a devotional, I knew exactly what I wanted to talk about.<br><br>Today I would like to talk about the war we are waging to defend our homes. Our social fabric has been attacked around the edges, and now it is moving to the center--our homes! I'll use Moroni's strategies of preparing places of security to suggest ways to protect our homes and renew our powers today. But before we talk about how we will defend our homes, I would first like to describe the battle as I see it and what I mean by <i>home.</i><br><h2><b>The War We Are Waging</b></h2><br>How are our homes and families being attacked at the edges? We are experiencing unprecedented prosperity and access to information, travel, and communication. In most ways these advances are blessings, and we surely would not want to return to the way people used to experience everyday life. An example of the home-front battles that were fought in the early days of the Church is found in Ann Howell Burt's journal. Sister Burt emigrated from Wales, married, and lived in a dugout in the summer of 1863. As a young mother she had to work hard to keep order and see to the needs of her family. She recorded in her journal:<br><br><i>For several mornings I was puzzled to find my milk-pan skimmed. . . . So the other evening I sat down behind the door, with my knitting, to watch proceedings, and what was my surprise to see a huge bull-snake come crawling out from the head of our bed and swaying gracefully toward my crude cupboard . . . to skim my cream.</i><br><br><i>Now I cover my milk tightly.</i><sup>2</sup><br><br>Personally, I think I would have done more than cover my milk, and maybe she did, but this was just one of many episodes during that summer. Her journal continues:<br><br><i>This is a hideous place. Some days ago, I killed a rattlesnake with my rolling pin, as he came crawling down the steps. I was just cooking supper and the baby was on the floor or rather the ground. . . . I was badly frightened. . . . </i><br><br><i>. . . A few days ago, while keeping the flies off the baby's face as he slept . . . , I discovered . . . a large tarantula crawling toward the child. I seized the broomstick, thrust the end of it at the tarantula and when it took hold . . . I hurriedly put it into the fire.</i><sup>3</sup><br><br>We usually don't have to worry about actual tarantulas and snakes invading our houses; instead, we have even more dangerous influences threatening us. Unlike Sister Burt's invaders, our tarantulas and snakes are moral ones, and they are ever so subtle. Our modern advances have brought us the Internet; TV; DVDs; the erosion of marriage through divorce, cohabitation, same-sex marriage, and abortion; the difficulty of holding family mealtimes; the clothing we wear; our cultural disdain for household work; and changing roles for mothers and fathers. It would be nice if we could beat these invaders back with rolling pins and broomsticks, but literally it's not possible--and figuratively we've lost many of our rolling pins and brooms. Let me explain.<br><br>In 2005 it is normal to hear young women describe their goals for the future in terms of exciting careers they plan to pursue. These girls most likely also desire to be wives and mothers, but today it seems more appropriate to announce career goals first. Although we value these opportunities for women, motherhood and homemaking suffer. Mothering and creating homes are knitted tightly together, but in recent years they have disappeared from American society as natural and valued pathways for women. Instead the message seems to be that if mothers have access to modern conveniences to care for their homes and families, then they should be free to seek their own fulfillment. Women and men often end up in conflict over the seemingly burdensome work in the home because they want to pursue personal interests and activities. Home is often erroneously considered a place from which women need to break free. Some ideologies would have women think that home duties limit their full potential, and women <i>and</i> men are tempted to disregard the important, everyday aspects of homelife--thus the loss of our rolling pins and brooms.<br><br>Modern conveniences <i>have</i> delivered us from the days of dugouts, chamber pots, smoke, fleas, mud, rattlesnakes, and tarantulas, but at the same time, American homelife is in a state of decline. Author Cheryl Mendelson explains:<br><br><i>Homes today often seem to operate on an ad hoc basis. Washday is any time anyone throws a load into the machine. . . . Meals occur any time or all the time or . . . never. . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . Many people lead deprived lives in houses filled with material luxury. . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . As people turn more and more to outside institutions to have their</i> [everyday] <i>needs met . . . ,</i> [our] <i>skills and expectations . . . diminish, in turn decreasing the chance that people's homes can satisfy their needs. The result is far too many people who long for home even though they seem to have one.</i><sup>4</sup><br><br>Elder L. Tom Perry reminds us:<br><br><i>We need to make our homes a place of refuge from the storm. . . . Even if the smallest openings are left unattended, negative influences can penetrate the very walls of our homes.</i><sup>5</sup><br><br>Today it seems that we live in houses without walls--or at least walls that offer protection from the outside world as our own types of tarantulas and snakes enter into our bedrooms, kitchens, and living rooms.<sup>6</sup><br><br>In general conference 25 years ago, President Spencer W. Kimball warned:<br><br><i>Many of the social restraints which in the past have helped to reinforce and to shore up the family are dissolving and disappearing. The time will come when only those who believe deeply and actively in the family will be able to preserve their families in the midst of the gathering evil around us.</i><sup>7</sup><br><br>It is clear that social restraints that have helped reinforce family life are eroding and creating openings that devalue and dismiss precious time and activities in our homes. One study of 32 families in Los Angeles showed that in several of the homes the whole family was <i>never</i> in the same room during the entire observation period. On average the rest of the families gathered in the same room just 16 percent of the time.<sup>8</sup><br><br>This is your day. The battle for your homes is real. To preserve your family you will need to believe deeply and actively in family life in the home and take action.<br><br>When I talk about home, I am talking to every person present, because we all create a home for ourselves. Home is not only something in the far distant future or a place you are from. There are many different ideas about what home is. Family researcher Sarah Allen suggests that home is a geographic center (1) where you have feelings of comfort, familiarity, and safety; (2) where meaningful people and things meet; (3) where significant events, memories, and routines take place; (4) where you develop specific knowledge, such as where to shop and find a bank or what sounds at night are normal; and (5) home is a space that "fits" with who you think you are and meets your expectations for a home place.<sup>9</sup> Where you live right now could qualify as home, and you can begin now to value it and form habits to help you create the home of your dreams. I challenge you to do something today to make your current home a place of comfort where you can enjoy meaningful people and events.<br><h2><b>Making Home a Sacred Center</b></h2><br>You are a remarkable group of young people. Some of you will be leaving BYU in the next weeks and months and begin in earnest to create your homes. You will create a home that is unique. I hope you will withstand the attacks of the adversary and defend the sacred time and activities inside your homes. Let me suggest how you can apply Moroni's strategies of preparing places of security to successfully defend your homes and progress toward your eternal goals.<br><br>First, like Moroni, dig a deep ditch and pile up ridges of dirt around your home as you dig deep to discover and preserve the sacred nature of your home and its purposes. In the Bible Dictionary we read, "Only the home can compare with the temple in sacredness."<sup>10</sup> If our homes compare to the temple, what is it about the home that makes it sacred? Listen to the dictionary meaning of "sacred": "belonging to or dedicated to God; worthy of reverence; set apart for or dedicated to some person, object, or purpose; that [which] must not be violated or disregarded; properly immune, as from violence or interference."<sup>11</sup><br><br>Apply this idea of sacred to everyday activities in your home such as mealtime, prayer, scripture study, music, caring for your home and yard, recreation, laundry, and everything else that takes place in and around your home. These activities have purpose and must not be disregarded or interfered with, because the home setting gives us opportunities to develop and practice character virtues and ethical behavior. Families can learn about moral truths and practice honesty, patience, brotherly kindness, and charity in their daily interactions. The settings of everyday work and recreation in the home provide rich contexts for children and adults to make choices and practice. For example, a child, spouse, or even a roommate may choose to contribute in the home by seeing what needs to be done and doing it happily. Or they may wait to be asked and then complain about the inconvenience.<br><br>Everyday events in our home can seem so simple that we overlook the importance of them--like the children of Israel who were smitten by a plague of snakes. To be healed they just had to <i>look </i>at the serpent of brass on a pole (see Numbers 21:8–9), but because it was so simple, many did not do it. In 1 Nephi 17:41 we read, "Because of the simpleness of the way, or the easiness of it, there were many who perished." Everyday activities in our homes may be simple, but because they are simple, frequent, and repeated they offer important opportunities to build individuals and families. Begin now to form habits of recognizing the sacred nature of everyday life. You don't need to wait until you have children or make mortgage payments.<br><br>I'll illustrate with the example of mealtime. Our modern technological age has created a speeded up sense of time, and everything we do seems accelerated--what we do, good or bad, can be done faster, easier, and cheaper. For example, it is easier for us individually to graze in our kitchens, dine from our dashboards, or go to the nearest restaurant for a quick meal rather than go to the trouble of preparing a meal and sitting down together. According to Tom Van Aman, executive vice president for Retail Measurement Product Management at Information Resources, Inc., in Chicago, "Meal preparation time dropped from three hours per day in 1960 to twenty minutes in 1998."<sup>12</sup> Author Jean Zimmerman comments, "Americans [seem to have] bought the argument that we no longer have time to cook--and, even if we did have time, it was drudgery we'd rather avoid in preference of leisure activities."<sup>13</sup><br><br>What are we rushing off to? PlayStation, movies, Internet? Jean Zimmerman also says:<br><br><i>Dispatching the pleasures of cooking good</i> <i>food in order to slay dragons on EverQuest.com seems not that rewarding a trade-off. . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . We buy an illusion of taste, an illusion of satisfaction, an illusion of comfort, an illusion of nutrition and health.</i><br><br><i>. . . We've trained our taste buds to savor fat and salt and chemical additives, synthetic flavors.</i><sup>14</sup><br><br>Besides good food, family meals have numerous beneficial effects. Evidence suggests that family meals with parents present contribute to better nutritive intake,<sup>15</sup> fewer psychological problems, and less risky or self-destructive behaviors.<sup>16</sup> Family meals in a positive environment also play an important role in preventing unhealthy weight-control practices.<sup>17</sup> One researcher suggests that it appears to be more promising to establish rituals of meal preparation and eating than to provide cognitive knowledge of nutrition.<sup>18</sup><br><br>Besides the physical benefits of family meals, the simple domestic act of creating a meal and enjoying it together is an important connector. But, as described in her book <i>Made from Scratch,</i> Jean Zimmerman was asked whether we could "bond equally well over a juicy Whopper as with a home-cooked meal." She answered, "The rewards of the experience are not the same."<sup>19</sup><br><br>The Stapp family in Alpine makes mealtime a daily event. Everyone participates, and "What's for dinner?" is an exciting part of the day. Dinner is always homemade, not purchased from a store. It doesn't have to be elaborate to create a time to connect and get a feeling for each person's day. Outside distractions can be managed so that the emphasis is on passing food, talking, and interacting. Children learn to share family food instead of asking for individualized orders as they do in a restaurant. At home the regular mealtime experience gives children a sense of security because they know what to expect at the end of each day. Indeed, sociologist Robert Bellah has called the family meal the "family sacrament."<sup>20</sup> These simple everyday routines have great power in our lives. They are the deep ditches and ridges of earth that help prevent outside forces from overwhelming and distracting us from our eternal goals.<br><br>I challenge you to plan a regular mealtime in your current home and prepare meals in partnership with people you enjoy. Retain positive examples from your past and change what needs to be changed. See what happens when you regard an everyday event like mealtime as sacred. Lend a hand, increase your knowledge and skills, and see if relationships and your sense of well-being improve.<br><br>Second, Moroni put up strong timbers and tall pickets on top of the ridges of dirt. As you develop spiritual strength through everyday activities in your home, you are building strong timbers and pickets to protect your homes. In the Doctrine and Covenants we read that God has only given us spiritual commandments and that none of them are temporal (see D&amp;amp;C 29:35). <i>Temporal</i> means lasting for time only. If God's commandments are not temporal, that means they are not limited to this life: His commandments are everlasting. We can apply this to our homes by realizing that all our actions on earth have consequences. The things we do on earth shape the person we become now and in the life to come. Thus the earthly patterns of living we create in our homes have power to influence our spiritual outcomes. Spouses can "love and care for each other and for their children"<sup>21</sup> and foster development of characteristics to prepare them for eternity.<br><br>We learn lessons of life at home that build strong character. Family researcher Enola Aird<sup>22</sup> reminds us that at home we learn how to work and how to govern ourselves; we learn manners and morals; we learn how to become self-reliant--or not. "Without parents' humanizing work, children may be quite smart, well-educated, and successful but so selfish, self-centered, and uncaring as to be essentially uncivilized--not able to live in a spirit of community with others."<sup>23</sup> If we realize the value of everyday life, we can see that even the smallest child can feel like a valued individual through something as mundane as folding laundry. Little children can match socks, sort colors, fold towels, and be recognized for their accomplishments. Over the years as the tasks' complexity increases, the children gain confidence in their ability to choose and do worthwhile things.<br><br>The integrative nature of everyday living provides opportunities to gain strength in many ways--physically, intellectually, socially, and spiritually. Clothing is an example: We all cover and protect our physical bodies from the elements. We develop intellectually as we learn to budget and care for our clothing. We grow socially as we choose clothing that represents who we are and gain a sense of being and belonging. And we develop spiritual strength as we choose clothing that shows respect for our bodies and creates a personal environment that is conducive to the Spirit.<br><br>It is easy to take clothing for granted because, as one scholar put it, it is our "second skin,"<sup>24</sup> but prophets have consistently reminded us about the connection between appearance, behavior, and eternal outcomes. They advise us to create our own style that can keep us "on the pathway to immortality and eternal life."<sup>25</sup> In the <i>For the</i> <i>Strength of Youth </i>booklet we are reminded that the way we dress is a reflection of what we are on the inside and our dress can show that we are disciples of Christ. Thus our everyday responsibilities are not vague--they are tangible, daily activities with form and meaning that have power to strengthen us. Begin today to recognize opportunities to grow spiritually through everyday choices. Build strong timbers and high pickets to guard your home against the adversary.<br><br>Finally, like Moroni, on top of your timbers and pickets, build towers and places of security to guard your homes. Draw closer to Christ and let His light increase in your daily life as a watchtower to safeguard your home and family. Elder Theodore M. Burton referred to the opportunity to receive light and truth by the temporal and spiritual nature of God's commandments. He used the examples of tithing and the Word of Wisdom and said that while it is true that obedience to these commandments may lead to temporal blessings, there are also spiritual blessings that come. One of these is the opportunity to "bring us back into the warmth and light of God."<sup>26</sup> There is a link between receiving light and truth, learning obedience, and our homes. In our homes, family duties are opportunities to practice gaining light and truth through obedience.<br><br>Jesus Christ is the Light of the World. When we walk in His light, we follow Him and keep His commandments. The closer we follow, the more light we have. The brother of Jared provided an example of walking in the light as he prepared barges "tight like unto a dish" (Ether 2:17). He was concerned that the barges would have neither light nor air. The Lord instructed him to make a hole in each barge for the air but gave no instruction about the light. The Lord explained that windows would be dashed to pieces and fire wouldn't work. Then He asked, "Therefore what will ye that I should prepare for you that ye may have light when ye are swallowed up in the depths of the sea?" (v. 25). This is when the brother of Jared "did molten out of a rock sixteen small stones" (Ether 3:1), then asked the Lord to touch the stones "and prepare them that they may shine forth in darkness" (v. 4). Literally and figuratively, the brother of Jared and his people drew upon the Light of Christ for their journey across the sea.<br><br>As we journey to our "promised land" in our "boats"--or our homes--we can practice obedience ourselves and we can teach our children at home by paying attention to our family duties. For example, by learning to do chores regularly, spouses and children can learn obedience and exactness in small things that have less severe consequences; then we are prepared to keep commandments and make sacred covenants.<br><br>To illustrate, one of our daughters told me a story about going to a school dance. She waited until I was distracted with company, then, when I wasn't looking, she changed and hurried off in a skirt she knew I wouldn't like. At one point during the evening boys started paying attention to her, and she remembers vividly how it made her feel. It wasn't the kind of attention she wanted after all. At that moment she decided to get rid of that outfit. Her experience and the consequences with clothing helped her learn an important lesson about agency and obedience, and she was able to invite more of the Light of Christ into her life.<br><br>The Lord has always commanded His people to attend to their family duties at home. In Deuteronomy 11:19 we read:<br><br><i>And ye shall teach</i> [the commandments to] <i>your children, speaking of them when thou sittest in thine house, and when thou walkest by the way, when thou liest down, and when thou risest up.</i><br><br>Tomorrow we celebrate 175 years since The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints was organized in this dispensation. When the Church was organized, the counsel to "attend to all family duties" was among the important foundational instructions given in section 20 of the Doctrine and Covenants. The Lord described the duties of a priest and said that one is to "visit the house of each member, and exhort them to . . . attend to all family duties" (D&amp;amp;C 20:47). This instruction is repeated twice (see v. 51). Three years later, in section 93, the leading brethren of the Church were chastened for neglecting their family duties (see D&amp;amp;C 93:41–53). Today, in "The Family: A Proclamation to the World," we are reminded again of our sacred family duties.<br><br>We often think about family duties in terms of family home evening, prayer, and scripture reading, but we should also remember daily activities of the home like feeding or clothing ourselves and recognize their power to help us practice obedience, service, love, and cooperation. Can we draw closer to the Lord through the clothing we choose, the meals we prepare, and our recreational choices? How much light do we want? Have you stopped to think about all the other small, ordinary things you do every day in this way? In Doctrine and Covenants 50:24 the Lord promised, "He that receiveth light, and continueth in God, receiveth more light." We also read, "For he will give unto the faithful line upon line, precept upon precept; and I will try you and prove you herewith" (D&amp;amp;C 98:12).<br><br>Prove faithful in the little things and the bigger things will be added on. Opportunities to learn and practice in the home are sacred; they are times to grow spiritually and draw closer to the Savior. This process of growth is a lifelong quest, and our home environment gives us repeated, sustained chances to practice becoming godlike individuals and families throughout the different seasons of our lives.<br><h2><b>Conclusion</b></h2><br>With your deep ditches, ridges, timbers, pickets, and towers in place, stand guard at the entrance and be deliberate about protecting daily activities. Noted family scholar William Doherty coined the phrase "intentional family."<sup>27</sup> We can extend this idea to an "intentional home." The opposite of the intentional home is the "entropic home." Entropy is the tendency of a physical system to lose energy and coherence over time. Think about your daily life. What happens when you don't plan and prepare? It quickly descends into chaos. Will you drift and experience entropy or will you steer as you establish intentional daily life? Whether you drift or steer, you <i>will</i> create daily life in your home. I challenge you today--whether you live in a house, an apartment, or a dorm--to do all in your power to protect your home from moral tarantulas and snakes that want to rob you of the sacred time, space, and activities within your home.<br><br>If you feel burdened or unsure about your responsibilities at home, the Lord can bless you to know what to do. At one particularly stressful time in my life, I felt like the daily load was more than I could bear. One night I had a dream--I saw myself placing a large bundle at the feet of each of my children. When I woke the next morning, I realized my children were responsible for their agency, not me, and that it was good for them to share in the work of our home. But I still had a very large bundle and wondered how I could manage it. Amazingly, the next night I had another dream, and this time I saw myself placing my bundle at the feet of the Savior. How I love Him. I'm thankful for the opportunities I've had over the years to draw closer to the Savior as a result of working, learning, and growing in my home.<br><br>In conclusion, we can learn one more lesson from the Book of Mormon. In the midst of these fierce battles, preparations for wars, and unrelenting attacks, Mormon wrote, "But behold there never was a happier time among the people of Nephi, since the days of Nephi, than in the days of Moroni" (Alma 50:23). We too can be the happiest people, even in the midst of difficult times, when we ask the Lord to bless us in protecting our homes and renewing our powers.<br><br>I express my love to you great young people and bear you my fervent testimony of the important work you will do in your homes. I know that our homes are important to Heavenly Father. He chose a humble home for the organization of the Church on April 6, 1830. He invites us to His house to begin a new family unit with marriage. I know that He will pour out His blessings upon you and help you as you create and protect your homes. I pray for your success and happiness in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Shirley R.

<h1>ucation: April 2005 Graduates - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Graduates, families, brothers, sisters, and friends, it is my most pleasant privilege on this special day to voice again my warm greeting and welcome to all of you and give my hearty congratulations to those we honor in these exercises. We are especially grateful for the presence of Elder Richard G. Scott of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles and chair of the board of trustees executive committee, who presides, and for Elder Earl C. Tingey of the Presidency of the Seventy and member of the board of trustees. We are appreciative of their support and contributions to BYU.<br><br>We are also especially pleased to welcome Elder W. Rolfe Kerr of the Seventy and commissioner of Church education. Although this is his first commencement in his assignment as commissioner, Elder Kerr is no stranger to BYU nor to these exercises. Likewise, we are honored to have with us today Sister Bonnie Parkin, Relief Society general president, and Sister Susan Tanner, Young Women general president. Both of these sisters are members of the board of trustees. Even though Sister Tanner is absolutely even-handed in her board responsibilities, we are not disappointed that she is the wife of our academic vice president John S. Tanner. We also recognize the many other special friends and honored guests who are with us today.<br><br>These ceremonies are tinged with sadness at the end of a difficult week for the BYU family. On Saturday we lost one of our graduate students, Mike Ashton. Then Tuesday we received the news that undergraduates Bradley Underwood and John Anderson had passed away--both are receiving their degrees posthumously. The loss of these fine students comes during an academic year in which we've also bid premature good-byes to several other students and members of our faculty and staff. Our thoughts and our prayers are with the affected families, and our hearts are heavier today because of their loss.<br><br>My wife, Sharon, and I are just completing our second year here at BYU. It has been wonderful and continues to be so. Many years ago as a young missionary, "the best two years of my life"--up to that point--seemed really to be two years long. Now these most recent "best two years" have flashed by so quickly in spite of the reality that so much has happened. I conclude that, in part, this may just be another evidence of my aging. I also believe that the special wonder and intense activity of this most remarkable institution contribute to the compression of this sweet and special time for us.<br><br>I do, however, take some comfort in a statement made by Henry Ford many years ago. He said, "Anyone who stops learning is old, whether at twenty or eighty. Anyone who keeps learning stays young. The greatest thing in life is to keep your mind young" (in Laurence J. Peter, <i>Peter's Quotations</i> [New York: William Morrow and Company, 1977], 297). By his definition, I believe I am still young.<br><br>I have much to learn, and I am sure that I continue to learn. This is one of the joys of being at Brigham Young University. And, I might add, one of the major reasons for you to be here--not only to learn while you are on campus but to learn how to continue to learn throughout your lives. As you know, this is central to our theology and also key to living an examined and fulfilling life.<br><br>As has been my custom and that of some of my predecessors, I wish now to share some important but possibly obscure facts about our graduates. Today we will award 6,436 degrees. Of these, 5,531 are bachelor's degrees, 711 are master's degrees, and 194 are doctoral degrees. Our graduates come from all 50 of the United States, from two U.S. territories, and from 59 other countries. Our youngest graduate is still too young to have a Utah driver's license and our oldest graduate--or at least the one willing to admit it--is 77-year-old Clarence Leavitt Grover, graduating in music.<br><br>Individually and as a group you have done well academically. You have earned the right to the diplomas you will receive.<br><br>We appreciate the generally very positive responses you shared on our senior survey regarding your BYU experience. Almost 60 percent of you anticipate full-time employment soon after graduation--great news for parents and spouses! About two-thirds of you plan to work in your major field, and the rest will pursue interests in another area.<br><br>Nine out of 10 of you said that you would choose to come to BYU again if you were starting over. We don't recommend starting over for any of you, but we are grateful that your choice to come here has been largely validated. I'm sure our faculty and staff are grateful that the majority of you have been very complimentary about your interactions with them.<br><br>Many of you have been employed while supporting yourselves here. Congratulations to those of you who have been so prudent financially. In that vein, let us especially thank your families and other benefactors who have so generously assisted you. We recognize that your tuition, for example, is comparatively very low, and we join in expressing appreciation to the tithe payers of the Church who make this possible.<br><br>Seventy percent of you report that you are graduating with no consumer debt. Another 10 percent owe less than $500. This is commendable. We understand, of course, that it is sometimes necessary to borrow, especially for education, but we continue to urge you to establish and follow patterns of providential living. As one of my close associates puts it, keep performing "plastic surgery" on any unnecessary credit cards or other debt.<br><br>Slightly more than half of you graduates are married, and our past surveys indicate that 80 percent will be wed within three years. During that same period almost two-thirds of you will be parents. Know that when you have chosen wisely, we are in favor of these statistics and even of increasing them!<br><br>It is both appropriate and necessary that we focus our attention today on our graduates, but I again want to mention our gratitude to so many of you for your essential contributions to our students. Families provide core, often lifelong support. Our faculty invest heavily in these great students and help provide the milieu that makes their remarkable achievements possible. Lest we forget another key group, let me also mention those who serve in various staff and administrative functions that too many of us may take for granted but who also deserve our praise and appreciation. Indeed, there is not one honored here today who can honestly say, "I did it alone."<br><br>In addition to those mentioned and present, may we continually reflect on those who make the BYU experience possible. Generous donors--who give both small and large amounts--make many of the extras possible that enhance our core educational experiences. The faithful tithe payers of the entire Church provide the bulk of the resources that make our lives so productive and positive. Lastly, we must acknowledge with great gratitude the confidence placed in us by the board of trustees, who make the difficult decisions concerning the appropriation of sacred funds to advance the work of the kingdom of God. I hope it is as comforting to you as it is to me that we are counted by them as part of that great work.<br><br>Relative to the tremendous financial, spiritual, and emotional support we receive, let me share the words of then Elder Spencer W. Kimball given more than three decades ago at BYU. He spoke of the university, but his descriptions could, and should, apply to us individually as well. Said he:<br><br><i>In all the world, . . . Brigham Young University is the greatest institution of learning. This statement I have made numerous times. I believe it sincerely. There are many criteria by which a university can be judged and appraised and evaluated. The special qualities of Brigham Young University lie not in its bigness; there are a number of much larger universities.</i><br><br><i>It should not be judged by its affluence and the amount of money available for buildings, research, and other facilities. It should not be judged by prestige, for there are more statusful institutions as the world measures status.</i><br><br><i>The uniqueness of Brigham Young University lies in its special role--education for eternity--which it must carry in addition to the usual tasks of a university. This means concern--curricular and behavioral--for not only the "whole man" but for the "eternal man." Where all universities seek to preserve the heritage of knowledge that history has washed to their feet, this faculty has a double heritage--the preserving of knowledge of men and the revealed truths sent from heaven.</i> [Spencer W. Kimball, <i>Education for Eternity,</i> Brigham Young University Speeches of the Year (Provo: 12 September 1967), 1–2]<br><br>Think of what this means to BYU--and what this means to each of us. I marvel at the opportunity and privilege of being part of such an enterprise but also become a little weak in the knees when I think of the responsibility and implied obligations.<br><br>Someone once said it is the responsibility of prophets to prophesy and the responsibility of the rest of us to do what we can to see that the prophecies are fulfilled. As you leave residency at Brigham Young University, I pray that you will retain a special place in your heart for this wonderful university. As you do, it will help you reflect on the tremendous blessings you have received and will receive. It will also help you keep focused on doing the things in your life that will allow the Great Judge in heaven to recognize that the significant investment made in you was worthwhile. I am convinced that it was and it is.<br><br>May heaven continue to smile on you and yours as you commence the rest of your lives as distinguished graduates of Brigham Young University is my prayer, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Cecil O. Samuelson was president of Brigham Young University when this commencement address was given on 21 April 2005.</i><br><br><i>© Intellectual Reserve, Inc. All rights reserved.</i>

<h1>ng 2005 Commencement - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
The First Presidency has extended to me this wonderful opportunity to conduct and provide remarks at the April 2005 commencement exercises. I am honored and privileged to be with all of you this afternoon.<br><br>I bring the love and best wishes of the Church Board of Education and the Brigham Young University Board of Trustees. This board consists of the First Presidency; Elders Joseph B. Wirthlin, Richard G. Scott, and Robert D. Hales of the Twelve; myself; Sister Bonnie D. Parkin, general president of the Relief Society; and Sister Susan W. Tanner, general president of the Young Women organization. Elder W. Rolfe Kerr, commissioner of Church Education, serves under the direction of the board of trustees.<br><br>The board meets each month and provides prayerful guidance to Brigham Young University, BYU--Hawaii, BYU--Idaho, the LDS Business College, and seminaries and institutes of the Church Educational System (CES). The members of the board have had many decades of experience in educational and business matters. They are wise men and women. They are directed by the Spirit and are presided over by President Gordon B. Hinckley, our prophet, seer, and revelator. In all of our decisions and deliberations, we have one key concern--and that is you, the student.<br><br>We anticipate that you will have a gospel-centered education--one that is professional in quality and overseen by instructors and administrators who are guided by the Holy Ghost.<br><br>It takes a lot of resources to operate a university the size of BYU. Of these resources, including money, much comes from tithing, the widow's mite. The proper use and allocation of this money is an important responsibility the board exercises.<br><br>You are very blessed to have a General Authority, Elder Cecil O. Samuelson, Jr., as president of Brigham Young University. He is a former member of the Presidency of the Seventy. He and I served together for several years in this presidency. He is an inspired Church leader and has the full confidence of the Church Board of Education and the BYU Board of Trustees. My wife and I are honored to call Elder and Sister Samuelson our friends.<br><br>We are delighted that you have such lovely buildings, dormitories, and programs to enhance your educational experience. We are confident you are appreciative of these blessings.<br><br>We are certainly proud of each student and graduate. We honor your parents and family who have assisted you as you have obtained your education. We know they are proud of you.<br><br>I would like to address four related subjects this afternoon.<br><h2><strong>1. The Graduate: A Challenge to the Future</strong></h2><br>To each of you receiving a diploma today, I congratulate you. The goal you set years ago has now been reached. You are a graduate of Brigham Young University.<br><br>Speaking of goals, I remember the following words from an unknown author that might express the feelings and thoughts you are having at this moment:<br><br>Oh that I could go--yet stay,<br>Have tomorrow, keep today,<br>Cherish, hold my yesterday.<br>My yesterday, now treasured dear,<br>Was once tomorrow seen with fear.<br><br>I believe you will cherish your treasured yesterdays in your memories of BYU. But, speaking of fear, you may have heard this statement: "Fear knocked at the door. Faith answered. No one was there."1<br><br>I am thinking of the fears you might have had as you commenced your schooling and continued on. Some of you may have initially feared that you might not be accepted into BYU. But you were. You might have experienced fear as you selected a major and then changed it--I hope not too many times. Individual classes may have loomed before you as significant challenges--even approaching a feeling of fear.<br><br>Concern about your living arrangements and even who your roommates might be could easily have resulted in fear. For some, being away from home and family for the first time brought a feeling of fear. Could having insufficient funds and money to continue with your education become a fearful thing to contemplate? Yes, if you are a normal college student!<br><br>Accepting a mission call, interrupting your schooling, and then returning to pick up where you left off would be of concern to many--possibly resulting in some fear.<br><br>And to those who are married and are beginning a family the increased challenges could often be overwhelming. How could you possibly maintain your scholastic standing and still have a strong marriage and family?<br><br>Yes, most of you have experienced some fear as you have completed your degree. But remember, when fear knocks at the door and faith answers, fear will be gone.<br><br>Congratulations on finding and developing faith in your years at Brigham Young University. Faith is belief plus action--in most cases, your action.<br><br>The religious aspects of your BYU experience are designed to build your faith. That is why every professor, instructor, mentor, and administrator is charged to do his or her job in such a way that you, the student, will learn the necessary aspects of your college education within the framework of gospel principles and faith.<br><br>Having faith in Jesus Christ and His atoning sacrifice and in the Prophet Joseph Smith and the Restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ helps you to overcome, by faith, each and every obstacle and challenge you will experience, have experienced at BYU, and might possibly experience in the future.<br><br>Faith in the Lord Jesus Christ and in your ability to accomplish all tasks before you is a marvelous gift to acquire and appreciate as you now complete your BYU schooling. This faith is one of the gifts of the Spirit as taught in the revelations.<br><br>All of that fear I have mentioned is now behind you. It has been replaced with faith. You have completed the education that qualifies you to receive your diploma. You should now look to the future not only with the college education you received here but also with the faith you developed during your stay here. That exercise of looking to the future is why we refer to this event not as a graduation service but as a commencement service. You are commencing your future with faith.<br><br>As you look to the future, I would encourage you to remember the following words by British poet Christopher Logue in honor of Guillaume Apollinaire:<br><br>Come to the edge.<br>We might fall.<br>Come to the edge.<br>It's too high!<br>COME TO THE EDGE!<br>And they came,<br>and he pushed,<br>and they flew.2<br><br>Yes, to some extent we are now pushing you out into the future. Some of you may feel this pushing from parents or a spouse. But we believe you will fly and not fall.<br><br>You are now entering real life. Your schooling might be referred to as preparation or practice for real life. Illustrating the difference between practicing for and being in real life, President Spencer W. Kimball often told the story of the young soldier in basic training who wrote back to his folks: "Yesterday we learned how to throw hand grenades. We practiced with duds first, and my best throw was 30 yards. Today we threw live grenades, and I threw 43 yards."<br><br>Real life experiences result in consequences. I recently read an article in a national magazine about the challenge of some college graduates being unwilling to grow up, step forward, and accept the full responsibilities of mature adulthood.<br><br>Let me quote just one paragraph from this excellent article:<br><br>Social scientists are starting to realize that a permanent shift has taken place in the way we live our lives. In the past, people moved from childhood to adolescence and from adolescence to adulthood, but today there is a new, intermediate phase along the way. The years from 18 until 25 and even beyond have become a distinct and separate life stage, a strange, transitional never-never land between adolescence and adulthood in which people stall for a few extra years, putting off the iron cage of adult responsibility that constantly threatens to crash down on them. They're betwixt and between. You could call them twixters.3<br><br>The article notes the indecision some college graduates have in seeking employment after graduation and in accepting the responsibilities of marriage and family. It uses a rather cruel phrase in describing such individuals as "permanent adolescents, . . . twentysomething Peter Pans" who never "grow up."4<br><br>The picture on the cover of the issue with this interesting and thought-provoking article shows a college graduate sitting in a sandbox.<br><br>Now the concerns of this article, which, unfortunately, describes an epidemic trend in some parts of the country, must never describe a graduate of Brigham Young University. You know better. You have been better trained. You have an eternal view of life that helps you see beyond and through the shallowness and emptiness of allowing a self-centered adolescent period following college graduation. We expect more from you. We have faith in you. You have developed faith in yourself.<br><br>You are now entering the real life of family, employment, increasing Church service, and even more significant responsibility.<br><br>You are like a ship embarking on the ocean of life. As you move out into the ocean of real life as a newly constructed ship, remember that ships are not built to rest in safe harbors. There will be storms, large and dangerous winds and waves, and sometimes uncharted shorelines. Fortunately your education, good common sense, personal inspiration through the Spirit, and lighthouses--who are the inspired watchmen on the tower we know as apostles and prophets--will guide you to harbors of safety.<br><br>You are entitled to have the assurance that your training at Brigham Young University is of the very finest. You are well equipped to steer and maneuver your ship of life through successful journeys to safe harbors.<br><br>Some of you are single. Others of you are married, many with growing families. Whatever your current circumstances, as you accept the responsibilities of marriage and family life and continue to provide loving and faithful service to the Church and to your community and fellowman, you will find that your commitment to the ideals of Brigham Young University will sustain and support you throughout your life.<br><br>The Lord will honor and bless you as you have honored and lived the exemplary ideals of BYU, which are the basic principles of the Church of Jesus Christ.<br><h2><strong>2. The Esteemed Ranking of Brigham Young University</strong></h2><br>Did you know that your alma mater, Brigham Young University, continues to receive the highest marks when compared to other esteemed universities in the United States? Let me give you several of the many areas in which BYU has excelled.<br><br>A recent edition of the Wall Street Journal rating regional business schools in North America ranked Brigham Young University's Marriott School of Business as number 5 in the entire nation. BYU was exceeded only by Purdue, Vanderbilt, Ohio State, and the University of Maryland.<br><br>When asked which MBA programs employers depend on to produce graduates with high ethical standards, the number 2 school was Brigham Young University, second only to Yale University.<br><br>The same report also ranked schools named most often when asked which MBA programs excel in accounting disciplines. Brigham Young University was rated number 5.5<br><br>U.S. News and World Report recently published a 2005 edition of America's Best Colleges.6 Let me share with you several of their rankings of Brigham Young University:<br><br>Students graduating with the least amount of debt--number 9 (p. 67). (You may or may not agree, but that is what they concluded.)<br>The school with the best value or price--number 25 (p. 64).<br>In the 2005 edition of America's Best Graduate Schools, also put out by U.S. News and World Report, the BYU Law School was rated number 34.7 And in 2004 the BYU undergraduate accounting program was rated number 6 for the year 2005.8<br><br>A year ago the Ballroom Dance Company took first place in both the modern and Latin American formation competitions at the prestigious Blackpool Dance Festival in England. The company enters the competition every three years and "has won first place in both divisions each of the last six times it has competed, and 18 times overall since 1971."9<br><br>BYU was recently ranked 17th in the nation for the number of students who received their undergraduate degree here and then received graduate fellowships from the National Science Foundation.10<br><br>BYU's faculty continue to be honored and recognized in many fields and disciplines for their outstanding achievements.<br><br>The Princeton Review recently published their 2005 edition of The Best 357 Colleges.11 I was absolutely fascinated with several of the rankings given to Brigham Young University, and I share them with you. Brigham Young University was rated number 1 in the following five categories:<br><br>great college library (p. 32)<br>stone-cold sober school, beer usage reported low (which category the author entitled "Got Milk?") (pp. 41, 43)<br>hard liquor usage reported low (p. 42)<br>marijuana usage reported low (p. 42)<br>most religious students (p. 38)<br>In the same publication, BYU was rated highly in the next two categories:<br><br>Best quality of life--number 6 (p. 36)<br>Happy students--number 7 (p. 34)<br>In the Princeton Review's publication Best 117 Law Schools, BYU was ranked number 4 in overall academic excellence.12<br><br>The newly published Princeton Review's 2006 edition of America's Best Value Colleges rated Brigham Young University as third best in the nation in terms of value for each tuition dollar.13<br><br>These interesting and most remarkable ratings attest to the fact that Brigham Young University is truly an unusual school of the most high academic excellence and of extremely high moral values. What an honor for you to be a graduate of that kind of university.<br><h2><strong>3. BYU Moral Values and the Honor Code</strong></h2><br>I believe the high moral values reflected in these various studies are the direct result of the fact that BYU is sponsored by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. It is a university where academic instruction is combined with gospel instruction.<br><br>The high achievements of Brigham Young University and its faculty and students are also the fruit of an inspired code of living we call the BYU Honor Code.<br><br>To honor is to hold in high esteem. We honor a person or institution by recognizing the entity's good name and showing respect for its fame and accomplishments. Living with honor results in becoming someone of distinction. Showing honor results in deference to a higher plane or standing.<br><br>You remember that the boy Samuel earned the love and respect of the Lord through the quality of his life. It is recorded that he "grew on, and was in favour both with the Lord, and also with men."14<br><br>For Samuel's adherence to and honor of God, the Lord said of him, "Them that honour me I will honour."15<br><br>What does it mean to observe the Honor Code? Will the Lord recognize you and honor you as you have honored the code of living that distinguishes Brigham Young University from all other institutions of higher learning?<br><br>I would like to address the Honor Code and its relevance to you, the graduating student.<br><br>The online information about the BYU Honor Code describes it as follows:<br><br>BYU exists to provide a university education in an atmosphere consistent with the principles of the Church of Jesus Christ. This environment is preserved through adherence to a code of conduct called the Honor Code that reflects those ideals.<br><br>Initiated by students in 1949, the Honor Code emphasizes being honest, living a chaste and virtuous life, abstaining from alcohol and tobacco, using clean language and following other values encompassed in the doctrines of the Church. The code is supplemented by additional guidelines on dress, grooming and housing.<br><br>Students and faculty are attracted by the opportunity to study and work among those who share their faith and standards. In a survey of BYU alumni, 77 percent cited their desire to "obtain a spiritual, religiously based education" as a very important or extremely important factor in their decision to attend BYU.16<br><br>Your initial endorsement and continued endorsement from your ecclesiastical leader--who in most cases is your bishop or branch president--is truly remarkable and should be reflected in your personal moral values as a graduate of Brigham Young University.<br><br>In the Church we know a little bit about covenants. When you sign the Honor Code, you enter into a commitment that might be compared to reaffirming certain covenants you have made. In the words of the scriptures, it might be compared to making oaths.<br><br>In the Encyclopedia of Mormonism we read that "oaths are solemn declarations used to affirm a statement or strengthen a promise. . . . In covenant-making, ritual oaths attest the fidelity of those entering into the covenant."17<br><br>Let me give you a few examples of the kind of oaths I'm talking about. In our worship and prayer we use the word amen, which in Hebrew means "verily," "truly," or "let it be affirmed," and it is considered a form of oath. When we raise our right hand in approval of those called to Church positions, we are making a silent oath signifying our agreement to sustain those persons in their callings. We all know that the higher priesthood is received through an oath and covenant,18 and we enter into sacred covenants in temples.<br><br>In the ordinance of baptism we covenant to take upon ourselves the name of Jesus Christ and to serve Him to the end. When we partake of the sacrament, we reaffirm the covenants we made at the time of our baptism.19<br><br>In our modern society the use of oaths is also recognized. For example, membership in the Boy Scouts is initiated with an oath. The president of the United States is inaugurated with an oath. When I graduated, I was commissioned an officer in the United States Army. With an upraised arm, I entered into an oath to carefully and diligently discharge the duties of an officer in the military. I remember when I was a little boy, when we wished to impress someone that we were telling the truth, we would often say, "Cross my heart, hope to die, if I ever tell a lie." Perhaps that is even some sort of juvenile oath making.<br><br>The scriptures are full of stories that illustrate the seriousness by which people make and keep oaths. Moses taught that covenants entered into by the swearing of an oath would bind a man's soul.20<br><br>Peter's remorse at thrice denying the Lord during the evening preceding the Crucifixion is better understood when we read that Peter "denied with an oath" that he knew Christ.21<br><br>Paul taught that the confirming of a promise by the swearing of an oath is "an end of all strife."22<br><br>Of course you all remember the wonderful story of the people of Ammon who made an oath never to shed blood or take up arms against their brethren.23<br><br>I think the most classic of all stories in the Book of Mormon illustrating the importance and sanctity of oath swearing is the incident between Nephi and Zoram, the servant of Laban. When Zoram discovered the identity of Nephi and realized that his master, Laban, had been slain, Zoram feared for his life and attempted to flee. The scriptures record that Nephi swore an oath to Zoram that "he need not fear" and "that he should be a free man" like Nephi. Zoram took courage and "also made an oath" to Nephi that he would tarry with Lehi and his people from that time forth.<br><br>Then comes this remarkable statement of Nephi: "And it came to pass that when Zoram had made an oath unto us, our fears did cease concerning him."24<br><br>What a wonderful statement: "Our fears did cease concerning him."<br><br>The Honor Code you signed when you entered BYU applies not just for the years at BYU but for life. It can become the basis of your lifelong moral standard. Adhering to it allows you to continue to live in a spiritual, religiously based environment where you can rear a family within the protective blanket of the gospel of Jesus Christ.<br><br>All you do from this point in your career or professional life will reflect on Brigham Young University and all of us. But, like Nephi, "our fears did cease concerning [you]."<br><br>We accept that when you covenanted to live by the Honor Code you truly agreed to adhere to a code of conduct that reflects the ideals of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and Brigham Young University. We believe you. We honor you for your past and continuing integrity and willingness to accept and conform to the high ideals of Brigham Young University.<br><br>But I remind you that essential to your honor and personal integrity is a lifelong commitment to obey the Honor Code. It is a similitude to entering into and keeping many covenants and oaths.<br><br>Speaking of covenants, oaths, and commitments, I remind you of the statement of Karl G. Maeser, the first president of Brigham Young University. It related to honor:<br><br>I have been asked what I mean by word of honor. I will tell you. Place me behind prison walls--walls of stone ever so high, ever so thick, reaching ever so far into the ground--there is a possibility that in some way or another I may be able to escape, but stand me on that floor and draw a chalk line around me and have me give my word of honor never to cross it. Can I get out of that circle? No, never! I'd die first!25<br><h2><strong>4. Your Responsibility to Give Back</strong></h2><br>The Church has made a significant and expensive investment in each of you. Brigham Young University is designed to provide you with a quality, professional education that will enable you to compete anywhere in the world in the field of your choice. As I said earlier, every aspect of your schooling and training at BYU has been within the context of the principles of the gospel of Jesus Christ.<br><br>You have been privileged to attend BYU and participate in this unique experience. Unfortunately, many others have not enjoyed this blessing.<br><br>What is now expected of you? May I make two suggestions?<br><br>First, make your life reflect your unique education. Take responsibility for what you have learned. After giving commandments to Joseph Smith and others, the Lord said, "An account of this stewardship will I require of them in the day of judgment."26<br><br>I believe you share in that obligation as it applies to your education at Brigham Young University. Although some of your stewardship will be reflected in your professional life, most will be reflected in your family and Church experience. Of the hundreds of thousands of persons graduating from universities at this time of year, you have an advantage that most do not have. You have been tutored in gospel principles as you have been educated. Your personal life should reflect those gospel qualities in such a way that wherever you are and in whatever situation you find yourself, your life will be a reflection of the eternal principles of the gospel of Jesus Christ and the high ideals of Brigham Young University.<br><br>Second, take responsibility for what you have been given. The Lord said, "For of him unto whom much is given much is required."27<br><br>In short, where much is given to you, much is required of you.<br><br>The Savior earlier announced the same principle in the parable of the talents:<br><br>For the kingdom of heaven is as a man travelling into a far country, who called his own servants, and delivered unto them his goods.<br><br>And unto one he gave five talents, to another two, and to another one; to every man according to his several ability; and straightway took his journey.28<br><br>You would certainly qualify as among those who have received five talents as compared to those who have received one or two talents.<br><br>What will you do with your talents or privileges received through your graduation from Brigham Young University?<br><br>The parable continues, explaining that some buried their talent and produced no growth or gain. In response, the Lord took the talent and gave it to another.29 Others doubled or magnified their talent. To them the Lord said: "Well done, good and faithful servant; thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord."30<br><br>Concluding the lesson on stewardship and magnifying one's opportunities, the Lord said, "For unto every one that hath shall be given, and he shall have abundance: but from him that hath not shall be taken away even that which he hath."31<br><br>You have been given in abundance and will be expected to give back much.<br><br>Give back of your time and service as an alumnus of Brigham Young University.<br><br>Give back of your financial means when you are in a position to do so, so that other future students can continue to enjoy the benefits you have received, provided in part by the contributions of others.<br><br>Give back through your Church service by bearing witness of the truths and beauties of the gospel of Jesus Christ and of the message of the Restoration.<br><br>Give back a posterity of righteous children and grandchildren reared and tutored in worthy goals and high ideals.<br><br>Give back of yourself as an honorable, productive citizen of your community.<br><br>Give back love and compassion to your fellowmen, as Christ would do.<br><br>In conclusion, I again congratulate you on behalf of the Church Board of Education and the BYU Board of Trustees for your achievement in receiving a diploma from Brigham Young University.<br><br>I counsel you to now step into the future without fear and begin to accomplish all of your righteous goals and aspirations.<br><br>Be grateful for the education, tutoring, and mentoring you have received at Brigham Young University, truly a world-class institution.<br><br>Observe and keep throughout your life the BYU Honor Code. Honor God and He will honor you. When you exhibit honor and integrity, as Nephi said of Zoram of old, our fears cease concerning you.<br><br>Give back to the university and to the Church a greater measure of what you have received. Where much is given, much is required. Magnify your talents and return a greater good for the good you have received.<br><br>Now the Seventy are called to bear testimony and witness of Jesus Christ. That is where I leave you.<br><br>The gospel of Jesus Christ, which prevails throughout this university, is true. Jesus truly is the Christ. The principles of Christian living, taught by our Savior, are the heart and soul of Brigham Young University.<br><br>The gospel restored by Jesus Christ through the Prophet Joseph Smith continues today under the inspired direction and leadership of President Gordon B. Hinckley, the chairman of the Church Board of Education and of the board of trustees of this university.<br><br>To these truths I offer my solemn witness in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><em>Earl C. Tingey was a member of the Presidency of the Seventy of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when this commencement address was given on 21 April 2005.</em><br><br><strong>Notes</strong><br><br>1.

<h1>n Knowledge - BYU Speeches</h1>

<br>
When I first found out that I was to speak at commencement, I was really excited and naturally wanted to share the news with some of my friends. One of them happened to be chatting online with an old friend of mine from Singapore. He told her, "Val is valedictorian!"<br><br>Her response? "Really? All my life I thought Val stood for Valerie."<br><br>What a great response. It certainly put things nicely into perspective.<br><br>Let me begin by sharing a little experience with you. One Monday night when I was a freshman living at Deseret Towers, our family home evening activity consisted of making cookies for students at the Testing Center. We had been planning this little service project for a week and were really looking forward to cheering up some tired test-takers. Pretty soon the cookies were made and we were on our way to the Testing Center. As we approached, we offered cookies to students we saw coming out of the building, but there were no takers. I must say we were somewhat puzzled. After all, why wouldn't anyone want a nice, fresh cookie after a long, hard test?<br><br>Finally a student came out munching on a brownie. When he saw us, he grinned and said, "Wow, cookies too? There are already two groups in there with brownies and muffins!"<br><br>Our cookie experience was fun, although--as we eventually found out--not particularly necessary. In fact, in my time at BYU I've come to realize that the most needed service is rarely scheduled. I've met some wonderful friends and teachers, and these associations have taught me that the essence of service does not lie in planned projects but in being the kind of person people know they can call on when they need help, whenever that may be.<br><br>Perhaps the most unique thing about a BYU education is that it prizes eternal and not simply academic progression. This difference in priorities encourages both faculty and students to factor in service alongside their pursuit of knowledge. As Elder Neal A. Maxwell noted, "Knowledge is intended to travel in a convoy of other Christian virtues. It does not have final meaning by itself" ("The Inexhaustible Gospel," BYU 1991–92 Devotional and Fireside Speeches [Provo: BYU, 1992], 141; see also adaptation of the address in Ensign, April 1993, 69).<br><br>I have seen Christian virtues traveling as companions of knowledge many times at BYU. I have seen them in the lives of friends who take time to listen to a roommate who has had a bad day, despite having papers due and pressing deadlines of their own. I've seen them in professors who leave their doors open all day so that students can walk in anytime when they have questions or would simply like to chat. I've personally known both the difficulty and joy of such service as part of my volunteer experience with the ACCESS program (Advocates for a Child's Community Exposure and Socialization Success). I've been called unexpectedly the day before finals to spend the afternoon with a child whose mother couldn't get off work. That certainly put an end to my studying, but it was well worth it. These small, yet profound acts of service are what give meaning and purpose to knowledge, and I'm so glad to have been part of a university that values service as much as it values knowledge.<br><br>Let me tell you the end of our little cookie delivery experience. After learning about the other two charitable food-bearing groups, we decided to go into the Testing Center and check it out. We ended up standing across from the muffin group with our cookies, trying to entice test-takers to choose our cookies instead of their muffins.<br><br>I have a feeling that many of us will soon be doing something similar to what I was doing that night--trying to persuade potential employers that our knowledge and skills are better than those of others. I believe that the knowledge I have gained at BYU has fully equipped me for the labor market. More important, however, my education here has helped me realize the importance of lifelong learning and service. As a result, the value of my education will not be determined by the demand and supply curves of the current job market or fade with age. It will instead be ever increasing and eternal. And for that I will always be grateful. Thank you.<br><br><em>Shuei Chen Valerie Woo spoke as the representative of her graduating class at BYU commencement on 21 April 2005.</em><br><br>© Brigham Young University. All rights reserved.

<br>
In section 128 of the Doctrine and Covenants, the Prophet Joseph Smith described "a welding link" that must exist between the past, the present, and the future if we are to be made perfect along with both our ancestors and our posterity (verse 18). He refers, of course, to the offering of the ordinances of exaltation so that we can present to the Lord "a book containing the records of our dead, which shall be worthy of all acceptation" (D&amp;amp;C 128:24).<br><br>Those who have done any family history work will know the great sense of fulfillment and gratitude that comes when we can learn enough about an ancestor that she ceases to be just another name with a death date to us and is resurrected in our minds as a living human being endowed with a unique personality and all the other human traits that help us develop a connection--or a welding link--to her.<br><br>In the emotional sense, this link may be something like the "taming" process that the fox described in Antoine de Saint-Exupé's classic tale <i>The Little Prince:</i><br><br><i>To me</i> [the fox declared], <i>you are still nothing more than a little boy who is just like a hundred thousand other little boys. And I have no need of you. And you, on your part, have no need of me. To you, I am nothing more than a fox like a hundred thousand other foxes. But if you tame me, then we shall need each other. To me, you will be unique in all the world. To you, I shall be unique in all the world.</i> [Antoine de Saint-Exupé, <i>The Little Prince</i> (New York: Harcourt, Brace and World, 1943), 66]<br><br>Once we have "tamed" our ancestors, they are unique in all the world to us, and our attachment to them grows.<br><br>But what I want to propose to you today is that there may be additional essential forms of linkage between ourselves and our loved ones of both yesterday and tomorrow. Our predecessors lived lives very different from those that we are experiencing today, and it is an absolute reality that our posterity will inhabit a world very unlike the one we know--just as my mother, who is here today, born just 15 years after the Wright Brothers took a flying leap at Kitty Hawk, sees her great-grandson Andrew growing up in a world that none of the most creative science fiction writers of her day even began to imagine.<br><br>As we ponder the Lord's injunctions to us in sections 88, 90, and 93 of the Doctrine and Covenants--where we are told to diligently study "good books" (D&amp;amp;C 90:15), history, geography, languages, peoples, and virtually every other imaginable discipline--I can't help but wonder whether the Lord in fact wants us to forge a link between the civilizations of the past and our own day and then to transmit them to our own progeny. Perhaps one of the welding links that will help each of us to be tethered more securely to our ancestors can be achieved by familiarizing ourselves with the cultures in which they were born, lived, married, wept, laughed, and created families of their own. Surely their lives were greatly influenced by the books they read, the music they enjoyed, the dances they danced--just as are yours. It seems to me it would be a terrible waste, since we are the inheritors of the cultural legacy they created, to allow it to die by dismissing it as old-fashioned.<br><br>And yet it <i>is </i>the death of earlier cultures--due to our failure to study and pass them along--that is of great concern to me. The popular culture of the present has become so pervasive, so omnipresent, and so hypnotically narcotic in its technological manifestations that it has all but fully succeeded in destroying any sense of obligation to learn anything about former days. After all, the word <i>classic</i> to many only takes you as far back as "classic rock." Why sniff around in the musty old archives of a lifeless past when you can simply insert the iPod headphones into your ears and thereby fully immerse yourself in a study of--well, surely there is <i>something</i> in there that will help you in your quest for eternal life!<br><br>I hesitate to be too critical of contemporary pop culture, if only because some of you are pretty heavily into some aspects of it. I have found that the youth of the Church are, to a surprising degree, more willing to listen to a pulpit-pounding sermon on the law of chastity than to have the worth of their favorite music, movies, or video games called into question.<br><br>But there are two significant perils in being unfamiliar with the cultural treasures of the past and being excessively absorbed in contemporary pop culture: first, you run the risk of breaking that critical link with the past; second, you may be overwhelmed as a "torrent of images and sounds" floods over you like the combined plagues of Egypt (the quoted phrase is Todd Gitlin's, taken from the subtitle of his book <i>Media Unlimited: How the Torrent of Images and Sounds Overwhelms Our Lives</i> [New York: Henry Holt and Company, 2002]). So I will have to run the risk of offending some of you as I suggest a few ways in which the modern media glut keeps you not only from accessing the culture of the past but also, most perilously, from having unbroken access to the Spirit of the Lord. As I understand section 121, we are not counseled to have the Holy Ghost as our <i>intermittent</i> companion!<br><br>I hope you will not dismiss out of hand the following brief critique of contemporary pop culture. Please understand that I am not suggesting that you have bad taste but merely that the range of tastes offered to you through most of the current media is extremely limited and that today's popular forms of entertainment promote values that in numerous ways are glaringly inconsistent with the principles of the gospel of Jesus Christ. But you already know that, because you have grown up in this culture.<br><br>Just as the Lord has reserved His best spirits (that would be you!) for the last days, the adversary is giving us his very worst. Over the course of time, as standards have eroded away, Satan has taken everything sacred and pulled it down to his hellish level.<br><br>It simply can't just be a cosmic coincidence that the tangible object that the adversary most craves--a physical body--is precisely the object toward which he aims the most lethal of his fiery darts in his manipulation of the entertainment media. How to make mortals regard the human body as less than holy? Very simply, just strip its sacredness of all its modest coverings and parade it to public view; batter it and explode it and riddle it with bullets; and display it nakedly engaged in its most intimate activities to make sure the viewer or listener comes to consider public performances of sexual activity as commonplace. What our Father in Heaven regards as the Holy of Holies Satan treats as an open-set film studio. You can almost hear the fiendish laughs of the demons over every depiction of the physical bodies they so desperately envy being exposed to public view and treated like so much meat in a butcher's shop.<br><br>Some of you will regard me as hopelessly out of touch. I hope I am. I would rather make entertainment choices more closely aligned with those of Gordon Hinckley than of Hugh Hefner.<br><br>I'm sure you know the directions for how to boil a frog. He'll jump out of the pot if the water is too hot when you put him in it, but if you put him in tepid water and then gradually turn up the heat, he won't notice how bad it's getting for him until it's way too late. I think many of the spiritual challenges you face come because the pot of water into which you were born in today's society is already at the boiling point, and the cultural milieu in which you live can <i>feel</i> normal unless you do a couple of very important things to test its temperature. First, acquaint yourselves with the great cultural traditions of the past to give you some point of comparative reference and to remind you how difficult issues can be treated with respect and restraint. Second (and most important), evaluate everything that you take into your mind and spirit using the standards established by the Lord, whose only purpose is to shield you from evil and prepare you for the greater good.<br><br>I think most of our problems with the popular media could be solved very simply if we would apply the Lord's clear standard: in our entertainment choices we must seek after those works that are "virtuous, lovely, or of good report or praiseworthy" (Articles of Faith 1:13). Mormon also provided us a clear measure from the Lord:<br><br><i>For every thing which inviteth to do good, and to persuade to believe in Christ, is sent forth by the power and gift of Christ; wherefore ye may know with a perfect knowledge it is of God.</i><br><br><i>But whatsoever thing persuadeth men to do evil, and believe not in Christ, and deny him, and serve not God, then ye may know with a perfect knowledge it is of the devil.</i> [Moroni 7:16–17]<br><br>Using the Lord's standards, how is contemporary culture faring? Last week I pulled up <i>Billboard </i>magazine's list of the top 20 pop songs in the country. Then I read the lyrics to all 20. (<i>Warning: Do not attempt this at home!</i>) Even after I had mentally bleeped out all of the obscenities--which were legion--the message that emerged was an ugly, surprisingly consistent message of violence, hate, prejudice, and drug peddling; an obsessive preoccupation with the carnal; and a disturbing denigration of the disposable, interchangeable sex objects known as women. I could not, in good conscience, recommend to you more than one of those 20 songs, with a begrudging admission that another three are probably not overtly destructive. President Boyd K. Packer has taught:<br><br><i>Some music is spiritually very destructive. You young people know what kind that is. The tempo, the sounds, and the lifestyle of those who perform it repel the Spirit. It is far more dangerous than you may suppose, for it can smother your spiritual senses.</i> [Boyd K. Packer, "Personal Revelation: The Gift, the Test, and the Promise," <i>Ensign,</i> November 1994, 61]<br><br>Now, what about movies? I've been listening carefully for the past 19 years, and I haven't heard any prophet during that time declare null and void the straightforward declaration of President Ezra Taft Benson, who was, I might note, president of the Church in 1986 when he said: "Don't see R-rated movies or vulgar videos or participate in <i>any </i>entertainment that is <i>immoral, suggestive,</i> or <i>pornographic</i>" (Ezra Taft Benson, "To the 'Youth of the Noble Birthright,'" <i>Ensign,</i> May 1986, 45; emphasis added). Nor have I noticed a significant reduction in the portrayals of violence, profanity, and sexuality in motion pictures. <i>Au contraire!</i> The Church booklet <i>For the Strength of Youth</i> similarly provides a useful standard: "Do not attend, view, or participate in entertainment that is<i> vulgar, immoral, violent,</i> or <i>pornographic in any way</i>" (<i>For the Strength of Youth: Fulfilling Our Duty to God</i> [Salt Lake City: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 2001], 17; emphasis added). What does that standard do to the excuses "Well, it's only rated that way because of the violence" or "just because of some bad language"? Why do some think they have reached a certain level of adulthood where prophetic counsel no longer applies to them? To those who stand at the doorways leading into graphic representations of the blood and sins of our current generation, the Lord's call is: "Come ye out from the wicked, and be ye separate, and touch not their unclean things" (Alma 5:57).<br><br>You probably ought to know that while you were sleeping, Hollywood has pulled another fast one on you. Just within the past month, without fanfare or public proclamation, the often-unreliable MPAA ratings board suddenly upped the number of times that infamous word, the vilest of vulgarities--the one beginning with the sixth letter of the alphabet--can be used in PG-13 movies. For some time now, only one use was allowed by the ratings board. But within the past month the PG-13 rating has been awarded to one film containing five uses of that vulgarity. Even more disturbing is the fact that after a documentary maker appealed the R rating given his film, he was allowed to distribute his film with a PG-13 rating, even though the vulgar word is uttered <i>42 times </i>in the space of 85 short minutes.<br><br>Some of you know even better than I that there are scores of PG-13 movies that are more vulgar and suggestive than some R-rated films. These are the leering, snickering films aimed at a hormonally hobbled teenage audience. They are relentlessly obsessed with crude depictions and descriptions of sexual activity and are blatantly offensive to the Spirit. Parents too often turn a blind eye to the viewing of such films, since, after all, they're "just" rated PG13. Meanwhile, the film industry, ever eager to have us pay more for our passions, has started to include a good deal of inappropriate--<i>but unrated--</i>material in the DVD releases of their films. Too often a DVD release is intentionally unrated because it is more violent and crude than the theatrical release.<br><br>With so much that is odious to the Spirit being hurled at you from movie screens, I suggest that you spend at least as much time checking on the content of a film before you go see it as you do comparing cell-phone rates. There are any number of good Web sites, including kidsinmind.com and screenit.com, that will give you detailed information about a movie's potentially objectionable features. The bottom-line message here is simple: <i>Don't trade your birthright for a mess of footage!</i><br><br>Okay, so you're living in a society that's nearing the final boiling point, a world that continues its free-fall plummet from Kolob while we're trying to find our way back. What can you do to avoid being <i>of </i>that world and its culture if you have heeded prophetic warnings and recognize that you are virtually submerged in very hot water? In addition to simple avoidance and endless vigilance to keep the Spirit with you in all your activities, I would suggest that additional strength will come as you tighten the cultural link between yourself and your ancestors. You will not only have much of great worth to enrich your own life but also you can subsequently pass it along to your descendants. As with anything that is of true spiritual consequence, however, you must first foster within your heart a <i>desire</i> to learn from the past. Then you will no doubt have to fight some significant battles to pull yourself away from the gravitational pull of today's popular culture and media. I encourage you to drink deeply from the wells of culture--your own native culture as well as the civilizations of other places and other times.<br><br>I am going to focus my remaining comments on the essential role that reading plays in the lifelong education that the Lord would have you pursue. But please bear in mind that what I say about the ingestion of books applies equally well to the need and responsibility we have to listen to good music, to study great paintings, to attend plays and dances, and to immerse ourselves in many other uplifting ways in the culture that shaped the lives of those to whom we would wish to be linked for eternity.<br><br>Why am I so excitable on the simple subject of reading? Because it is happening less and less in our society--most likely because of the rapid development of technological tools that force-feed us contemporary culture at all times and in all places. (Hmm. Sort of sounds like it's in direct competition with our efforts to stand as witnesses of Christ at all times and in all places!) Last year the National Endowment for the Arts published a study entitled "Reading at Risk." The study found that over the past 20 years the percentage of adult Americans who read literature has dropped by more than 10 percent, paralleling a decline in total reading of books, <i>particularly</i> in the age group between 18 and 24. During the year 2002, 90 million adults in the U.S. did not read a single book! I think you can guess what young people are doing with their time instead.<br><br>What are the benefits of reading? T. S. Eliot said, "We read many books, because we cannot know enough people" ("A Note on Culture and Politics," chapter 5 of <i>Notes Towards the Definition of Culture</i> [New York: Harcourt, Brace, 1949], 87). The only way in mortality that we can really come to know our deceased kindred is by reading about the kinds of lives they lived--whether they happened to be saints or scoundrels. Much can be learned from the choices made by both types. It would be shortsighted to shun the scoundrels and thereby lose the opportunity to learn from their mistakes, repeating them ourselves. For example, although it is not my personal intention to violate the law of chastity, I will live the rest of my life interacting with--and being under a sacred obligation as a disciple of Christ to serve as a positive influence on--people who regularly do engage in immoral activity. Frankly, I would rather gain my understanding of the hearts and minds of such people by reading <i>Madame Bovary</i> or <i>The Heart of the Matter</i> or <i>The Once and Future King</i> than from watching visual depictions of the sin that cannot help but simultaneously glorify and debase it merely by the act of showing it, no matter what moral stance--if any--they take toward the action.<br><br>Sven Birkerts, in his book <i>The Gutenberg Elegies,</i> wrote:<br><br><i>Reading is at once a movement and a comment of sorts about the place one has left. To open a book voluntarily is at some level to remark the insufficiency either of one's life or of one's orientation toward it. ... When we read we not only transplant ourselves to the place of the text, but we modify our natural angle of regard upon all things; we reposition the self in order to</i> see<i> differently....</i><br><br><i>... When we enter a novel, no matter what novel, we step into the whole world anew. ... For the space of our reading, and perhaps beyond, it changes our relation to all things....</i><br><br><i>What reading does, ultimately, is keep alive the dangerous and exhilarating idea that ... life has a unitary pattern inscribed within it, a pattern that we could discern for ourselves if we could somehow lay the whole of our experience out like a map.</i> [Sven Birkerts, <i>The Gutenberg Elegies: The Fate of Reading in an Electronic Age </i>(New York: Fawcett Columbine, 1994), 80, 81, 85; emphasis in original]<br><br>I might ask: How is the experience of reading that Birkerts describes here qualitatively different from the process of eternal progression? Can we ever become better until we sense and wish to transcend the insufficiencies of our current life? But how do we gain an awareness of those insufficiencies? Through prayer and repentance, of course, but also through reading. Do we have any hope of becoming more like our Creator if we cannot "modify our natural angle of regard upon all things ... to <i>see </i>[things] differently"--a vision altered, I would suggest, through reading? If we fail somehow to acquire the skill of entering into unfamiliar worlds anew, how can we avoid being trapped--literally damned--in our current imperfections, and how can we ever begin to imagine the infinities where God dwells and labors?<br><br>Eight years ago, just after I was appointed dean of the College of Humanities, Elder Henry B. Eyring, then commissioner of the Church Educational System, challenged me to spend some time pondering the answer to a simple question. He asked, "Why do we teach a book like <i>The Great Gatsby</i> at BYU?" Now there are many simplistic, snobbishly pedantic ways to dismiss the question altogether. I have chosen to take it seriously--<i>especially </i>since this devotional is being broadcast. As I have pondered Elder Eyring's question, a piece of a part of an answer has begun to crystallize in my head. Before I venture to unload it on you--and please don't get your hopes up too high!--I have to refer to a favorite passage from one of C. S. Lewis' space fantasy novels entitled <i>Perelandra.</i> In this alternate reading of the Garden of Eden calamity, Lewis conjures up a second Eve. Still innocent but learning much about her paradisiacal garden home, Eve considers the ways in which God's perspectives are superior to ours, and she muses: "When I was young I could imagine no beauty but this of our own world. But [God] can think of all, and all different" (C. S. Lewis, <i>Perelandra: A Novel</i> [New York: Scribner Paperback Fiction, 1996], 61).<br><br>Can we, I wonder, ever be gods and goddesses of our own universes, eternal parents of imperfect beings who will have to go through the mortal travails as each of us will have done, without somehow having an understanding of and even an empathy toward our flawed progeny? (An empathy better learned, I would suggest, from reading<i> Hamlet</i> than from listening to hip-hop.) How do we school ourselves to comprehend--even marvel at and love--the mental and emotional worlds of other people, since we can never live inside their heads or experience life just the way they experience it? How will perfected humans, looking down from the heights of their own Mount Olympuses, be able to observe the stupid, bungling, relentlessly sinful acts of their children and still resist the temptation to thunderbolt them all to ashes?<br><br>The training program to develop such divine restraint--or should we call it "charity"?--is, no doubt, a complex one. But I seriously doubt that the products of contemporary popular culture will show up on the syllabus of that training curriculum. Rather, I anticipate that we will need to prepare ourselves to understand the heights and depths of human experience vicariously (perhaps another of our miniscule attempts to mirror the Christ?) through our reading and expanded cultural literacy. We can begin to prepare ourselves now so that in the eternities we can spend some gloriously bright, clear days with our ancestors--discussing the books both they and we have read, listening to mutually evocative masterpieces of music, sharing a bag of perfected popcorn as we laugh at Buster Keaton, weep along with Tom and Ma Joad, and sing and dance with Fred and Ginger.<br><br>But this is about a lot more than just cool family home evenings with the eternal "fam." And why is Fitzgerald's novel about adultery, obsession, alcoholism, and murder taught at a place like BYU? Well, in part, because all those who are crowned with glory and immortality and eternal lives will have, in their own kingdoms, an array of offspring who are, in their own ways, disobedient, annoying, and horrifying. We will have to learn how to deal with an abundance of our own Jay Gatsbys and Sweeney Todds and Pol Pots and Marquises de Sade and Brian David Mitchells. Just as it is presently the work and the glory of our Father in Heaven to bring to pass <i>our </i>immortality and eternal life--in spite of all He knows about us, which is everything--we hope it will someday be <i>our</i> work and <i>our </i>glory to help provide those same blessings for countless souls who are very much unlike ourselves, and many of them will be supremely unlovable. In my experience, the best way to come to know such people--and not merely to <i>know </i>them, but to know them well enough to be able to love them beneath all the layers of their sins and imperfections--is through the instrument of good books. After all, the Lord has repeatedly instructed us to seek wisdom "out of the best books" (D&amp;amp;C 88:118; 109:7, 14).<br><br>We each have an eternal moral obligation not only to flee the wickedness that has polluted far too much of the culture of our day but also to seek after the good, the true, the virtuous, and the uplifting that has been produced in the cultures of mankind for countless centuries. None of us will be in mortality long enough to be able to experience all that is good here, so how can we afford to waste our time on the bad? Already in the cultural storehouse of humanity is a huge body of works that will help you better understand who you really are and train you how to relish the nobility as well as the sufferings of the individuals depicted in them, to glory in the quiet strains of hummable melodies, to savor the intelligent turn of lyrical phrase, and to laugh and to weep at the humanizing films of the past and the present instead of the dehumanizing mate-and-maim movies being served up on far too many local screens.<br><br>Parents can--no, in our day, parents <i>must--</i>expose their children to an endlessly regenerative menu of good entertainment that can help displace the mindless slop of the garbage heap. But it will take committed parents, siblings, and leaders who make the conscious decision to bring the past into the present, to restore the great works to life in their homes, to buy and play for their families the movies and recordings, to display the art, and to experience together the masterpieces--the pieces that I can only imagine are loved by our Lord and Master Himself. There are <i>so many</i> truly inspiring works that our forebears--often under the influence of divine inspiration--were able to create. Could it possibly be that we, without them, cannot be saved?<br><br>As disciples of Christ, we have a divine obligation to love the good and the beautiful and to keep ourselves unspotted by the bad and the ugly. In his First Presidency message in last September's <i>Ensign,</i> President Hinckley assured us:<br><br><i>The situation is far from hopeless. ... There is no need to stand still and let the filth and violence overwhelm us or to run in despair. The tide, high and menacing as it is, can be turned back if enough</i> [people] <i>will add their strength to the strength of the few who are now effectively working. I believe the challenge to oppose this evil is one from which members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, as citizens, cannot shrink.</i> [Gordon B. Hinckley, "In Opposition to Evil," <i>Ensign</i>, September 2004, 3–4]<br><br>May I encourage you to steep yourselves in the cultural riches of your ancestors. I promise you will be a better, more sensitive, more understanding and appreciative individual--a better spouse, parent, citizen, and disciple of Christ--as a result. The more links you forge with your ancestors through their culture, the richer the legacy you will have to pass along to your own children and grandchildren. Begin to teach your own children, from the earliest possible moment in their development, the intellectual, emotional, and spiritual value of reading and of cultural linkage. If we continue to lose ground against the torrent of digitized culture that moves so fast that it cannot be given a moral rating, we run the real risk of losing our souls.<br><br>I testify to you that we have a loving Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ, who atoned for the bad within us and around us so that we might fully embrace the good. I bear witness that He has the power to weld us together with all of our loved ones of all dispensations and for all eternity, and that we can draw closer to them by coming to know them as individuals who actually lived and labored, who read books and listened to music, and whose lives were shaped by their faith and by their culture. That we may, in all our labors and all our recreation, help to create welding links with those who came before us and those who will follow--links of faith, of love, and of reverence for the finest things that the human soul has created--is my sincere prayer in the name of our Savior, Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>© Brigham Young University.

<h1> Observe: the Gift of Discernment - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Sister Bednar and I are delighted to be with you. She and I have been anxiously engaged in university life for more than 30 years, and we love the young people of the Church. Time spent with you this morning is a sacred privilege for us. I now seek for and invite the assistance of the Holy Ghost as I speak with you about essential spiritual truths.<br><br>In October 1987 Elder Marvin J. Ashton, a member of the Quorum of the Twelve, spoke in general conference about spiritual gifts. I recall with fondness the impact his message had upon me at that time, and the things he taught then continue to influence me today. In his message Elder Ashton detailed and described a number of less conspicuous spiritual gifts--attributes and abilities that many of us might not have considered being spiritual gifts. For example, Elder Ashton highlighted the gifts of asking; of listening; of hearing and using a still, small voice; of being able to weep; of avoiding contention; of being agreeable; of avoiding vain repetition; of seeking that which is righteous; of looking to God for guidance; of being a disciple; of caring for others; of being able to ponder; of bearing mighty testimony; and of receiving the Holy Ghost (see Marvin J. Ashton, "There Are Many Gifts," <i>Ensign,</i> November 1987, 20–22).<br><br>This morning I want to talk with you about another seemingly simple and perhaps underappreciated spiritual gift--the capacity of being "quick to observe." I will also attempt to explain why appropriately seeking for this blessing is vitally important for you and for me in the world in which we do now and will yet live.<br><h2><b>The Spiritual Gift of Being Quick to Observe</b></h2><br>All of us have learned important lessons from the central characters in the Book of Mormon. As we read about and study the lives of Nephi, Laman, Alma, King Noah, Moroni, and many others, we discover things we should and should not do, and we realize more completely the kinds of people we should and should not become.<br><br>In my study of the Book of Mormon I have been especially impressed with a particular description of Mormon, the principal compiler of the Nephite record. The specific depiction of this noble prophet to which I would direct our attention is contained in the first five verses of the first chapter of Mormon:<br><br><i>And now I, Mormon, make a record of the things which I have both seen and heard, and call it the Book of Mormon.</i><br><br><i>And about the time that Ammaron hid up the records unto the Lord, he came unto me, (I being about ten years of age ... ) and Ammaron said unto me: I perceive that thou art a sober child, and art </i><u>quick to observe;</u><br><br><i>Therefore, when ye are about twenty and four years old I would that ye should remember the things that ye have </i><u>observed</u><i> concerning this people... .</i><br><br><i>And behold, ye shall ... engrave on the plates of Nephi all the things that ye have </i><u>observed</u><i> concerning this people.</i><br><br><i>And I, Mormon, ... remembered the things which Ammaron commanded me.</i> [Mormon 1:1–5; emphasis added]<br><br>Please note that the root word <i>observe</i> is used three times in these verses. And Mormon, even in his youth, is described as being "quick to observe" (Mormon 1:2). As you study and learn and grow during your time as a university student, I hope you also are learning about and becoming quick to observe. Your future success and happiness will in large measure be determined by this spiritual capacity.<br><br>Please consider the significance of this important spiritual gift. As used in the scriptures, the word <i>observe</i> has two primary uses. One use denotes "to look" or "to see" or "to notice"--as we learn in Isaiah 42:20: "Seeing many things, but thou <i>observest</i> not; opening the ears, but he heareth not" (emphasis added).<br><br>The second use of the word <i>observe</i> suggests "to obey" or "to keep"--as is evident in the Doctrine and Covenants: "But blessed are they who have kept the covenant and <i>observed</i> the commandment, for they shall obtain mercy" (D&amp;amp;C 54:6; emphasis added).<br><br>Thus when we are quick to observe, we promptly look or notice and obey. Both of these fundamental elements--looking and obeying--are essential to being quick to observe. And the prophet Mormon is an impressive example of this gift in action.<br><br>I now want to present several examples of the lessons that can be learned when you and I are blessed to be quick to observe.<br><br>I have a dear friend who served as a stake president. The patriarch in the stake over which he presided had experienced some health challenges and was unable to perform in his calling. The ailing patriarch had difficulty moving about and dressing and caring for himself, and his strength was limited. One Sabbath afternoon this good stake president visited the home of the patriarch to encourage him and check on his well-being. As the stake president entered the home, he found the patriarch dressed in his suit and white shirt and tie, sitting in a recliner in the front room. The stake president greeted the dear patriarch and, knowing how hard it must have been to dress himself, graciously suggested to the patriarch that it was not necessary for him to get dressed up on the Sabbath or to meet visitors. In a kind but firm voice, the patriarch reproved the stake president and said, "Don't you know that this is the only way I have left to show the Lord how much I love Him?"<br><br>The stake president was quick to observe. He both heard and felt the lesson, and he applied it. Reverence for the Sabbath day and the importance of respect and appropriate demeanor and dress took on added importance in the ministry of the stake president. The spiritual ability to see, hear, remember, and act upon that lesson was a great blessing in his life--and in the lives of many others.<br><br>Before attending her sacrament meetings, Sister Bednar frequently prays for the spiritual eyes to see those who have a need. Often as she observes the brothers and sisters and children in the congregation, she will feel a spiritual nudge to visit with or make a phone call to a particular person. And when Sister Bednar receives such an impression, she promptly responds and obeys. It often is the case that as soon as the "amen" is spoken in the benediction, she will talk with a teenager or hug a sister or, upon returning home, immediately pick up the phone and make a call. As long as I have known Sister Bednar, people have marveled at her capacity to discern and respond to their needs. Often they will ask her, "How did you know?" The spiritual gift of being quick to observe has enabled her to see and to act promptly and has been a great blessing in the lives of many people.<br><br>Your president, Elder Samuelson, participates each month in a Church Board of Education meeting in Salt Lake City. President Hinckley serves as the chair of that board. The counselors in the First Presidency, several members of the Quorum of the Twelve, and other General Authorities and general auxiliary leaders also sit on that board. During my years of service at Brigham Young University--Idaho, I also was blessed to participate in monthly board meetings.<br><br>At the conclusion of the June 2004 board of trustees meeting, President Hinckley called upon Elder David B. Haight to offer the benediction. It was the last board meeting in which Elder Haight ever participated. At the age of 97, Elder Haight had some difficulty as he tried to stand and offer the prayer.<br><br>After several attempts to rise to his feet, President Hinckley courteously said, "David, it is all right"--suggesting, I believe, that it was permissible for Elder Haight to remain in his chair and offer the prayer.<br><br>Elder Haight responded in a voice that was both firm and appropriate and said, "President, I must stand!"<br><br>There was simply no way that mighty Apostle was going to sit and pray in the presence of the First Presidency and his colleagues of the Twelve. And of greater importance, he was not going to sit as he communicated with his Heavenly Father. So once again Elder Haight worked to stand--and was successful. I shall never forget the spirit I felt as I listened to Elder Haight pray. I hope on that occasion I was quick to observe a powerful lesson about the dignity and the humility that should always attend our prayers. In my present calling I am blessed by Elder Haight's example and feel a deep sense of gratitude for what I saw and felt and learned that day.<br><br>Sister Bednar and I are acquainted with a returned missionary who had dated a special young woman for a period of time. This young man cared for the young woman very much, and he was desirous of making his relationship with her more serious. He was considering and hoping for engagement and marriage. Now this relationship was developing during the time that President Hinckley counseled the Relief Society sisters and young women of the Church to wear only one earring in each ear.<br><br>The young man waited patiently over a period of time for the young woman to remove her extra earrings, but she did not take them out. This was a valuable piece of information for this young man, and he felt unsettled about her nonresponsiveness to a prophet's pleading. For this and other reasons, he ultimately stopped dating the young woman, because he was looking for an eternal companion who had the courage to promptly and quietly obey the counsel of the prophet in all things and at all times. The young man was quick to observe that the young woman was not quick to observe.<br><br>Now before I continue, I presume that some of you might have difficulty with my last example. In fact, this particular illustration of the young man being quick to observe may even fan the flames of controversy on campus, resulting in letters of disagreement to the <i>Daily Universe</i>! You may believe the young man was too judgmental or that basing an eternally important decision, even in part, upon such a supposedly minor issue is silly or fanatical. Perhaps you are bothered because the example focuses upon a young woman who failed to respond to prophetic counsel instead of upon a young man. I simply invite you to consider and ponder the power of being quick to observe and what was actually observed in the case I just described. The issue was <i>not </i>earrings!<br><br>Now one final example. I have long been fascinated by the nature of the interaction between the Spirit of the Lord and Nephi found in chapters 11 through 14 of 1 Nephi. As you recall, Nephi desired to see and hear and know the things his father, Lehi, had seen in the vision of the tree of life (see 1 Nephi 8). In chapters 11 through 14 the Holy Ghost assisted Nephi in learning about the nature and meaning of his father's vision. Interestingly, 13 times in these chapters the Spirit of the Lord directed Nephi to "look" as a fundamental feature of the learning process. Nephi repeatedly was counseled to look, and because he was quick to observe, he beheld the tree of life (1 Nephi 11:8); the mother of the Savior (1 Nephi 11:20); the rod of iron (1 Nephi 11:25); and the Lamb of God, the Son of the Eternal Father (1 Nephi 11:21).<br><br>I have described only a few of the spiritually significant things Nephi saw. You may want to study these chapters in greater depth and learn from and about Nephi's learning. As you study and ponder, please keep in mind that Nephi would not have seen what he desired to see, he would not have known what he needed to know, and he could not have done what he ultimately needed to do if he had not been quick to observe. Brothers and sisters, that same truth applies to you and to me!<br><br>Quick to observe. Prompt to watch and to obey. A simple gift that blesses us individually and in our families and extends blessings to so many other people. Each of us can and should strive to be worthy of this significant spiritual gift--even the capacity of being quick to observe.<br><h2><b>Why the Spiritual Gift of Being Quick to Observe Is So Vital Today</b></h2><br>Let me now address the question of why the spiritual gift of being quick to observe is so vital for us in the world in which we do now and will yet live. Simply stated, being quick to observe is an antecedent to and is linked with the spiritual gift of discernment. And for you and for me, discernment is a light of protection and direction in a world that grows increasingly dark.<br><br>Much like faith precedes the miracle, much like baptism by water comes before the baptism by fire, much like gospel milk should be digested before gospel meat, much like clean hands can lead to a pure heart, and much like the ordinances of the Aaronic Priesthood are necessary before a person can receive the higher ordinances of the Melchizedek Priesthood, so being quick to observe is a prerequisite to and a preparation for the gift of discernment. We can only hope to obtain that supernal gift of discernment and its light of protection and direction if we are quick to observe--if we both look and obey.<br><br>President George Q. Cannon, who served as a counselor to four presidents of the Church, taught powerfully about the gift of discernment:<br><br><i>One of the gifts of the Gospel which the Lord has promised to those who enter into covenant with Him is the gift of discerning of spirits--a gift which is not much thought of by many and probably seldom prayed for; yet it is a gift that is of exceeding value and one that should be enjoyed by every Latter-day Saint... .</i><br><br><i>Now, the gift of discerning of spirits not only gives men and women who have it the power to discern the spirit with which others may be possessed or influenced, but it gives them the power to discern the spirit which influences themselves. They are able to detect a false spirit and also to know when the Spirit of God reigns within them. In private life this gift is of great importance to the Latter-day Saints. Possessing and exercising this gift they will not allow any evil influence to enter into their hearts or to prompt them in their thoughts, their words or their acts. They will repel it; and if perchance such a spirit should get possession of them, as soon as they witness its effects they will expel it or, in other words, refuse to be led or prompted by it.</i> [<i>Gospel Truth: Discourses and Writings of President George Q. Cannon,</i> comp. Jerreld L. Newquist (Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1974), 1:198–99]<br><br>Can we recognize how crucial this spiritual gift is in our lives today and how being quick to observe is a powerful invitation for the blessings of discernment?<br><br>President Stephen L Richards, who served as a counselor to President David O. McKay, has provided additional instruction about the nature and blessings of discernment:<br><br><i>First, I mention the gift of discernment, embodying the power to discriminate ... between right and wrong. I believe that this gift when highly developed arises largely out of an acute sensitivity to impressions--spiritual impressions, if you will--to read under the surface as it were, to detect hidden evil, and more importantly to find the good that may be concealed. The highest type of discernment is that which perceives in others and uncovers for them their better natures, the good inherent within them... .</i><br><br><i>... </i>Every member in the restored Church of Christ could have this gift if he willed to do so.<i> He could not be deceived with the sophistries of the world. He could not be led astray by pseudo-prophets and subversive cults. Even the inexperienced would recognize false teachings, in a measure at least... . We ought to be grateful every day of our lives for this sense which keeps alive a conscience which constantly alerts us to the dangers inherent in wrongdoers and sin. </i>[<i>CR,</i> April 1950, 162–63; emphasis added]<br><br>As we integrate the teachings of Presidents Cannon and Richards, we learn that the gift of discernment operates basically in four major ways.<br><br>First, as we "read under the surface," discernment helps us detect hidden error and evil in others.<br><br>Second, and more important, it helps us detect hidden errors and evil in ourselves. Thus the spiritual gift of discernment is not exclusively about discerning other people and situations, but, as President Cannon taught, it is also about discerning things as they really are within us.<br><br>Third, it helps us find and bring forth the good that may be concealed in others.<br><br>And fourth, it helps us find and bring forth the good that may be concealed in us. Oh, what a blessing and a source of protection and direction is the spiritual gift of discernment!<br><br>The teachings of Presidents Cannon and Richards concerning the power of discernment to detect hidden evil and to identify good that may be concealed become even more important to you and to me in light of a specific element of Lehi's vision. In the vision various groups of individuals were pressing forward that they might obtain the path which led unto the tree of life (see 1 Nephi 8:21). The strait and narrow path came along by the rod of iron, even to the tree (see 1 Nephi 8:20). The mists of darkness described in the vision represent the temptations of the devil which blind the eyes of the children of men and lead them into broad roads so that they are lost (see 1 Nephi 12:17). Now please pay particular attention to verse 23 in 1 Nephi 8, and let us liken this scripture to our day and the challenges we face in an increasingly wicked world:<br><br><i>And it came to pass that there arose a mist of darkness; yea, even an exceedingly great mist of darkness, insomuch that they who had commenced in the path did lose their way, that they wandered off and were lost.</i> [1 Nephi 8:23]<br><br>I repeat again for emphasis the truth that discernment is a light of protection and direction in a world that grows increasingly dark. In these latter days you and I can press forward safely and successfully through the mist of darkness and have a clear sense of spiritual direction. Discernment is so much more than recognizing right from wrong. It helps us to distinguish the relevant from the irrelevant, the important from the unimportant, and the necessary from that which is merely nice.<br><br>The gift of discernment opens to us vistas that stretch far beyond what can be seen with natural eyes or heard with natural ears. Discerning is seeing with spiritual eyes <i>and</i> feeling with the heart--seeing and feeling the falsehood of an idea or the goodness in another person. Discerning is hearing with spiritual ears <i>and</i> feeling with the heart--hearing and feeling the unspoken concern in a statement or the truthfulness of a testimony or doctrine.<br><br>I frequently have heard President Boyd K. Packer counsel members and priesthood leaders: "If all you know is what you see with your natural eyes and hear with your natural ears, then you will not know very much." His observation should help all of us to appropriately desire and seek these spiritual gifts.<br><br>Observing and discerning also enable us to assist others who are seeking to obtain the path and who desire to press forward with steadfastness in Christ. Blessed with these spiritual gifts, we will not lose our way; we will not wander off; we will not be lost. And we can only hope to obtain the supernal gift of discernment and its light of protection and direction if we are quick to observe. As Alma taught his son Helaman, "See that ye take care of these sacred things, yea, see that ye look to God and live" (Alma 37:47).<br><br>I declare my special witness that Jesus is the Christ, our Redeemer and our Savior. I know that He lives. I invoke His blessing upon each of you--that indeed you may desire to be and become quick to observe and truly discerning. In the sacred name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>David A.

<h1>- BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
When I was near your age, I had returned from serving as a missionary in Uruguay, and my wife and I were making plans for marriage. At that time foreign language missions were for a period of two and a half years. I had completed two years of college, but my memory was somewhat dulled by the passage of three years of time. I wanted then to be where you are now, so I came to BYU and spoke with the chair of the Electrical Engineering Department. His first question was to ask me to invert a matrix. Then he wrote out a simple matrix and presented me with a piece of paper to do my work. I had to confess to him that I couldn't remember how to do it. To this he replied, "Then I suggest that you go to the University of Utah." And that is where I went.<br><h2><b>Parable of the Talents</b></h2><br>That same question is not asked of students today, nor have I ever heard it asked of a prospective faculty member. The students and faculty today possess remarkable talent. A recent faculty candidate observed on his visit that the students here all seem to him to be among those who possess five talents. Of course he is referring to the parable of the talents found in Matthew:<br><br><i>For the kingdom of heaven is as a man travelling into a far country, who called his own servants, and delivered unto them his goods.</i><br><br><i>And unto one he gave five talents, to another two, and to another one; to every man according to his several ability; and straightway took his journey.</i><br><br><i>Then he that had received the five talents went and traded with the same, and made them other five talents.</i><br><br><i>And likewise he that had received two, he also gained other two.</i><br><br><i>But he that had received one went and digged in the earth, and hid his lord's money.</i> [Matthew 25:14–18]<br><br>To each of the first two, the Lord said:<br><br><i>Well done, good and faithful servant; thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord.</i> [Matthew 25:23]<br><br>But to the last servant he declared:<br><br>[I will] <i>take therefore the talent from </i>[you],<i> and give it unto him which hath ten talents.</i> [Matthew 25:28]<br><h2><b>More About Talents</b></h2><br>Many years ago explorers discovered the remains of a Roman ship that had sunk around the year a.d. 50. Inside they found what they called copper blister cakes. These cakes were made of 99.2 percent pure copper--sufficiently pure to be used as an alloy, but not pure enough to be used to make copper artifacts without further manufacturing. In other words, these copper cakes had to go through the refiner's fire before they became useful. Because the discoverers could not see much value in one of these blister cakes, it was discarded into the trash. A good friend of mine eventually retrieved it, and later it was identified by a scholar as a talent.<br><br>A talent is not a coin but rather refers to a sum of money or to a weight. As the word is used in the Old Testament, a <i>talent</i> weighed about 75 pounds. Others indicate that this word changed in the New Testament to refer to sums of money. My point in telling you about talents here today is for you to understand that a talent refers to something very large. "Five talents" refers to a significant amount of money. In today's terms a talent of gold (75 pounds) might represent something around a half million dollars. Further, the blister cake talent needs to go through the refiner's fire. A BYU faculty member recently pointed out to me the additional meaning this gives to the parable of a king who forgave one of his servants a debt of 10,000 talents. The servant subsequently demanded payment of a debt of just 100 pence that someone else owed him (see Matthew 18:23–35).<br><br>What is expected, then, from you who are blessed with many talents? In Matthew 5:16 we read, "Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven."<br><h2><b>Developing Your Talents</b></h2><br>In his book <i>Standing for Something,</i> President Gordon B. Hinckley stated:<br><br><i>It is not enough just to live, just to survive. It is incumbent on each of us to equip ourselves to do something worthwhile in society--to acquire more and more light, so that our personal light can help illuminate a darkened world. And this is made possible through learning, through educating ourselves, through progressing and growing in both mind and spirit.</i> [Gordon B. Hinckley, <i>Standing for Something</i> (New York: Times Books, 2000), 67]<br><br>As I was growing up, my mother insisted that I read regularly. She would take me down to the public library and check out about a one-foot length of books from the shelves. She typically chose biographies of great men and women. Sometimes it was painful to stay inside and read when I would rather be doing other things. But then each day I would see my mother reading, and I noted that she finished a book almost every day. That habit has stayed with her throughout her life and has blessed not only her children but her grandchildren, extended family, former students, and friends.<br><br>Today at the age of 87, my mother has grown blind, but she still "reads" constantly. She now reads by listening to audiotapes of books. Just a few days ago I asked her what books she had read recently. The list she gave me was impressive. She told me that she was rereading several of the classics, including <i>The Iliad, The Odyssey,</i> Dante's <i>Divine Comedy, Moby Dick,</i> <i>Walden,</i> etc., all intermingled with scripture and gospel study. She has made the quest for knowledge a lifelong pursuit.<br><br>I would invite each of you to study and prepare your minds and then make a commitment to develop your talents and provide a significant contribution to the world. Look around and you will find the examples of many others who have made such a contribution. This university is filled with such people. Talk to them. Find out what motivated and inspired them. Then choose a pursuit that will bless mankind, your friends, and your family. Much is expected of you. Matthew 25:29 reads, "For unto every one that hath [other talents] shall be given, and he shall have abundance: but from him that hath not [obtained other talents] shall be taken away even that which he hath."<br><h2><b>Prayer</b></h2><br>I would like to share with you some things that are important if you are to succeed in developing your talents. Prayer is perhaps one of the primary requirements in obtaining the guidance of our Heavenly Father. In this dispensation one of the first lessons that we find taught in the Doctrine and Covenants concerns prayer and seeking divine guidance. Oliver Cowdery inquired of his Heavenly Father regarding the next steps in his life, and in the response we are given an insight into the keys of asking and receiving answers to prayer (see D&amp;amp;C 6:14–15).<br><h2><b>Asking</b></h2><br>The Lord answered Oliver Cowdery with the following:<br><br><i>I say unto you, that assuredly as the Lord liveth, who is your God and your Redeemer, even so surely shall you receive a knowledge of whatsoever things you shall ask in faith, with an honest heart, believing that you shall receive.</i> [D&amp;amp;C 8:1]<br><h2><b>Receiving</b></h2><br>After we have asked in faith, we are given a promise by the Lord:<br><br><i>I will tell you in your mind and in your heart, by the Holy Ghost, which shall come upon you and which shall dwell in your heart.</i> [D&amp;amp;C 8:2]<br><br>You will all recall that Oliver failed in his attempts to translate because he did not understand two additional principles for acquiring knowledge: (1) the requirement to study it out in our minds and (2) we will feel either a burning in our bosoms if it is right or a stupor of thought if it is wrong (see D&amp;amp;C 9:7–9).<br><br>Answers to prayer do not always come quickly. Often answers come over long periods of time and in ways we do not anticipate. Some prayers may be answered immediately if we have an honest heart and the courage to ask with faith, believing that we shall receive. One such prayer is the one offered when we humbly and sincerely ask our Father in Heaven what we need to repent of. The answer will come quickly, but it takes humility, courage, and resolve to utter this kind of prayer.<br><br>Similarly, the Lord will answer your prayers about setting goals in your life and developing your talents. I have spoken with many students who have obtained such direction in their lives. Jesus said, "My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me" (John 10:27).<br><h2><b>Friends and Companions</b></h2><br>Another important issue that you will face in your journey toward developing your talents is the choice of friends. Of singular importance is the choice of an eternal companion. At one time I regularly interviewed couples who had found that right one and were ready to be married. You are likely all familiar with the questions that are asked in these interviews, but to the set of prescribed topics I added three questions.<br><br>First, I asked each person how long it had taken them to know that their fiancé was the one. Most had prayed earnestly about their feelings toward their companion. Their answers startled me, but the responses were remarkably similar. The average time, they typically indicated, was about two and a half weeks from the time they started dating.<br><br>Then came my second question: "How long did you wait before you expressed your feelings to your fiancé" Again the responses were surprising. The average time to share their feelings was about six weeks from the time they first started dating.<br><br>Now, for the third question, I asked them about how long they had waited before actually getting married. This time the answers varied greatly, but generally they chose the semester break closest to six months after they had met.<br><br>I know that statisticians would say that my results may not be statistically significant--and then only valid for the geographical area just to the south of campus--but I thought you might want to know how long some of your classmates are taking to get an answer to their prayers once they have found their eternal companion.<br><br>Besides choosing the proper mate, seek out those who will lift you and inspire you to be better. Seek colleagues who know more than you and learn from them. Remember that in the parable of the talents, each servant was given talents according to their several abilities. Learn from the talents of others.<br><h2><b>Obedience</b></h2><br>Obedience is a key to progression. The search for truth and the development of character go hand in hand. Shakespeare said, "To thine own self be true, And it must follow, as the night the day, Thou canst not then be false to any man" (William Shakespeare, <i>Hamlet, </i>act 1, scene 3, lines 78–80). Nephi set an example for us:<br><br><i>I will go and do the things which the Lord hath commanded, for I know that the Lord giveth no commandments unto the children of men, save he shall prepare a way for them that they may accomplish the thing which he commandeth them.</i> [1 Nephi 3:7]<br><br>Years ago, when I first came to BYU, I met a student from Korea. He had set lofty goals for himself, but he was rather poor and was struggling to get through school. Yet he was dedicated to the gospel and had determined that he was going to get an education and return to bless his homeland. I worked with him and even went to his home to tutor him. He was a hard worker and was obedient in all that he was asked to do. Finally, after much effort, he graduated. He worked in this local area for some time, and then I lost track of him.<br><br>Recently, nearly 25 years later, one of my colleagues brought a visitor to my office and introduced him as the executive vice president of one of the largest electronics firms in Korea. I immediately recognized him, and all of the years of our separation faded away. One of the blessings that can come from being true to the gospel is the establishment of lasting and tender friendships. As my former student and I talked, we found that our friendship had not changed. When we remain true to the gospel, our rendezvous with friends will be that way, as it was with Alma and the sons of Mosiah (see Alma 17:1–2).<br><h2><b>Your Divine Heritage</b></h2><br>Finally, I would counsel you to remember who you are--spiritual sons and daughters of your Father in Heaven. If you are true to this divine heritage, your Father will bless you.<br><br>About three years ago our college was scheduled for an inspection by our professional accreditation group. Accreditation is a critical step for a college, since it provides a certification that the graduates of academic programs meet certain standards of knowledge and practice in fields of study.<br><br>As part of our accreditation, documentation is prepared covering all aspects of study. Exams, homework, lecture outlines, and the like are assembled for scrutiny. Students and faculty are interviewed, and facilities are inspected. Then, just prior to the accreditation team's visit, the team leader called and indicated that his team would be arriving at BYU on Sunday and wanted to spend that day inspecting laboratories and classrooms and in interviewing the department chairs and senior faculty. Since I was dean, I responded that Sunday was the Sabbath and that we would all be involved in worship on that day. Further, I told him that our classrooms and laboratories were used by students for worship services, so it was not possible for their team to visit on that day.<br><br>He continued to press the issue, letting me know that the Sabbath day visit would be a requirement if we were to be accredited. Finally, an idea occurred to me. I responded that we would accommodate their team visit if they could come in the middle of the day. I was sure at that time there would be a sacrament meeting in progress in the study area of the Clyde Building and that there would be ongoing classes in the auditorium, classrooms, and laboratories.<br><br>When the time for the visit arrived, our department chairs all presented themselves in their Sunday best. The accreditation team arrived in casual attire and were startled to see that all of the young men in the building had on white shirts and ties and that all of the young women wore dresses. All of the students were better dressed than they were! Our department chairs introduced themselves, and we split up to visit different areas of the college. I took the team leader to the doorway that enters the study area. He stopped suddenly and peered through the doorway to see a young man giving a talk in sacrament meeting. He wouldn't go in, but he listened intently for a while. Then he turned to me and observed that he had rather expected that these students for their worship would be sitting around tables chatting and drinking Coke.<br><br>He then asked to go to one of our large classrooms. I escorted him to the auditorium, and we entered the room from the rear. There we observed a young lady who was standing by the side of a table adorned with a tablecloth and a flower. She was giving a Relief Society lesson, and I explained the role of the Relief Society in our Church. The next stop was similar, but this time we observed the operation of an elders quorum meeting. As we were leaving, I took the opportunity to also explain about the Sunday School. The other visitors from the accreditation team each had a similar experience.<br><br>Two days later the team met with the academic vice president for a brief oral report on the state of our college. His opening statement surprised us, for he pointed out that it was clear our students and education were firmly grounded in the gospel of Jesus Christ. Then the team members one by one were most laudatory in their reviews of both the academic programs and the students.<br><br>In 2002 a consortium of companies including General Motors, EDS, Unigraphics, and SUN made a software donation to BYU that amounted to over $300 million (Partners for the Advancement of Computer-Aided Design/Manufacturing/Engineering Education [PACE]). This donation was provided, we were told, to acknowledge the accomplishments of the students and faculty and to help them with their academic programs. We scheduled a time for the presentation that allowed us to focus on this generous gift. I am grateful to all of those students who came and supported us in such grand fashion. The PACE group was all abuzz about their visit and the celebration. Everything about that day was perfect.<br><br>Then PACE decided to make a similar donation to BYU--Idaho. This donation was somewhat smaller and amounted to about $60 million in software. Unlike BYU, BYU--Idaho had scheduled their announcement to coincide with their weekly devotional. Just prior to the time of the devotional, President Bednar had a reception for the PACE team. During that time he talked about BYU--Idaho, their unique approach to sports, and the devotional that they held regularly. He explained that it was a custom at BYU--Idaho for all of the students to hold up their scriptures at the beginning of the devotional. Then he presented a copy of the scriptures to the PACE team leader so that he wouldn't be embarrassed when the students all had their scriptures in their hands and raised them high. During the devotional President Bednar called upon the team leader to say a few words, which he gave most appropriately.<br><br>Last year this same PACE team leader asked me to attend an annual conference in New York. There I made a presentation to the other deans in attendance concerning what BYU had done with our PACE gift. After I finished, the PACE team leader related to the entire group of deans that he had a copy of the scriptures that he had received from BYU--Idaho. He told them how he valued these and recounted his wonderful experience there. Remembering who we are can have a lasting effect for good.<br><br>At BYU not too long ago, a young man approached his bishop to introduce himself. He was from the Pacific Rim and stated that his given name was Golden. Proudly he told the bishop that his parents were converts to the Church, and they had named him in honor of the General Authority whose conference talk had had such an impact upon them when they were investigating the gospel. He told how his parents wanted him to always remember the great example set by that man. As I heard this I was a little surprised, and my thoughts were likely the same as yours. Then he went on to tell his bishop that the name of that General Authority was "Golden B. Hinckley." That name has served him as a tender reminder both of what his parents expected of him and of his parents' humble origins.<br><br>I would like to close with the invitation that President Hinckley gave to the women of the Church and extend that same invitation to all of you:<br><br><i>I ... invite</i> [you] <i>to rise to the great potential within you. I do not ask that you reach beyond your capacity. I hope you will not nag yourselves with thoughts of failure. I hope you will not try to set goals far beyond your capacity to achieve. I hope you will simply do what you can do in the best way you know. If you do so, you will witness miracles come to pass.</i> [Gordon B. Hinckley, <i>Motherhood: A Heritage of Faith,</i> booklet (Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1995), 9; see also <i>TGBH,</i> 696]<br><br>I share these thoughts and leave you with my testimony that I know the Church is true. I wish you the best of blessings as you develop your talents. I say these things in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Douglas M. Chabries was a BYU professor of electrical and computer engineering when this devotional address was given on 17 May 2005.</i><br><br><i>© Brigham Young University. All rights reserved.</i>

<h1>and Changes, Burdens and Blessings - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
A well-worn and much-loved poem by Robert Frost introduces the subject. You may know the work, or perhaps you have heard only the oft-quoted last lines:<br><br><i>Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,</i><br><br><i>And sorry I could not travel both</i><br><br><i>And be one traveler, long I stood</i><br><br><i>And looked down one as far as I could</i><br><br><i>To where it bent in the undergrowth;</i><br><br><i>Then took the other, as just as fair,</i><br><br><i>And having perhaps the better claim,</i><br><br><i>Because it was grassy and wanted wear;</i><br><br><i>Though as for that, the passing there</i><br><br><i>Had worn them really about the same,</i><br><br><i>And both that morning equally lay</i><br><br><i>In leaves no step had trodden black.</i><br><br><i>Oh, I kept the first for another day!</i><br><br><i>Yet knowing how way leads on to way,</i><br><br><i>I doubted if I should ever come back.</i><br><br><i>I shall be telling this with a sigh</i><br><br><i>Somewhere ages and ages hence:</i><br><br><i>Two roads diverged in a wood, and I--</i><br><br><i>I took the one less traveled by,</i><br><br><i>And that has made all the difference.</i><br><br>[Robert Frost, "The Road Not Taken" (1916)]<br><br>Each day our literal and figurative feet carry us to places where the roads diverge, and we must choose. Some of the choices are no-brainers, in the current vernacular, while some tax our mental capacities. Some seem to be of little consequence while others appear to hold eternity in the balance and really do make "all the difference." Because we are here, in part, to learn to make righteous <i>and right</i> choices, perhaps none is trivial in the longest view. Contrast the thoughtful and deliberate approach to choices and consequences suggested by Frost's poem with the sign that Sister Griffen and I saw in Las Vegas. The sign declared, "Wedding Chapel: No Waiting, No Questions, No Thinking!" We had a good laugh at the sign as we recognized the irony in seeing it on our way to a temple wedding. But the sobering reality is that too many--in and out of the Church--think about some choices too little and fail to connect the road they choose with the place to which it leads.<br><h2><b>The Freedom to Choose</b></h2><br>Go with me to a vaguely familiar but not quite remembered place and a time too remote to contemplate, where perhaps time as we understand it had no meaning. There was one who would have denied each of us our moral agency--the freedom to choose for good or ill--in order to exalt himself. There was One, also, who saw through that ruse and declared Himself on the side of agency. The scriptures tell of a war full of casualties, except that physical death was not possible for anyone there. No, the cost--spiritual death--was far more serious. Listen to this, from John the Beloved, writing in Revelation:<br><br><i>And there was war in heaven: Michael and his angels fought against the dragon; and the dragon fought and his angels,</i><br><br><i>And prevailed not; neither was their place found any more in heaven.</i><br><br><i>And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the Devil, and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world: he was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him. </i>[Revelation 12:7–9]<br><br><i>And his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven, and did cast them to the earth.</i> [Revelation 12:4; see also D&amp;amp;C 29:36]<br><br>This bit of premortal history has been reviewed in countless talks and lessons, and it may pass glibly through the consciousness. One-third of the hosts of heaven were cast out. Think about it. How many people have you seen in your life, including on television and in movies? How many live on earth right now? One-third is an impressive number, and we haven't included in our informal census everyone who has ever lived or will ever live. In that premortal realm, the outcasts had been our brothers and sisters. I wish to elicit no sympathy here. This was serious business, and they would, after all, have betrayed us.<br><br>We are still fighting the war of agency, but it is no longer a question of whether we will be allowed to choose, for that is decided once and for all. The battle in the second estate is all about how we <i>use</i> our agency. It is still serious business.<br><br>You may say, or wish you could, "I will live my life as I see fit and will simply ignore the battle. It need not concern me." That is not an option.<br><br>Daniel Tyler, an early member of the Church, told of the visit he and Isaac Behunnin made to Joseph Smith in Nauvoo. The Prophet had recently come from imprisonment in Missouri, and he related to these brethren the persecutions he had endured, many at the hands of apostates. According to Brother Tyler's account, Brother Behunnin exclaimed:<br><br><i>"If I should leave this Church I would not do as those men have done: I would go to some remote place where Mormonism had never been heard of ... and no one would ever learn that I knew anything about it."</i><br><br>To that the Prophet Joseph responded:<br><br><i>"Brother Behunnin, you don't know what you would do. No doubt these men once thought as you do. Before you joined this Church you stood on neutral ground. When the gospel was preached good and evil were set before you. You could choose either or neither. There were two opposite masters inviting you to serve them. When you joined this Church you enlisted to serve God. When you did that you left the neutral ground, and you never can get back on to it. Should you forsake the Master you enlisted to serve it will be by the instigation of the evil one, and you will follow his dictation and be his servant."</i> [Quoted by Daniel Tyler in "Recollections of the Prophet Joseph Smith," <i>Juvenile Instructor</i> 27, no. 16 (15 August 1892): 492]<br><br>You--we--are a people of covenants. We cannot allow our choices to compromise covenants and remain on neutral ground, nor can we <i>keep</i> covenants and remain on neutral ground. We have forever left neutral ground, and our willful choices must place us on one side or the other. Fortunately, because Heavenly Father loves us, understands our imperfections, and knows that we will sometimes choose amiss, we need never remain long on the wrong side--but more on that later.<br><br>Lehi made the essential elements of agency clear:<br><br><i>Men are instructed sufficiently that they know good from evil.... </i><br><br><i>For it must needs be, that there is an opposition in all things....</i><br><br><i>Wherefore, the Lord God gave unto man that he should act for himself....</i><br><br><i>... And they are free to choose liberty and eternal life, through the great Mediator of all men, or to choose captivity and death, according to the captivity and power of the devil.</i> [2 Nephi 2:5, 11, 16, 27]<br><br>The concept is simple; the consequences are vast.<br><h2><b>The Burden of Agency</b></h2><br>Being agents unto ourselves places burdens on us that seem sometimes heavy or uncomfortable.<br><br><i>Jesus ... said, A certain man went down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and fell among thieves, which stripped him of his raiment, and wounded him, and departed, leaving him half dead.</i><br><br><i>And by chance there came down a certain priest that way: and when he saw him, he passed by on the other side.</i><br><br><i>And likewise a Levite, when he was at the place, came and looked on him, and passed by on the other side.</i><br><br><i>But a certain Samaritan, as he journeyed, came where he was: and when he saw him, he had compassion on him,</i><br><br><i>And went to him, and bound up his wounds, pouring in oil and wine, and set him on his own beast, and brought him to an inn, and took care of him.</i><br><br><i>And on the morrow when he departed, he took out two pence, and gave them to the host, and said unto him, Take care of him; and whatsoever thou spendest more, when I come again, I will repay thee.</i> [Luke 10:30–35]<br><br>Three people, three choices. Each choice was made independently, within the heart and mind of the individual--where all of our most important choices must ultimately be made. And incidentally, the "two pence" given by the Samaritan to the innkeeper amounted to two days' wages for a workman of that time--not a light commitment!<br><br>Thirty years ago, as I sat in a chapel awaiting the beginning of priesthood meeting, a group of young men--priests--sat down on the bench behind me. Outside there poured from the sky a drenching rain.<br><br>One of the young men said to another, "Did you see the woman with the flat tire on Canyon Road?"<br><br>"Yes," came the reply, in a voice full of honest concern. "We'd have stopped to help her, but we would have been late for priesthood meeting."<br><br>Two roads diverged in a driving rain--one leading to timely arrival at priesthood meeting and one to someone in distress. Were the roads equally fair? I do not suppose that any of the young men sitting behind me lost their eternal reward that day, nor do I suspect that any permanent harm came to the woman with the flat tire. No, the most troubling aspect of this experience for me is that, hearing of the woman's distress, <i>I</i> did not leave the meeting to help her. Did I figuratively "look and pass by on the other side," leaving my two pence in my pocket? It is a question I must ask myself. Perhaps you, too, have hard questions in need of honest examination.<br><br>Years later a wise stake president, speaking in a stake conference, made a statement that has been teaching me ever since. He said, "The spirit of the law is most often gained by repeated obedience to the letter of the law." I repeat, "The spirit of the law is most often gained by repeated obedience to the letter of the law." The statement brings to mind Brigham Young's comment: "It matters not whether you or I feel like praying, when the time comes to pray, <i>pray.</i> If we do not feel like it, we should pray till we <i>do</i>" (<i>JD</i> 13:155; emphasis in original). If we are to emulate the Savior, then our choices must repeatedly lead us to Christlike behavior, even when we do not feel like being Christlike. We must continually strive to behave in ways that are unnatural to the natural man, until that Christian conditioning becomes natural and we become more Christlike.<br><br>As you may recognize, I am not speaking here of the broad, overarching, and governing decisions of life--baptism, temple covenants, marriage, children, and the like--absolutely crucial as these decisions are. Many of you wear rings bearing the letters CTR for "Choose the Right." The abundant opportunities to choose the right that confront us in apparently small ways each day provide the choices that I am talking about. These are the choices that mold character and determine who, at the core, we really are. In reality they are not small. Their very importance is the <i>burden</i> of choice. But beyond the burden lies the blessing, because as we learn to make the seemingly little decisions properly, the broad, overarching, and governing decisions of life become clearer, and we make them with purer motives and greater commitment.<br><h2><b>The Choice to Change</b></h2><br>Recall Frost's lines, "Yet knowing how way leads on to way, I doubted if I should ever come back." Sometimes, though, it is necessary to come back. All roads are not created equal, and you can turn around. Inevitably, some of our choices will be poor ones, made with too little data or too much haste, too little restraint or too much fear, too little prayer or too much doubt. The good news is that there is almost no poor choice that cannot be corrected with timely action.<br><br>Amulek taught:<br><br><i>This life is the time for </i>[us]<i> to prepare to meet God.... </i><br><br><i>... Behold, if we do not improve our time while in this life, then cometh the night of darkness wherein there can be no labor performed.</i> [Alma 34:32, 33]<br><br>A careful reading of that scripture in the context of surrounding verses and footnote references reveals that the night of darkness for the unrepentant to whom Amulek refers is beyond the veil. The key to avoiding that night of darkness is timely action on this side of the veil.<i> </i>Helaman assured us that it <i>is</i> possible to wait too long to make important changes in our lives:<br><br><i>But behold, your days of probation are past; ye have procrastinated the day of your salvation until it is</i> everlastingly too late, <i>and your destruction is made sure; yea, for ye have sought all the days of your lives for that which ye could not obtain; and ye have sought for happiness in doing iniquity, which thing is contrary to the nature of that righteousness which is in our great and Eternal Head.</i> [Helaman 13:38; emphasis added]<br><br>The warning is clearly serious. Nevertheless I suspect that it is "everlastingly too late" for none of you. For the present, time is on your side, and you have the choice to change.<br><br>Some time past I received an unusual package in the mail. It contained a small crystal and a letter. The letter said something like this:<br><br><i>I was a student in your mineralogy class a few years ago. I saw this crystal in the lab and wanted it. It seemed that there were other, similar specimens and that this one wouldn't be needed or missed, so I took it.</i><br><br>The letter went on to describe the burden of remorse that had grown over those years. In my mind's eye a desk drawer is opened at home, and a BYU graduate shrinks from this innocuous little crystal. It is moved to a less frequently accessed drawer, but weeks or months later, the same thing happens, almost unexpectedly. Finally, so much of self-worth and self-respect seems to ride on a nearly worthless little piece of inorganic stuff that this intrinsically good person <i>must</i> return the crystal.<br><br>I felt a little emotional as I read the letter and imagined this person carrying the weight of senseless guilt for so long. Then, as I recognized what I was feeling, words of scripture came to mind: "And how great is his joy in the soul that repenteth!" (D&amp;amp;C 18:13). Truly His yoke is easy and His burden is light. My former student made a choice to change. That choice is open to every one of us; only the specific nature of the change varies.<br><br>A word about the meaning of <i>change</i> may be in order. In the heyday of lightbulb jokes, there was one that went about the Church:<br><br>How many bishops does it take to change a lightbulb?<br><br>The answer: Just one, but the lightbulb really has to <i>want</i> to change.<br><br>I don't know whether one can speak of a "true" joke, but that one comes close.<br><br>The prophet Mormon, recording in his own short book the carnage of a final struggle between two godless foes, wrote of the mourning that overcame his people as they sensed impending destruction. He became optimistic about their apparent repentance and rejoiced in the possibility that the Lord would once again save them from themselves. Then he wrote:<br><br><i>But behold this my joy was vain, for their sorrowing was not unto repentance, because of the goodness of God; but it was rather the sorrowing of the damned, because the Lord would not always suffer them to take happiness in sin.</i> [Mormon 2:13]<br><br>The message of Mormon's observation is that repentance, while it generally <i>involves</i> a change in behavior, is more than a mere change in behavior. "The Lord looketh on the heart" (1 Samuel 16:7). It really is the heart that counts. Would I advise people to change bad behavior for the wrong reason? Change bad behavior for<i> any</i> reason and perhaps real repentance will eventually follow. But in the end God looks on what I, in others, cannot. He "looketh on the heart." When our actions fall short but our hearts are right in His sight, then the Atonement of His Only Begotten Son provides compensation for our deficiencies.<br><h2><b>Choosing to Be</b></h2><br>We have considered the gift of agency, some of the burdens of agency, and choosing to change for the better. If you have spent any significant time on this planet, or have even gone to kindergarten, you understand that no one gets to choose in everything. Life thrusts upon all of us circumstances that are not of our choosing. We deal with the loss of loved ones, personal illness, and many other situations we would not have chosen for ourselves. It is not capricious chance or even personal trials but conscious choices that "prove them herewith, to see if they will do all things whatsoever the Lord their God shall command them" (Abraham 3:25). That is why we are here. Our afflictions and challenges may not always be entirely within our control, but the most important parts of us--our minds and our hearts--are, or can be. If you doubt that, read. Start with Natan Sharansky or Elie Wiesel--or Joseph Smith.<br><br>Life for most of us is a recursive exercise--that is, we make choices that result in consequences, and what we thus learn helps us to make better choices. As we repeat this process, we learn to make choices that produce positive consequences--or at least consequences we can live with. This recursive procedure generally results in eventually being faced with fewer choices between good and evil and more between good and good, especially for those whose lives are significantly influenced by the Light of Christ.<br><br>We are presented with so many apparently worthy activities on which to spend our time and energy that it may seem as if we can hardly go wrong. Be cautious here. We can choose to be so involved in <i>good</i> things that we exclude from our lives the <i>essential</i> things. Others have referred to the pitfalls of becoming engaged in the thick of thin things. In all of our lives there are things we <i>must</i> do and time we <i>must</i> spend doing them, and other things that we <i>choose</i> to do with our discretionary time. May I suggest a question that should inform every decision about how we will spend substantial discretionary time? It is this: "Will this choice lead me toward what I want to be (not just what I want to <i>do</i> but what I want to <i>be</i>)?" In reality, our most important choices are not about what we will do but about what we will be.<br><br>Two examples will illustrate what I mean. On a 1997 flight across the Atlantic to attend a scientific conference in Aberdeen, Scotland, I sat immediately behind two women. At some point during the long flight they began conversing in good English, tinged with some sort of European accent I couldn't quite place. Their conversation was rather loud because of the jet engines, and although I should have done my best not to listen in, I confess that they caught my attention, and what they said still does. They spoke critically of Americans for lack of depth in their relationships with people.<br><br>One said, "The first thing that an American wants to know about a person who has just been introduced is what the person does for a living."<br><br>"Yes," concurred the other, "that seems to form their basis for personal judgments. They aren't interested in who a person really <i>is</i> beyond his occupation."<br><br>As I pondered their evaluation, I found myself realizing, uncomfortably, that they might be more right than I wanted to admit. For much of the remainder of the flight I pondered these two questions: (1) Beyond those aspects of my life that are connected with my work at BYU, who am I? and (2) Isn't what I am more than merely what I do? The intellectual answers to those questions are easy. The operational answers can be challenging.<br><br>A second illustration comes from Elder Boyd K. Packer, Acting President of the Quorum of the Twelve:<br><br><i>Once in a stake meeting, I noticed a larger than usual number of older members, most of them widows. I mentioned to the stake president how impressive they were.</i><br><br><i>The president replied, "Yes, but they are not active in the Church," meaning they did not serve as leaders or teachers. He spoke as though they were a burden.</i><br><br><i>I repeated his words, "Not active in the Church?" and asked, "Are they active in the gospel?" He did not quite understand the difference at first.</i><br><br><i>Like many of us, he concentrated so much on what people</i> do <i>that he overlooked what they</i> are. ["The Golden Years," <i>Ensign,</i> May 2003, 82; emphasis in original]<br><br>Elder Russell M. Nelson of the Quorum of the Twelve has put it this way:<br><br><i>It is important to know who you are and who you may become. It is more important than what you do, vital as your work is. You pursue an education to prepare for life's work, but you also need to prepare for life--eternal life. I emphasize this because some people on life's journey forget who they really are and what is really important. Without sure identity and priority, blessings that matter most are at the mercy of things that matter least.</i> ["Identity, Priority, and Blessings," <i>Ensign,</i> August 2001, 6]<br><br>So I invite you, once again, to examine your choices and ask, "Will this choice lead me toward what I want to be--not just to <i>do</i> but to <i>be?"</i> A few minutes ago I said that the abundant opportunities to choose the right that confront us in apparently small ways each day provide the choices that mold character and determine who, at the core, we really<i> </i>are. Do you understand how important it is that you not just do something but that you be someone? In the long run, who you really are will matter more than what you have done. Those are not entirely unrelated, of course, but who we are, in the end, is more than a mere list of accomplishments captured on a réé. Might that be what the Savior meant when He said:<br><br><i>Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? and in thy name have cast out devils? and in thy name done many wonderful works?</i><br><br><i>And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you: depart from me, ye that work iniquity.</i> [Matthew 7:22–23]<br><br>Perhaps you now are expecting a convenient checklist of criteria that will lead you to the right choices in your lives. Although I can offer a listening ear and my own fallible advice, I cannot make your choices for you, nor can I dictate how you should make them. That, you will recall, was someone else's plan. Repeatedly throughout your days, two roads--appearing equally fair--will diverge in a yellow wood or in a driving rain or in whatever your circumstances happen to be at the time, and you will have to choose.<br><br>Experience suggests that almost always, not far down the road, you will know whether your choice was right. Furthermore, very few of life's poor choices cannot be rectified; you can turn around, though doing so takes resolve and may be painful. If you strive to repeatedly make choices that lead you to become what our Father in Heaven wants you to be (not just to do but to be), then the words of the Apostle John describe your destiny:<br><br><i>Beloved, now are we the</i> [children] <i>of God, and it doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when he shall appear, we shall be like him.</i> [1 John 3:2]<br><br>As you choose your roads, may you make agency your ally, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Dana T. Griffen was a professor of geology and associate dean of the College of Physical and Mathematical Sciences at BYU when this devotional address was given on 31 May 2005.</i><br><br><i>© Brigham Young University.

<h1>ing the Lord and His Healing Influence in the Book of Mormon and in Our Own Lives - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Recently some of my colleagues and I were walking up the ninth hole of a local golf course after practicing for our annual student/faculty department tournament. One of my friends commented, "Well, we just ruined a good walk." It seems that happens frequently when I combine a walk with golf. In contrast, I hope that our "walk" together this hour will be edifying for each of us.<br><br>President Ezra Taft Benson declared that the Book of Mormon would be the main instrument in the latter-day gathering of people to Christ. It was true for me in my conversion to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints some 37 years ago. I have grown to love the book and Him of whom the book testifies.<br><br>Nephi, in the opening chapter, declares his intent in writing when he says, "I, Nephi, will show unto you that the tender mercies of the Lord are over all those whom he hath chosen" (1 Nephi 1:20). Moroni, in the last chapter of the book, invites us to receive the record by willfully casting away unbelief and to ask God of its truthfulness as it describes "how merciful the Lord hath been unto the children of men" (Moroni 10:3). Hence the first and last chapters provide the reason why the authors and preservers of the plates labored for us to have this great record. When I am privileged to teach a Book of Mormon class, I tell the students that if they do not find the Savior and the reference to His mercy and healing influence in all that they will read, they will have missed the point that the authors and editors were making.<br><br>I will discuss both Book of Mormon and modern examples of how the Savior's teachings and/or the extension of His mercy through His unselfish act of the Atonement brought healing. As I do so, please ponder your own experiences in order to "liken all scriptures unto us" (1 Nephi 19:23).<br><br>King Benjamin described his people as "a diligent people in keeping the commandments of the Lord" (Mosiah 1:11). King Benjamin subsequently told about being visited by an angel who taught him "glad tidings of great joy" concerning Christ (Mosiah 3:3). He gathered his people for a final address and spoke to them about the Atonement and of our divine indebtedness. He taught that all we can attempt to give back to the Father and the Son is our gratitude, obedience, and service. Following this great discourse, his people fell to the earth because "they had viewed themselves in their own carnal state, even less than the dust of the earth" (Mosiah 4:2). Even though they had been diligent in keeping God's commandments, after hearing about the Savior's mission, their hearts were changed.<br><br>I sometimes find myself caught up in the busyness of life and the sometimes seemingly blind obedience to rules that comes, as Jacob warned, from "looking beyond the mark" (Jacob 4:14). President Benson's counsel to daily feast on the Book of Mormon and on its testimony of Jesus helps me to focus on what matters most in my life: my relationship with the Father and the Son.<br><br>Buried in the war chapters in the book of Alma, there is a wonderful lesson about the healing influence of the Savior. At one point the sons of King Mosiah are described as being "the very vilest of sinners," but "the Lord saw fit in his infinite mercy to spare them" (Mosiah 28:4). After their change-of-heart experience, they asked to go "impart the word of God to their brethren, the Lamanites. . . . For they could not bear that any human soul should perish" (Mosiah 28:1, 3). Later in the record, Mormon described the great general Moroni: "If all men had been, and were, and ever would be, like unto Moroni, behold, the very powers of hell would have been shaken forever" (Alma 48:17). Mormon obviously had some tender feelings for this man and probably even named his own son after him. But Mormon, wanting to teach an important lesson, added these words in the next verse:<br><br><i>Behold, he was a man like unto Ammon, the son of Mosiah, yea, and even the other sons of Mosiah, yea, and also Alma and his sons, for they were all men of God.</i> [Alma 48:18]<br><br>The sons of Mosiah went from being "the very vilest of sinners" to being men like Moroni and "men of God." This was only possible because of the Atonement and the life-changing, healing influence it has on the children of men.<br><br>All of us will feel the pain of sin and transgression in our lives. The Savior's act of redemption can take away that pain. I have witnessed this marvelous experience as individuals have accepted the Lord, repented, asked His forgiveness, and then felt the tremendous burden of guilt be washed away. Rebellious young people have turned to the Lord and served wonderful missions. Couples struggling with pride and selfishness have humbled themselves and invited the Lord to help them find solutions to their relationship problems. I acknowledge and express gratitude for the Savior's role in my own conversion and for the daily application of His forgiveness in my life.<br><br>Alma the Younger went to the people of Ammonihah to "preach the word of God" and bear "pure testimony" (Alma 4:19). He was directed to the home of Amulek, who fed and cared for him. Later, Amulek defended Alma as "a holy man" and witnessed: "He hath blessed me, and my women, and my children" (Alma 10:9, 11). Alma and Amulek were bound and placed in prison for their preaching. Those that believed on their words were stoned and cast out of the city. Alma and Amulek were then forced to watch the martyrdom of the wives and children of the believers. "And when Amulek saw the pains of the women and children who were consuming in the fire, he also was pained" (Alma 14:10). During one reading of this account, I wondered where Amulek's own wife and children were and considered the possibility that he might have watched them die in the fire. We read later in the account that Alma "took him [Amulek] to his own house, and did administer unto him in his tribulations, and strengthened him in the Lord" (Alma 15:18).<br><br>Three years ago I lost both of my parents. Although not members of our faith, they had led good, Christian lives. My father passed away 30 days short of their 66th wedding anniversary, and my mother died exactly 30 days after that anniversary date. A little over a year later, my wife, some of our children, and I gathered in the Provo Temple to perform sacred ordinances for them and for me to be sealed to them. I will ever be grateful for the Lord's healing influence at the time of their deaths and for His sustaining spirit as we met for that sweet experience in the temple. I know that the Savior loosed the "bands of death" and made it possible to again be with our departed loved ones.<br><br>Sometime following the destruction that attended the Savior's Crucifixion, a group of Nephites gathered at the temple in Bountiful. While there, they heard a voice that said, "Behold my Beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased" (3 Nephi 11:7). Then they witnessed the Savior descending out of heaven and declaring:<br><br><i>Behold, I am Jesus Christ, whom the prophets testified shall come into the world.</i><br><br><i>And behold, I am the light and the life of the world; and I have drunk out of that bitter cup which the Father hath given me, and have glorified the Father in taking upon me the sins of the world, in the which I have suffered the will of the Father in all things from the beginning</i>. [3 Nephi 11:10–11]<br><br>His first words on that glorious occasion addressed His obedience to His Father's will. It is also interesting to note that from the first words that we have recorded about His premortal existence, we learn that the Savior volunteered to go and perform the Father's work. The first words that we have of His mortal life are to tell His mortal mother that He must be about His Father's business. And among the last words that we have of His mortal life is His stated willingness to submit to the Father's will instead of to His own.<br><br>What is so important for you and me to know and understand about Him--not only doing but also <i>wanting</i> to do the will of the Father? Certainly we need to learn that the Savior placed a premium on obedience and sacrifice and that we should as well. Another important lesson is that He loved the Father and us more than Himself. The Savior demonstrated that love to the people at Bountiful when He invited them to come forth "one by one" to feel the wounds in his side, hands, and feet (3 Nephi 11:15) and then later as He blessed their sick and afflicted and "their little children, one by one" (3 Nephi 17:21). Yet another lesson is found in His statement "For the works which ye have seen me do that shall ye also do" (3 Nephi 27:21). If we want to yield our will to the Father's, we must live the laws of obedience and sacrifice and let our love for the Father and the Son govern our thoughts and actions.<br><br>As I was finishing graduate school years ago, I was blessed with several job offers. My wife and I were trying to decide where we wanted to live instead of where the Lord wanted us to live. We prayed for another offer that would allow us to live close to both of our families. The offer didn't come, and we grew a bit frustrated and impatient. One day while my wife was sitting in Relief Society, her thoughts became more focused on the Savior's will instead of on her own, and almost immediately she saw the words written in her mind of the location of the offer that we were to accept. When she told me of her experience, my own prayers changed and I was blessed with a similar confirmation. We accepted that offer, and the associations and the experiences that have resulted have enriched our lives. I'm grateful for a wife whose love for the Lord and desire to do His will guide her thoughts and actions and help me with mine.<br><br>Near the end of the Book of Mormon, we read of the great social, political, and personal unrest in which the prophet Mormon lived. Indeed, Mormon said, "A continual scene of wickedness and abominations has been before mine eyes ever since I have been sufficient to behold the ways of man" (Mormon 2:18). Nevertheless, Mormon went on to write to<br><br><i>the peaceable followers of Christ . . . that have obtained a sufficient hope by which ye can enter into the rest of the Lord, from this time henceforth until ye shall rest with him in heaven.</i> [Moroni 7:3]<br><br>Note that there are two "rests" mentioned in this verse. The first reference suggests that we can experience "the rest of the Lord" in this life. We live in a time in which cherished values are being sacrificed under the guise of self-serving interpretations of words like <i>tolerance</i> and <i>acceptance</i> and when physical and spiritual warfare dominates news headlines. But in all of the confusion, in all of the mounting turmoil and unrest, faith in the Lord Jesus Christ can lead us to a "peaceable walk with the children of men" (Moroni 7:4). I find it interesting and reassuring to note that Joseph Smith received section 87 (often referred to as the revelation on war) on the 25th of December--the day the world celebrates the birth of Him who provides our needed hope and peace. I testify that He is willing to provide help with all of our concerns, however large or small they may appear.<br><br>Several years ago I was on a consulting assignment to provide three weeks of professional engineering training in London. I was traveling with carry-ons, two large suitcases, and several boxes of workshop materials. As I was making arrangements to get on London's underground transportation that would take me from the airport to my hotel, I heard a message that unattended luggage would be seized and individuals detained for questioning. I knew that I could not get off the train without leaving pieces of my luggage unattended. I began to pray and ask the Lord for help. Not long before my stop, I was amazed to see two young men dressed in suits with our Church's missionary name tags get on the large train with its several passenger cars and sit down next to <i>me!</i> I was further amazed to discover that they were getting off at my stop! As you can imagine, I offered a silent prayer of gratitude. My anxiety in this situation may seem trivial compared to the anxiety and stress that we live in today, but it was a testimony of the Lord's awareness of my plight and His willingness to help. I am certain that He is anxious to help each of us in our "peaceable walk with the children of men."<br><br>After the terrible battle at Cumorah, Moroni assumed responsibility of the records and noted that he had "but few things to write" (Mormon 8:1). We get a sense of his despair when he wrote:<br><br><i>I even remain alone to write the sad tale of the destruction of my people. . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . Whither I go it mattereth not.</i><br><br><i>. . . My father hath been slain in battle, and all my kinsfolk, and I have not friends nor whither to go; and how long the Lord will suffer that I may live I know not.</i> [Mormon 8:3–5]<br><br>He was discouraged and without hope and even appeared to have ended his record when he wrote, "I make an end of speaking concerning this people" (Mormon 8:13). But he lived for another 20-plus years and added much to the plates. In his additional comments, his tone appears to be transformed as he provides some of the most profound comments on faith, hope, and charity that we have in all scripture. What caused the change? Listen to what he wrote to us: "And then shall ye know that I have seen Jesus, and that he hath talked with me face to face" (Ether 12:39).<br><br>When the Lord is our companion, as I believe He was for Moroni, we are never alone. The Savior knew what it was like to be left alone when He worked out the Atonement. He provided the companionship and comfort that Moroni needed during this difficult time. Many people, for a variety of reasons, experience feelings of loneliness during their lives. The Lord in His infinite mercy can provide the solace that all such people are desperately seeking.<br><br>A story told by President Steve Studdert at a session of the Mount Timpanogos Temple dedication dramatically illustrates this. I repeat it with his permission. Before the temple dedication, the First Presidency invited the residents of the Utah State Developmental Center to a special open house of the temple. This center houses severely mentally and physically disabled sons and daughters of our Heavenly Father. I now quote from President Studdert's account:<br><br><i>There was a man in his mid-sixties in the center. He had been there since age eight, and it had been 15 years since any family members had been to visit him. They had understandably quit coming because he never spoke to them, never showed any indication of recognition, and never expressed anything whatsoever to them. But on that morning the Spirit worked on this man's brother, also in his mid-sixties, that today was the day for that overdue visit.</i><br><br><i>Together with his wife, somewhat apprehensively the brother walked into the room of his handicapped younger brother, not knowing what to expect. The brother, who we will respectfully call Fred, was dressed in his best clothes and waiting somewhat impatiently in his wheelchair. Seeing his older brother, Fred immediately broke into a wide smile, stood up, and embraced him with a not-so-gentle bear hug. There was sweet recognition for the first time ever.</i><br><br><i>So with a happy eye toward the temple, they ventured out. As Fred's wheelchair was pushed across the street, he began to become increasingly unsettled. His brother became concerned, recognizing that Fred had not left his residence for many years and that maybe this unusual experience or the crowds were too much for him. They considered returning Fred to his residence, but the Spirit whispered, "Carry on." As they entered the temple, Fred seemingly grew even more agitated. But they felt impressed to continue.</i><br><br><i>About 50 feet behind the temple recommend desk is a beautiful painting of the Savior depicted as a shepherd lovingly holding in His protective arms a small black lamb, symbolic of a tender lost lamb. This particular</i> [Minerva Teichert] <i>painting had never before been displayed in any temple.</i><br><br><i>As the three of them approached this powerful painting, Fred stopped his wheelchair and looked upward at the painting. And then in a voice as clear as any voice ever heard,</i> [he] <i>spoke one simple word: "Jesus." This was the first understandable word anyone had ever heard him speak in his entire life, and he did so with certainty, clarity, and knowledge. He then folded his arms in the same manner as the Savior's arms in the painting.</i><br><br><i>In that moment he grew silent and calm; peace flooded over his anxious mind and nervous body. His arms relaxed and remained firmly folded as were the Savior's. They proceeded on the tour of the temple, quiet and reverential.</i><br><br><i>On the wide sidewalls of the magnificent celestial room are large mirrors. As they reached that point in the tour, Fred stopped the wheelchair and stood. Without movement or speech, he looked for several minutes into those mirrors. It was as if he were looking into an unseen eternity.</i> [And, if I might interject, possibly seeing a time in the future when the Resurrection will make him whole.] <i>Then he sat in his wheelchair, again folded his arms as did the Savior in the painting, and remained quiet all the way back to his room. . . .</i><br><br><i>Since that day in the Lord's house, Fred has never again spoken an understandable word. The only word he has ever spoken is "Jesus."</i> [Stephen M. Studdert, personal account]<br><br>This incredible story illustrates to me the love that the Savior has for each of us. No one goes unnoticed. He is aware of everyone and of everyone's concerns. Even when it seems like people can't or won't respond to His attempts to reach out to them, He continues to communicate His love.<br><br>I bear testimony that the Lord is mindful of each of us, and if we come to Him, we can find peace and hope in our times of need.<br><br><i>For can a woman forget her sucking child, that she should not have compassion on the son of her womb? Yea, they may forget, yet will I not forget thee, O house of Israel.</i><br><br><i>Behold, I have graven thee upon the palms of my hands.</i> [1 Nephi 21:15–16]<br><br>The Book of Mormon does testify of Christ and His healing influence. I am grateful for the authors and the preservers of the plates who made it possible for us to read these marvelous accounts of the Lord extending the arms of His love to those in need. It was written for our day when we need similar applications of His mercy. Like Nephi of old, I declare that<br><br><i>he shall rise from the dead, with healing in his wings. . . . Wherefore, my soul delighteth to prophesy concerning him, . . . and my heart doth magnify his holy name</i>. [2 Nephi 25:13]<br><br>We are divinely and eternally indebted to Him. I pray that we will love Him as He loved us and demonstrate that love through our gratitude, obedience, and service. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Ronald E. Terry was a BYU professor of chemical engineering when this devotional address was given on 7 June 2005.</i><br><br><i>©Brigham Young University. All rights reserved.</i>

<br>
I would like to talk with you about a subject that you may think you know a lot about: truth. I would like to base my talk on a number of scriptures that talk about truth.<br><br>The first is in John 18. There is a key question in these verses that I always found curious. Christ was tried before Caiphas and then brought to Pilate, because the Jewish Sanhedrin did not have the power to sentence anyone to death. After some interchange His accusers told Pilate that Christ claimed to be King of the Jews, a crime of treason but not the crime Caiphas was concerned about, which was blasphemy. Pilate asked Christ if the accusation of treason was true, and Christ explained that His kingdom was not of this world and added, "Every one that is of the truth heareth my voice" (verse 37). Then Pilate responded with the question "What is truth?" (verse 38).<br><br>A few years ago you all watched the news as President Clinton's problems with Monica Lewinsky unfolded. What was odd about the event to me was that both sides of the argument had identical facts. One side looked at the facts and said, "Clinton is a flawed but great leader." The other side looked at exactly the same facts and said, "Clinton is a liar and guilty of a felony--he should be thrown out." What was the truth? It was the same set of facts.<br><br>The point is that truth is not just a set of facts. Truth has something to do with your attitudes and philosophy and the way you have of looking at the world. Note that in verse 37, Christ makes an interesting statement: He indicates that we must be "of the truth" to really hear His voice. I think He is referring to this point about truth being more than a set of facts, that you have to have the right attitude and value system and be somehow "of the truth," as the scripture describes, to understand truth.<br><br>The second scripture is found in John 8. The chapter begins with the woman taken in adultery. Immediately following the incident, Christ says that He is "the light of the world" (verse 12). The Pharisees argue that his record is not true, but Christ goes on to talk about how you can know truth and how knowing His Father is really the only way to know truth (see John 8:13–18, 26–29).<br><br><i>As he spake these words, many believed on him.</i><br><br><i>Then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him, If ye continue in my word, then are ye my disciples indeed;</i><br><br><i>And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.</i> [John 8:30–32]<br><br>Several years ago I was a PhD student at Stanford University and was teaching in the MBA program at the University of Santa Clara, a Jesuit school. The leaders of the school were Jesuit priests, and I can honestly tell you they were some of the most insightful people I have ever met. At the same time there was a national controversy going on about the feminist movement. A very outspoken feminist in the Church--Sonia Johnson, for those of you who may have heard her name--was bitterly attacking the Church and its leaders. She went through an excommunication hearing. All of the national news media were gathered around the Church building where the bishop had asked her to come in for the hearing and were upset that they weren't allowed into the hearing with the bishopric. The National Organization of Women wanted to provide lawyers to help her argue her case with the bishop. She was ultimately excommunicated.<br><br>Soon after the excommunication she went around the country giving speeches. She came to the University of Santa Clara, gave a speech, and had a question-and-answer period following the speech. One of the young students in the audience stood and said, "It must be hard to leave your Church." (Remember, this university is roughly a Catholic equivalent of BYU.) He then asked, "How did it feel?"<br><br>Sonia gave a fascinating response. She said she reacted differently than she expected--she felt free.<br><br>Huh?<br><br>See, before, she had to believe God was a man; now she was free to believe God was a woman. Before, she had to believe her salvation depended on a man--Christ. Now she was free to believe anything she wanted to believe. She was exhilarated! She felt free!<br><br>I thought about that response a long time. I had trouble reconciling it with Christ's concept of truth making us free. And then a thought hit me. Truth is terribly constraining. You see, if 2 + 2 = 4, then we are not free to believe that the total is 5 or 10 or 103. Only one right answer is constraining. You can believe anything you want, but on the other hand, if you want to be free to build a rocket that is capable of flying to the moon, then you had better believe 2 + 2 = 4. Without the terribly constraining nature of truth, we could not be free to do anything!<br><br>In high school I did my homework, I didn't sluff class, and I was terribly constrained. A lot of kids laughed at me (and others like me) because we didn't have any freedom. They had freedom: they sluffed class, didn't do any homework, smoked, and drank if they felt like it. We didn't have freedom: we only did what we were told to do--according to them.<br><br>It is interesting to look at the same issue several years later. I graduated with a good GPA, got a scholarship, and had a big choice of schools I could attend and a wide selection of majors. As time went on I worked hard and had freedom to do anything I wanted to do. I was constantly faced with a bewildering set of choices. I had more and more freedom to do more and more things. Some of those who thought I had no freedom in high school didn't graduate from high school, couldn't get a good job, couldn't afford a house, and couldn't go back to school because they were earning so little they didn't have enough time or money. Over time they had less and less freedom. I am sure they feel trapped today.<br><br>The same is true in the gospel. Doing what you are asked to do may seem like anything but freedom. But you see, God gives us commandments because He wants us to be free. Suppose you knew a child better than the child could possibly know himself, and you knew that the only thing that would make that child truly happy would be to, say, become a neurosurgeon. What would you tell the child to do? Go to school, don't sluff, take the hard classes, get good grades--terribly confining stuff. But did you give him the commandments to make him miserable? No, you gave him the commandments because you knew that the only way he was going to be free to achieve the greatest possible happiness and do what he really wanted to do--if he only knew it himself--was to follow your rules.<br><br>It is the same way with God. Truth may appear to be irritatingly confining--think of the BYU Dress and Grooming Standards and the Honor Code. Other schools look at us and laugh, just the way my high school friends used to look at me and laugh. Now the greatest agony of my high school friends who thought they were free is knowing what might have been. I believe the greatest agony of mortality and eternity is knowing what might have been. Note that the LDS version of hell, "outer darkness," is only for those who know the truth and reject it. Knowing the inexpressible joy that might have been and never experiencing it can certainly be expressed as the agony that is much like being in eternal torment or, as the scriptures often put it in a metaphor, "burning."<br><br>Don't go through the agony of knowing what might have been when it is too late. Learn the truth now. Obey the truth. I promise you and, more important, the Lord--who knows you better than you know yourself--also promises you that you will achieve a happiness so great, so awesome, so far beyond anything you can imagine you simply cannot comprehend it. If you really understood that truth, you would sacrifice anything--everything--to achieve it. Understanding this truth is central to your purpose for being on the planet.<br><br>I want you to imagine yourself as a missionary. You have just been made senior companion and you have a new greenie who barely speaks the language. You have been teaching a young mother and her two small children. Her husband is not interested in the Church and has not been meeting with you, but she and her children have been attending church, and she has developed a deep testimony. They love the members and the joy that the Church and the gospel bring into their lives and have accepted the baptismal challenge.<br><br>One Sunday you go to church and she is not there, even though she promised you a couple of days earlier that she would be. You are concerned that she might be ill, so after church you go to her apartment. She meets you at the door, and she does not appear to be ill. You chat for a minute and ask if you can come in. She reluctantly lets you in the door. After a couple of minutes of chatting you ask her why she wasn't at church. She looks down and says nothing for two minutes. Two minutes can be an eternity without a word being spoken. In a broken voice she weeps and says that if they go to church anymore her husband will leave them.<br><br>Now I want you to think for a moment about what you will say. I hope you realize that there is not a memorized dialogue learned in the Missionary Training Center you can roll off the end of a glib tongue and expect to solve the problem. There is no canned approach you learned in some university class that will work. In fact, what might be exactly the right thing to say to one person in that situation may be exactly the wrong thing to say to another person who appears to be in the identical situation.<br><br>There is only one way you can know what to say. Someone who knows that person and that situation better than you could possibly know or understand has to tell you what to say. The wrong words have the potential to destroy the life situation of that mother and her children. The Lord through His Spirit has to tell you what to say.<br><br>That means that you have to be able to hear what the Lord wants to tell you. And that requires a clear channel between you and Him. That means that you have to be clean and pure and able to hear His voice. You have to be "of the truth" in a very real sense.<br><br>One of my favorite authors is C. S. Lewis. He wrote a set of children's books called <i>The Chronicles of Narnia,</i> which reflect his powerful Christian beliefs. In one of these books, a selfish boy is transformed into a dragon but still has on his bracelet, which is way too small for a dragon. He cannot get it off, and it hurts terribly. In this part of the book called "The Voyage of the <i>Dawn Treader,</i>" Eustace is recounting the story to his cousin Edmund. I should note that the lion in this series of books represents the Christ figure. Let me read:<br><br>"<i>Well, last night I was more miserable than ever. And that beastly arm-ring was hurting like anything--"</i><br><br><i>"Is that all right now?"</i><br><br><i>Eustace laughed--a different laugh from any Edmund had heard him give before--and slipped the bracelet easily off his arm. "There it is," he said, "and anyone who likes can have it as far as I'm concerned. Well, as I say, I was lying awake and wondering what on earth would become of me. And then--but, mind you, it may have been all a dream. I don't know."</i><br><br><i>"Go on," said Edmund, with considerable patience.</i><br><br><i>"Well, anyway, I looked up and saw the very last thing I expected: a huge lion coming slowly towards me. And one queer thing was that there was no moon last night, but there was moonlight where the lion was. So it came nearer and nearer. I was terribly afraid of it. You may think that, being a dragon, I could have knocked any lion out easily enough. But it wasn't that kind of fear. I wasn't afraid of it eating me, I was just afraid of </i>it--<i>if you can understand. Well, it came close up to me and looked straight into my eyes. And I shut my eyes tight. But that wasn't any good because it told me to follow it." ...</i><br><br><i>"... And I knew I'd have to do what it told me, so I got up and followed it. And it led me a long way into the mountains. ... So at last we came to the top of a mountain I'd never seen before and on the top of this mountain there was a garden--trees and fruit and everything. In the middle of it there was a well.</i><br><br><i>"... The water was as clear as anything and I thought if I could get in there and bathe, it would ease the pain in my leg. But the lion told me I must undress first....</i><br><br><i>"I was just going to say that I couldn't undress because I hadn't any clothes on when I suddenly thought that dragons are snaky sort of things and snakes can cast their skins. Oh, of course, thought I, that's what the lion means. So I started scratching myself and my scales began coming off all over the place. And then I scratched a little deeper and, instead of just scales coming off here and there, my whole skin started peeling off beautifully. ... In a minute or two I just stepped out of it. I could see it lying there beside me, looking rather nasty. It was a most lovely feeling. So I started to go down into the well for my bathe.</i><br><br><i>"But just as I was going to put my feet into the water I looked down and saw that they were all hard and rough and wrinkled and scaly just as they had been before. Oh, that's all right, said I, it only means I had another smaller suit on underneath the first one, and I'll have to get out of it too. So I scratched and tore again and this underskin peeled off beautifully and out I stepped and left it lying beside the other one and went down to the well for my bathe.</i><br><br><i>"Well, exactly the same thing happened again. And I thought to myself, oh dear, how ever many skins have I got to take off? For I was longing to bathe my leg. So I scratched away for the third time and got off a third skin, just like the two others, and stepped out of it. But as soon as I looked at myself in the water I knew it had been no good.</i><br><br><i>"Then the lion said ... 'You will have to let me undress you.' I was afraid of his claws, I can tell you, but I was pretty nearly desperate now. So I just lay flat down on my back to let him do it.</i><br><br><i>"The very first tear he made was so deep that I thought it had gone right into my heart. And when he began pulling the skin off, it hurt worse than anything I've ever felt. The only thing that made me able to bear it was just the pleasure of feeling the stuff peel off....</i><br><br><i>"Well, he peeled the beastly stuff right off--just as I thought I'd done it myself the other three times, only they hadn't hurt--and there it was, lying on the grass: only ever so much thicker, and darker, and more knobbly-looking than the others had been. And there was I as smooth and soft as a peeled switch and smaller than I had been. Then he caught hold of me--I didn't like that much for I was very tender underneath now that I'd no skin on--and threw me into the water. It smarted like anything but only for a moment. After that it became perfectly delicious and as soon as I started swimming and splashing I found that all the pain had gone from my arm. And then I saw why. I'd turned into a boy again." </i>[C. S. Lewis, "The Voyage of the <i>Dawn Treader,</i>" <i>The Chronicles of Narnia</i> (London: HarperCollins, 2001), 473–75]<br><br>To understand truth, we must be "of the truth." To be "of the truth," we must be clean. To be clean--to shed our sins--we must repent, and repentance requires Christ. <i>There is no other way</i>. This is part of what Christ meant in the 8th chapter of John we were just reading from when He said, "I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life" (verse 12).<br><br>When our first son was born, I was overwhelmed with the love that I felt for Ryan. I also felt it again with my other children. This love was fundamentally different than love I had felt before. You see, I love my wife deeply for who she is and for all she does for me. I love my parents deeply for who they are and what they have done for me. They <i>deserve</i> my love. They have earned it. Ryan was a newborn. I didn't know him. He kept us awake at night, he needed constant attention, he was sometimes crying and fussy. He <i>didn't deserve</i> to be loved. He hadn't earned it in any sense of the word. Yet I loved him (and still do) so intensely that I would do anything to help him.<br><br>God feels the same love for us--even if we feel we don't deserve it.<br><br>I believe that developing this love for someone who doesn't "deserve" it is part of our essential experience in this life if we are to achieve our purpose in life. I believe that is why the Lord feels families are so important and that love should be based on something other than selfish gratification.<br><br>The Mormon religion is fundamentally different from other Christian religions. Ask people of other faiths if God is our Father and they usually will say yes. But ask them if God is also the Father of cats and dogs and cows and horses and they will also often say yes for exactly the same reason: He created them. When we say God is our Father, we mean something fundamentally different. We mean He is literally the Father of our spirit. We can become like Him. As powerful as the love is that I feel for my children, it pales in comparison to the love God has for you. I feel that my experience as a father provided me with that understanding better than any other means could have. That is truth.<br><br>Your experience here at the university and life in general will provide you with truth if you will approach the Lord for understanding. Sometimes things must be experienced to be understood. I remember an experience I had on my mission. I was assigned to the mission home and received a call from a missionary newly arrived in the field. He indicated that he wanted to go home right then. The mission president and his wife were unavailable for a few days. I asked the mission secretary to go with me, and we drove down to the little Swiss village where the missionary was stationed. I went tracting with him while the mission secretary went tracting with his senior companion. We tracted farmhouses, and so we had a long time between houses to talk. After talking about missionary work and life in general, the missionary was feeling okay about staying on.<br><br>Our conversation turned to him. This missionary was different than most--he was much older because he was a convert. He was converted while he was a soldier in Vietnam, and then he went on a mission after he returned home from the war. He talked about his experiences, and at one point he talked about being on reconnaissance when shots were being fired. He and the soldiers in his patrol dove off the road to avoid the shots, and he heard explosions around him. The Viet Cong had placed land mines around and then used gunfire to get the soldiers to jump off the road. He talked about seeing one of his buddies literally blown apart. He became choked up.<br><br>There was silence, and finally I said, "I understand."<br><br>I remember that he looked at me and said, "No, you don't! There is no way you could understand. You had to be there. You had to feel it to understand."<br><br>And you know, he was right.<br><br>Sometimes the Lord makes us go through difficult experiences because there is no other way to understand the truth. Sometimes we have to go through pain to understand pain. But it is the gospel that will provide us with the right attitude and perspective to understand. Without the gospel some people only learn bitterness or anger from these experiences. We have to be "of the truth" to understand the truth. We can have the same experiences, the same facts, but we have to be "of the truth" to understand the truth.<br><br>You may be terrified sitting in front of the young mother as a missionary, feeling helpless, not knowing what to say. But if you are clean, you can feel the Lord's love for the person you are trying to help, and your confidence waxes strong--not because you are perfect, but because you can feel the Lord speaking through you and you know He has the right answer. You are merely the vehicle He uses to help this family. He knows the truth, and you will know the truth, and it will set you truly free.<br><br>Of this I testify, and I say this in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Hal B.

What is relevant to you today? A few weeks ago I attended a young single adult ward in Washington, D.C., where I met Dean Magleby for the first time. As we came here this morning, I was a little apprehensive about this assignment until I was able to see some of you whom I have known: some of our missionaries--well, many of our missionaries; those of you we have visited in your mission--and we consider you ours; as well as mission presidents and others we have had experiences with.<br><br>After sacrament meeting in Washington, D.C., we stayed in the chapel and took the rest of the block time to answer questions. I wish we could do that today. I would be more comfortable with a microphone walking through the audience and asking you questions and answering your questions. Then we could talk about what is on your minds--not just what is on my mind.<br><br>Several months ago, when I received this assignment to speak here, my thoughts went back to the devotionals I attended while at BYU. My objective in speaking today is to say something that will be relevant, something that you will not just listen to but that you will hearken to.<br><br>How I envy you! What a marvelous time you live in, and what a happy time this should be. I don't want to live my life over--it has been full and wonderful--but, from my perspective, BYU students have never had it better.<br><h2><b>The Chosen Generation</b></h2><br>When I was here as a student 50 years ago, I remember hearing from Church leaders that we were "the chosen generation," that we were among the spirits held back to come forth in this last dispensation. We were told that great responsibility would rest upon us to prepare the way for the coming of the Savior, that no one had ever faced the challenges we would, and that no one had ever been equipped to handle them as we were. I confess my feelings upon hearing this were mixed. There were days I believed what we were told, and other times I rejected it as hyperbole--exaggeration spoken with the intention to get us to behave better than the previous generation. Now that I am in a position to do the preaching, I admit to some hyperbole, but I say with conviction that the Lord meant what He said:<br><br><i>Even before</i> [you] <i>were born,</i> [you], <i>with many others, received</i> [your] <i>first lessons in the world of spirits and were prepared to come forth in the due time of the Lord to labor in his vineyard for the salvation of the souls of men.</i> [D&amp;amp;C 138:56]<br><h2><b>How Do You Become Chosen?</b></h2><br>From the beginning of creation, our Father in Heaven has singled out from among His children those He has referred to as "chosen." We can be chosen by birthright, through the covenants we make, or both. Abel was chosen, for it was said of him that he <i>"hearkened</i> unto the voice of the Lord. . . . And the Lord had respect" for his sacrifices (Moses 5:17, 20; emphasis added). Because Cain wanted it <i>his </i>way, he was not counted among the chosen and rebelled against God. After Cain killed Abel, Adam and Eve prayed for a worthy son, and Seth was born after the image and likeness of Adam. Seth was called chosen, and his sacrifices were acceptable before the Lord. Being born after the image and likeness of Adam, he looked like him, but, more important, he <i>acted</i> like him. He was chosen because of the way he chose to live.<br><br>Throughout time the Lord has chosen righteous servants to carry out His work. Noah pronounced Shem the chosen of his three sons, and--although he was not the eldest--in his patriarchal blessing he received <i>all</i> the promised blessings of the birthright. Through the lineage of Shem came Abraham. The Lord made a covenant with Abraham: "I will make my covenant between me and thee, and will multiply thee exceedingly. . . . Thou shalt be a father of many nations" (Genesis 17:2, 4). The covenant included the priesthood and great responsibility that through his seed "all the nations of the earth [would] be blessed" (Genesis 22:18).<br><h2><b>The Responsibility of Being Chosen</b></h2><br>There is a bit of irony in being chosen. One might suppose that being chosen makes a person better than others, yet the Lord has made it clear He is no respecter of persons. What does it mean, then, to be chosen? Peter spoke of "a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that <i>ye should shew forth the praises of him </i>who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light" (1 Peter 2:9; emphasis added).<br><br>To those who are chosen, the Lord has always opened the heavens to that marvelous light. The promised light includes understanding the plan of salvation and participation in the covenants and blessings from God. It includes the blessings of the priesthood, the key of the knowledge of God, and exaltation. That marvelous light comes through the Holy Ghost. Those who have not enjoyed the experience of light and knowledge through the Holy Ghost ridicule those who have because they cannot produce empirical evidence to substantiate their knowledge. Notwithstanding the disdain of skeptics, we have that knowledge, and with that marvelous light we have great responsibility. The Lord said, "Of him unto whom much is given much is required; and he who sins against the greater light shall receive the greater condemnation" (D&amp;amp;C 82:3).<br><h2><b>The Holy Ghost and the Marvelous Light</b></h2><br>The Savior promised His disciples that when He left, they could continue to learn from the Holy Ghost, who would "teach [them] all things, and bring all things to [their] remembrance, whatsoever [He had] said unto [them]" (John 14:26). The Prophet Joseph Smith, in explaining the Godhead, said the Holy Ghost is "a personage of Spirit" so that He can dwell in us (D&amp;amp;C 130:22). As he dwells in us, that marvelous light is increased, and he works as the agent to cleanse us of our sins and confirm truth to our minds and our hearts as we hear it or read it. It is through the inspiration of the Holy Ghost that we come to know the things of God.<br><h2><b>Inspiration and Agency</b></h2><br>There is an interesting dichotomy between inspiration and agency. The Lord has made it clear: He will inspire, He will guide, He will prompt, He will teach, but He will not <i>choose</i> for us. Oliver Cowdery thought that getting inspiration and guidance would be easy. The Lord does not work that way. First we must "study it out in [our minds]," and then <i>we</i> must decide (D&amp;amp;C 9:7–9). It is with the exertion of studying it out that inspiration comes. It is through our earnest seeking and thinking that the Holy Ghost can speak to our minds. Part of that deliberation is formulating the right question in our minds so we can then ponder and seek the answer to the question.<br><br>When we have made a preliminary decision and settled on a solution or answer, we then take it before the Lord. He has promised us a confirmation of our decisions through a burning in our bosom if it be right and a stupor of thought if it be wrong. A stupor of thought affects each of us in different ways. It may come as a complete brain cramp, when you can't think of anything. I remember some of those times here at BYU when I had not studied adequately for an exam. You all know what I am talking about. Of course, if the exam is multiple choice, you can always guess. But understand this, the important questions of life are essay questions, and you either know or you don't.<br><h2><b>Asking the Right Question</b></h2><br>In 1972 we had a large family and a very small home. Seven of our nine children were then under the age of 12, and our five girls shared a single bedroom. We had only one bathroom. The opportunity came to move to a much larger and nicer home that was also closer to my work. It seemed like a simple, uncomplicated decision. It meant a change in ward, stake, and school, but that didn't seem important in light of the advantages. I spent two frustrating months considering the move. I was learning about stupors of thought. I finally decided to take the problem to the Lord in a serious way. I determined I wouldn't eat until I made a clear decision. For three long days the same frustrating ideas went through my mind. Finally I asked the right question: not about money and convenience but about family and Church. The next morning in the shower I knew we should stay where we were, and I made the decision. The calm peace "which passeth all understanding" (Philippians 4:7) came over me, and I knew it was right. I didn't know <i>why,</i> I just knew. I learned why two months later, when I was called to be the stake president. The Lord, of course, knew all along. I just had to ask the right question.<br><h2><b>The Light of Christ</b></h2><br>In addition to the blessing of the Holy Ghost, our Father in Heaven has provided another marvelous resource to guide us in our choices. When Elohim confronted Lucifer in the Garden of Eden, He said to him, "I will put enmity between . . . thy seed and [the woman's] seed" (Moses 4:21). We feel this enmity toward Satan through the Light of Christ. The Light of Christ plants within our hearts a natural hostility toward Satan and his followers, who have set about to frustrate the plan of God. The Light of Christ is given to every man, and it is what makes sin repulsive to the honest in heart. Goodness, innocence and faith, the honesty of a little child, and disgust at the sight of sin are personifications of that enmity. The Light of Christ is one of the most precious possessions we can have. However, if we persist in rejecting His inviting and enticing, we can lose that help, for the Spirit "will not always strive with man" (2 Nephi 26:11).<br><h2><b>The Meaning and Purpose of Agency</b></h2><br>The Light of Christ gives us the foundation in choosing between good and evil, and the Holy Ghost is our teacher. Together they will guide us toward the light, but the choice is ours, with no compulsion. The purpose of our existence is to develop the character and capacity to make right decisions; it is based on the eternal principle of agency that began in our premortal existence. I believe it was just as difficult to make right decisions then as it is now. There was as much uncertainty then as we face now. We had to be decisive, to make up our minds. We chose right in the War in Heaven--otherwise we wouldn't be here.<br><br>Explaining the meaning and purpose of agency, Lehi told Jacob that if there were not opposition in all things, it would destroy the wisdom of God and His eternal purposes (see 2 Nephi 2:11–12).<br><h2><b>Agency and Eternal Life</b></h2><br>A life without opposition would be a life without agency, and without agency there could be no progression. But because of agency there can be progression. Lehi continued:<br><br><i>Men are free according to the flesh. . . . They are free to choose liberty and eternal life, through the great Mediator . . . , or to choose captivity and death, according to the . . . power of the devil.</i> [2 Nephi 2:27]<br><br>God gave man agency so that he could act for himself, which he could not do if he were not tempted "by the one or the other" (2 Nephi 2:16). Agency is the essence of eternal life, for eternal life, or God's life, cannot be if there is no agency. Or, in other words, if we can make our agency eternal through right choices, then through the grace of Christ we will have eternal life (see D&amp;amp;C 84:37–38, 121:46).<br><br>Man is free to choose between eternal life--which is an eternal continuation of the right to choose--or eternal death, wherein we can no longer choose. One choice perpetuates agency, the other terminates it (see D&amp;amp;C 93:30–31). When we make wrong choices, the door of opportunity closes behind us. If we continue in error, the doors keep closing until the night of darkness comes when agency is lost and no labor can be performed (see Alma 34:33).<br><h2><b>"We Will Prove Them Herewith"</b></h2><br>The Lord said through Abraham, "We will prove them herewith, to see if they will do all things whatsoever the Lord their God shall command them" (Abraham 3:25). I have no doubt you are among "the noble and great ones" Abraham saw (verse 22), but that is not a <i>free pass;</i> you will have to prove yourselves. The choices we make always determine the outcome or consequences. The Lord has given us commandments to guide us. It seems simple enough. The rub is to make the right decisions. That will require the application of faith. To even know there is a God requires faith. Faith is the basis of our obedience to God. It follows then that faith is an important part of making <i>right</i> decisions.<br><h2><b>Exercise of Faith</b></h2><br>With each decision we exercise our faith. That expression, "exercise faith," has always intrigued me. I know what exercise means in a physical sense. Physical exertion causes us to sweat. But exercise of the mind and will, the exercise of the spirit, is harder to understand. With greater uncertainty, greater faith is required. Perhaps every decision, to be consistent with God's plan, requires an element of faith. The real exercise of our faith and spirit comes when we make decisions out of our comfort zone. At this time in your lives, you are weighed down with decisions outside your comfort zone. If you are single, you have a marriage decision ahead of you. If you are married, you have homes to buy and children to bring into the world. You wonder, "How will I support my family?" These decisions you face today will require the exercise of faith. We exercise our faith by stepping into the darkness. If we step with faith, surely the light will follow. The courage to take that step is based on the evidence and the substance we have added to our faith by earlier stretching. And if you have practiced that procedure, you will be decisive and boldly step into the darkness, knowing the light will follow. Mature faith leads to pure knowledge.<br><br>When our faith has matured, making the right decision in spiritual things is automatic. It requires little effort, for when you are standing in the light, the decision is clear. The choice has already been made. Moses was caught up into an exceedingly high mountain, where he was able to see all of creation from the beginning to the end. When he came down from his great vision, Satan came tempting him. He appeared as an angel of light, claiming to be the Only Begotten. (He can do that, you know.) But Moses was not deceived, for he said: "[The Spirit of the Lord] hath not altogether withdrawn from me. . . . [Therefore,] I can judge between thee and God" (Moses 1:15). When we have the Spirit of the Lord with us, the decisions are easier, for with that light the difference can be as clear as the day from the darkest night (see Moroni 7:15).<br><h2><b>Time of Uncertainty</b></h2><br>We live in an information age. With a keystroke or two you can access information that, when I was here, would have taken hours of research in the library. These are also very uncertain times--in part because of that flood of information and the resulting contradictory information. What is truth and what is propaganda? What is right? What is wrong? Isaiah saw this day and declared:<br><br><i>Woe unto them that call evil good, and good evil; that put darkness for light, and light for darkness; that put bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter! </i>[Isaiah 5:20]<br><br>During the American Revolution, Thomas Paine declared: "These are the times that try men's souls." He then spoke of summer soldiers and sunshine patriots who chose to hide and watch, to wait and see. (<i>The American Crisis,</i> no. 1, 23 December 1776.)<br><br>We have our choice today. We must never be summer Mormons or sunshine Saints.<br><h2><b>This Is Not a Time to Wait and See</b></h2><br>This is not a time to wait and see; this is a time of decision. Unfortunately many of us go through life knowing the things we should do but then fail to make the decisions that allow us to act prudently. We put off important decisions until they require a quick or an impulsive answer.<br><br>Early in life our choices and decisions were guided by our parents, teachers, or Church and political leaders. My father died 13 years ago. I miss him. I miss him because there was great certainty in his counsel. It is always comfortable to have someone validate your decisions, but the most important thing is to learn to make right decisions yourself.<br><br>Following the gospel plan trains us in making decisions. Through the gospel we receive God's commandments, and we choose to obey or disobey. As we make the right spiritual choices, our capacity to make right decisions increases in every facet of life. You are here at school to learn how to make right decisions from the experience of others. Going to school is for your temporal life what studying the scriptures is for your spiritual life.<br><h2><b>The Season of Decision</b></h2><br>In training missionaries, I counsel them to make up their minds about what they intend to do when they grow up, and I teach them that this decision will help them to be better missionaries. In Mexico, one of the elders, obviously a very bright young man, asked, "You mean you want me to take time out of my missionary service to make that decision?"<br><br>I asked him, "How much time do you need?"<br><br>He replied, "At least a week of fasting and prayer so that I can know the will of the Lord in that important choice in my life."<br><br>My answer surprised him, as it may surprise some of you. I said, "Elder, I don't think your career matters to the Lord. As long as you keep the commandments and prepare to serve Him, your career is your decision."<br><br>I don't mean to imply we should not confirm that kind of decision with the Lord, but I believe He expects us to go through the process of making the decision first.<br><br>Elder Bruce R. McConkie, many years ago, told a group here at BYU about meeting the girl he would later marry. "When I saw Amelia," he said, "I knew what I wanted. I didn't have to ask the Lord." Then, in reflection, he said, "I guess I could have confirmed that with the Lord, but it was clear to me."<br><h2><b>Indecision Is No Choice at All</b></h2><br>Becoming decisive is part of our spiritual growing up. This growing up requires constant decision making. We must learn to be decisive, because indecision is no choice at all. If we fail to choose, we fail to act. With no action, the second law of thermodynamics takes over. That law, simply stated, is that without power or energy applied, things tend to deteriorate. The easiest path is always followed unless we choose otherwise. The Lord expressed it this way: "Strait is the gate, and narrow is the way, which leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it" (Matthew 7:14). And "wide is the gate, and broad is the way, that leadeth to destruction, and many there be which go in thereat" (Matthew 7:13). It is a life-or-death issue. To overcome this entropy requires power. That power is generated by faith, as we follow the narrow way.<br><h2><b>The Most Important Choices</b></h2><br>We make two kinds of decisions in our lives. The critical decisions determine our standing before our Eternal Father. These decisions have to do with eternal truth, and the Holy Ghost can confirm the rightness of our choices. Many other decisions don't make a difference in our standing before the Lord, but they are schoolmasters that help us to learn and gain experience. They are noncritical decisions like "What color of shirt should I wear today?" (For me, that is easy. With my assignment it is always white.)<br><br>And, speaking of white shirts, one of the Brethren told me this experience. He said his wife had given him a colored shirt, a bright yellow shirt, as a present. He knew that to make her happy he had to wear it. So one day, knowing that he was going to the temple, he thought, "I'll wear it as I leave home. Then I'll change into my white shirt at the temple." As he stepped into the elevator at the Church Office Building, one of the senior Brethren saw him and said, "Hmmm. Nice shirt."<br><br>We learn from making those noncritical kinds of decisions. I've made the decision to wear a white shirt always so that won't happen to me! Learn from those decisions and move on. A wrong decision in the noncritical department may embarrass us or cause some other discomfort, but it will not affect our standing before the Lord.<br><h2><b>The Nonnegotiables</b></h2><br>The critical decisions have to do directly with the gospel, the plan that the Father has given us to guide us back to His presence. These decisions are eternal in consequences and require nonnegotiable commitments. These are the "I will never" and "I will always" parameters that will accelerate our progress and build in a powerful protection when we are tempted to stray from the celestial path. I knew a young man who exemplified this. He overcame difficult physical obstacles in order to fulfill his life's dream--to serve a mission. At his farewell his father said, "My son will not make many decisions on his mission." I wondered where he was going with that statement, but then he continued: "Because he only makes a decision once." We all need to be like that with the nonnegotiables.<br><h2><b>The Thomas Paradox</b></h2><br>These nonnegotiable commitments give us greater access to the Holy Ghost to build and strengthen testimony. A testimony of the gospel goes beyond believing to a profound certainty that comes through personal spiritual witness. As Latter-day Saints we are surrounded by the truth--by the truth and the testimonies of others. In that insulated environment we run the risk of depending on others for our certainty. We can find ourselves caught in what I call "the Thomas paradox." Thomas had spent three years with the Savior, yet when Jesus told His apostles He was leaving and was going to prepare a place for them, Thomas said, "We don't know where you are going and we don't know how to get there" (see John 14:2–6).<br><br>Contrast Thomas' indecisiveness with the testimony of Peter when the Savior asked him, "Whom say ye that I am?" (Matthew 16:15).<br><br>Peter declared, "Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God" (verse 16).<br><br>Then the Savior confirmed Peter's source of that knowledge: "Flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my Father which is in heaven" (verse 17).<br><br>If we will be decisive in our desire for personal witness, we can know just as Peter knew.<br><h2><b>The Step of Faith</b></h2><br>In San Antonio, Texas, I met a man who had married a faithful Latter-day Saint girl. He was not a member of the Church, and they made an agreement that they would not discuss or argue about religion. His wife was true to her commitment, but shortly after they were married the missionaries came calling. He remained true to his commitment and didn't argue or complain, and the missionaries just kept coming. He went through so many sets of missionaries he lost count. Three years went by, but he still remained indifferent to the gospel. He was a good man; he was just not willing to expend the faith necessary to believe.<br><br>One evening he came home from work, and his wife said, "The missionaries are coming tonight."<br><br>He thought to himself, "Oh, no. Not again! Haven't I been through this enough already?"<br><br>But that night was different. An older stake missionary was with the elders, and as they began the lesson, he said to this man, "It's time you joined the Church. You need to make the decision now!"<br><br>And he heard himself saying, "I know. You're right. It is time."<br><br>As he said those words, he felt a powerful confirmation of the Spirit and knew it was true.<br><br>He later said to me, "I really didn't know until that moment, but then I knew with a confirmation that I could not deny." His one step of faith into darkness opened the door to the confirming Spirit.<br><br>I rejoice in the principle of agency. I am grateful for opposition that helps us grow.<br><br>So what happens when we make wrong choices? With everyday mistakes in everyday temporal decisions, opportunities are lost and physical or mental discomfort may result. But these consequences can be overcome, and the experience gained is valuable to our development.<br><h2><b>The Gates of Hell</b></h2><br>However, if we make wrong choices in keeping the commandments, the consequences are far more serious. When we disobey the commandments of God, we suffer spiritual death. We cannot return to His presence without help.<br><br>There is a trap used to catch pigeons. It is a wire cage with a hinged gate that only swings to the inside. As the pigeon eats the feed on the perch, he focuses on his appetite for the food and blissfully walks through the gate, finding himself trapped. The gate will not swing out. The gates of hell are like that. If we follow our carnal appetites and commit sin, in effect we pass through that gate. We are powerless to open it, but the Master can and will if we will repent.<br><br>How I love our Savior. I know He vicariously suffered spiritual death for us if we will leave behind the mistakes we have made and follow Him. We can become the "new creature" through Him (2 Corinthians 5:17). I know that is what He wants, and above all that is what I want. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Lynn A.

<h1>ent for Journeying Through Babylon to Athens and Zion - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
My wife and I once boarded a train going south from Paris to Marseilles, a Mediterranean port. At Lyon, about halfway there, part of the train (the part we were in!) split off and headed east toward Geneva. As soon as we saw the Alps, we realized that we were off course. We got off in Grenoble, caught a train back to Lyon, then took a later train to Marseilles. Our minimal ability to discern between the Alps and the Mediterranean helped us to make a necessary course correction on a physical journey.<br><br>We need discernment for each of the three tracks of our journey through life. These tracks can be symbolized by places: Babylon for material life, Athens for intellectual life, and Zion for spiritual life. Scriptural imagery distinguishes Babylon from Sodom, an emblem of gross perversions. Babylon represents our entire material experience--meeting our physical needs, "getting and spending,"<sup>1</sup> relishing "the vain things of the world,"<sup>2</sup> and satisfying "the natural man."<sup>3</sup> According to a "double commandment," we are instructed both to be "not of the world" and to be "in the world."<sup>4</sup> Peter, advising the Saints to "be ye holy," did so "at Babylon"<sup>5</sup>--that is, in the world. This is a main purpose of our "second estate": to be proven while we dwell on the earth.<sup>6</sup> Claims of bravery mean nothing in the absence of danger. Likewise, innocence shielded by nonopportunity is not the same thing as virtue that is freely chosen among alternatives and then severely tested in the furnace of life. So we are charged to pass our mortal probation not isolated in monastic enclaves but thoroughly engaged in human society.<br><br>Babylon thus comprises our material circumstances, our physical movements, our social environments, and even our professional careers. In traveling through Babylon it is important to increase our powers of discernment by using them--just as we strengthen our muscles through physical exercise. Discerning our journey through the world entails, first, choosing specific worthy destinations rather than just drifting somewhere. Floating with natural currents usually takes us downstream to Babylon's Sodom-like districts. To avoid these in favor of better neighborhoods, we seek positive objectives and make frequent course corrections in order to reach them.<br><br>At times as we exercise discernment, we may even need to change our destinations. In fall 2000 we were shepherding BYU students in the Holy Land. They were visiting Akko for a couple of hours en route to Jerusalem. But Jerusalem suddenly experienced a spike of unrest, so we changed their destination to the safer area of Galilee.<br><br>Likewise, discerning the road ahead may require us to modify our professional goals. I grew up as the son of a metalworker in an LDS ward with about 20 dentists. They taught me to visualize sin as a cavity! At any rate, in my midteens I decided to be a dentist. That was my vocational ambition until I encountered a dose of reality called organic chemistry! I then prudently changed my career path.<br><br>Among the most noteworthy physical journeys were those of Lehi and Brigham Young. Their examples show us that although travelers meet obstacles and get sidetracked, resolute ones persevere until they reach their destinations.<br><br>I've had some experience with obstacles and sidetracks. After teaching at the University of Miami for a year, I received in fall 1973 a postdoctoral grant to do research in Yemen. My ticket, paid for by the grant, took me from Miami to New York to Paris to Tunis and then (the plan was) to Cairo and Yemen. Because we had to pay for their travel ourselves, my wife and three small children took a cheapie airline to Luxembourg, rode trains for three days to Istanbul, then got on a plane to Beirut, whence they were to fly to meet me at the Cairo airport so we could proceed to Yemen together.<br><br>No one told us that a war would break out between Egypt and Israel a few hours before our scheduled reunion. My wife missed her plane from Beirut--luckily, because it came under fire. My plane was grounded in Libya, where I was put under arrest for three days and then sent back to Tunis. It took me nearly a week to discover that my family was stranded in Lebanon. They came to Tunis, where my research grant had been reassigned by U.S. officials--who changed their minds, however, and told us to proceed to Yemen. We went first to Rome. Our flight from Rome to Jidda in western Arabia was diverted around the war zone to eastern Arabia, where we were detained overnight and then deported to Bahrain. After a month of such obstacles and sidetracks, we finally arrived in Yemen, where we discovered a magical society in which I conducted my research and my wife taught at a Yemeni school. After leaving Yemen we finally did go to Cairo, where we spent the next 11 years.<br><br>Whereas Babylon stands for worldly matters, Athens represents intellectual ones. To Latter-day Saints, however, Athens symbolizes a destination as well as a passage, for we know that intelligence is a basic part of our eternal nature and that "whatever principle of intelligence we attain unto in this life, it will rise with us in the resurrection."<sup>7</sup> So we should work to maximize our intellectual capacity and discernment not just for the purpose of navigating routes but also for that of magnifying our stewardships over our very selves. Moreover, the "greatest commandment" is to love the Lord with all our mind as well as with all our strength and soul.<sup>8</sup> So we want to love Him--not with an empty, small, or flabby mind but with a mind as large, as vigorous, and as disciplined as we can possibly make it.<br><br>How do we strengthen our intellects and our powers of intellectual discernment? First, we make intelligent choices to avoid mental Sodoms--like pornography and drivel-spewing media that stupefy our minds instead of stimulating them. But we don't avoid the big ideas and the hard questions, which we are, in effect, mandated to engage. BYU's mission statement reminds us that "a broad university education ... will help students think clearly [and] understand important ideas,"<sup>9</sup> and the civilization course guidelines urge "the exploration of some important questions and themes."<br><br>I remember a student telling me on the first day of a world civilization course: "I'm going to be an accountant. I don't need to know anything about Shakespeare or Gandhi." Three months later he changed his mind. A young woman he home taught consented to date him because, after our class discussion on early 20th-century art, he'd been able to explain the symbolism of her Marc Chagall print.<br><br>But general education courses can do more than improve our social lives. They can stretch and sharpen our intellects to make us better citizens of our country and more effective servants of God. In that regard, some of the thorns and thistles<sup>10</sup> prescribed for Adam's posterity may include thorny ideas; when we sweat over them, we broaden and sharpen our minds. After all, athletes improve their performance by facing better competition; businesses become more efficient and make finer products by participating in competitive markets; and our intelligence grows in quantity and quality by wrestling with challenging ideas. That principle, I believe, is implicit both in the Lord's teaching to Abraham about mortality's purpose<sup>11</sup> and in Lehi's profound statement about "opposition in all things."<sup>12</sup><br><br>Besides, intellectual discovery is an exhilarating experience, not just a mandate. I remember the exhilaration the first time I read in <i>The Prelude</i> by Wordsworth a few verses that paraphrase Lehi's statement about the importance of opposition:<br><br><i>There is a dark</i><br><i>Inscrutable workmanship that reconciles</i><br><i>Discordant elements, makes them cling together</i><br><i>In one society. How strange, that all</i><br><i>The terrors, pains, and early miseries,</i><br><i>Regrets, vexations, lassitudes interfused</i><br><i>Within my mind, should e'er have borne a part,</i><br><i>And that a needful part, in making up</i><br><i>The calm existence that is mine when I</i><br><i>Am worthy of myself!</i><sup>13</sup><br><br>Supreme Court Justice Felix Frankfurter experienced such a discovery. He was struggling to define the concept that--in order to protect the innocent fully--courts of law should treat even the villainous fairly. He went to see Robert Bolt's play <i>A Man for All Seasons,</i> about Sir Thomas More's interactions with the selfish tyrant King Henry VIII. At the point where More's character spoke the line "Yes, I'd give the Devil benefit of law, for my own safety's sake,"<sup>14</sup> Justice Frankfurter blurted out, "That's the point, ... that's it!"<sup>15</sup><br><br>When I first saw that play, I thought "That's it!" in two other scenes. In one, Sir Thomas learns of an oath crafted to entrap him by the king's henchmen; yet he hopes that the wording of the oath will let him take it without violating his conscience. He tells his daughter: "God ... made animals for innocence and plants for their simplicity. But Man he made to serve him wittily, in the tangle of his mind!"<sup>16</sup> The other scene is set in the Tower of London, where More has been jailed for refusing to take the oath. His daughter urges him to say it with his mouth and to think otherwise in his heart; after all, she notes, he is a virtuous hero, and it's not his fault the government is bad. Sir Thomas replies:<br><br><i>If we lived in a State where virtue was profitable, common sense would make us good, and greed would make us saintly. ... But since in fact we see that</i> [villainies] <i>commonly profit far beyond</i> [virtues]<i>, and have to choose, ... why then perhaps we</i> must <i>stand fast a little.</i><sup>17</sup><br><br>So we seek Athens keenly and do not fear it--unlike the slothful servant who, being "afraid,"<sup>18</sup> buried his talent <i>and</i> his future. Most Latter-day Saints who lose their way do so in Babylon's hedonistic arcades, where, like Housman's ale-drinking "fellows whom it hurts to think," they "look into the pewter pot / To see the world as the world's not."<sup>19</sup> Comparatively fewer get lost in Athens' laboratories, lecture halls, and libraries. It is usually Babylon's "lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God"<sup>20</sup> who try to rationalize destructive self-gratification in half-baked intellectual terms, rehearsing cliché about freedom to justify enslaving vices. Indeed, as a rule, better education correlates with stronger commitment to gospel principles and with greater activity in the Church,<sup>21</sup> to which ignorance is the graver threat.<br><br>As by design does mortal life itself, the life of the mind does, of course, have pitfalls. President Hugh B. Brown told BYU students 36 years ago, "One cannot think right without running the risk of thinking wrong." Just as we endure setbacks when we take bad turns along roads through the world, we suffer negative consequences for our immature or misinformed intellectual conclusions. But, as President Brown went on to say, "Generally more thinking is the antidote for the evils that spring from wrong thinking."<sup>22</sup><br><br>"More thinking" should not entail just parroting our brightest, most articulate fellow humans, past or present. Concerning the greatest truths, they've all speculated wrong on some vital points, leading astray any uncritical disciples whose quest takes them no farther than saying "me too." Wordsworth, for example, venerated "meadow, grove, and stream"<sup>23</sup> to the extent of pantheism. While appreciating his insight about reconciling discordant elements, we would not follow him in substituting the worship of abstract nature for the worship of our personal Father.<br><br>Hugh Nibley was an advisor for my master of arts thesis. Once, when I was in his office to get feedback on a draft chapter, his phone rang. He picked it up, listened for a while, then, before hanging up, said, "You ought to do your own research." Refusing to "set [himself] up for a light unto the world,"<sup>24</sup> he fended off would-be "Nibley groupies." Rather, he urged his students not just to do their own research but also and especially to do their own critical thinking. To that end God made every intelligence "independent ... to act for itself."<sup>25</sup><br><br>We can strengthen our intellectual discernment only by using it often. When I was in France on a mission 45 years ago, I learned a French proverb: <i>"C'est en forgeant qu'on devient forgeron"</i> ("It is by smithing that one becomes a smith"). So it is by thinking discerningly that one becomes a discerning thinker.<br><br>Of course mature intellectual independence requires a long apprenticeship. From the word <i>sophomore--</i>one who has completed a freshman year--comes the word <i>sophomoric:</i> "overconfident of knowledge but poorly informed and immature."<sup>26</sup> We are sophomoric when we consider ourselves wise on the basis of a little learning<sup>27</sup>--what Santayana called "a torch of smoky pine / That lights the pathway but one step ahead" or what Paul likened to seeing "through a glass, darkly."<sup>28</sup> Indeed, "the learned" are apt to become "puffed up in the pride of their hearts."<sup>29</sup> Such vanity is especially dangerous, according to C. S. Lewis and President Benson,<sup>30</sup> when it involves enmity for God. Conversely, "a wise man will hear, and will increase learning."<sup>31</sup> The wisest scholars learn early to forsake arrogant dogmatism and to embrace humility. Although working ultimately toward intellectual self-reliance, we need to stay mindful that our thought processes are still comparatively juvenile. We limit our intellectual potential when, with more zeal than knowledge,<sup>32</sup> as adolescents we embrace a worldly intellectual or political trend, demonize its alternatives, and devote ourselves, as Santayana put it, to "not covet truth, but victory and the dispelling of their own doubts."<sup>33</sup> With humility and open minds we should read the great thinkers--to exercise our brains and<i> </i>to discover and refine nuggets of truth. As Paul advised, "Prove all things; hold fast that which is good."<sup>34</sup><br><br>The ideal of Zion represents the destination of our spiritual journey. For every difficulty of physical, professional, or intellectual traveling--drifting, obstacles, sidetracks, pitfalls, wrong conclusions, and sophomoric pride--there are spiritual equivalents with spiritual consequences. But the stakes are higher. I remember a time when our family was ordering pizza; my children debated whether to get pepperoni or another topping. The debate ended when one of them said, "Well, it's not a life-or-death decision."<br><br>According to Alma, the choices we make on our life's spiritual track, however, really are life-or-death decisions, with "joy" accompanying (spiritual) life and "remorse of conscience" accompanying (spiritual) death.<sup>35</sup> For precisely that reason, less than two months ago Elder Bednar taught us about spiritual discernment.<sup>36</sup> If you have "cut-and-paste" functions in your mind, insert what he said here. I add a few observations from my own experience.<br><br>Spiritual discernment helps us to perceive our own lapses and lacks. I have met persons whose pride or enmity for God blinded them to their sins and so to their very eternal predicament. To such was Samuel talking when he called "unto the Lord, ... that ye may perceive and see that your wickedness is great."<sup>37</sup> As Paul put it, "There is none righteous. ... For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God"; so every human needs "the redemption that is in Christ Jesus."<sup>38</sup><br><br>But I have met others whose keen awareness of their past and present failings--and of their inability to overcome these on their own--have in effect blinded them to the grace of the Atonement and to the miracles of repentance and forgiveness. Reasoning that "I am unworthy, so the Savior can't redeem me" constitutes a spiritual <i>non sequitur.</i><sup>39</sup><br><br>Beyond enabling us to recognize our foibles, spiritual discernment helps us to see and feel God's goodness, love, and redemptive power. Like the abilities to discern the world's best destinations and to intellectually discern nuggets of truth from speculation or sophistry, spiritual discernment becomes stronger and sharper through use. A doctor once showed me an X-ray and said, "You can plainly see the problem right here." But, having no experience reading X-rays, I could see nothing but fuzzy blurs. The doctor could read X-rays because he did so every day. By seeking the Light of Christ every day, we increase our capacity to discern good from evil by its illumination. By listening to the Holy Ghost every day, we learn to hear more clearly the "still small voice."<sup>40</sup><br><br>Babylon's happiness is attained, as Shakespeare put it, through attracting "Fortune and men's eyes."<sup>41</sup> Babylon's hedonism is so pervasive and potent that many defer until the afterlife the possibility of Zion's happiness--entailing personal and group righteousness and holiness. But the Lord clearly seeks to "establish Zion" among us here and now.<sup>42</sup> That begs the key question: How can we establish Zion while dwelling in Babylon? We can do it, in effect, by sanctifying the nooks and crannies of Babylon that are nearest to us--our own bodies and minds, our families and homes, our wards and neighborhoods.<br><br>We start with our personal core and proceed outward to whatever periphery our influence can reach. If we are blessed with wealth, we consecrate it to the Lord--who told Martin Harris not to covet his own property.<sup>43</sup> If we are blessed with learning, we devote it to strengthening God's enterprises and His children--our brothers and sisters.<sup>44</sup> In that regard, so many scriptures pair worshipping God with serving our fellow beings that we must regard them as symbiotic, mutually necessary endeavors. We can't serve God effectively without serving each other effectively.<br><br>Some of my best experiences with the growth of spiritual discernment have come while serving at the BYU Jerusalem Center. Some students would arrive--fresh from Babylon--boasting of their thrilling amusements to get attention. But then they went to the hill east of Bethel to reflect on the covenant of Abraham, to Mount Sinai to contemplate that of Moses, and to Mount Ebal to think about Joshua's rededication. They visited Nazareth to see where Jesus "grew, and waxed strong in spirit."<sup>45</sup> They traveled into the Judean wilderness to consider the resolve with which He began His ministry, to Galilee to ponder His Sermon on the Mount and the principles of His higher law, to Mount Tabor to recall His Transfiguration, then back to Jerusalem to study His healing miracles. In a culminating journey they walked from Bethany over the Mount of Olives to Gethsemane, then across the Kidron Valley to the possible sites of Golgotha and the nearby tomb in a garden. That evening they reenacted the Last Supper.<br><br>By then I could feel that most students were forsaking Babylon and approaching Zion. As they recommitted themselves to serving God better, they simultaneously shifted their concerns from their own comforts and conceits to the welfare of their classmates and others within the reach of their positive influence. Such commitments each of us has made and remade many times--in premortal life, at baptism, in the temple, and every Sabbath when we partake of the sacramental emblems. I pray that we shall perform our next act of covenant renewal with greater resolve, confidence, and purpose.<br><br>I pray that we shall resolve to discern our way to worthy destinations in mortal life; that we shall resolve to strengthen our minds to appreciate with exhilaration our intellectual heritage, to understand our complex world more fully, and to love the Lord and serve His children more effectively; and that we shall resolve to consecrate and sanctify ourselves, our assets, and our environments.

<h1>o Find the Sweet Assurances of the Spirit - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Thank you for that beautiful music and opening prayer that helps to set the tone for the devotional today. I appreciate those members of my family, members of the College of Nursing, and each of you for coming today. I am also thankful for the opportunity to reflect over the past few weeks and come before you with a humble heart to share with you some of the experiences I have had that have taught me to be a better child of God. I hope the Lord will bless me to be able to communicate to you the message that I have prepared.<br><br>Twenty-five years ago I found myself in my first nursing course at St. Benedict's Hospital in Ogden, Utah. My clinical instructor, Dr. Helen Farr, lined me and other students up against the wall to inspect our clean, white, crisp nursing uniforms early that first morning. With stethoscopes around our necks and confidence abounding, we were assigned our first patients. We could hardly wait to care for our patients--to do those skills that we had practiced so long and so hard in the nursing lab. We were excited to take our first blood pressure, give our first medication, and start our first IV.<br><br>I remember my first patient, a man in his fifties who had been diagnosed with bladder cancer--a terminal disease. I completed the technical skills with precision and, after giving what I thought was good care, walked out into the hallway to be met by Dr. Farr. She asked how I was doing. I reported all the tasks I had completed, including giving her a report of the patient's current blood pressure and pulse.<br><br>With a worried look she asked me if I had taken the time to talk to the patient and really listen to understand his concerns and worries about his health problems. She told me to go back into the room and not come out until I had talked and then listened intently to my patient.<br><br>With my tail between my legs, I turned around and headed back into his room. I felt uncomfortable as I entered. I cannot remember what was said to break the tension, but I soon found out this patient's physician had told him of his terminal condition that morning. The man shared with me his concern and his fears about the terminal diagnosis. How was he going to be able to talk about this to his wife? He told me he was scared of being in pain. He shared his concerns about leaving his wife and told me how important she had been to him. Tears came to his eyes as he spoke about how much he wanted to be with his children and grandchildren, to go fishing and camping with them. We spoke for a long time that day. At times no words were spoken, but communication occurred soul to soul.<br><br>Even though I felt I had been scolded by Dr. Farr that morning, I was taught an important and valuable lesson that day: to be still and listen. That lesson has helped me more throughout my nursing career than anything else I have learned since. Years later I relived this experience as I sat at the edge of my Grandpa Carlton's bed, watching each day bring him closer to his death. I had the great opportunity of caring for him when his health began to decline. I had lived next door to my grandpa most of my life, but it was not until this period that I actually took the time to really listen to him. I learned much more about him, his life, and his love and concern for my grandmother and other family members. Those cherished moments will be forever remembered.<br><br>In the world today listening has become more complex. In the information age in which we live we are bombarded with constant information, facts, and messages that we must continually process. E-mail, the Internet, cell phones, pagers, text messaging, instant messaging, and virtual electronic communications are all great innovations. "Communication technology will make strangers of neighbors and neighbors of strangers. We can now know more about what is going on across the globe than we do about what is going on across the street."<sup>1</sup><br><br>In addition, if your "to-do" list is like mine, I have more "to do's" than time available to do them all. Book chapters and journal articles to read, concepts to review to help me teach the next class, literature to search, papers to write, deadlines to meet, meetings to attend, papers to grade, students to visit, individuals to contact, things to pick up at the store on my way home, next week's priesthood lesson to prepare for, and, don't forget, visiting my home teaching families--these are but a few of my "to dos." Sound familiar to you?<br><br>It seems as though time is being shortened and the list of life's "must do's" has grown longer. From our waking moments we are at a dead run, multitasking until we retire at night. No wonder innovations such as e-mail, cell phones, and the Internet have been created to ease and lighten our burdens, yet the unintended consequences of these technologies have increased the pace of our day. How could we ever survive without e-mail or leave home without our cell phones? Between our "to-do" lists, our days filled with activities and events, and the avalanche of information, do we take time to be still and listen? How does this busyness and barrage of information affect our ability to also prepare ourselves to feel heavenly promptings from the Holy Ghost to guide our lives and choices?<br><br>This last fall, at the end of her first term in seventh grade, my 13-year-old daughter, Makell, arrived home after school concerned that she had lost her green notebook for her science class. This notebook had all her notes and assignments in it, and it was due to be handed in to her teacher the following week. As she had been working hard to get a good grade, she was very concerned that she was not able to find it.<br><br>Wanting to look one more time in her locker at the school, she asked if I would take her back to school and help her look for it. Finding no green notebook in her locker, she suggested that we check in each of her classrooms. Because it was late on a Friday afternoon and many teachers had left for the day, we were able to get into only a couple of classrooms. As we drove home together, Makell became more concerned. I tried to help her backtrack her steps of that day, identify the place where she had last seen the notebook, and devise plan B--just in case she should not be able to find it. Maybe she could call one of her friends to see if she could borrow their notebook over the weekend and copy the notes into a new notebook.<br><br>When we arrived home she tried to call a few of her friends. Unable to reach them, she began to look everywhere in our house. Later that night, after she had looked in every possible place, she came to talk to her mother and me. After reviewing all the places she had looked, my wife suggested that she say a prayer and ask Heavenly Father to help her with her lost notebook. As a family we included Makell's problem in our family prayer that evening.<br><br>The weekend passed, and Makell, still not able to find her green notebook, came to me Sunday evening to ask if I would be willing to drive her to school the next morning. She wanted to look in the classrooms that we were not able to get into the previous Friday. She especially wanted to look in the science classroom to see if her notebook was there. If it was not, she was hoping that my presence would help her negotiate an extension of the due date or find another option with the teacher.<br><br>When we arrived at the school, Makell first wanted to look in her science classroom. Meeting her science teacher at the door, she became more nervous and asked in a trembling voice if he had seen her green notebook. He told her that there were a few notebooks on the back table. Makell went to the table and recognized her lost green notebook! With huge relief showing on her face, she returned to where we were standing. The teacher commented to her that he had almost thrown away the notebooks that morning but had suddenly decided he'd better keep them.<br><br>Tears welled up in Makell's eyes when she thanked her teacher, and they began to stream down her face as we walked out into the hallway. She needed a few minutes to pull herself together before her first class, so we went out to the car. As we sat for a few minutes, I asked her how she knew where to look for her green notebook. Her sweet, simple response reminded me of an important concept. She replied, "Dad, I just listened after I prayed."<br><br>Before we can discuss how to be still and listen in a chaotic world, let's take a few minutes to review who the Holy Ghost is, how the Holy Ghost works, and how the Holy Ghost is available to each of us to bless our lives. Speaking of the Spirit, the prophet Brigham Young stated:<br><br><i>This</i> [spirit] <i>is the privilege of the Latter-day Saints, but they do not enjoy it as much as they might; consequently it is right to talk about these matters, and to instruct the people.</i><sup>2</sup><br><br>One of the differences between the teachings of our church and other Christian denominations is that we believe the Holy Ghost to be a separate and distinct personage who is literally the third member of the Godhead. How wonderful it is to know that if we are faithful, we can be blessed to actually have the companionship of this member of the Godhead with us at all times and places. Section 93:36 of the Doctrine and Covenants states: "The glory of God is intelligence, or, in other words, light and truth." With the Holy Ghost as the third member of the Godhead whose primary responsibility it is to provide each of us the surge of pure intelligence, He is indeed our contact to the glory of our Heavenly Father.<br><br>Elder Bruce R. McConkie described the Father and the Son as having tangible bodies of flesh and bones, but the Holy Ghost is a "personage of spirit" because<br><br><i>he is to dwell, figuratively, in the faithful, and he is to speak to their spirits in a special and particular way, which he can do because he himself is a spirit. ...</i><br><br><i>... His voice is heard; his influence is felt; his presence is manifest--but his person is kept hidden from view in all but rare instances.</i><sup>3</sup><br><br>The Savior's final days and hours were spent teaching and preparing His disciples for the time when He would no longer dwell among them in mortality. Perhaps His most important instructions regarding the Holy Ghost are found in chapters 14, 15, and 16 in the Gospel of John in the New Testament:<br><br><i>But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you. ...</i><br><br><i>But when the Comforter is come, whom I will send unto you from the Father, even the Spirit of truth, which proceedeth from the Father, he shall testify of me. ...</i><br><br><i>Nevertheless I tell you the truth; It is expedient for you that I go away: for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you; but if I depart, I will send him unto you.</i><sup>4</sup><br><br>Parley P. Pratt described the mission of the Holy Ghost as one that<br><br><i>quickens all the intellectual faculties, increases, enlarges, expands and purifies all the natural passions and affections, and adapts them, by the gift of wisdom, to their lawful use. It inspires, develops, cultivates and matures all the fine toned sympathies, joys, tastes, kindred feelings and affections of our nature. It inspires virtue, kindness, goodness, tenderness, gentleness and charity. ... It develops and invigorates all the faculties of the physical and intellectual man. It strengthens, invigorates and gives tone to the nerves. In short, it is, as it were, marrow to the bone, joy to the heart, light to the eyes, music to the ears, and life to the whole being.</i><sup>5</sup><br><br>I do not know of anyone here at Brigham Young University--student, faculty member, or staff, or anyone else within the sound of my voice--who would not like to have their intellectual faculties quickened, increased, enlarged, or expanded.<br><br>Each of us who has been baptized and confirmed a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has also received the gift of the Holy Ghost. This gift allows the Holy Ghost to be our constant companion as long as we remain worthy and our ability to listen to His promptings is not diminished. Those who have not yet been baptized and confirmed a member of the Church can receive spiritual promptings, but these are from the Light or Spirit of Christ.<br><br>Moroni spoke of that Spirit when he said:<br><br><i>For behold, the Spirit of Christ is given to every man, that he may know good from evil; wherefore, I show unto you the way to judge; for every thing which inviteth to do good, and to persuade to believe in Christ, is sent forth by the power and gift of Christ; wherefore ye may know with a perfect knowledge it is of God.</i><sup>6</sup><br><br>Promptings of the Holy Ghost can come to each of us through a variety of means. The scriptures refer to the Spirit as a still small voice. You might remember the story in the Old Testament about the prophet Elijah when he learned that the voice of the Lord is not in the wind, nor in an earthquake, nor in a fire but is a "still small voice."<sup>7</sup> Other scriptural accounts describe the voice of the Spirit as being neither loud nor harsh. It is "not a voice of thunder," neither "a voice of a great tumultuous noise," but rather "a still voice of perfect mildness, as if it [were] a whisper"; yet it can pierce even "to the very soul" and cause the heart to burn.<sup>8</sup><br><br>In a revelation given through the Prophet Joseph Smith to Oliver Cowdery regarding his role in assisting the Prophet with translating, Oliver learned that sometimes promptings of the Holy Ghost can cause a feeling: "If it is right I will cause that your bosom shall burn within you; therefore, you shall feel that it is right."<sup>9</sup><br><br>Elder Boyd K. Packer stated:<br><br><i>The Holy Ghost speaks with a voice that you</i> feel <i>more than you</i> hear. <i>It is described as a "still small voice." And while we speak of "listening" to the whisperings of the Spirit, most often one describes a spiritual prompting by saying, "I had a</i> feeling ... "<sup>10</sup><br><br>In another talk Elder Packer said:<br><br><i>I have come to know that inspiration comes more as a feeling than as a sound. ...</i><br><br><i>The Lord has a way of pouring pure intelligence into our minds to prompt us, to guide us, to teach us, to warn us.</i><sup>11</sup><br><br>Another way the Holy Ghost can prompt us is through a feeling of assurance. The Apostle Paul taught in the first chapter of his Second Epistle to the Corinthians that the Saints are sealed and given assurance by the Spirit in their hearts.<sup>12</sup> He further listed the specific feelings the Holy Ghost puts in our hearts; namely, "love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, Meekness, [and] temperance."<sup>13</sup><br><br>For me the feeling of assurance by the Spirit as described by Paul has led me to personally respond to promptings from the Holy Ghost throughout my life.<br><br>Upon coming to BYU four years ago to teach, I was given the challenge of returning to school to obtain a PhD. Since the only university in the state of Utah to offer a PhD in nursing is the University of Utah--and already a number of faculty in the College of Nursing were graduates from that program--I was highly encouraged to look outside the state. Although moving does not seem like a big deal to most people, moving out of state would have been a major sacrifice for my family. We had settled in a new home and had three teenagers, and my wife had just begun her teaching career. And that wasn't even considering my actual schooling.<br><br>As my wife and I spoke about the opinions, we prayed that I would find a program that would make it possible for us to remain in Utah while I furthered my education. I identified my research interests and looked for programs that matched these interests. I spoke to a number of individuals who gave me direction and advice. Included in this advice was the aforementioned assurance by the Spirit described by the Apostle Paul.<br><br>The result was that I was able to find an excellent doctoral program at the University of Colorado, which is ranked as one of the top 10 nursing programs in the country. Although there were issues of whether or not I would be accepted to that program, where we would live in the Denver area each summer, whether we would be able to find a loving ward that would accept summer "nomadic" visitors, and a few other minor inconveniences, everything fell right into place. It was amazing.<br><br>For the last three summers my family has packed up their belongings and placed their summer plans with friends on hold. Two of my teenagers delayed obtaining their driver's licenses until we arrived back home in the fall. Precious summer vacation time was used so that everyone could go with me to Denver as I attended school. Yes, we did find housing and a great ward--the Summit View Ward in Highlands Ranch, Colorado, which made us feel welcome each summer.<br><br>We now can laugh at some of the minor inconveniences we experienced. We know that it was only through the calmness and assurance of the Spirit that we were able to move forward even when we did not have all the answers. I have been able to complete my course work, and my family and I were able to meet many individuals and have experiences we will never forget.<br><br>Each of us must find and know the way the Lord chooses to communicate with us through the Holy Ghost. This process is extremely personal. The Lord will not use methods to communicate with each of us different from those He has used in the past. Elder Packer has said, "As an Apostle I listen now to the same inspiration, coming from the same source, in the same way I listened to [it] as a boy. The signal is much clearer now."<sup>14</sup><br><br>If you are unfamiliar with the way the Lord chooses to communicate with you, do not worry. The Prophet Joseph Smith told the Twelve Apostles that receiving promptings from the Spirit is a principle that one must "grow into."<sup>15</sup> It comes after much effort and repetition.<br><br>So what can we do to ensure we are prepared to receive the promptings from the Holy Ghost? After careful study I have found five important factors each of us must consider and strive to do every day of our life.<br><h2><b>1. Live and Obey the Commandments</b></h2><br>To receive the promptings from the Holy Ghost, Elder Richard G. Scott encouraged us to live the Lord's basic commandments. He likened trying to receive promptings from the Holy Ghost when we are not being obedient to pouring contaminated fluid into a glass of pure water and expecting the contaminated fluid to only remain in half of the glass. The Spirit will not communicate with us when there is impurity.<sup>16</sup> President Harold B. Lee taught that we will receive answers from the source of power that we choose to obey.<sup>17</sup> In addition, in the Doctrine and Covenants we are promised, "If ye are purified and cleansed from all sin, ye shall ask whatsoever you will in the name of Jesus and it shall be done."<sup>18</sup><br><h2><b>2. Search the Scriptures</b></h2><br>Elder Bruce R. McConkie taught that one of the best-kept secrets of the kingdom is prayerful study and pondering of the holy scriptures. He stated that this will do as much or more than any other single thing to bring the spirit of revelation into our lives.<sup>19</sup> We have been counseled:<br><br><i>Feast upon the words of Christ; for behold, the words of Christ will tell you all things what ye should do.</i><sup>20</sup><br><h2><b>3. Pray Often, Asking in Faith</b></h2><br>We may be worthy to receive the promptings of the Spirit and may be searching our scriptures, but if we do not ask, nothing will happen. Many times in the scriptures we are told, "Ask, and ye shall receive; knock, and it shall be opened unto you."<sup>21</sup> It is important that each of us has a communication line open with our Heavenly Father so that He will recognize us and we will come to understand Him.<br><h2><b>4. Write Down the Promptings You Receive and Act Quickly upon Them</b></h2><br>Elder Richard G. Scott remarked that when the Lord gives gentle promptings in answer to our prayers, they often "require us to think, to exercise faith, to work, to struggle at times, and to act."<sup>22</sup> The whole answer to an important matter or complex problem rarely comes all at once. Usually it comes piece by piece "without the end in sight."<sup>23</sup> The more you act upon the promptings you receive, the more you will receive promptings in the future. Elder Scott has also said:<br><br><i>We often leave precious personal direction of the Spirit unheard because we do not record and respond to the first promptings that come to us when we are in need or when impressions come in response to urgent prayer.</i><sup>24</sup><br><h2><b>5. Be Still and Listen</b></h2><br>In our scriptures we find the passage "Be still, and know that I am God" in both the Old Testament and in the Doctrine and Covenants.<sup>25</sup> Do you think the Lord is trying to tell us something? To get stillness in our lives, we need to come to a complete stop and listen. My wife pointed out that stillness does not mean idleness; stillness has a purpose. And that purpose is for us to know God and feel the promptings from the Holy Ghost. Stillness is pausing with a purpose. Is it any wonder that we are drawn to the stillness of the temple, the purpose of which is to come to know our Heavenly Father, Jesus Christ, and Their plan for us?<br><br>I would like to end with a story that illustrates this concept a bit more through one of my favorite scripture passages in the New Testament, found in verses 13 through 32 of Luke 24.<br><br>Now, for a moment, imagine with me the busyness and crowded city streets of Jerusalem, the bustle of the ending of the Sabbath day, and what must have been the predominant conversation on the crowded streets concerning the Crucifixion and Resurrection of Jesus Christ.<br><br>Two men, one by the name of Cleopas, were walking to a village called Emmaus, which is about threescore furlongs--or about five to seven miles--from Jerusalem. During their walk to Emmaus, they talked about what had transpired over the past few days. Let me read, starting with verse 15:<br><br><i>And it came to pass, that, while they communed together and reasoned, Jesus himself drew near, and went with them.</i><br><br><i>But their eyes were holden that they should not know him.</i><br><br><i>And he said unto them, What manner of communications are these that ye have one to another, as ye walk, and are sad?</i><br><br>Cleopas commented to Jesus, who was unrecognizable to him, that He must be a stranger in Jerusalem because He did not know the happenings that had occurred over the past few days. Jesus desired to know more, and Cleopas proceeded to tell Him about the Savior, who was "mighty in deed and word before God," and how He was condemned to death by the chief priests and rulers. He continued to give an account that after Jesus' Crucifixion, His body was laid in a sepulchre, and when "certain women" visited the sepulchre and found not His body, they were told by an angel that Jesus had risen.<br><br>Continuing on their journey toward Emmaus, the two men approached the village and said to Jesus:<br><br><i>Abide with us: for it is toward evening, and the day is far spent. ...</i><br><br><i>And it came to pass, as he sat at meat with them, he took bread, and blessed it, and brake, and gave to them.</i><br><br><i>And their eyes were opened, and they knew him; and he vanished out of their sight.</i><br><br><i>And they said one to another, Did not our heart burn within us, while he talked with us by the way, and while he opened to us the scriptures?</i><br><br>I have often wondered why these two men's eyes were "holden," as the scriptures report. Were they so focused on their journey to Emmaus and the miraculous happenings of the day that when the Lord Himself approached and journeyed with them, they did not recognize the Lord until just before He had gone?<br><br>I hope as you and I have journeyed and will journey on our "roads to Emmaus," we will listen and be still in order to recognize the Holy Spirit in our lives--the teachings and promptings. It is my prayer that we will create stillness in our lives and that the fruits of listening will become the sweet assurance of the Spirit for each of us, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Troy W.

<h1>ays Remember Him” - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I am humbled this morning to share a few words and pray I might say some things that will increase our desire and ability to live the gospel of Jesus Christ. I am grateful for university devotionals. They are a nice break from academic work and let us focus on the weightier matters of the kingdom. I know you students appreciate the chance to get away from writing papers and studying for exams. I have heard how difficult some of those exams can be.<br><br>I was told of a zoology professor who is so tough a grader that nobody has ever received an A in his course. Last semester, history was being made because an especially bright student had A's on the two midterms. If he could get an A on the final he would have the first A in this professor's class--ever. The final test was on birds, and so the student practically memorized the three chapters on birds. He went to the library, checked out extra readings, and felt ready for anything that might appear on the final.<br><br>The day of the final the professor said, "Good morning, students. This is your final exam." From underneath the table he pulled out three stuffed birds. Each of them was covered with a little hood, and all you could see were the legs and feet poking out from underneath the hoods. He said, "Now, students, looking at the legs and feet of these three specimens, I'd like you to tell me their common names and their scientific names. That's all you have to do. You have an hour and a half to complete the exam. Begin."<br><br>The class sat absolutely stunned. There are thousands of bird species. How do you identify a bird by looking at the legs and feet? This test was given so nobody would get an A. The student who previously thought he had a shot at getting an A wrote down some names he knew were probably incorrect. He went up, slammed his paper on the professor's desk, and said, "Sir, that's the dumbest test I've ever taken in my life. I want to tell you something else. You are the most boring lecturer on this campus."<br><br>The professor fumbled for a pen and said, "Just one minute, student. What was your name?"<br><br>The student thought for a second, pulled up his pant leg, showed his hairy leg, and said, "Why don't you tell <i>me?</i>"<br><br>Sometimes professors need to be put in their places.<br><br>Now I know you appreciate this chance to have a break from academics, but I'm hoping you won't mind if I pull a short pop quiz to help explore today's subject. Please answer the following questions in your mind.<br><br><b>Question Number 1:</b> What great event turned around the life of Alma the Younger? If you responded that an angel of God came down and called Alma to repentance, I would give you partial credit. Certainly that was part of the equation. But I think the story more importantly illustrates the power of remembering the Savior and thinking of Him than it illustrates the ability of angels to call us to repentance.<br><br>Alma reported being tormented for three days. Sometimes we think that is some sort of record. It's not. He could have gone three months, three years, or a lifetime and still not felt redemption. In other Book of Mormon stories angels confronted individuals such as Laman and Lemuel with their misdeeds, but no repentance and lasting change were seen. What was the difference with Alma the Younger? Here is how he described it:<br><br><i>As I was thus racked with torment, while I was harrowed up by the memory of my many sins, behold, I remembered also to have heard my father prophesy unto the people concerning the coming of one Jesus Christ, a Son of God, to atone for the sins of the world.</i><br><br><i>Now, as my mind caught hold upon this thought, I cried within my heart: O Jesus, thou Son of God, have mercy on me, who am in the gall of bitterness, and am encircled about by the everlasting chains of death.</i><br><br><i>And now, behold, when I thought this, I could remember my pains no more.</i><sup>1</sup><br><br>I believe this story illustrates the tremendous power of remembering and thinking about the Savior. The focus of this devotional talk is the need to "always remember him" and to consider the blessings that come from remembering the Savior.<br><br>Back to the pop quiz.<br><br><b>Question Number 2:</b> If you combine the two sacrament prayers,<sup>2</sup> how many times is the phrase "and keep his commandments" used? The answer is one time. It is in the blessing of the bread.<br><br><b>Question Number 3:</b> In the sacrament prayers, how many times are the phrases "in remembrance" and "always remember him" used? The answer is that each phrase is used in both of the prayers. The Lord wants us to take seriously our promise to keep His commandments. I believe He is equally serious about our promise to always remember His Son.<br><br><b>Question Number 4:</b> In your average day, how many times do you remember Him? In other words, if I could be with you at the end of the day and download your mental files to examine what you have thought about during the last 24 hours, how many times would I find that you specifically, deliberately, deeply thought about the Lord Jesus Christ? We sing the song "I Need Thee Every Hour," not "I Need Thee Once in a While, or Occasionally." In the Doctrine and Covenants we are told to "look unto me in every thought."<sup>3</sup> We are counseled to "let virtue garnish [our] thoughts unceasingly."<sup>4</sup> In the sacrament prayers we promise to "always remember him."<br><br>Now certainly the Lord does not imply that every single thought be focused on His Son. We are not mystic monks who spend the whole day in meditation. We have real jobs and real assignments, and we live in the real world that requires our intellectual energy. But, throughout the day, good disciples of the Master should frequently think of the Savior in order to have His spirit to be with them. If any of you is a good, devout Buddhist, I would expect that your mind frequently returns to and contemplates the teachings of Buddha. A good disciple of Confucius contemplates the teachings and virtues of that master. I am impressed with devout Muslims who at least five times a day stop their routines to pray and contemplate their relationship with Allah. How many times a day should thoughts of a good Christian return to Galilee or Gethsemane? And how frequently should covenant-renewing disciples in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints think of their Savior and Redeemer? The answer is "Always."<br><br>At times in my life I have been embarrassed about how little I thought about the Savior. I could have been classified as maybe a good Zoramite but certainly not a Christian. A description of how the Zoramites worshipped is given in Alma 31. The people said their hollow prayers on Rameumptom, then<br><br><i>they returned to their homes, never speaking of their God again</i> [and I would insert "never thinking of Him either"] <i>until they had assembled themselves together again to the holy stand, to offer up thanks after their manner.</i><sup>5</sup><br><br>The Zoramites didn't have the time to remember the Lord. They, like we, must have been a very busy people. Are you a good Zoramite? Do you remember the Savior only from sacrament meeting to sacrament meeting or just a few times throughout the week?<br><br>Later in this same chapter Alma shared what the Zoramites were thinking about. Both their hearts and minds were set on the things of this world. The Zoramites' hang-ups were materialism and persecution of the poor. They remind me of the ghost of Jacob Marley, who asked Ebenezer Scrooge, "Why did I walk through crowds of fellow-beings with my eyes turned down, and never raise them to that blessed Star which led the Wise Men to a poor abode?"<sup>6</sup> The answer is simple. His thoughts were on other things. In Marley's own words, "In life my spirit never roved beyond the narrow limits of our money-changing hole."<sup>7</sup><br><br>In our day we suffer from the same busy lifestyle and materialism that afflicted the Zoramites, but we also have added a variety of additional distractions that prevent us from remembering and thinking about the Savior. Our minds are stuffed with the thoughts of pop culture, entertainment, advertising, hobbies, sports, and other trivial concerns that easily crowd out those vital thoughts we should be having of the Savior.<br><br>President Monson challenged us:<br><br><i>Prepare time for him in our lives and room for him in our hearts. In these busy days there are many who have time for golf, time for shopping, time for work, time for play--but no time for Christ.</i><br><br><i>Lovely homes . . . provide rooms for eating, rooms for sleeping, playrooms, sewing rooms, television rooms, but no room for Christ.</i><br><br><i>. . . Do we flush with embarrassment when we remember, "And she brought forth her firstborn son, and wrapped him in swaddling clothes, and laid him in a manger; because there was no room for them in the inn." (Luke 2:7.) No room. No room. No room. Ever has it been.</i><sup>8</sup><br><br>A few years ago I was in a conference where President Hinckley urged brothers and sisters to turn off those "inane and empty television programs."<sup>9</sup> <i>Inane</i> is a good word. It is defined as something devoid of purpose; senseless; meaningless. I have observed that sometimes there are some inane mental thought channels in my mind that could and should be replaced by more purposeful, deliberate thinking of the Savior. Is that true for you?<br><br>In the time of the Savior, the question "What think ye of Christ?"<sup>10</sup> was put to the Pharisees. Perhaps the more appropriate question for our day is "Do we think of Christ?" We sing the words "I think of his hands pierced and bleeding to pay the debt! / Such mercy, such love, and devotion can I forget?" And then we sing, "No, no," that we won't.<sup>11</sup> But as we examine our daily thoughts, we might have to confess, "Yes, yes," we do indeed too often forget.<br><br>Now back to our pop quiz.<br><br><b>Question Number 5:</b> When you remember to remember the Savior, what is it specifically that you contemplate? Here are a few thoughts. For me sometimes it is remembering the Savior in a casual way, and this too is good. We sing, "Jesus, the very thought of thee / With sweetness fills my breast."<sup>12</sup> How true. The Church Office Building has rotating printed spiritual thoughts in the elevators that are appropriately titled "Uplifting Thoughts." I find that even a casual reflection upon the Savior is an uplifting thought that fills my heart with peace.<br><br>But we also need to think more deeply. We are counseled to love the Lord with our heart, might, mind, and strength.<sup>13</sup> Loving the Lord with our mind implies pondering and thinking about spiritual issues. With the instruction to "always remember Him," the Lord does not want some form of general, always-sort-of-in-the-back-of-the-mind kind of remembering. God the Father expects that we frequently have full mental attention and specific thoughts of His Son. Part of remembering the Savior, I believe, implies thinking deeply about some of the following:<br><br>&amp;nbsp;<br><ul><br>	<li>His atoning sacrifice and the price that He has paid in our behalf</li><br></ul><br>&amp;nbsp;<br><br>&amp;nbsp;<br><ul><br>	<li>His goodness, mercy, and love</li><br></ul><br>&amp;nbsp;<br><br>&amp;nbsp;<br><ul><br>	<li>His perfect life and His example of living the gospel</li><br></ul><br>&amp;nbsp;<br><br>&amp;nbsp;<br><ul><br>	<li>His teachings and the beautiful stories of His ministry</li><br></ul><br>&amp;nbsp;<br><br>&amp;nbsp;<br><ul><br>	<li>What He is actually like</li><br></ul><br>&amp;nbsp;<br><br>&amp;nbsp;<br><ul><br>	<li>How we can know Him</li><br></ul><br>&amp;nbsp;<br><br>Near the conclusion of the Church film <i>The Testaments</i> there is a scene where Helam, the faithful Nephite disciple, is now blind. The resurrected Savior is visiting the New World, but Helam cannot get to the Master because of the thronging crowd and his disability. The dialogue between Helam and his son Jacob goes like this:<br><br><i>"Is it really Him? Can you see Him?</i><br><br><i>"Not yet."</i><br><br><i>"Can you see Him?"</i><br><br><i>"Yes!"</i><br><br><i>"Tell me. Tell me everything. Describe Him to me!"</i><br><br><i>"He is magnificent, Father! He is everything you imagined!"</i><sup>14</sup><br><br>Brothers and sisters, I like that portrayal. It implies that a true disciple of Jesus Christ, like Helam, spends a lifetime trying to envision in his mind the attributes, qualities, and characteristics of the Savior. How clear is your mental picture of what the Savior is actually like? A good disciple will recognize Him at the final judgment. In the King James Version of the Bible the Savior tells the wicked, "I never knew you: depart from me."<sup>15</sup> In the Joseph Smith Translation the words are "Ye never knew me."<sup>16</sup> Perhaps it would be accurate to say, "You never knew me because you never thought about me or contemplated who I was, what I did, or the attributes of my life and character."<br><br><b>Question Number 6:</b> What blessings do we receive when we always remember Him?<br><br>One blessing of remembering Him is an increased sense of gratitude. It was simply the fact that <i>he remembered</i> that made one cleansed leper so very different from the other nine.<sup>17</sup> The grateful leper remembered and therefore focused his thoughts on the giver of the gift rather than on the gift itself. It is impossible to contemplate the Atonement without a profound sense of gratitude and thanksgiving. Gratitude is the fertile soil from which so many other important virtues sprout.<br><br>A second blessing is the increased measure of the Holy Spirit that we receive. The entire message of the sacrament blessing on the water is that as we remember the Savior, the Lord will send His spirit to be with us. Having the influence of the Holy Ghost is not an all-or-nothing experience. It comes in degrees. Remembering the Savior tremendously enhances or potentiates the influence of the Holy Ghost in our lives. Remembering Him increases the guiding, directing influence that comes from Christ. We sing the songs "Guide Us, O Thou Great Jehovah";<sup>18</sup> "The Lord Is My Light";<sup>19</sup> "Lead, Kindly Light";<sup>20</sup> and "Jesus, Savior, Pilot Me."<sup>21</sup> It is a big mistake to pilot your ship solo and not take Christ as copilot. Failing to remember the Savior often puts the natural man at the controls. Jesus is a far better navigator than the natural man.<br><br>Another blessing of remembering Him is that it recalls to us His example as the kind of person we ought to be. Here in the Harris Fine Arts Center, students are instructed in the techniques of art and painting. This is not one of my skills. A few years ago I was with my family in the Teton Mountains, and our car was parked on the highway because of road construction. I noticed an artist at the side of the road. She was painting the magnificent mountain scene. I had some time to observe her technique. As a nonartist I was impressed at how much time the artist spent looking up at the vista as opposed to the time she actually spent painting on the canvas. In order to get it right, she spent a tremendous amount of time studying, contemplating, and mentally processing the scene she was painting.<br><br>There is an analogy here. Too often you and I have our noses and brushes to the canvas of life--busily painting away but never looking up and getting that inspiration as to what our lives are supposed to look like when we are all finished. If we want to get it right in this life, it is imperative that we lift our thoughts from the canvas of daily life and frequently remember and think about Jesus Christ. If we do so, when our life is finished His image indeed will be painted in our countenance. We sing, "God loved us, so he sent his Son, / Christ Jesus, the atoning One, / To show us by the path he trod / The one and only way to God."<sup>22</sup> As we think of the Savior, we are shown what manner of men and women we ought to be.<br><br>One more analogy: I was recently in a toy store and saw a jigsaw puzzle that boasted of having 2,000 pieces. I am sure there are trained counselors and therapists who can help people who like to put such things together. I am not a huge fan of jigsaw puzzles, but I remember doing a few as a child, usually at Christmastime with cousins. From those experiences I know that it is extremely difficult to put a puzzle together if you do not have the picture that is on the cover of the box. Similarly, it is challenging to put this earthly experience together if we do not frequently look at what the completed picture ought to look like. The life and perfect example of the Savior provides this picture. I suggest you refer to it frequently.<br><br>The idea of using the Savior's example as a blueprint for our own life is well expressed in two Primary children's songs. One states: "I'm trying to be like Jesus; / I'm following in his ways. / I'm trying to love as he did, in all that I do and say."<sup>23</sup> Then there is an older song that I sang as a child: "So, little children, / Let's you and I / Try to be like him, / Try, try, try."<sup>24</sup> We will never achieve it in this life, but remembering the Savior and thinking about His attributes will help us to come closer to the mark.<br><br>Remembering Christ opens our thoughts and actions to the needs of others. The natural man sees life's issues through the dim and cloudy lens of "What's in it for me?" Thinking of the Savior is like putting on corrective glasses that help us see life's issues with the clarity of charity. Have you ever wondered why President Monson has so many personal stories that illustrate the principle of service and the practice of pure religion undefiled? After listening to one of his talks, I think I found a clue. He said:<br><br><i>Through the years, the offices I have occupied have been decorated with lovely paintings of peaceful and pastoral scenes. However, there is one picture that always hangs on the wall which I face when seated behind my desk. It is a constant reminder of Him whom I serve, for it is a picture of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ. When confronted with a vexing problem or difficult decision, I always gaze at that picture of the Master and silently ask myself the question, "What would He have me do?" No longer does doubt linger, nor does indecision prevail. The way to go is clear, and the pathway before me beckons.</i><sup>25</sup><br><br>When we have disciplined ourselves to more frequently remember the Savior, I believe it also changes our prayers. They become more like the prayer attributed to Saint Francis of Assisi: "Lord, make me an instrument of Thy peace. Where there is hatred let me sow love; where there is injury, pardon; where there is doubt, faith." In other words, "Lord, put me to work. Whom can I help? How can I serve? What wouldst thou have me do?" We treat people differently when we think of Christ. We see things from the Lord's perspective. Our tongues are bridled. We show more kindness.<br><br>President Susan Tanner of the Young Women organization told a story that took place when her family was in Brazil. The family had recently left sacrament meeting. A careless driver pulled out into the street without looking and broadsided the Tanner family car. Fortunately no one was injured. Sister Tanner said:<br><br><i>As my husband John</i> [and I] <i>got out to discuss our plight with the other driver, I kept reminding him that it was not our fault. Soon he returned to the car and slowly drove back to the little farmhouse where we were living, with metal grinding against the tires on every rotation. The other car followed. All John said was, "I'll explain later."</i><br><br><i>When we got home, John found our little envelope of emergency cash, and he paid the family to get their car repaired. They happily left. I was astonished. Then John gathered our family together. He was somewhat apologetic as he explained his actions. "I know this accident was not our fault, but as I was negotiating with this family, the only thought in my head was that only a little over an hour ago I had covenanted with Heavenly Father to always act as He would. I knew that if He were standing in my position, He would have had compassion on this family and would have done all He could to help them.</i><sup>26</sup><br><br>Thinking of the Savior profoundly affects how we interact with others.<br><br>Finally, thinking about the Savior helps us to resist temptation and to repent. How true are the words "I need thee every hour; / Stay thou nearby. / Temptations lose their pow'r / When thou art nigh."<sup>27</sup><br><br>I teach a substance abuse class here at BYU, and my students are required to attend an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting. I always read with interest their reports of that experience. The following quote is typical:<br><br><i>At the first part of the meeting the members shared some very difficult personal stories. Basically it seemed like a testimony meeting from hell. But then I listened as these people talked about relying upon their higher power, the Savior, to help them through their difficult times, trials, and temptations. I saw how earnest they were and realized that I did not use the Savior in the same way in my life.</i><sup>28</sup><br><br>In Primary we learn all of the R words of repentance such as <i>recognition</i> and <i>restitution,</i> but we should never forget that the word that starts with a capital R is the word <i>Redeemer.</i> The Lord can give us increased power and ability to resist temptation and to overcome the natural man. There is no better example of resisting temptation than the Savior's perfect performance on the Mount of Temptation. Equally powerful is His example before the Sanhedrin and on the cross when He demonstrated perfect control of His tongue. What an example of self-mastery!<br><br>As with Alma the Younger, remembering the Savior helps us repent. Let me share a personal story. For the past few years our department has sponsored a Tobacco Control Intervention in Eastern Europe--a place in dire need of assistance with this issue. Petty crime, especially pickpocketing, is a problem there, as it is in many places of the world. I followed all of the crime prevention advice we gave to our students. I bought a cheap substitute wallet, took out all of my credit cards, and kept a minimal amount of cash with me. I also put my wallet in my front rather than back pocket. One day while I was on the subway, some very skilled "Artful Dodger" picked me clean.<br><br>It was the first time in my life that I had been directly victimized by a crime. It bothered me. It bothered me a lot. I started brooding over this incident and devoted an extreme amount of mental energy and time thinking about it. I confess I had some very unchristian thoughts of what I would do to the thief if I ever caught him or what should be done with him. In the Doctrine and Covenants it says that when you are sinned against and you refuse to forgive the sinner, you have the greater problem.<sup>29</sup> I was exhibit A of that principle.<br><br>Even after four days I was still thinking about this "terrible injustice" in the middle of the night to the extent that I lost hours of sleep. I slept through my alarm and missed sacrament service. I nevertheless went to priesthood and Sunday School and decided to stay for the next branch's sacrament meeting. I came into the chapel early. They have a very small hymnal in Ukraine, and the organist was playing some Christmas songs, in June, for the prelude. I started to contemplate the beautiful words of these Christmas hymns and thought of my Savior. I began to have a change of heart.<br><br>Two Aaronic Priesthood members came to prepare the sacrament. I have been a teacher and a teachers quorum advisor. You give me a couple of teachers and a good water faucet and the sacrament can be prepared in just a few minutes. It does not take a lot of attention.<br><br>That was not the case with these young Aaronic Priesthood holders. The first thing they did was say a prayer before they started to prepare the sacrament. I assume they were praying to put themselves in the frame of mind for this holy ordinance. I had never seen this kind of devotion before.<br><br>Then they carefully laid the first linen on the sacrament table. They stood back to make sure all the corners were perfectly correct. They carefully pressed out a few wrinkles. They placed cups in the water trays and with bottled water carefully and uniformly filled each cup. They placed the bread on the table, then reverently and with great solemnity covered the sacrament table as if they were covering the dead body of the crucified Christ. I do not think Joseph of Arimathea and the earlier disciples showed any more reverence when they took care of the body of our Lord.<br><br>Watching these Aaronic Priesthood brethren touched me deeply and caused me to think about the teachings of the Savior. No angels came down from heaven to smite me, but the Spirit whispered the following message to my soul: "Brother Lindsay, you big baby! You lost 12 bucks and a cheap wallet, pal. Get over it! You claim to be a disciple of Christ; now act like it. That's not how the Master would do it." I was chastened.<br><br>The meeting started and rapidly progressed to the sacrament. I did not speak the language, but as the priests offered the sacrament prayers with heartfelt expression, I felt the meaning of the words, which sank deep into my heart. I remembered my Savior, and I cried unto Him, saying, "I am so sorry for my unchristian thoughts and actions. I have been so narrow, so petty. I can do better, and, with Thy help, I will do better. I want to be Thy disciple. Please forgive me."<br><br>As my mind caught hold upon this thought, from the top of my head to the soles of my feet the most beautiful spirit erased all the enmity and feelings of revenge that had infected my soul. All those negative feelings were completely gone. Brothers and sisters, I testify that when we remember the Savior, good things happen.<br><br>I apologize for my wandering words this morning. Almost all of what I wanted to say today has been more eloquently expressed in a single paragraph by a modern prophet of God. Consider this counsel from President Howard W. Hunter:<br><br><i>Let us follow the Son of God in all ways and in all walks of life. Let us make him our exemplar and our guide. We should at every opportunity ask ourselves, "What would Jesus do?" and then be more courageous to act upon the answer. We must follow Christ, in the best sense of that word. We must be about his work as he was about his Father's. We should try to be like him. . . .</i><br><br><i>We must know Christ better than we know him; we must remember him more often than we remember him; we must serve him more valiantly than we serve him. Then we will drink water springing up unto eternal life and will eat the bread of life.</i><sup>30</sup><br><br>The prophet Alma taught that out of simple things great things come to pass.<sup>31</sup> Remembering the Savior and thinking about Him are certainly simple things, but I testify they bring mighty changes in our lives. Thinking of the Savior fills us with gratitude. It more powerfully increases the ability of the Holy Spirit to direct our lives. It helps us repent and change our behavior; it opens our eyes to the needs of others; and it helps us resist temptation. I testify that each of us has the ability to train and discipline our minds to more frequently remember Him.<br><br>We seldom sing the fifth verse from the sacrament hymn "God Loved Us, So He Sent His Son." The final verse states, "This sacrament doth represent / His blood and body for me spent. / Partaking now is deed for word / That I remember him, my Lord."<sup>32</sup> "Deed for word" means an action for a promise that we remember Him, our Lord. It is my prayer that we will all more fully keep this promise to always remember the Savior. As we do so, I promise we will be blessed and will become more effective disciples in His holy work. I so testify in the sacred name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Gordon B.

<h1> Present Me Wings” - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Several years ago one of our BYU performing groups was on tour in Riga, Latvia. As was customary, the students were assigned host families who would share their homes during the duration of our stay in that city.<br><br>Two young men were assigned to a nonmember host "mom." Despite the cultural and language barrier that existed between them and the limited time that they would be together, one of these young men felt a strong impression to share the gospel with his new friend. Even the concept of a Heavenly Father was new to her, but, somehow, with the help of the Spirit and an English-Russian dictionary, her heart and mind were opened to new ideas she could never have imagined, and she listened, learned, and believed. Several weeks later this young man received a beautiful letter from this sweet sister--written with the help of the same English-Russian dictionary--expressing her thanks and her belief in God. She concluded with these words: "I wasn't know why or what for I lived and you present me wings."<br><br>Now I've thought about that phrase a lot as I have watched hundreds of young performers go out from our campus each year to take a message of friendship and brotherhood to people all over the world. But today I would like to tell you a little about the performing group that I have the privilege of directing: the BYU Living Legends.<br><br>The Living Legends is a unique group consisting of Native American, Latin American, and Polynesian students--descendants of the Lamanite people of the Book of Mormon.<br><br>Working closely with them for the last 15 years, I have come to love and respect these extraordinary students and their precious cultures. I am not at all surprised by the glorious prophecies that have been made concerning them during our day.<br><br>We read in the Doctrine and Covenants that "the Lamanites shall blossom as the rose" (D&amp;amp;C 49:24). President Spencer W. Kimball, a great friend of the Lamanites, said they would "rise in majesty and power" (CR, October 1947, 22), and he prophesied a future for them filled with culture, refinement, education, and positions of great leadership.<br><br>President Brigham Young said we should "look to see them like a flame of fire, a mighty rushing torrent, like the grand march of angels" ("A Sermon by President Brigham Young," Young Woman's Journal 1, no. 8 (May 1890): 263; sermon by Brigham Young delivered on June 1, 1876, in St. George, Utah, on the occasion of his 76th birthday).<br><br>Seeing a "grand march of angels" is often what I feel I'm seeing as I travel with the Living Legends. These are students who dedicate their time and talents, often at great personal sacrifice, to carry forth the message of the Book of Mormon through the music, dance, and legends of their cultures.<br><br>Let me tell you about some of the times I have watched them "present wings" to people all over the world.<br><br>Due in great part, I am sure, to their ethnic diversity, the Living Legends had the remarkable yet challenging opportunity to take part in numerous activities during the 2002 Winter Olympic Games in Salt Lake City. In addition to performances at the Olympic Village and the Medals Plaza, they were featured in the opening ceremonies and, of course, the glorious production of Light of the World at the Conference Center.<br><br>It sounds glamorous, but in fact it meant months of long rehearsals and long bus rides between Provo and the Olympic venues in Salt Lake City. The last few weeks the students boarded buses at the Richards Building each school day at 4 p.m., returning at midnight. Saturdays started at 8 a.m. and lasted far into the evening as well.<br><br>Along with this sacrifice came many miracles and blessings, but perhaps the sweetest to me came just after the close of our last Olympic performance.<br><br>One of our greatest concerns with our schedule was that Light of the World would close just one week before our campus performance of Seasons, our 90-minute show. That meant just one week to rehearse and polish a show that we had quickly learned back in September before the Olympic rehearsals began. You can imagine then our shock and concern when Elder Robert D. Hales stood before an audience of 22,000 at our closing Saturday night performance to announce a one-week extension of the show, which would then close the following Saturday afternoon.<br><br>Shock turned to panic as we realized the implications for our campus show. Not only would we have to cancel our Friday night performance, but any rehearsal time during the following week was now gone as well. I still remember the Living Legends racing through the long underground tunnels in the vast Conference Center following that last Saturday afternoon show, gathering hundreds of costumes and props and climbing onto the buses for the journey down to Provo, and unloading right here in the de Jong Concert Hall fewer than 90 minutes before our show was to begin.<br><br>As we were making final show preparations, I noticed six Native American girls out in the tunnel rehearsing a particularly difficult dance called the Jingle Dance. It is a sacred dance requiring intricate footwork and formations while adjusting to the sound made by 350 jingles per dress that sway in a rhythm different from the drumbeat. Families and friends had traveled from reservations in other states to watch, and tradition dictated that it should be done perfectly.<br><br>Repeated rehearsals of the dance made it evident that the task was beyond their ability to accomplish, and suggestions were offered as to how disaster could be averted. Not doing the dance was discussed but could not be an option since lighting and music cues and costume changes depended on that time slot being filled. Simply going out and "freestyling" was another option to consider. But at 7:15, with only 15 minutes until the performance was to begin, the section leader quietly stood up and said:<br><br>We have fulfilled every request made of us these past months, we have represented our culture in a positive way to the entire world. We have been obedient to the prophet's request to extend the blessings of Light of the World to thousands more people this week. We have done all that we can do, and now we must trust in the Lord. We will do the dance as we have rehearsed it.<br><br>As the show progressed that evening into the "Season of Plenty," where the Jingle Dance is performed, every other member of the group lined up in the wings to watch as these six Native American girls walked out onto the stage. The entire company wept together three and a half minutes later as the girls walked offstage, having performed a perfect Jingle Dance. It was certainly a miracle preceded by great faith. These same girls rehearsed that dance for a full two weeks following that show before ever performing it that well again.<br><br>Taking the Living Legends to Native American reservations is always rewarding and inspiring and always an opportunity to reach out to impressionable youth who may not realize the possibility of a better life. On one such trip we found ourselves in a high school where the condition of the gym and the graffiti on the walls made it obvious that standards, values, and morals were not a high priority. As we set up for our assembly, we suspected these students might be a challenging audience. They entered the gym with revealing, suggestive clothing, and boisterous obscenities filled the air. Our suspicions were confirmed.<br><br>The assembly was about to begin when the principal rushed backstage with an urgent request. They were having a terrible epidemic of immorality and teenage pregnancies. Would one of our young ladies be willing to talk to the students, especially the girls, about this problem? The term being thrown to the lions crossed my mind. I couldn't imagine one of my sweet girls being brave enough to face this group, yet I knew that Heavenly Father was giving us an opportunity to leave an important message.<br><br>I approached one of the Native American dancers--a tall, beautiful girl--with this request and in one instant saw an Indian become a "paleface." With no time to prepare a talk or even think about her comments, Erin nevertheless consented to this daunting task. It was decided that she would speak to them just before our final number, "Go, My Son."<br><br>At the appointed time Erin walked onto the floor dressed in her sparkling white buckskin. Immediately she was greeted with catcalls, whistling, foot stomping, and yelling. She asked for their attention but received little response.<br><br>Then, standing tall to her full 5'10" height, Erin commanded them to pay attention with a power and force that could be felt to the top of the bleachers. Astoundingly, a hushed silence began to fall across the gym. She began by specifically addressing the young girls in that audience. She said, "I know you're up there with your boyfriends, but I want you to listen carefully to what I am going to say to you right now." Then, speaking on a level that they understood, Erin began to ask them some serious questions: What were they going to do after school? Go out in back of the gym for a cheap bottle of beer with their boyfriends? Weren't they worth more than that? And what about later on tonight? Were they going to spend the night with that boyfriend, and did they realize they had a choice? Did they think about the possible consequences?<br><br>As she continued, it suddenly occurred to me that in the midst of this most unlikely place and audience, Erin was teaching these girls Young Women Values: Divine Nature, Individual Worth, Choice and Accountability, Good Works, and Integrity. And she assured them they were worth more than that cheap bottle of beer or a night with their boyfriend, and she reminded them of their potential for good. Because of Erin's preparation, knowledge, courage, faith, and ability to invite the Spirit to guide her, they listened, and the Spirit bore testimony of the truthfulness of her words. The principal told me later he believed that was the most important 10 minutes the students would spend in his school that year.<br><br>Two years ago the Living Legends had the unique experience of traveling to small, remote villages in Alaska at the request of the Alaskan National Guard. More than just performing, we were to be a part of an antidrug campaign. It was an opportunity to reach out with a message of hope and encouragement, especially to the young people, who were feeling the effects and challenges of life in these isolated areas.<br><br>After intense security clearance and with earplugs in hand, we boarded the massive C130 cargo planes for a flight over majestic Mount McKinley and the glorious mountains beyond. Then a small airstrip appeared beneath the clouds. On the runway a column of small trucks and vintage, well-traveled vehicles stood ready to transport our five tons of costumes and equipment and performers to the gymnasium at the high school. With limited time on the ground before the C-130s had to begin our return trip to Anchorage, we quickly prepared for our show.<br><br>Before the performance was to begin, one of our dancers, Tabor Rigg, who was born and raised in Anchorage, addressed the audience about his experience attending high school in Alaska. He told the story of being challenged by his older brother, who bet him $100 that he could not refrain from tobacco, alcohol, and drugs for his entire time in high school. He accepted the bet, dreaming of all the things he would buy with that $100. Well, he won that bet, completing all four years of high school without ever drinking, smoking, or taking drugs.<br><br>He told the audience that he didn't remember ever being paid that $100 but that he had gained something far greater and more important to him than any monetary reward. He had gained a knowledge of his own worth, an impressive GPA, the respect of his peers and teachers, good health, and an opportunity to attend college and further his education. He then challenged those young people in the audience to make the same commitment that he did, with a promise to them that their reward, too, would be far greater than they could now imagine.<br><br>A wonderful spirit prevailed during that particular performance. Children moved closer and closer to the stage, seemingly drawn to the dancers. Hundreds of small hands reached out to touch the performers as they sang their final song. During the encore number these children actually came up on the stage while the members of the Living Legends embraced them and, with tears in their eyes, sang "I Am a Child of God."<br><br>Smiles, hugs, and warm conversations followed that performance, and it was with great reluctance that we finally waved good-bye to our new friends. Perhaps the words of Major Mike Haller of the Alaskan National Guard best describe the window of opportunity the Lord opened up for us that day in Bethel:<br><br>In this region of Alaska young people have a real struggle with huffing, with the use of marijuana, and just a whole bunch of other drugs, and [there are] lots of possibilities and opportunities to get themselves into very deep trouble. In fact, among young men in particular, teen suicide is 16 times greater here in this part of Alaska than it is on the reservations in the western United States, [where it] is already outrageously high.<br><br>It's a real epidemic here, so anything we can do to bring some light into the lives of these youngsters--to help them understand there is a vision of tomorrow, that they can live out their passions and desires and raise their expectations for themselves higher than they've been--is a great day. And in our view, Living Legends will help to do that. It will propel it to a whole other level for these youngsters, a level that many of them never even thought of before.<br><br>Lives will change. You know, I really believe what I'm about to tell you. I believe this. It's the most important thing to me. There is going to be more than one young man, more than one young woman, who will come to this performance tonight, who in my mind will absolutely not commit suicide, will not betray themselves in their relationship with their Heavenly Father, with their parents, with their families, because they had their lives changed as a result of what these young folks will do. So that's what I believe, and I know it. I know it in my heart of hearts, and that's all it's going to take--just that notion, that idea, that concept that there is something better out there for me.<br><br>These young people in Bethel, Alaska, didn't know what they were living for, and someone presented them with wings.<br><br>Now, why do I tell you these stories and what do they have to do with each of you sitting here today?<br><br>First of all, I want you to know and to appreciate the rich diversity that exists here on our campus. People of the Book of Mormon and of many other beautiful cultures are sitting among you today. They sit beside you in your classes, live in your dorms and apartment buildings, and attend your wards. But you may not have had the great privilege that has been mine to learn from them, be inspired by them, and witness their ability to live close to the Spirit with a faith that expects and experiences miracles and a humility and purity that allows their light to shine with clarity and power. You can draw great strength from their example. They come from a great heritage.<br><br>Second, I want you to know that each of you also comes from a great heritage. In Peter 2:9 we read: "But ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light." I want you to know that each one of you is a part of "the grand march of angels" going out into all the world in these latter days. Matthew 24:31 tells us: "And he shall send his angels with a great sound of a trumpet, and they shall gather together his elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other."<br><br>Opportunities to gather the elect, to lift others, and to let your light shine are not reserved only for members of the Living Legends or our other BYU performing groups. Opportunities to serve, to reach out to others, to make a difference in someone's life are available to all of us if we will seek for them and have the faith and courage to accept them when they come. If we will prepare and live worthy to have the inspiration of our Heavenly Father--whatever our culture or heritage might be--He will guide us to be instruments in His hands: to stand up for what we believe in front of that boisterous crowd, to go forward with faith when adversity threatens to make us fail, to encourage by our example of goodness and obedience those around us who are struggling or feeling hopeless.<br><br>As happened in that humble home in Riga, Latvia, on that Indian reservation in New Mexico, and in that isolated village in Alaska, people will listen, for we are given a beautiful promise in Doctrine and Covenants 29:7: "And ye are called to bring to pass the gathering of mine elect; for mine elect hear my voice and harden not their hearts."<br><br>I know that Heavenly Father loves us and that He is aware of our potential for good and our ability to help build the kingdom in these latter days. I know He is even now preparing the elect to hear your words and see your example.<br><br>At the end of our show we hear the words of a wise chief. His message is, "We are of noble birth, for royal blood flows within us. We are children of a Heavenly Father, here to carry on the dreams of our forefathers beyond this generation to future generations." That you will find great joy and adventure in that quest, that you might let your own unique light shine, that you might use the spiritual and temporal education you have received here at BYU to lift up others and truly present them wings is my prayer, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><em>Janielle Christensen was artistic director of BYU Living Legends when this devotional address was given on 2 August 2005.</em><br><br>© Brigham Young University.

<h1>aby Shampoo - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I must have figured out early on that learning has a lot to do with refining the way we see. Surely this was the thought on my mind as I ventured my first attempt at the scientific method. One night, staying over at my grandparents' home, I noticed a peculiar bottle of shampoo. It was labeled "No Tears Baby Shampoo." My grandmother must have purchased it thinking it would be safer for her grandchildren's use.<br><br>I felt an experiment coming on! The experimenter: six-year-old me. The materials: "No Tears" shampoo and my eyeball. I courageously held up the clear bottle of honey-colored shampoo and poured a generous glob into my eye. I think I must have cried for an hour. After that, I showered with caution and learned to examine labels. Somehow the world looks cleaner to me now.<br><br>In spite of this learning incident, I faced a similar experience shortly after my family moved to Japan. A few years older, and debatably wiser, I walked with my sister into a convenience store where we found a small bottle labeled "Sample" (in English) that appeared to be a breath-refreshing spray. The details were all written in Japanese. My sister excitedly bid me "open wide," to which I automatically opened up and received a full dose of cologne in my mouth. I diligently learned to read Japanese after this episode.<br><br>Half blind and short on taste buds, I now reflect upon my educational experience with profound gratitude not only to have survived thus far but for those moments that have converted knowledge into wisdom. To all the graduates, I ask: "What have we learned here?"<br><br>Looking back upon journal entries from my freshman days at BYU, I found what I had written to sum up my year of learning: "An unconfident man will say he has no talent. A foolish man will believe him." This idea has made a strong impression upon me. History classes show us that for centuries we have been myopic enough to believe that someone can profit by making another person lose. In the short run this seems valid enough, but on a more complete scale of time, it's just not possible. When one person is denied the chance to exercise his or her skill or caused to "lose" in some way, the rest of us miss out dearly on that person's contributions--a lose-lose situation.<br><br>My mother once asked, "I wonder how many Einsteins and Gershwins there have been in the world who have lived out their time without a chance to show forth all they had to offer." Maybe they were not allowed the opportunity. Perhaps they lacked someone to have faith in their abilities. Maybe they didn't even know they had something to offer. On the other hand, when someone develops his or her talents and enhances his or her education, the positive effects can be contagious. One person's victory, in some small or large, direct or indirect way, benefits everyone--a win-win situation.<br><br>With this I need to thank you all in advance for the contributions you will make, because I plan on benefiting from them. I know I already have benefited from many.<br><br>It seems only natural that we would underestimate and misunderstand each other since we can't actually ever be someone else. Around the time I was in third grade, I remember visiting my cousins' home and watching them play video games. As I stood focused on the screen, it fascinated me that a character named Mario would stumble into traps and even die as many times as he wanted and yet keep coming back to life. He could even come back as someone else: Luigi or Yoshi. It occurred to me that I would never be afforded that same luxury. This struck me as the greatest dilemma in my young life, that try as I may, I could never look out from a pair of eyes other than my own: never Luigi's or Yoshi's, never Helen Keller's or Lassie's or Carl Sagan's or Brigham Young's. This is a great way to keep a third grader up all night. I wondered, "Is it possible to stay behind Sachi's eyes and still understand someone else's angle of vision?"<br><br>While living in Hiroshima, I learned a little more about seeing through another person's eyes. I remember wandering through Hiroshima's Peace Memorial Park. My two sisters and I, still in elementary school, had a habit of introducing ourselves and jabbering away with random passersby. One day we found an elderly lady staring at something invisible in the river that ran alongside the park. We plunked ourselves down beside her on the bench and asked what she was looking at. She explained how she had been a little girl in a large family, living in Hiroshima during World War II.<br><br>The atomic bomb struck, and all that survived of her family besides herself were her father and two younger siblings. She recalled that the last time she saw her mother and her older brothers and sisters, they were floating down this river brimming with black water stained by acid rain. Her father decided to keep her in Hiroshima and send the two younger ones away to live with relatives in Nagasaki, where they would be safe. Three days later, the second atomic bomb, this time in Nagasaki, erased any trace of her siblings. Not long after, her father passed away from leukemia, leaving her the sole survivor of a once-large family.<br><br>A handkerchief held to her eyes marked the end of her story. This time my own tears came not from something poured into my eye but from a woman's perspective that suddenly came into focus in my mind. It was like filling in a blind spot I didn't even know I had. I feel in retrospect that perhaps Mario's ability to see through others' eyes is not quite out of our reach. With this experience I began to see how crucial it is that we apply knowledge harnessed by wisdom and spiritual perspective.<br><br>How grateful I am to a university that promotes this intermingling of academic reasoning and spiritual vision, a place that has encouraged me to see more clearly and advance my education beyond baby shampoo.<br><br>As graduates of BYU we can all say that someone has had great faith in us. A large portion of our educational expenses came from tithe payers and individuals who generously bestowed these funds upon the university with us in mind. Considering these sacrifices that subsidize our tuition, it is fair to say we have all attended BYU on scholarship. This means someone has deemed each of us a worthwhile investment.<br><br>In thinking about the confidence this inspires--to know that someone believes in you that much--it occurred to me that our Heavenly Father has also sent us to attend this earthly "school" on a full-ride scholarship. Jesus Christ paid the full price, enabling us to come and make mistakes, fix them, learn, and perfect ourselves. Obviously the Lord has profound faith in each of us to invest so heavily in our futures. Just as with a college scholarship with GPA and credit-hour requirements, we are expected to obey commandments. Because of Christ's Atonement, however, we are, in a sense, able to experience Mario's amazing ability to stumble and get back up again.<br><br>In Japan there is an expression, "nanakorobi yaoki," which means "Fall seven times; get up eight." Many times here at BYU I've felt so underqualified that I had to hold my breath and try hard not to look behind me to accomplish the task at hand. Though it has seemed overwhelming on occasion, I am humbled and deeply thankful to be here with all of you today to commemorate the times we've gotten back up again and what we've learned from the times we've fallen.<br><br>I wish to express a wholehearted thank-you to the parents, professors, administrators, alumni, and friends who have invested time and thought, energy and funds, refreshments and love toward our education. We appreciate it deeply, and we'll do you proud!<br><br>Thank you.<br><br><em>Sachiko V. Jensen spoke as the representative of her graduating class at BYU commencement on 11 August 2005.</em><br><br>© Brigham Young University. All rights reserved.

<h1> Voice Be Heard - BYU Speeches</h1>

<br>
What an incredible privilege it is for me to have attended BYU and to now serve both this university and its sponsoring organization. That said, I must acknowledge that being alumni president is not without its perks. One of those is being invited to sit in the president's loge during Homecoming games. (Although, frankly, at times during the last few years, that has been the only thing fun about those games.)<br><br>At one Homecoming game, running a bit late, my wife and I arrived just after the kickoff. People were still milling around, and, although still at some distance, we noticed that our seats were occupied. From my wife's angle above, she could only see that they were filled by an elderly couple.<br><br>Now, you need to understand that my wife would rather stand for three and a half hours than offend anyone. However, her passion for BYU football caused a serious internal conflict. So, being the thoughtful husband that I am, I stepped back to watch with amusement how this conflict would play out. She approached a female student usher to explain that an elderly couple were sitting in our seats and then asked, "What should we do?"<br><br>Seizing the opportunity to tease, and with feigned indignation, I added, "Would you please go tell them to move?"<br><br>A scowl raised on my wife's face just as quickly as the blood ran from the young student's. While looking past us at the elderly couple, only a few rows away, this young lady had clearly recognized who the "seat stealers" were and began to sputter and stammer, searching for words.<br><br>Unable to hold a straight face any longer, and fearing my wife's glare was going to burn a hole right through my head, I smiled and politely asked, "Would you have any other seats? We'd be happy to have President and Sister Hinckley stay right where they are."<br><br>Also attending that particular game was Elder L. Tom Perry, seated about a dozen chairs away and a few rows down. The game was going poorly, with BYU getting beaten badly. Approximately halfway through the third quarter, President Hinckley had seen enough, and, raising his voice in order to be heard by Elder Perry, jokingly said, "Tom, you're just not cheering loud enough."<br><br>Replying the only way appropriate to such a comment, Elder Perry simply smiled and said, "I'll do better, President."<br><br>Today I ask each of you graduates, "Will your voice be heard when it is time to cheer on BYU?"<br><br>I'm not talking about a football game; rather, will your voice be heard when it is time to support BYU's divine mission and objectives?<br><br>Like you, many of the defining experiences of my life were obtained here at BYU, on what I believe is hallowed ground:<br><ul><br>	<li>I solidified my testimony of the gospel of Jesus Christ.</li><br>	<li>I confirmed my desire to fulfill a mission.</li><br>	<li>I was introduced to my sweetheart and eternal companion.</li><br>	<li>I was educated with the basics of my occupation.</li><br>	<li>I learned the importance of service to others.</li><br>	<li>I felt the presence of the Holy Ghost--frequently.</li><br></ul><br>These and thousands of other experiences taught me about the Spirit of the Y and created a stewardship responsibility that I hold today and that requires me to "lift my voice."<br><br>I owe a debt to this university greater than I have the capacity to repay. I would suggest that each of you, like me, has a greater debt today than you realize. As alumni, you are now the stewards of the Spirit of the Y.<br><br>In speaking of the Spirit of the Y at a devotional here at BYU, President Gordon B. Hinckley stated:<br><br><i>You might have gone to another school and received an excellent education. But you came here, and you were fortunate enough to be accepted. You came because you wanted the BYU experience, although perhaps you could not define it.</i><br><br>In that same talk President Hinckley also said:<br><br><i>It has or will become a part of you. You are involved in it. . . . It should--it must--leave an everlasting impression upon you. . . . It should become an inseparable part of your very nature, something almost intangible but of great substance. . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . Having gained it, never lose it. Cultivate it in your lives and hold its very essence until you grow old and gray.</i> ["The BYU Experience," <i>BYU 1997–98 Speeches</i> (Provo: BYU, 1998), 65]<br><br>You graduates today--and those graduates with us today from years past--have drunk deeply of the Spirit of the Y. However, you are no longer recipients only; instead, you are now stewards of this university's reputation and its future prophesied success.<br><br>Make a commitment today to "let your voice be heard." Serve Brigham Young University, thereby fulfilling your stewardship responsibilities and being keepers of the Spirit of the Y:<br><ul><br>	<li>Serve BYU by mentoring those who follow you.</li><br>	<li>Serve BYU by donating your time and financial support every year.</li><br>	<li>Serve BYU by never doing anything that would reflect poorly on its name.</li><br>	<li>Serve BYU by being the employee/manager/owner/citizen who only acts with the highest integrity.</li><br>	<li>Serve BYU by growing the testimony of the gospel that was nurtured here.</li><br></ul><br>I congratulate you on your accomplishments to date.<br><br>As president of your alumni association, I hereby confer on each of you lifetime membership in the Brigham Young University Alumni Association and welcome you to this honored fraternity of more than 350,000.<br><br>I invite each of you to join me in raising our voices on behalf of this great university and the students it produces. I pray that your experiences will have taught you this university's divine mission and that you will faithfully accept your very personal responsibility to carry the Spirit of the Y into every corner of your life, safeguarding its reputation and sharing its light with all around you. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Carr Krueger was president of the BYU Alumni Association when this commencement address was given on 11 August 2005.</i><br><br><i>© Brigham Young University.

<h1>o Celebrate - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Today is a count-your-blessings day; a day to celebrate. And on a day like today, you have countless reasons: You've finally passed American Heritage; you've landed a job that pays more than the Cougareat; you're finished with 8 a.m. classes; you can stop eating frozen burritos; you don't have to trudge across the quad in two feet of snow; you don't have to memorize every element of the periodic table; you don't have to rack your brain for the most clever way to ask out that prospective eternal companion; and you can stop doing your roommate's dishes.<br><br>And, of course, it's also a bittersweet day: You'll stop eating frozen burritos; you won't have those much-loved roommates to eagerly listen to your latest dating fiasco (although some of you might have chosen an eternal roommate); you won't have professors with an unrequired interest in your personal, academic, and spiritual success; and you'll no longer trudge across the quad in two feet of snow.<br><br>But mostly, today is a day of celebrating both where you've been and your leap into the uncharted territory we call life--that thing that happens while we're making other plans. Isn't it ironic how the things we often complain about are the very things we miss the most? Life is funny that way.<br><br>I remember when my husband, Jim, graduated from medical school. I had been a third-grade schoolteacher. With our one-year-old son, Jeff, we were moving from our small basement apartment to Seattle.<br><br>With another couple also going to Seattle, we rented the smallest U-Haul truck made and loaded up our meager belongings: a baby crib, a sofa, a kitchen table, an old brass bed that had belonged to Jim's grandmother, and our books. We were leaving familiar stomping grounds, family, and friends, not really knowing what was ahead. We were excited by the possibilities of the future but nervous about the risks.<br><br>We found a small one-bedroom apartment that cost $96 a month--somewhat less than Deseret Towers. With a monthly salary of $196, we were left with exactly $100 a month to live on! Are you wondering how we managed? It wasn't easy! We paid our tithing and for entertainment played in the tide pools and fed the ducks. We established warm, tender friendships with neighbors who were also struggling graduate students, and we helped with each other's children. Jim served in the elders quorum presidency, studied nonstop, worked late at the hospital, and was on call every other night and every other weekend from early Friday morning to late Monday night. Oh, how I looked forward to those off-call weekends when our little family could be together! But between those weekends, I often felt like an abandoned mother.<br><br>And so at the end of four years of medical school, followed by six more years of specialty training, Jim began his career. I turned to him one evening and said wistfully, "You know, those weren't such bad times."<br><br>To which he replied, "You didn't say that then."<br><br>What will you say about your years at BYU? May I make a suggestion? Just as you celebrate this day, choose to celebrate these years. I know there were struggles and hard times. But celebrate what was happy: the day you opened your letter of acceptance; the aha moment when you really knew that Joseph Smith was a prophet of God; the exhilaration of finally understanding supply-side economics; the relief you felt when you passed physical science; the appreciation for a professor who gave you a second chance; the gratitude for a friend who listened and cared; the liberation found in forgiveness and forgiving; the quiet awe of knowing you were where your Father in Heaven wanted you to be.<br><br>Recently, on the nightly news, a social science researcher shared his findings of what people felt mattered most in life. At the end of his multiyear study, he reported that it was relationships with the people we love. And so I encourage you to celebrate the people you've met and love, some of whom you may not see again in this life: the professor who changed who you are because of who he or she was; the employer who recognized your strengths before you did; the bishop or Relief Society president or home teaching companion who blessed your life with real compassion; the brother or sister you came to know in ways you never would have at home; the classmate or roommate or friend who became your soul mate, or maybe even your helpmeet.<br><br>As you celebrate these things, you will begin to feel a deep sense of gratitude, which is an essential part of celebration. I have learned that we can actually increase our happiness by reflecting on our blessings; by expressing gratitude to our mentors, family, and friends; and by thanking our Father in Heaven. Before you get too far from your BYU adventures, will you just take some time to write a note or two of celebration to those who have believed in you, who have buoyed you up, who have cheered you on? And will you thank the Lord for allowing you the uncommon privilege of attending and growing at Brigham Young University? I know it may not have all been sweetness and light, but it's hard to be grumpy in gratitude. Celebrate where you've been!<br><br>And celebrate where you're going. As you put Provo in your rearview mirror to face the unexpected, choose to celebrate what's to come, to be happy wherever you find yourself, in whatever finds you--because there will be potholes and detours and highway patrolmen handing out tickets. Come what may, celebration is a choice--your choice! Choose you this day!<br><br>In the predawn of Memorial Day, I was awakened by the rolling sound of thunder, flashes of lightning, and the hard pitter-patter of raindrops on the roof. This was no ordinary rainstorm; it was a torrential downpour--"chucking it down," as they say in Britain. Then I heard another sound. It was the chirping and singing of the birds. Were I a bird, I'm pretty sure I wouldn't have been singing at that moment. I probably would have been looking for dry shelter or a map to Hawaii. Listening to them, I wondered, "Are the birds smarter than I? Why do they choose to sing during a thunderstorm?"<br><br>Recently <i>Time</i> magazine devoted an issue to the science of happiness. A list of practical suggestions, based on extensive research, named eight steps one could take to lift one's personal level of happiness. The list did not include money, recreation, position, or even college degrees.<br><br>Let me share the list with you:<br><br>1. Count your blessings.<br><br>2. Practice acts of kindness.<br><br>3. Savor life's joys.<br><br>4. Thank a mentor.<br><br>5. Learn to forgive.<br><br>6. Invest time and energy in friends and family.<br><br>7. Take care of your body.<br><br>8. Develop strategies for coping with stress and hardships.<br><br>[Taken from suggestions from University of California psychologist Sonja Lyubomirsky, Eight Steps Toward a More Satisfied Life, in Claudia Wallis, "The New Science of Happiness," <i>Time,</i> 17 January 2005, A8–A9]<br><br>Doesn't each of these actions include a choice to celebrate? Would one of these steps work for you?<br><br>My great-grandparents, Jane and Robert Dansie, were asked by Brigham Young to help settle the southwest corner of the Salt Lake Valley. To the west of Fort Herriman, Robert Dansie dug a one-room home into the hillside for himself, his wife, and their five children. Over time, 10 children followed. Their daughter, Isabelle, recounted, "One day someone set the dog on the cow. The cow became so frightened that she started to run across the top of the dugout, her weight forcing her feet and legs through the roof, where she became lodged. Mother said dugouts were very nice, but she did not care to have her ceiling decorated with cow legs." Luckily, good neighbors helped to free the cow and repair the roof.<br><br>I've never lived in a dugout--although there was that basement apartment. I've never had cow legs puncture my ceiling--although I've had my share of drips. I used to wonder if my great-grandmother was unhappy because she lived in a hillside and ate sego lily bulbs, wild rabbits, and occasional mutton. I think I might have been. But from all I've learned about her, it seems she chose to celebrate her challenges, to be happy. Amidst difficult conditions, she built a happy family who worked hard together but also had fun together.<br><br>She was known for making people feel welcome in her home--even if it was in a hole in the hill--and seeing that no one went hungry either for food or a kind word. Hers was an example of hard work and service and charity. Hers was a legacy of songs in thunderstorms, of celebration in hardship.<br><br>I think of Father Lehi, who taught that we "are free to choose liberty and eternal life . . . or . . . captivity and death" (2 Nephi 2:27). We can choose to be happy or to be miserable. Both have eternal consequences. Choosing to be miserable assists Satan in his work.<br><br>When we served in the England London South Mission, I asked one of our missionaries, Elder Cole from Ireland, how he handled difficult days. He said, "I think of my mother's favorite scripture."<br><br>"What is that scripture?" I asked.<br><br>"And it came to pass," he answered, adding, "It doesn't say, 'It came to stay.'"<br><br>After their wedding, one of our sons and his wife moved to Los Angeles for school. Not long after arriving, their car was broken into. The thieves smashed a window, stealing a wallet and other valuables. The harsh realities of big city life became strikingly clear. Such an event could have been frightening and debilitating. But instead, they went into their studio apartment and threw a Welcome to Los Angeles party, complete with sparkling cider and streamers. Their choice that night set a tone for their adventures in LA and is one they still recall with great fondness.<br><br>Jim served as the bishop of a singles ward. One Sunday evening after a day of meetings and interviews, he came home and asked me a question: "When we first got married with no money and years of schooling ahead of us, did you ever think we wouldn't make it?" Then he said, "I've been listening to young couples who want to marry but are afraid they can't make it financially."<br><br>Jim and I were perplexed at this outlook because, as a young couple, we never believed we wouldn't make it. We kind of knew it would be hard, we sort of knew our faith would be tried, but we started the journey anyway, waiting for open weekends, wading through tide pools, and feeding the ducks. And somehow we knew we would make it.<br><br>Dear graduates, I testify that you can make it too. Such an outlook probably sounds naï. We will all face our own life struggles that will try us to the breaking point. But I believe that "making it" has less to do with <i>what</i> happens to us than <i>how</i> we choose to handle it. To paraphrase Elder Neal A. Maxwell, "Jesus drank from the most bitter cup without becoming bitter" (see "Irony: The Crust on the Bread of Adversity," <i>Ensign,</i> November 1989, 63, and "The Precious Promise," <i>Ensign,</i> April 2004, 46). Isn't that "making it"?<br><br>I believe this quote is true: "Happiness is not a state to arrive at but a manner of traveling."<br><br>As you reflect on your BYU days, I pray that you will choose to celebrate all that was happy and good and productive. I pray, too, that you will choose to move forward with that same attitude toward all you undertake and all that undertakes you.<br><br>You can make it! You must make it! May you do so with a heart of celebration. And may the Lord continue His watch over you as you let your celebrations so shine among all you meet.<br><br>Class of 2005, I congratulate you for your decision to obtain a higher education and for accomplishing that goal. I also congratulate you family members and others who have supported and sustained your beloved students. Finally, I congratulate you who have chosen education as your life's work--there's much joy in learning and in sharing that knowledge with others. Thank you, all.<br><br>On this day of celebration and in all our future days of celebration, may we all choose happiness. God bless you. May you choose to feel the love of the Lord in your life daily is my prayer in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Bonnie D.

<h1>ging World - to the August 2005 Graduates - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Graduates, families, brothers, sisters, and friends, this is a wonderful afternoon of significant celebration. We are grateful to all of you for your presence and particularly for you, our graduates, who have made today's exercises both possible and necessary.<br><br>I am privileged again to thank our special guests who are in attendance and who are showing their deep and consistent support not only for those being specifically honored but also for those who have significantly sponsored and assisted these who have reached this most noteworthy academic achievement. Parents, spouses, and children have sacrificed consistently to ease the way for their students. Likewise, faculty, staff, and classmates join in the satisfaction of these accomplishments and deserve all of our appreciation.<br><br>We are grateful for Sister Bonnie Parkin of the BYU Board of Trustees and Relief Society general president who by assignment conducts these services and from whom we will receive counsel and encouragement a little later. We note with appreciation the presence of Elder Richard G. Scott of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles who is chairman of the Board of Trustees Executive Committee and presides at these exercises today. We also recognize Elder Henry B. Eyring of the Twelve, Elder David E. Sorensen of the Presidency of the Seventy, and Elder W. Rolfe Kerr of the Seventy and commissioner of Church Education. Spouses of the Brethren and Sister Parkin are seated in the audience, as are Sisters Kathleen H. Hughes and Anne C. Pingree of the Relief Society general presidency.<br><br>I also offer special thanks to our commencement committee; our musicians, ushers, media, and facility experts; and all who have labored tirelessly to make today the special, dignified, and wonderful event that it always is.<br><br>I wish to share something of the uniqueness of this group of graduates and honorees. Our youngest graduate today is 19 years old; some others approximate my own age. You come from 48 states and 62 countries. You are almost equally divided between men and women, and half of you undergraduates have attended other institutions of higher learning in addition to BYU.<br><br>Slightly over half of you baccalaureate candidates are married, and this percentage rises to almost three-fourths of the graduate-degree recipients. Many of you already have children, and we especially commend those who have done so well in balancing the rigors of education while fulfilling fundamental family responsibilities.<br><br>Thanks to so many of you for responding to our Senior Survey. From it we have learned that 90 percent of you feel well prepared for the obligations of family, Church, profession, and community service. I am particularly delighted that well over half of you report no credit card debt and many others report credit card debt of less than $500. Although there are sometimes circumstances that require some debt, including educational expenses, we are grateful that as a class you have been and are planning to be financially prudent. I am particularly pleased to report that the number of BYU students who default on student loans is near zero. It is actually three-tenths of 1 percent or one-17th of the national average.<br><br>BYU, in itself, is unique not only because of its mission but also because of those who choose to come here and are qualified to do so. Increasingly, our students and faculty are closely scrutinized by an ever-widening audience because so many who might like to come to BYU are not able to do so. This means that those who are accorded this special privilege have a significant accountability not only to themselves and to those who specifically sponsor and support them individually but also a high responsibility to all those who contribute resources to the great institution of Brigham Young University, including and especially those providing "the widow's mite."<br><br>Today I am pleased to report to this broad constituency my assessment of the general goodness and high quality of this distinguished student body. As the Lord said of the Church at the time of its organization, "I, the Lord, am well pleased, speaking unto the church collectively and not individually" (D&amp;amp;C 1:30), I believe I can say to the board of trustees, to the membership of the Church, to the parents of our students, and to all other interested parties that they should be generally well pleased with the BYU student body.<br><br>I must hasten to add that even our best students, faculty, and staff are not perfect. We all understand that a large measure of meekness and humility is important for everyone in the BYU community because there is still so much that we need to do individually and collectively to meet the God-given potential that is being rightfully enhanced at this remarkable and unique institution.<br><br>This year we are celebrating a number of important anniversaries. It is the bicentennial of the birth of the Prophet Joseph Smith. It is the 175th anniversary of the organization of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, the 130th anniversary of the establishment of Brigham Young Academy, and the 95th birthday of our beloved prophet, president, and board of trustees chairman: Gordon B. Hinckley. For those of you being honored today, the class of 2005, this year will always be special to you as well.<br><br>A useful exercise for you graduates and for all of us is to consider how quickly the world in which we live is changing. Think of how much has happened just since you last graduated, whether from high school or with a previous postsecondary degree. Almost all who are receiving baccalaureate degrees today left high school prior to September 11, 2001. Those horrific events, coupled with continuing terrorist attacks and wars or rumors of wars in diverse places, have changed the focus of governments, newscasts, and travel plans.<br><br>Other dramatic changes are occurring in our world and will continue to do so--likely at an even more accelerated pace. Inventions and scientific breakthroughs are made constantly. New jobs or occupations are emerging almost daily whereas others are disappearing. Recently Sister Samuelson and I had dinner with other couples who are old friends. That is a terrible thing to say, but we did all go to school together. Two have already retired and two more will do so within the year. Each has been in his or her same job for well over 20 years, and two have been with the same organization for more than 30 years.<br><br>Although they are leaving the employed workforce for multiple reasons, each observes that the world has changed dramatically and that the stability and expectations they had when graduating from university and entering the world of work no longer exist. Current information suggests that it will be very rare for any of you to work for the same firm or institution or even stay in the same occupation throughout your careers. In fact, it is quite likely that most of you will go through three, four, or more significant employment transitions before retiring.<br><br>How do you view the changing world? I hope it is with optimism and encouragement rather than with the disappointment or dismay that we find in some circles. It is true that each of us will need to be adaptable and proactive in our approaches to the future. It is also true that the most portable and precious skill that you will take with you as you leave Brigham Young University is your well-honed capacity to learn continually and to accommodate your attributes and your talents to the changing world before you.<br><br>You have learned important and significant approaches, facts, skills, procedures, theories, and truths. Some of the most important and some that make BYU both unique and necessary are not changeable--nor will they change. These are the moral and ethical values that are deeply imbedded within you; the bedrock details of your testimonies of the reality of our Father in Heaven and His Son, our Savior and Redeemer, Jesus Christ; the vitality and actuality of the restoration of the gospel through the Prophet Joseph Smith in our day; the absolute veracity of the Book of Mormon and the other canonized revelations; and the wonderful blessings of living in a time and in the midst of living prophets. Many other things will change and must, but these will not and cannot.<br><br>On the other hand, much of what seems so current and breathtaking now in each of your respective disciplines and fields will rather soon be replaced or significantly supplemented by new theories, truths, information, or perspectives. Most of the avant-garde approaches in medicine that were the rage when I graduated from medical school 35 years ago have been replaced or significantly improved. I believe this to be true in virtually every field of inquiry or endeavor, and it is wonderful!<br><br>I know that some may find this disquieting. I think we should find it exhilarating. After all, almost all of us believe in continuing revelation, and this applies to all of our work and lives. It is an institutional doctrine, but it is also a direct promise that we can be continually taught and tutored by the Holy Ghost in addition to the other methods you are beginning to master.<br><br>It was Brigham Young himself who said:<br><br><i>Not only does the religion of Jesus Christ make the people acquainted with the things of God, and develop within them moral excellence and purity, but it holds out every encouragement and inducement possible, for them to increase in knowledge and intelligence, in every branch of mechanism, or in the arts and sciences, for all wisdom, and all the arts and sciences in the world are from God, and are designed for the good of His people.</i> [<i>JD</i> 13:147]<br><br>We believe that our doctrine is clear and that your experiences at BYU have prepared you well to serve with personal satisfaction and significant distinction as you go forth to contribute to your families, your communities, your Church, and your countries. You have learned to learn. More important though, you know how to continue to learn. We encourage you to keep your hearts and minds flexible where you should and fixed where you must. As you do, you will be blessed and sustained and will meet the potential and responsibility inherent in being a graduate of Brigham Young University.<br><br>We express our love and our admiration as well as our encouragement as you take your places on the wonderful stage of life in these remarkable days of the early 21st century. I leave my testimony and blessings with you, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Cecil O. Samuelson was president of Brigham Young University when this commencement address was given on 11 August 2005.</i><br><br><i>© 2004 Intellectual Reserve, Inc. All rights reserved.</i>

<h1>mith—The Prophet - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I am grateful for the honor and the privilege of participating with you in this devotional as we commence this wonderful week of education. I am particularly grateful for the theme of this conference: The Prophet Joseph Smith: "Whom I Did Call upon ... to Bring Forth My Work" (D&amp;amp;C 136:37). My hope and prayers would be that from my message, above all else, you will understand that I have a great love for the Prophet and an unwavering testimony of his divine calling and mission.<br><br>A recent article from the <i>Washington Post</i> stated:<br><br><i>The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is the fastest-growing denomination in the United States and ranks No. 4 among the country's churches, according to membership figures compiled by the National Council of Churches.</i> ["In Brief," Metro, <i>Washington Post,</i> 19 February 2005, B09]<br><br>Imagine the Church's humble beginnings of only six members just some 175 years ago--and now it is reportedly the fourth-largest Christian church in the United States, and growing.<br><br>While the accuracy of the study from the National Council of Churches may be questioned, there remains an interest as to why our Church has such strong growth in both membership and activity while other churches reportedly are declining in both. When presented this question by those not of our faith, I have often answered this question thusly: Our Church grows rapidly because of our strong emphasis on the family. We believe in the eternal nature of the family--that we can live together after death, eternally, as a family. Or I might explain that one of the reasons our Church grows so rapidly is that we can tell you the purpose of your life on this earth. We can tell you why you are here; why you experience pain, sadness, tragedy, and suffering; and how you can find peace out of your trials and tribulations. And we can tell you what you might expect after death. I might answer the question by explaining that we have kept the doctrines of Jesus Christ pure. They are the same as when Jesus taught them when He was upon the earth. We have not altered the doctrines to fit the popular mores of the world. I might explain our strong youth programs or give other obvious and popular answers. But these are not the complete answers. They only lead into the real answer.<br><br>The reason this Church grows so rapidly is this: A young boy of only 14 years of age went into a grove of trees to petition his God in a simple matter of prayer. And in his innocence, and to his great surprise, the unimaginable happened. The heavens opened, God and Christ appeared, angels descended, and the true gospel of Jesus Christ, with its authority, doctrine, and ordinances, was restored to the earth in its simplicity and its purity. And because of a 14-year-old boy, we can tell you about eternal families, the purpose of life, and other doctrines as revealed by God. And any honest, seeking person can have a personal revelation from God about the truthfulness of this event. And that is why this Church grows so rapidly.<br><br>Webster's Collegiate Dictionary explains that to <i>foreordain</i> means "appoint in advance" (<i>Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary,</i> 11th ed. [2003], s.v. "foreordain"). In the book of Abraham, the Lord explained that His Son, Jesus Christ, was appointed before the world began (see Abraham 3:22, 24).<br><br>To the prophet Jeremiah the Lord explained, "Before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee; and before thou camest forth out of the womb I sanctified thee, and I ordained thee a prophet unto the nations" (Jeremiah 1:5).<br><br>Lehi explained to his son Joseph that the Joseph who was sold into Egypt prophesied of yet another Joseph who would bring salvation to his people:<br><br><i>But a seer will I raise up out of the fruit of thy loins. ...</i><br><br><i>And his name shall be called after me; and it shall be after the name of his father. And he shall be like unto me; for the thing, which the Lord shall bring forth by his hand, by the power of the Lord shall bring my people unto salvation.</i> [2 Nephi 3:11, 15]<br><br>And so it was on December 23, 1805, after 1,800 years of confusion and spiritual darkness, Lehi's prophecy began to unfold with the birth of Joseph Smith, the son of Joseph Smith, Sr. Like so many of the great ones appointed before the foundation of the world, Joseph Smith began the fulfillment of his divine appointment.<br><br>Wilford Woodruff testified:<br><br><i>I believe that God Almighty reserved a certain class of men to carry on his word. They have been born into the world in this generation. I believe this was the case with Joseph Smith. I believe he was ordained to this work before he tabernacled in the flesh. He was a literal descendant of Joseph who was sold into Egypt, and the Lord called him and ordained him. He gave unto him the keys of the kingdom. He received the record of the stick of Joseph from the hands of Ephraim, to stand with the Bible, the stick of Judah.</i> [<i>The Discourses of Wilford Woodruff,</i> sel. G. Homer Durham (Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1946), 43]<br><br>Brigham Young stated:<br><br><i>It was decreed in the</i> [councils] <i>of eternity, long before the foundations of the earth were laid, that he</i> [Joseph Smith] <i>should be the man, in the last dispensation of this world, to bring forth the word of God to the people, and receive the fulness of the keys and power of the Priesthood of the Son of God.</i> [<i>JD</i> 7:289]<br><br>With this background I would like you to think of two prophecies received in the infancy of the Restoration. First, in the prophecy given by the angel Moroni on September 21, 1823, Joseph was advised by Moroni that his name "should be had for good and evil among all nations" (JS--H 1:33). The second prophecy comes from the Doctrine and Covenants as recorded in October 1831. This prophecy states: "From thence shall the gospel roll forth unto the ends of the earth, as the stone which is cut out of the mountain without hands shall roll forth, until it has filled the whole earth" (D&amp;amp;C 65:2).<br><br>Imagine such incredible prophecies coming from an uneducated, obscure boy from an obscure village where he was known only to family, close friends, and the Lord. What boldness and impertinence to declare the unthinkable before the whole world!<br><br>As Joseph Smith walked out of the Sacred Grove declaring a marvelous revelation, his name was reviled. He has indeed been called a charlatan, uneducated, an egomaniac, and every other scornful name that can be expressed. And yet to those who knew him best through personal acquaintance or personal study or personal revelation, he is revered as one of the Lord's most beloved and choice servants.<br><br>Oliver Cowdery stated: "To sit under the sound of a voice dictated by the inspiration of heaven, awakened the utmost gratitude of this bosom!" (JS--H 1:71, footnote).<br><br>While Joseph and his companions were confined to jail in Richmond, Missouri, and subjected to the most vile language and treatment, Joseph rebuked his tormentors. Joseph's reproof caused Elder Parley P. Pratt to recount: "Dignity and majesty have I seen but <i>once,</i> as it stood in chains, at midnight, in a dungeon in an obscure village of Missouri" (<i>PPP,</i> 1973, 211; emphasis in original).<br><br>Brigham Young testified: "Joseph Smith lived and died a prophet. ... He lived a good man, and died a good man, and he was as good a man as ever lived" (notes from Thomas Bullock, quoted in Preston Nibley, <i>Brigham Young: The Man and His Work</i> [Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1970], 147). Later, on October 6, 1855, Brigham Young declared, "I feel like shouting hallelujah, all the time, when I think that I ever knew Joseph Smith" (<i>JD</i> 3:51).<br><br>Even respected, learned contemporaries saw the potential of the movement restored by the Prophet. Two years before the Martyrdom of Joseph, the New York <i>Herald</i> printed:<br><br><i>Joseph Smith is undoubtedly one of the greatest characters of the age. He indicates as much talent, originality and moral courage as Mahomet ... or any of the great spirits that have hitherto produced the revolutions of past ages. ... Joseph Smith is creating a spiritual system, combined also with morals and industry, that may change the destiny of the race.</i> [New York <i>Herald,</i> 1842, quoted in George Q. Cannon, <i>Life of Joseph Smith the Prophet</i> (Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1958), 345]<br><br>In 1844, Josiah Quincy, the distinguished American judge and congressman, declared:<br><br><i>It is by no means improbable that some future textbook, for the use of generations yet unborn, will contain a question something like this: What historical American of the nineteenth century has exerted the most powerful influence upon the destinies of his countrymen? And it is by no means impossible that the answer to that interrogatory may be thus written:</i> Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet. <i>And the reply, absurd as it doubtless seems to most men now living, may be an obvious commonplace to their descendants.</i> [Josiah Quincy, <i>Figures of the Past: From the Leaves of Old Journals</i> (Boston: Roberts Brothers, 1883), 376; emphasis in original]<br><br>Even as early as 1851, only seven years after the Prophet's Martyrdom, his name reached Europe. The London <i>Morning Chronicle</i> reported:<br><br><i>It can not be denied that he</i> [Joseph Smith] <i>was one of the most extraordinary persons of his time, a man of rude genius, who accomplished a much greater work than he knew; and whose name, whatever he may have been whilst living, will take its place among the notabilities of the world.</i> ["The Mormons," <i>Morning Chronicle,</i> London, England, June 1851; quoted in Cannon, <i>Life of Joseph,</i> 356–57]<br><br>And the list goes on. Truly the bold prophecy of an uneducated, unknown boy has and continues to be fulfilled.<br><br>There were no religious scholars to teach Joseph the true doctrines and principles of the gospel. The most prestigious seminaries, the most renowned scholars had nothing to teach him. Thankfully Joseph did not need to rely upon the learning and traditions of man.<br><br>We read in the Book of Mormon:<br><br>&amp;nbsp;<br><ul><br>	<li>Nephi explained that "angels speak by the power of the Holy Ghost; wherefore, they speak the words of Christ" (2 Nephi 32:3).</li><br></ul><br>&amp;nbsp;<br><br>&amp;nbsp;<br><ul><br>	<li>Jacob testified to Sherem that he "truly had seen angels, and they had ministered unto" him (Jacob 7:5).</li><br></ul><br>&amp;nbsp;<br><br>&amp;nbsp;<br><ul><br>	<li>King Benjamin declared to his people: "And the things which I shall tell you are made known unto me by an angel from God" (Mosiah 3:2).</li><br></ul><br>&amp;nbsp;<br><br>&amp;nbsp;<br><ul><br>	<li>In answering Zeezrom as to how he knew the things of God, Amulek responded: "An angel hath made them known unto me" (Alma 11:31).</li><br></ul><br>&amp;nbsp;<br><br>&amp;nbsp;<br><ul><br>	<li>Mormon explained in his final words to his son Moroni that angels have not "ceased to minister unto the children of men" (Moroni 7:29).</li><br></ul><br>&amp;nbsp;<br><br>And so we see that the administration of angels was not a new privilege to those in the service of the Lord. As in times of old, the heavens were opened to Joseph and angels descended. The veil was pierced, heaven and earth were brought together, and angels ministered. Thus, line upon line, precept upon precept, Joseph was taught by the ministering of angels.<br><br>Joseph's teaching from on high began in the secluded classroom of a grove of trees on that historic day in 1820 when the Father declared: "This is My Beloved Son. Hear Him!" As Joseph subsequently testified, "I had actually seen a light, and in the midst of that light I saw two Personages, and they did in reality speak to me" (JS--H 1:17, 25).<br><br>With this vision of the Father and the Son, Joseph already knew more about the personality and attributes of God than any man on earth. Joseph understood the personal nature of the Godhead and Their separateness--and that he was literally created in Their image and likeness. Joseph at 14 was already a religious scholar--unmatched by any. And with that vision the Restoration was started and the persecutions began. The stone rolled forward and Joseph's name began to be known for good and evil.<br><br>Joseph endured well this all-too-common life of a prophet. We read in the fifth chapter of Acts that the early Apostles were taken before a council of Jewish high priests and tried for their lives for preaching Jesus Christ. After the Apostles had been beaten, judged for their lives, and threatened with death if they ever again preached Jesus Christ, we read:<br><br><i>And they</i> [the Apostles] <i>departed from the presence of the council, rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer shame for his name.</i><br><br><i>And daily in the temple, and in every house, they ceased not to teach and preach Jesus Christ</i>. [Acts 5:41–42]<br><br>And so it was with Joseph. As he recounted his marvelous vision, in his wonderment he stated:<br><br><i>How very strange it was that an obscure boy, of a little over fourteen years of age, and one, too, who was doomed to the necessity of obtaining a scanty maintenance by his daily labor, should be thought a character of sufficient importance to attract the attention of the great ones of the most popular sects of the day, and in a manner to create in them a spirit of the most bitter persecution and reviling. ...</i><br><br><i>... I had actually seen a light, and in the midst of that light I saw two Personages, and they did in reality speak to me; and though I was hated and persecuted for saying that I had seen a vision, yet it was true. ... For I had seen a vision; I knew it, and I knew that God knew it, and I could not deny it, neither dared I do it; at least I knew that by so doing I would offend God, and come under condemnation.</i> [JS--H 1:23, 25]<br><br>And so, like the Apostles of old, Joseph Smith rejoiced in suffering shame for Jesus Christ, "and daily in the temple, and in every house, [he] ceased not to teach and preach Jesus Christ."<br><br>While the intensity and frequency of the persecutions picked up, it did not slow the work. The ministering of angels was proliferating, and the circle of participants was expanding. In summary, the Father and Son appeared to Joseph. The angel Moroni appeared to Joseph in his bedroom in 1823. And then he appeared again, and then again. And then he appeared to Joseph the next day at the fence in the orchard. The angel Moroni appeared at the site of the plates on the Hill Cumorah. Then one year later he appeared again, and then again, and then again. John the Baptist conferred the Aaronic Priesthood on Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery. Peter, James, and John appeared to Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery, restoring the Melchizedek Priesthood. Joseph Smith and Sidney Rigdon saw the Father and the Son in Hiram, Ohio (see D&amp;amp;C 76:11, 14, 20, 23). A heavenly messenger appeared to Joseph Smith to instruct him regarding the use of the bread and water for the sacrament (see D&amp;amp;C 27). Moses, Elias, and Elijah appeared to Joseph and Oliver Cowdery and committed the keys of "the gathering of Israel."<br><br>Moroni appeared to Oliver Cowdery, David Whitmer, and Martin Harris, testifying to the authenticity of the Book of Mormon. The plates, as evidence of the administration of an angelic work, were shown to eight additional witnesses: Christian Whitmer; Jacob Whitmer; Peter Whitmer, Jr.; John Whitmer; Hiram Page; Joseph Smith, Sr.; Hyrum Smith; and Samuel H. Smith (see "The Testimony of Eight Witnesses," Book of Mormon). In addition, David Whitmer's mother was privileged to see the plates, and Emma had the opportunity to handle the plates on many occasions. The administration of angels was not an isolated or infrequent event given to a very narrow group of participants. This was not a one-man show. It was a congregation of respectable participants, both heavenly and earthly. Indeed, the floodgates of heaven were opened.<br><br>Joseph not only lived like a prophet, but he revealed as prophets reveal. As a result of these many visitations from heavenly messengers, Joseph revealed, among other things:<br><br>&amp;nbsp;<br><ul><br>	<li>The true nature of God</li><br></ul><br>&amp;nbsp;<br><br>&amp;nbsp;<br><ul><br>	<li>The need for a Restoration</li><br></ul><br>&amp;nbsp;<br><br>&amp;nbsp;<br><ul><br>	<li>The Aaronic Priesthood</li><br></ul><br>&amp;nbsp;<br><br>&amp;nbsp;<br><ul><br>	<li>The Melchizedek Priesthood</li><br></ul><br>&amp;nbsp;<br><br>&amp;nbsp;<br><ul><br>	<li>The gathering of Israel</li><br></ul><br>&amp;nbsp;<br><br>&amp;nbsp;<br><ul><br>	<li>The turning of the hearts of the fathers to the children</li><br></ul><br>&amp;nbsp;<br><br>&amp;nbsp;<br><ul><br>	<li>The fullness of the gospel through the Book of Mormon, the Doctrine and Covenants, and the Pearl of Great Price</li><br></ul><br>&amp;nbsp;<br><br>&amp;nbsp;<br><ul><br>	<li>The necessity of the temple</li><br></ul><br>&amp;nbsp;<br><br>&amp;nbsp;<br><ul><br>	<li>The charge to preach the gospel to every nation, kindred, and people</li><br></ul><br>&amp;nbsp;<br><br>Joseph's teachings were new, inspiring, and, in the truest sense, revelatory. Among the many original teachings were the following:<br><br>&amp;nbsp;<br><ul><br>	<li>"The glory of God is intelligence" and whatever intelligence a man "attain[s] unto in this life ... will rise with [him] in the resurrection" (D&amp;amp;C 93:36, 130:18).</li><br></ul><br>&amp;nbsp;<br><br>&amp;nbsp;<br><ul><br>	<li>The priesthood is the power and authority of God. It is the power by which the kingdom is organized and governed and a power that all worthy men may hold. But Joseph, the revelator, warned against the abuse of such power in section 121 of the Doctrine and Covenants:</li><br></ul><br>&amp;nbsp;<br><br><i> We have learned by sad experience that it is the nature and disposition of almost all men, as soon as they get a little authority, as they suppose, they will immediately begin to exercise unrighteous dominion.</i><br><br><i>Hence many are called, but few are chosen.</i><br><br><i>No power or influence can or ought to be maintained by virtue of the priesthood, only by persuasion, by long-suffering, by gentleness and meekness, and by love unfeigned.</i> [D&amp;amp;C 121:39–41]<br><br>&amp;nbsp;<br><ul><br>	<li>All men are children of a righteous God, and there is a continuity and eternal nature of life. We are literally the spirit sons and daughters of God. And this gives new meaning to the sacred words, "Our Father, which art in heaven."</li><br></ul><br>&amp;nbsp;<br><br>&amp;nbsp;<br><ul><br>	<li>We are taught tolerance for all men of every race, religion, and station in life: "And he denieth none that come unto him, black and white, bond and free, male and female; and he remembereth the heathen; and all are alike unto God" (2 Nephi 26:33).</li><br></ul><br>&amp;nbsp;<br><br>In the midst of his terrible persecutions, Joseph declared:<br><br><i>If it has been demonstrated that I have been willing to die for a "Mormon," I am bold to declare before Heaven that I am just as ready to die in defending the rights of a Presbyterian, a Baptist, or a good man of any other denomination.</i> [<i>HC</i> 5:498]<br><br>&amp;nbsp;<br><ul><br>	<li>We are taught the majesty of the Atonement--that the Atonement was infinite and eternal in nature. Joseph taught that in the Garden of Gethsemane Jesus not only bore our sins but He assumed our personal suffering, pains, infirmities, trials, and tragedies. And through His great sacrifice we can have hope, and that hope can bring peace to all who will come unto Christ.</li><br></ul><br>&amp;nbsp;<br><br>But history would indicate that the greater the manifestation from heaven and the more glorious the teachings, the more active and determined Satan will be. Thus while angels were befriending the Prophet, the floodgates of hell continued to widen and the devil's angels continued their attempts at destruction. Perhaps the most difficult times were when a beloved associate turned against Joseph. Yet some closest to him returned and remained valiant in their testimonies. Martin Harris and Oliver Cowdery were rebaptized. David Whitmer expressed a desire to return but was never able to rejoin the Saints.<br><br>And some who once spoke evil of the Prophet later trumpeted his name for good throughout the world. William W. Phelps, a close friend of the Prophet who later turned against him, was the cause of much persecution. But, like the prodigal son, he asked for forgiveness and was welcomed back with a letter from the Prophet:<br><br><i>Believing your confession to be real, and your repentance genuine, I shall be happy once again to give you the right hand of fellowship, and rejoice over the returning prodigal. ...</i><br><br><i>"Come on, dear brother, since the war is past,</i><br><br><i>For friends at first, are friends again at last."</i><br><br>[<i>HC</i> 4:163–64]<br><br>Among the many hymns in our hymnbook that were written by William W. Phelps is the stirring song with these words:<br><br><i>Praise to the man who communed with Jehovah!</i><br><br><i>Jesus anointed that Prophet and Seer.</i><br><br><i>Blessed to open the last dispensation,</i><br><br><i>Kings shall extol him, and nations revere.</i><br><br>["Praise to the Man," <i>Hymns,</i> 1985, no. 27]<br><br>What a profound prophecy sung throughout the world!<br><br>Joseph was a father and a husband, and he loved his wife and children dearly. Emma was indeed his faithful companion in the Restoration. She was unwavering in her devotion to the Prophet and her commitment to the work. She was there assisting in the translation of the Book of Mormon. She was there as her beloved husband was torn from her bosom and family time and again. She was there to cleanse his wounds, remove the tar, and comfort his soul. And she was there to lay his body in a hidden, unmarked grave. And Joseph loved her like we love our spouses, and he loved his children like we love our children. And for that reason, perhaps no greater suffering took place than that of being torn away time and again from his loving family to be falsely imprisoned.<br><br>Governor Lilburn W. Boggs issued his infamous extermination order on October 27, 1838: "The Mormons must be treated as enemies and <i>must be exterminated</i> or driven from the state" (<i>HC</i> 3:175; emphasis in original). Shortly thereafter, Joseph, Hyrum, Amasa Lyman, Sidney Rigdon, Parley P. Pratt, Lyman Wight, and George W. Robinson found themselves chained together in an old log house in Richmond, Missouri, under heavy guard. The charges were treason, murder, arson, burglary, larceny, and stealing. The human emotion emerging from these heart-wrenching separations from his family are perhaps best illustrated by his personal letters.<br><br>On November 12, 1838, he wrote his beloved Emma:<br><br><i>My Dear Emma,</i><br><br><i>We are prisoners in chains, and under strong guards, for Christ's sake and for no other cause. ... I received your letter, which I read over and over again; it was a sweet morsel to me. Oh, God grant that I may have the privilege of seeing once more my lovely family in the enjoyment of the sweets of liberty and social life. To press them to my bosom and kiss their lovely cheeks would fill my heart with unspeakable gratitude.</i> [<i>The Personal Writings of Joseph Smith,</i> comp. Dean C. Jessee (Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1984), 367–68; text modernized]<br><br>On December 1, approximately three weeks later, the prisoners were taken to the hostile dungeon known as Liberty Jail to suffer a cold, damp winter. On March 21, 1839, Joseph wrote:<br><br><i>Affectionate Wife,</i><br><br><i>My dear Emma, I very well know your toils and sympathize with you. If God will spare my life once more to have the privilege of taking care of you, I will ease your care and endeavor to comfort your heart.</i> [<i>Personal Writings,</i> 408; text modernized]<br><br>Again, on April 4, 1839:<br><br><i>Dear and Affectionate Wife,</i><br><br><i>Thursday night I set down just as the sun is going down, as we peek through the grates of this lonesome prison to write to you that I may make known to you my situation. It is, I believe, now about five months and six days since I have been under the grimace of a guard night and day, and within the walls, grates, and screeking iron doors of a lonesome, dark, dirty prison. With emotions known only to God do I write this letter. The contemplations of the mind under these circumstances defies the pen, or tongue, or angels, to describe, or paint to the human being who never experienced what we experience. ... My dear Emma, I think of you and the children continually. ... And as to yourself, if you want to know how much I want to see you, examine your feelings, ... I would gladly walk from here to you barefoot, and bareheaded, and half naked to see you and think it great pleasure and never count it toil.</i> [<i>Personal Writings,</i> 425–26; text modernized]<br><br>And here is Joseph's letter to God on March 20, 1839: "O God, where art thou? And where is the pavilion that covereth thy hiding place?" (D&amp;amp;C 121:1).<br><br>And then comes God's answering letter to Joseph:<br><br><i> My son, peace be unto thy soul; thine adversity and thine afflictions shall be but a small moment;</i><br><br><i>And then, if thou endure it well, God shall exalt thee on high; thou shalt triumph over all thy foes.</i> [D&amp;amp;C 121:7–8]<br><br>It was approximately three years later, amidst continued persecution, that the Prophet declared in the famous Wentworth letter:<br><br><i>No unhallowed hand can stop the work from progressing; persecutions may rage, mobs may combine, armies may assemble, calumny may defame, but the truth of God will go forth boldly, nobly, and independent, till it has penetrated every continent, visited every clime, swept every country, and sounded in every ear, till the purposes of God shall be accomplished and the Great Jehovah shall say the work is done.</i> [<i>HC</i> 4:540]<br><br>Then, approximately two years later, on June 23, 1844, Joseph Smith turned himself in to the militia under the control and promised protection of Governor Ford. Joseph's statement to his friends was: "If my life is of no value to my friends it is of none to myself" (<i>HC</i> 6:549). As he rode out of Nauvoo, the Prophet added, "I am going like a lamb to the slaughter" (D&amp;amp;C 135:4).<br><br>Here is Joseph's last letter to Emma, started one day before his Martyrdom and dated June 27, 1844:<br><br><i>Dear Emma:</i><br><br><i>I am very much resigned to my lot, knowing I am justified and have done the best that could be done. Give my love to the children and all my friends, Mr. Brower, and all who inquire after me. And as for treason, I know that I have not committed any, and they cannot prove one appearance of anything of the kind. So you need not have any fears that any harm can happen to us on that score. May God bless you all, amen.</i> [<i>Personal Writings,</i> 611; text modernized]<br><br>Joseph Smith lived the life of a prophet. He suffered the life of a prophet. He died the death of a prophet. Out of persecution, suffering, and the shedding of innocent blood, the stone carved out of a mountain without hands rolls forward. The words of John Taylor continue to ring with increasing power and clarity: "The Book of Mormon, and this book of Doctrine and Covenants of the church, cost the best blood of the nineteenth century to bring them forth for the salvation of a ruined world" (D&amp;amp;C 135:6).<br><br>John Taylor also said: "Joseph Smith, the Prophet and Seer of the Lord, has done more, save Jesus only, for the salvation of men in this world, than any other man that ever lived in it" (D&amp;amp;C 135:3).<br><br>Through trial and affliction Joseph brought together all the elements of the gospel, fitted together like a beautiful puzzle. The true nature of God has been restored. The priesthood is upon the earth. Baptisms can be performed with authority. Temple covenants bind families together forever. The Atonement and the Resurrection are meaningful events affecting the lives of millions. And living prophets today bring divine light to a troubled world. Without the Prophet Joseph Smith, with all his trials, sufferings, and even death:<br><br>&amp;nbsp;<br><ul><br>	<li>The priesthood of God could not be found upon the earth.</li><br></ul><br>&amp;nbsp;<br><br>&amp;nbsp;<br><ul><br>	<li>Temple ordinances and covenants would not be found; hope would be replaced with loneliness, confusion, and despair.</li><br></ul><br>&amp;nbsp;<br><br>&amp;nbsp;<br><ul><br>	<li>The ordinances of baptism, confirmation, and endowment would have no efficacy.</li><br></ul><br>&amp;nbsp;<br><br>&amp;nbsp;<br><ul><br>	<li>The concept of God would remain the great mystery of an impersonal force that cannot be explained or understood.</li><br></ul><br>&amp;nbsp;<br><br>&amp;nbsp;<br><ul><br>	<li>The knowledge and understanding of the plan of salvation and the Atonement of Christ would be replaced with ignorance and superstition.</li><br></ul><br>&amp;nbsp;<br><br>&amp;nbsp;<br><ul><br>	<li>The prophets would indeed be dead, and revelation would be a thing of the past.</li><br></ul><br>&amp;nbsp;<br><br>Without the Prophet Joseph Smith, spiritual darkness would continue to reign and hope would continue to wane.<br><br>The Lord promised, "If thou endure it well, God shall exalt thee on high; thou shalt triumph over all thy foes" (D&amp;amp;C 121:8).<br><br>In his 1998 Christmas devotional, President Gordon B. Hinckley declared:<br><br><i>No one has borne more certain knowledge of the Son of God, the resurrected Lord Jesus Christ, than has this great prophet of this the dispensation of the fulness of times. Praise to his name. Honor to his memory. Reverence to him as an instrument in the hands of the Almighty in bringing to pass the restoration of His work in our time.</i> [Gordon B. Hinckley, First Presidency Christmas devotional delivered at the Tabernacle on Temple Square, Salt Lake City, 6 December 1998]<br><br>Joseph declared the Book of Mormon to be the keystone of our religion. Truly it has brought us the fullness of the everlasting gospel with clarity and meaning. I declare Joseph the Prophet to be the keystone of my testimony of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ.<br><br>&amp;nbsp;<br><ul><br>	<li>Because of my testimony of Joseph Smith, I know that God and Christ are personal Beings in whose image I am created.</li><br></ul><br>&amp;nbsp;<br><br>&amp;nbsp;<br><ul><br>	<li>Because of my testimony of Joseph Smith, I know that I am indeed a child of God with a spark of divinity that surpasses even my most lofty hopes and expectations.</li><br></ul><br>&amp;nbsp;<br><br>&amp;nbsp;<br><ul><br>	<li>Because of my testimony of Joseph Smith, I know that out of trials and tribulations can emerge a triumphant and victorious self.</li><br></ul><br>&amp;nbsp;<br><br>&amp;nbsp;<br><ul><br>	<li>Because of my testimony of Joseph Smith, I know that the divine authority of God reigns upon the earth.</li><br></ul><br>&amp;nbsp;<br><br>&amp;nbsp;<br><ul><br>	<li>Because of my testimony of Joseph Smith, I know that I am privileged to receive ordinances and covenants that, if lived, will bring everlasting glory to me and my family with our Father in Heaven.</li><br></ul><br>&amp;nbsp;<br><br>&amp;nbsp;<br><ul><br>	<li>Because of my testimony of Joseph Smith, I know who I am and what I can become.</li><br></ul><br>&amp;nbsp;<br><br>&amp;nbsp;<br><ul><br>	<li>And, most important, because of my testimony of Joseph Smith, I have a more complete understanding of the magnitude of Christ's Atonement and a more sacred relationship with my Lord.</li><br></ul><br>&amp;nbsp;<br><br>I love the Prophet Joseph Smith. I love him for what he taught. I love him for what he restored. I love him for what he endured. I love him for how he lived.<br><br>And so, in conclusion, we return to where we started: two prophecies. Because of what he taught, because of what he restored, because of what he endured, and because of what he lived, Joseph's name should be known for "good and evil ... among all nations" (JS--H 1:33). And second, "From thence shall the gospel roll forth unto the ends of the earth" (D&amp;amp;C 65:2). The persecution, the ridicule, and the attacks remain even today. You just have to witness the demonstrations during general conferences or the picketing at any temple open house. However, to the thinking and honest, the question of Joseph Smith has moved from ridiculing him and trying to disprove him to wonderment and awe.<br><br>Some 150 years ago Joseph traveled to Washington, D.C., to ask for redress from President Martin Van Buren for the suffering of the Saints. Joseph was advised that while his cause was just, the president could do nothing for him (see <i>HC</i> 4:80). Now just this last May, a symposium held by noted historians in the Library of Congress in Washington, D.C., paid tribute to the life and works of Joseph Smith. In June a similar symposium was held in New South Wales, Australia, honoring the Prophet Joseph Smith. There was no criticizing, defaming of his name, or attacking the Prophet. Rather, these learned scholars stand in awe and wonderment at his influence and accomplishments. Oh, the good his name invokes throughout the world today! "Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them" (Matthew 7:20).<br><br>In our own day Yale professor Harold Bloom declared:<br><br><i>Nothing else in all of American history strikes me as ... equal to ... Joseph Smith ... and the men and women who were</i> [his] <i>followers and friends. ...</i><br><br><i>... I also do not find it possible to doubt that Joseph Smith was an authentic prophet. Where in all of American history can we find his match? ...</i><br><br><i>... Joseph Smith did not excel as a writer or as a theologian, let alone as psychologist and philosopher. But he was an authentic religious genius.</i> [Harold Bloom, <i>The American Religion: The Emergence of the Post-Christian Nation</i> (New York: Simon and Schuster, 1992), 79, 95, 96]<br><br>As to the gospel rolling forth to the ends of the earth, in 1834 a priesthood meeting was held in Kirtland, Ohio. All of the priesthood in Kirtland met in a small log building approximately 14 feet by 14 feet. In this meeting Joseph prophesied:<br><br><i>I want to say to you before the Lord that you know no more concerning the destinies of this Church and kingdom than a babe upon its mother's lap. You don't comprehend it. ... It is only a little handful of Priesthood you see here tonight, but this Church will fill North and South America--it will fill the world.</i> [Quoted by Wilford Woodruff in <i>CR,</i> April 1898, 57; spelling modernized]<br><br>His was a name for "good and evil," and "from thence shall the gospel roll forth unto the ends of the earth" (D&amp;amp;C 65:2). In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Richard C. Edgley was first counselor in the Presiding Bishopric of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when this devotional address was given on 16 August 2005 during Campus Education Week.</i><br><br><i>© Intellectual Reserve, Inc.

<h1>Way - Cecil O. Samuelson - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
It is wonderful to be with you at the beginning of a new school year. This is my third opportunity to visit with you on the occasion of a university conference, and I approach this assignment and responsibility with gratitude to you, to many others, and particularly to our board of trustees for this privilege. I have spoken before about our vision, our antecedents, and also our future and will again do so today, albeit somewhat differently. My basic premise has been, and continues to be, that we are all engaged in the daunting and exhilarating adventure of helping BYU become the best it can be.<br><br>I believe that an essential component for this great university to become the best it can be is for each of us in our various roles to strive to be the best that we can be individually. There are a number of appropriate ways to consider such matters. Today, as we think about how best to improve, I would like to contribute by trying to strengthen our understanding of the context in which BYU finds itself.<br><br>As an example, rather early in the BYU presidency of Dallin H. Oaks, he spoke to the faculty about the need to be "bilingual" in their skills and attributes. Let me share what he said:<br><br><i>In order to be effective at teaching secular subjects and at integrating gospel concepts, we must be "bilingual." . . . We ha</i>[ve] <i>to be fluent in the language of scholarship in order to command the respect of the secular world and . . . we also ha</i>[ve] <i>to speak in the special language of our faith to communicate our adherence to the gospel values that illuminate our learning efforts and justify our existence as a university.</i> ["A House of Faith," BYU Annual University Conference address, 31 August 1977, 12; see also <i>Educating Zion,</i> eds. John W. Welch and Don E. Norton (Provo: BYU Studies, 1996), 124]<br><br>I believe that almost all of us understand the unique philosophical basis and religious purposes for Brigham Young University. Candidly, I am less sure that all of us fully understand some of the practical applications and, when compared with most universities, the almost countercultural approaches we take in a number of areas. I hope to address some of them today.<br><br>In the coming months our bilingual capacities will take on special significance. During this next year we face our once-each-decade examination for institutional accreditation. Our BYU Accreditation Executive Committee chairs, committee members, and others have worked long, hard, and smart under the leadership of Gerrit Gong to draft the BYU Accreditation Self-Study you see referenced on the inside cover of your Annual University Conference program. I invite you to read and comment on our BYU Accreditation Self-Study--both so we will receive your input and so you will be knowledgeable about its contents if a visiting site team should ask you about it!<br><br>In addition, we will also be testing, validating, and refining our self-study institutional and unit strengths, challenges, opportunities, and recommendations in upcoming president's leadership retreats, college visits, Deans' Council and Faculty Advisory Committee meetings, and other campus visits. You recognize, of course, that this is all a natural part of our continuing focus on how and where we work together "to make BYU the best we can be." In many ways, especially coming now, this BYU accreditation process provides a road map for where we have been, where we are, and where we plan to be, inasmuch as we are asked to evaluate ourselves in such important areas as institutional mission, planning and effectiveness, educational program, students, faculty, library and information services, governance and administration, finance, physical resources, and institutional integrity.<br><br>Also, as part of accreditation preparation, this past February a majority of faculty and staff responded to the campus e-mail survey regarding BYU's mission, aims, and objectives. Your thoughtful responses are both heartening and instructive.<br><br>You say you understand the BYU mission, aims, and objectives and integrate aspects of spirituality, service, and character-building into courses and into building character in your students.<br><br>At the same time, some respondents perceive a gap between what we say is important as an institution and what we sometimes reward or emphasize. Several responses ask, "Are we a research institution or an undergraduate teaching institution?" While the answer is "both," I want us to continue discussing how we best define each.<br><br>Some responses feel a tension between student evaluations and the need to teach skills and disciplines. A representative response notes, "I worry that working my students beyond their comfort zone will adversely affect my course evaluations," though to be well prepared, students "need to be pushed, and pushed hard."<br><br>University-wide accreditation is important and essential for a number of reasons. Of course our reputation and standing in the academic universe generally depend on it. There are a number of practical reasons as well. About half of our students receive various government loans and grants that would not be possible if BYU were not a fully accredited institution. As many of our students look to go on for graduate work at other institutions or to enter the workforce, they are judged in a significant way by the reputation and credentials of Brigham Young University.<br><br>Again, many have been working hard and effectively on this project for some time. I express our gratitude to them and to our entire university community for what has been done and for what must and will be done in the few months before next April.<br><br>I appreciate and endorse our theme for this year's conference: "Seek learning, even by study and also by faith" (D&amp;amp;C 88:118). Many have spoken on the phenomenon of our special dual track to wisdom and knowledge, but nothing has been clearer than the word of the Lord Himself. Of all places, BYU needs to keep its activities and efforts well grounded in the revelations and the pronouncements of living prophets. Our scriptures, especially those revealed to our dispensation, are rich in counsel, clarification, and direction with respect to our education, learning, and thinking. This is true for passages that address these issues directly but also true for many other verses and chapters that seemingly are focused on other themes as well.<br><br>Some years ago a respected and loved senior mentor suggested that I reread the scriptures regularly through the eyes of my current calling--whatever that happened to be at the time. I endorse the same notion for each of you and suggest that insights will come to you, as they have to me, in ways not before obvious. This is so, I believe, because of the importance of the context of our lives and responsibilities and also because of the maturation in understanding that should occur with broadening experiences. Likewise, the counsel of Nephi that we "liken all scriptures" (1 Nephi 19:23) to ourselves and not just rely on a few old favorites is both sound and broadening. Let me use an example that I think will help add some clarity to the BYU context of how and why we do certain things the way we do.<br><br>I, like most of you, have long been familiar with section 104 of the Doctrine and Covenants. Given in 1834, it addresses the reorganization of the United Order and the necessary consideration of meeting the temporal needs of the people. Those who have had responsible Relief Society and priesthood callings may recall that one verse in this section is often quoted in welfare meetings and in associated printed materials. I have used this verse myself in such settings. Let me share the specific scriptural phrase I have in mind: "But it must needs be done in mine own way" (D&amp;amp;C 104:16).<br><br>My point to you is that as significant as this scriptural phrase is in the welfare context, it has broader general significance and further narrow specific applications to us even though our primary efforts at BYU have to do with education rather than temporal welfare.<br><br>Let me now read several verses from this section. As you listen and reread these passages later, try to do so with the ears and eyes of one with great responsibility and opportunity to further the mission of Brigham Young University--because I believe this is who you and we really are.<br><br><i>It is wisdom in me; therefore, a commandment I give unto you, that ye shall organize yourselves and appoint every man his stewardship;</i><br><br><i>That every man may give an account unto me of the stewardship which is appointed unto him.</i><br><br><i>For it is expedient that I, the Lord, should make every man accountable, as a steward over earthly blessings, which I have made and prepared for my creatures. . . .</i><br><br><i>And it is my purpose to provide for my saints, for all things are mine.</i><br><br>But it must needs be done in mine own way;<i> and behold this is the way that I, the Lord, have decreed to provide for my saints, that the poor shall be exalted, in that the rich are made low.</i><br><br><i>For the earth is full, and there is enough and to spare; yea, I prepared all things, and have given unto the children of men to be agents unto themselves.</i> [D&amp;amp;C 104:11–13, 15–17; emphasis added]<br><br>This is good doctrine for bishops and Relief Society presidents as they administer to the welfare needs of their flocks. I believe it is also good doctrine for us in our BYU stewardships.<br><br>Let me suggest several principles that I believe apply to us in the context of the doctrines outlined in these scriptural statements. These are broad concepts, but I am convinced they also have narrow and specific applications in the ways that BYU should operate. Think of our special circumstances as I list a few.<br><br>1. Everyone has a stewardship, or obligation. This is true of every one of us--students, staff, faculty, and administration--although the particulars of our stewardship may be quite different for each of us.<br><br>2. Everyone must be held responsible for her or his stewardship. Note that the Lord assigns both the specific stewardship and a corresponding accountability for it.<br><br>3. It is the Lord's purpose to provide for His Saints (including our students and all of us who are here to support, teach, and assist them), but:<br><br>4. It must be done in His way.<br><br>5. We are also agents unto ourselves (see D&amp;amp;C 29:35).<br><br>By now you might well be asking yourself, "What does this really have to do with us at BYU?" That is a fair question and deserves a clear answer. I will do my best to provide a proper response.<br><br>I believe each of these five premises or assertions just mentioned are general principles and not just unique applications to temporal needs or welfare concerns. While the scriptural reference I used seems to focus on pressing temporal issues that were vexing the Saints and the Church in 1834, the principles themselves largely make the case that Nephi was teaching and instructing us that "all scriptures" should be likened to our current and specific circumstances (see 1 Nephi 19:23). If we understand this basic construct, then some things--including and especially some at BYU--that might not be so clear in isolation can be appreciated with new and improved understanding.<br><br>Let me give some examples. This list is not comprehensive by any means but includes some things about which I have wondered, puzzled, thought, and prayed about since my arrival here. I have done so because in our quest to help BYU be the best that it can be, several of these matters, standing alone, may seem counterintuitive to our goals and aspirations. I do not believe they are and want to share my current understanding of why this is so.<br><h2><b>Salary Structure</b></h2><br>The basic salary structure at BYU is quite unlike that of most other universities with which most of us are familiar. It is not just a matter of money--although I've never met a faculty member or administration official at any institution who thought that they truly had enough money. We keep careful comparative compensation data about BYU salaries in the context of a fairly broad series of roughly comparable institutions. For most disciplines, but not all, our beginning faculty salaries at the assistant professor level are close to most index institutions. The most dramatic differences occur in the upper ranks and for the faculty who have been at BYU for a long time. In brief, they tend to be further behind their colleagues at other places salarywise.<br><br>Is this true because of ignorance or neglect on the part of the administration or the board of trustees? In spite of some opinions I have heard expressed on this campus, I am convinced that this is not the case. Rather, fundamental decisions have been consciously and carefully made that take into account at least the following factors:<br><br>1. BYU does not have a "star system" for faculty compensation. Make no mistake, we have more than a few real stars as members of the faculty in their respective disciplines, but their rewards are not likely to be financial. While many universities pay tremendous salary premiums to recruit or retain academic "stars," we do not.<br><br>2. The approach taken at BYU has been to address salary levels at the time that is typically most important for faculty: when their children are young, when they are trying to buy a home, when they are retiring student loans from graduate school, and the like. Thus a conscious effort has been to do as much as possible for the faculty early in their careers. Similar principles are used to ensure that salaries for our administrative and staff personnel are at appropriate levels.<br><br>3. It is a well-considered decision by the board that an element of sacrifice be offered by all who are privileged to have a BYU appointment. Stated another way, it is the intent of our trustees that none of us, including faculty and staff, chooses to come to BYU primarily on the basis of a financial decision. It is the job of the administration and the trustees to see that the gap does not become too large, but it is not the preference of the board to participate in bidding wars with other institutions for faculty, staff, or students. Having said this, it must be noted that in terms of our benefits, we do rather well. Travel funds, start-up expenses, and the like are very generous at BYU when compared with most other places. Likewise, our leave policies and faculty enrichment efforts are really quite liberal and remarkable.<br><br>4. In addition to these considerations, we do look carefully at--and also try to reward--merit and performance in our annual evaluations.<br><h2><b>Church Support of BYU</b></h2><br>Many of you will be aware that the high level and stability of the Church's support for this university is quite atypical, even for nominally church-supported institutions. A general trend in American higher education is for the churches to decrease their support gradually--both in total and in percentages--to their universities. Gratefully, this has not been our lot. In fact, a conscious decision was reached many years ago and regularly reaffirmed by our board of trustees that the primary source of support for BYU and other Church institutions would come from the appropriated funds of the Church. This is so not only because we have a very generous Church and leaders but also because the Brethren have always wanted it to be abundantly clear to whom we would look for our leadership and guidance.<br><br>It is the stated policy of the board of trustees that the fundamental support needed to prosecute the university's agenda would come from the tithing funds of the Church. While we receive substantial amounts of donated funds, these monies are viewed as enhancements to rather than as replacements for the basic programs of the university. The salary support of our faculty, for example, needs to come from Church-appropriated sources so that no one will ever be in doubt as to where we look for our guidance and to whom we owe our loyalty.<br><br>This unique approach is surprising and even confusing to some; but when its foundational reasons are clear, then we have a better appreciation for our remarkable support system and the tremendous protection and security it brings to us. In effect, we have an "endowment" that ranks with those of the most prominent universities in our nation.<br><h2><b>Research Support</b></h2><br>For many years prior to my current assignment, I believed that BYU's well-known reticence about seeking large amounts of extramural research funding was based on an effort to keep the government out of the affairs of the university. As desirable as this might be in the abstract, I have come to learn that there are at least two other considerations that bear on the matter.<br><br>The first is that BYU is subject to careful scrutiny and detailed governmental regulations because we are part of an increasingly regulated world and also because we are the ultimate recipient of millions of dollars of federal financial assistance in the form of Pell Grants, student loans, and the like. Thus, like it or not, we have considerable scrutiny from and obligations to the government. In partial response to this reality, I have established the Executive Risk Management and Compliance Committee composed of senior university personnel and tasked them with establishing processes and procedures to ensure that we are in compliance with this complex labyrinth of laws and regulations.<br><br>The second--and far more important factor, in my judgment--is the clear intent of our board of trustees that none of us, individually or collectively, gets distracted from BYU's fundamental mission of undergraduate education excellence in an environment of sustaining and enriching faith. The pursuit of available and generous external funding for a wide variety of research projects is tempting to our accomplished faculty, but we consciously resist the quest for such resources until we can convince ourselves and others that these efforts will support and supplement our basic mission rather than compete with it. I am a witness of the soundness of this policy. Many excellent universities in this country have succumbed to the temptation to pursue support for peripheral projects and have found themselves deflected from their basic purposes--if they even remember what they really were.<br><br>Coupled with our philosophy concerning faculty compensation, we can see the wisdom that keeps all of us primarily loyal to BYU and its mission. It also protects us from the whims and vagaries of significant, but temporary extramural money that often has an eventually high price tag. When that external funding is no longer available--as is inevitably the case over time--the institution and faculty are left in a difficult position.<br><br>Having given this explanation, let me be clear that we value and favor research of high quality that supports our fundamental mission of superb undergraduate education. We know that often the best way to transmit current knowledge to our very able students is to involve them in the process of generating new knowledge by doing research and other creative work.<br><br>These considerations also apply to our graduate programs, which should not only be of the highest quality but contribute to rather than compete with our primary educational mission.<br><h2><b>Hiring and Recruitment Policies for Faculty</b></h2><br>I know of no other major university where the board of trustees reviews each prospective new faculty hire individually by name before a final offer of employment is made. I certainly know of no other place outside the Church Educational System where a prospective faculty member is interviewed by a General Authority as part of the process. These differences are unique and dramatic for important reasons. Our leaders want everyone to be crystal clear that The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is very concerned about education generally and also about what happens at BYU specifically. They also want full clarity on the tremendous support that BYU receives from the Church--not only financially but in every way.<br><br>The accountability inherent in our financial support and operating procedures is part of sending the clear message that what transpires at BYU is of great consequence. The support that we receive from the tithing funds of the Church is a very significant allocation of Church resources, and the membership and leaders deserve and require our assurance that their sacrifices in our behalf are completely consistent with the jointly agreed-upon mission and purposes of BYU.<br><br>While Church membership is not required for faculty members, staff, or students, absolutely consistent behavior in support of the university's Church-directed mission and our Honor Code is more than a suggestion. We expect it. Furthermore, it is a condition of employment for the faculty and staff and also for our students' continued enrollment.<br><h2><b>Student Admissions and Recruitment</b></h2><br>Fundamentally, the same standards mentioned for faculty and staff also apply to our students. Because there are so many more who would like to study at BYU than we can accommodate, we need to be as wise, thoughtful, fair, and appropriate as we can be. Ultimately, the selection and admission of students is a very human process that has significant subjective as well as objective components.<br><br>Paramount in our admissions process is the ecclesiastical endorsement. Only when we are fully satisfied about a candidate's standing and conduct within her or his own religious community, and when BYU has received proper recommendations and assurance about matters pertaining to living within the parameters of the BYU Honor Code, do we then look closely at a prospective student's previous academic record and test scores. We also look carefully at applicants' potential to contribute to BYU in special ways and to develop themselves to be of particular service to their communities and church when they leave BYU. Because each student is unique, this is a very labor-intensive process. We also work hard to be sure that we are fair and always in full compliance with both legal requirements and policy from the board of trustees.<br><br>Having said all of the above, we are absolutely committed to admitting no student to BYU--for whatever seemingly compelling reason--who does not have the strong potential to be successful here. To do otherwise would not only be unfair to the student but unfair to all who support and have an interest in this university.<br><br>Because we are privileged to have such outstanding students come to BYU, we must continually do better to see that what we offer to them matches their potential. Virtually all of our students have multiple choices as to where they might study. Many come out of loyalty to our sponsoring organization, and this is commendable, but they also deserve a secular education so fine in the eyes of the world that it approximates the incomparable spiritual experience available only at BYU.<br><h2><b>Honor Code Expectations</b></h2><br>I, like my predecessors, speak regularly about our Honor Code. It is now tightly and permanently woven into the fabric of Brigham Young University and is one of the ingredients that helps BYU be what it is. It will continue to guide BYU as it becomes what it needs to become.<br><br>As you know, we have some new coaches and administrators in our athletic programs. We also have some outstanding leaders in this area who have been with us for some time. I want to commend them. Both privately and publicly they have done a great job in explaining why the Honor Code and following its precepts and principles is an asset and an advantage to BYU and its students rather than an obstacle or a disadvantage. We are who we are, and we will do our best to continue to be so. We stand by our values and standards with humility and respect for those who choose to follow a different course, but we are clear that the Honor Code is integral to all that we do here. We are grateful for the very many who understand and live consistently with it.<br><br>All that I have said is a rather lengthy preamble to what I would now like to address as I conclude my message this morning. With my trusted colleagues on the President's Council, the deans, faculty, staff, BYUSA officers, the President's Leadership Council, and our board of trustees, I have attempted during the past two years to solidify and clarify my approach to the contributions that I hope to make to BYU during my "days" here. My approach, I believe, might be described in two notions that I consider to be basic.<br><br><b>First,</b> I believe that we can better fulfill our responsibilities and come closer to our potential when we choose carefully to do fewer things better. We cannot and should not try to do everything for everybody. When we work consistently and diligently on a small number of issues, it is more likely that we will be able to make progress of real consequence.<br><br><b>Second,</b> I have a strong bias that the quality of what we do improves best with improved focus and not just more resources. Remarkable things have occurred in years past at BYU with very meager resources beyond the consecrated efforts of a committed and talented faculty and staff. We now live in an era of more resources and greater financial support than at any other time in our history. While we are not at any great risk, in my judgment, of losing our great Church support, it is true that whenever we ask to do something new, we are also asked what we plan to stop doing. Thus we must sharpen our focus on the things that are most important and learn to prioritize more effectively how we will expend our energies and the treasured resources that come to us.<br><br>A hallmark of BYU has always been that we have attempted to do all that we do with absolute integrity. One of the issues that occasionally interrupts my sleep is the gap that occurs between expectations and reality--not only for our students, faculty, and staff but also with our broader communities, the Church membership generally, and especially with our board of trustees. You might think of several examples, but let me share some that I have observed since coming here. I do not mention them out of a sense of criticism but only because they seem to reflect variances in understanding or practice that are not reflective of what should be "the BYU way."<br><br>Student housing receives considerable attention. Few students, their parents, the broader Utah Valley community, Church members, and especially landlords lack strong opinions or perceptions. Julie Franklin and her staff do an excellent job in a nearly impossible situation. One of the issues we have faced is that there has been wide variation in what people have thought "BYU-approved housing" means. We are taking steps to improve not only general understanding but also our policies and procedures so that our standards and expectations are crystal clear to all. In addition, we are working very hard as a university to make sure that BYU housing in a changing and evolving world is optimally situated to meet the needs and wishes of our students and their families. You will hear and see more in the months and years ahead.<br><br>Athletics also receives broad and extensive attention, often associated with high levels of emotion. Sadly it is often the rare, negative occurrence that receives the most media consideration; meanwhile, the public fails to recognize that the vast majority of student athletes are not only fine students as well as athletes but also wonderful, exemplary representatives of BYU. I am very pleased to report the serious attention given and outstanding progress made by athletic director Tom Holmoe and his associates and coaches in making our realities in intercollegiate athletics congruent with our expectations.<br><br>You might easily join with me in identifying other examples, but our clear intent is to behave both publicly and privately in complete accord with our public statements about our standards of conduct.<br><br>As we complete this year's cycle of campus strategic resource planning, I want to thank again the deans and directors who shared thoughtful and well-prepared presentations with the President's Council, and I thank each of you who seek to use the sacred resources (importantly including your own time, talents, and other blessings) for the blessing of our students.<br><br>During resource planning this year, the story was told of a veteran faculty member orienting a new faculty member. Said the veteran faculty member, "Focus on FTE, space, and budget--nothing else matters." I'd like to agree with that statement--and to disagree! It is true that our trustees generously provision BYU and that they, therefore, ask that we do not add FTE, space, or budget without their approval. This is why I, as does the board, constantly ask, "When you propose to add something new, what is it you propose to drop?"<br><br>We understand that our board must measure new BYU proposals in terms of how many temples, meetinghouses, and missions that same money might provide somewhere around the world. This is why we must each continue to be careful and thoughtful whenever we propose new buildings, new programs, or new activities.<br><br>You have heard me say before that I have been more concerned about our "soft" infrastructure than about our "hard" infrastructure or physical plant. I initially made such comments for two reasons.<br><br><b>First,</b> I believed--and continue to believe--that BYU has one of the finest campuses at any university anywhere.<br><br><b>Second,</b> while some university presidents may want to be most remembered for the buildings that were built on their watch, I want to do what I can in my turn at the helm to help us become the best we can be in terms of our academic and spiritual standards and not just our buildings and monuments.<br><br>Having said this, we will continue to work very hard in upgrading this beautiful campus. Just two weeks ago we rededicated the George H. Brimhall Building after an extensive remodeling project. Next month we believe that President Gordon B. Hinckley will be on campus to dedicate the magnificent new Joseph F. Smith Building. Recently the board of trustees appropriated millions of dollars to do a complete remodeling and expansion of the Jesse Knight Building. Other projects are in various states of planning and dreaming and will continue. But it is not in the buildings that we find a great university. It is what is in the hearts and minds and efforts of a superb student body, a wonderfully talented faculty, and a most able and dedicated staff that ultimately determines what we will really become.<br><br>That is precisely why in leadership meetings over the last year or more we have asked these questions:<br><br>· Who are and who should be the future students who will come to BYU? What will and should happen to them while they are here? How do we best optimize their experience in the context of what BYU is and should become?<br><br>· Who are the new faculty that need to come to BYU if we are to reach the higher ground to which we aspire? How do we identify them, recruit them, train them, support them, and empower them when they come? How do we help the current faculty, as good as they are, reach even higher to become their best selves? How does each one of us better fulfill our individual responsibilities to further the mission of BYU and assist our students in reaching their potential?<br><br>· What physical resources do we really need to accomplish our special mission? How do we clearly differentiate these needs from our wants and wishes? How do we prioritize among the many good things we might or even should do? How do we place our requests for support in the proper context of the Church's resources and worldwide ecclesiastical responsibilities?<br><br>· By what standards should BYU be measured? I have mentioned accreditation, and I hope you believe the case we have made as to its importance to us. Other standards or measures, of equal or even greater importance, are those that I think of as internal--meaning that we impose them ourselves because it is the right thing to do even if not recognized or appreciated by others. Which of these standards and measures are really the most important? How do we deal with those that are intangible as well as tangible?<br><br>In addition to these questions of a general nature are corollaries or subset issues that are best wrestled within small groups, departments, and committees. I will focus on a few. This list is not inclusive, and all of these matters cannot receive the same level of attention--nor probably should they. As I give a few examples, I hope you will think of others and find a way to share them with us and with each other across the campus.<br><br>1. What do we need to do with respect to simplification in courses, curriculum, and requirements?<br><br>2. How can we achieve necessary improvements in student advisement?<br><br>3. Can we appropriately do more to shorten the time to graduation?<br><br>4. What should be our next steps in distance learning?<br><br>5. How can we best integrate new technologies into our teaching and learning?<br><br>6. What will be the emerging and future relationships between BYU and the Church? Examples might include: BYU and the BYU Salt Lake Center in downtown Salt Lake City, BYU Broadcasting, the joint Church–BYU Data Center on our campus, and future synergies with various Church departments.<br><br>7. What will be the future BYU housing?<br><br>8. What will be the new or replacement buildings built on campus in the years ahead?<br><br>As is obvious, we cannot do it all--or at least all at once. Therefore an honorable question is "How do we choose?" We will need to continue to refine our priorities and also understand our possibilities better. Some matters that will need to receive proximate, intense attention will be those that affect the rest of what we must do. Others will be things that might not rise to an urgency on their own merits entirely but, because of unique opportunities that occur, might be pursued since they are not competitive with higher priorities and involve resources that are not transferable to other areas or initiatives.<br><br>Let me conclude with some advice having a scriptural basis that I believe applies to all of us.<br><br><b>First,</b> we need to know what is urgent and must be pursued now and be able to contrast these things with those that are best left to wait. The Lord said, "I will hasten my work in its time" (D&amp;amp;C 88:73). But He also said, "All things must come to pass in their time" (D&amp;amp;C 64:32). Through the principles and processes of study, prayer, and obtaining necessary counsel, we need to determine which is which.<br><br><b>Second,</b> we need to deal with what we do in terms of our real capacities. King Benjamin advised, "And see that all these things are done in wisdom and order; for it is not requisite that a man should run faster than he has strength" (Mosiah 4:27). Likewise, Joseph Smith was told in the very pressing days of trying to complete the translation of the Book of Mormon, "Do not run faster or labor more than you have strength and means" (D&amp;amp;C 10:4). The "wisdom-and-order" and "strength-and-means" tests need to be applied to all of our undertakings.<br><br><b>Third,</b> we need to have the faith and capacity to move forward with the knowledge that when we are doing the right things in the right way, even when we face difficulties and challenges, we can expect and rely on blessings from heaven. The instruction given during the dark days in Missouri still applies in the relative light and ease of our days in Provo:<br><br><i>Ye cannot behold with your natural eyes, for the present time, the design of your God concerning those things which shall come hereafter, and the glory which shall follow after much tribulation.</i><br><br><i>For after much tribulation come the blessings.</i> [D&amp;amp;C 58:3–4]<br><br>What a great place to be, and what a wonderful time to be here! Thanks go to each of you for your significant contributions and efforts that make this so. May heaven help us understand our rightful places in this tremendous work, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Cecil O. Samuelson was president of BYU when this address was given at the BYU Annual University Conference on 23 August 2005.</i><br><br><i>© 2004 Intellectual Reserve, Inc. All rights reserved.</i>

<h1>the Great Lights of the World”: Seeking Learning by Study and Faith at BYU - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
As I prepared for this talk, wondering what I might say or do that would make any lasting difference, I recalled the example of another Miltonist turned administrator. When the Renaissance scholar Bart Giamatti became president of Yale, he wondered:<br><br><i>What was it that Yale needed most, wanted most, and would most contribute to solving our deficit, enhancing our quality, and making me a Manager?</i><br><br><i>One night . . . , crouched in my garage, as I was trying to memorize the Trustees' names . . . , it came to me, and I wrote, right there, between the lawnmower and the snow tires, a memo. On July 1, 1978, my first day in office, I issued this memo to an absent and indifferent University. It read,</i><br><br><i>To the members of the University Community:</i><br><br><i>In order to repair what Milton called the ruin of our grand parents, I wish to announce that henceforth, as a matter of University policy, evil is abolished and paradise is restored.</i><br><br><i>I trust all of us will do whatever possible to achieve this policy objective.</i><sup>1</sup><br><br>I considered issuing such a policy today. Then I remembered that it would be redundant at BYU, where, as a matter of university policy, evil is already abolished and, to a degree perhaps, paradise is restored in this little green world of ours, ringed by mountains, that we call campus.<br><br>So I have sought for some other principled way to address the challenges we face in our quest to become "the very best that we can be"<sup>2</sup>--as President Hinckley has charged--and to become better without necessarily becoming bigger--as President Samuelson has reminded us--in this season when in order to grow we need to prune. Pruning is not easy. It is wrenching for me even to prune my poor overgrown fruit trees. How much harder to prune the BYU vineyard--to reallocate, repurpose, refocus, live within limits. (Notice how rapidly I am picking up manager-speak.)<br><br>Limits, however, need not be seen merely as impediments to growth, as the pruning metaphor reminds us. Wise limits can help us focus on qualitative rather than quantitative growth. And this can be salutary. In fact, I believe that qualitative improvement is precisely what is most needed at this juncture in our history. For in the main, we enjoy adequate tangible resources at BYU. To shine, we need to burnish our intangible resources of mind and will and purpose. And shine we must if we are to the fulfill prophetic expectations not only of President Hinckley but also of modern prophets back to the days of Joseph Smith, who hoped to establish a university that would become "one of the great lights of the world."<sup>3</sup><br><br>So I hereby issue the following memo to the faculty:<br><br><i>In order to realize the visions and expectations of this institution's inspired leaders, henceforth, as a matter of university policy, BYU shall be "one of the great lights of the world," where learning is diligently sought by rigorous study and also by profound faith. I trust all of us will do whatever possible to achieve this policy objective.</i><br><br>I offer this memo only partly in jest. For, in fact, in our quest for quality, I can think of nothing more needful than a renewed commitment at every level to become a learning community that could aptly be described as "one of the great lights of the world." BYU has ever been built of dreams and ideals as much or more than of brick and mortar. It has been built on sacrifice--as President Samuelson has reminded us--and on vision. I know of no vision more core to our mission than the revelation that we are to diligently "seek learning, even by study and also by faith."<sup>4</sup><br><br>Today I want to encourage us to reflect on and embrace this familiar divine injunction even more fully than we heretofore have--not as an occasion for self-congratulation but as an ongoing challenge to raise our level of performance. I like what John Churchill wrote: "Institutions and individuals [are] better off when they are animated by a vision of the good rather than by a belief that they possess it."<sup>5</sup><br><br>The gospel imperative to "seek learning, even by study and also by faith" constitutes the single-most important revealed statement of the common good at BYU. It applies to both student and faculty alike. It was first revealed in a profound revelation to the Prophet Joseph called the Olive Leaf. Over the years the Olive Leaf, which guided the School of the Prophets, has become, as then President Dallin H. Oaks observed, "the basic constitution of Church education. It defines Brigham Young University's role in the kingdom."<sup>6</sup> The injunction to "seek learning, even by study and also by faith" articulates a core concept in this core LDS vision on education.<sup>7</sup> This phrase is repeated twice elsewhere in scripture.<sup>8</sup> It likewise has been invoked repeatedly by prophets and by BYU presidents. It summarizes our distinctive LDS educational philosophy as well as BYU's special educational mission. Yet for some reason it has not been used as a university preschool theme--at least not since the 1980s, which is as far back as the records went that I was given when asked to recommend a theme.<br><br>I recommended that this be our theme in 2005 for two main reasons: accreditation and the bicentennial of the Prophet's birth. University accreditation is a time for serious and sustained institutional reflection about how we are doing against our core values. I could think of no scripture that stated our core educational objective more clearly and succinctly than the injunction to "seek learning, even by study and also by faith." It also seemed an appropriate scripture for a year in which we commemorate the bicentennial of the Prophet Joseph Smith's birth. This gospel mandate not only was revealed to Joseph but embodies his personal approach to learning. His example bids us to become a university where learning is more diligently sought by even more rigorous study and by more profound faith. In this year of the bicentennial I want to honor the Prophet as the spiritual architect of BYU. His precepts and practice challenge us to become an even better learning community--one worthy of Joseph's dream to found a Church university that would be "one of the great lights of the world."<br><br>In a very real sense BYU extends the long shadow of the Prophet's personal and prophetic commitment to seek learning by study and by faith. Joseph loved to learn. "No man of his time loved knowledge more than he," wrote George Q. Cannon.<sup>9</sup> He sought education for himself, his children, and his people. Through him the Lord established schools everywhere that the early Saints congregated, including the School of the Prophets, the School for the Elders, the Kirtland High School, the Hebrew School, and the University of the City of Nauvoo--not to mention a host of small primary schools.<sup>10</sup> In fact, the early Saints regarded school building as "one of the principal objects" to gather in compact communities: "Intelligence is the great object of our holy religion," Joseph told them. "Intelligence is the result of education, and education can only be obtained by living in compact society; so compact, that schools of all kinds can be supported."<sup>11</sup><br><br>Joseph was not only a temple builder but a school builder. Indeed, these two enterprises were regularly conflated by the early Saints. Schools operated in temples. Temples functioned as schools. The "house of faith" was to be "a house of learning" and vice versa.<sup>12</sup> Church school buildings for the early Saints were to have a "double purpose, of a house of worship and an institution of learning."<sup>13</sup> I often think about this on Sundays at BYU as sacrament trays are laid out on lab tables, lecterns turn into pulpits, and classrooms become chapels. I also am struck by the fact that the Church has chosen to locate Church schools and temples in close proximity. The new temple in Rexburg continues this pattern.<br><br>In June of 1831, barely a year after the Church was organized, Joseph received a revelation commissioning W. W. Phelps, who had not yet even joined the Church, to collaborate with Oliver Cowdery in selecting and writing books for Church schools:<br><br><i>You</i> [W. W. Phelps] <i>shall be ordained to assist my servant Oliver Cowdery to do the work of printing, and of selecting and writing books for schools in this church, that little children also may receive instruction before me as is pleasing unto me.</i><sup>14</sup><br><br>This is the first mention in modern revelation that there were to be schools in the Church. BYU's beginnings may be traced back to this revelation. Note that from the beginning it was revealed to Joseph that the Lord takes pleasure in education, books, and schools.<br><br>So did his Prophet. Joseph sought out teachers for his own children. My great-grandmother, a graduate of Amherst, served as such a teacher. I love Joseph's sentiments in a tender letter from Liberty Jail to Emma encouraging her to educate their children: "Tell them Father loves them with a perfect love, and he is doing all he can to get away from the mob to come to them. Do teach them all you can, that they may have good minds."<sup>15</sup> Like many a parent who lacked formal education, Joseph had fond hopes that his children would receive the blessings of education of which he had been deprived.<br><br>He wanted the same for his people. Under Joseph's inspired direction the Saints established schools in Ohio, Missouri, and Illinois--wherever they gathered. And these schools were not just for children but for adults. The early Saints were pioneers in adult education, for they understood lifelong learning by both study and faith to be a doctrine of the restored gospel.<sup>16</sup> Joseph inspired the Saints "with an extravagant thirst after knowledge," according to John Corrill, an elder from Missouri visiting Kirtland.<sup>17</sup> Well over a hundred early Saints attended Hebrew School in Kirtland.<sup>18</sup> The scene was so impressive that even an anti-Mormon acknowledged that<br><br><i>the Mormons appear to be very eager to acquire education. Men, women and children lately attended school, and they are now employing</i> [a] <i>Hebrew teacher, to instruct them in Hebrew; and about seventy men in middle life, from twenty to forty years of age, are most eagerly engaged in the study. They pursue their studies alone until twelve o'clock at night, and attend to nothing else. . . . They are by no means, as a class, men of weak minds.</i><sup>19</sup><br><br>In this effort to seek learning by study, Joseph himself led the way. I am frankly in awe of the Prophet's assiduous efforts to pursue learning by study amidst all the persecutions and other demands on his time and energy. He studied many subjects but had a particular passion for languages. Entry after entry in his journal finds him studying Latin, Greek, German, and especially Hebrew. He was an avid participant in the Kirtland Hebrew School, which met in the west room of the third floor of the temple.<sup>20</sup> On 17 February 1836, Joseph exclaimed in his journal:<br><br><i>My soul delights in reading the word of the Lord in the original, and I am determined to pursue the study of the languages, until I shall become master of them, if I am permitted to live long enough.</i><sup>21</sup><br><br>What remarkable determination to learn language "by study"--and this from a translator and seer! As Terryl Givens recently observed, Joseph "consistently merged the gift of prophecy with the gritty work of language study."<sup>22</sup> To become "one of the great lights of the world," we cannot afford to be less committed to learning by study than was the Prophet.<br><br>He also set the example of diligently learning by faith. Joseph knew, as President Harold B. Lee taught, that "learning by faith is no task for a lazy man. . . . Such a process requires the bending of the whole soul, the calling up of the depths of the human mind and linking them with God."<sup>23</sup> The Prophet also knew that learning by faith requires personal worthiness. Those privileged to learn and teach in the School of the Prophets were required to be essentially temple worthy, setting a pattern that continues today in the Church Educational System:<br><br><i>And ye shall not receive any among you into this school save he is clean.</i><sup>24</sup><br><br><i>Therefore, cease from all your light speeches . . . , from all your lustful desires, from all your pride and light-mindedness, and from all your wicked doings.</i><sup>25</sup><br><br>The Lord instructed those who would learn by faith to "draw near unto me and I will draw near unto you; seek me diligently. . . . And if your eye be single to my glory, your whole bodies shall be filled with light."<sup>26</sup> Similarly, if BYU is to become "one of the great lights of the world," we must be worthy and do our work with our eyes single to God so He can "unveil" His will to us "in his own time, and in his own way."<sup>27</sup><br><br>The Prophet taught that learning by study and faith applies to all realms of knowledge--sacred and secular. He learned early on that revelation requires the recipient to "study it out in your mind," just as learning wisdom from the "best books" required the exercise of faith.<sup>28</sup> We, by contrast, sometimes assume that secular subjects are to be learned exclusively by study while religious subjects are to be apprehended solely by revelation. The Prophet did not draw sharp distinctions between how we are to learn sacred and secular truth.<br><br>Further, the early elders were taught that the gospel embraced all truth. Brigham Young remarked:<br><br><i>Were you to ask me how it was that I embraced "Mormonism," I should answer, for the simple reason that it embraces all truth in heaven and on earth, in the earth, </i>[and]<i> under the earth. . . . There is no truth outside of it.</i><sup>29</sup><br><br>Likewise, the Lord revealed in the Olive Leaf that the Saints were to learn "of things both in heaven and in the earth, and under the earth; things which have been, things which are, things which must shortly come to pass" and so forth. Why? To "be prepared in all things" to go forth into the world.<sup>30</sup> I never cease to be inspired by the breadth of the curriculum endorsed by the Lord. This has profoundly influenced my passionate individual commitment to general education. It has shaped our institutional commitment to general education at BYU as well.<br><br>The Prophet taught the early Saints to gather up knowledge and books and bring them to Zion. I am moved every time I visit the Seventies Hall in Nauvoo, which houses a library containing copies of some of the books collected and studied by early LDS missionaries so that they might "be prepared in all things when I shall send you again"<sup>31</sup> as missionaries. The Prophet himself contributed 50 books to establish an early lending library. "In view of the losses the Prophet suffered during the Missouri persecutions," wrote one historian, "one cannot help but marvel at the library he had gathered since then."<sup>32</sup> By the time of the exodus, the Seventies Library contained 675 volumes. This was "taken west to become the nucleus of the first library in Utah and reportedly the first one west of the Missouri River."<sup>33</sup><br><br>Having hauled heavy books from place to place during my days as a poor graduate student, I am moved by the thought that the pioneers lugged books across the plains along with plows and bedding. In the words of one writer:<br><br><i>Behind them they would leave the beautiful city. . . . But in their wagons, packed away with their essential tools and seed grain, were their beloved books, the tools and seed grain for the future schools and libraries of Utah.</i><sup>34</sup><br><br>Also packed away deep in their hearts was the Prophet's vision of building a university that would become "one of the great lights of the world." The Prophet had hoped that the University of the City of Nauvoo would<br><br><i>enable us to teach our children wisdom, to instruct them in all the knowledge and learning, in the arts, sciences, and learned professions. We hope to make this institution one of the great lights of the world, and by and through it to diffuse that kind of knowledge which will be of practicable utility, and for the public good, and also for private and individual happiness.</i><sup>35</sup><br><br>BYU's institutional genealogy harks directly back to the University of the City of Nauvoo. We are the inheritors of the Prophet's dream to build a university that would become "one of the great lights of the world," where knowledge is diligently pursued by rigorous study and profound faith. Let us resolve to honor our founding Prophet of the Restoration by striving to fulfill this dream here at BYU.<br><br>Now let me spell out a few specific implications for BYU inherent in the Prophet's precept and practice of seeking learning by study and by faith. I could mention many more, such as the implications for hiring, tenuring, and faculty development that flow from the imperative to engage in lifelong learning.<br><br>First, lifelong learning must be a fundamental institutional goal at BYU. Many universities embrace lifelong learning as an institutional objective because it is a practical necessity whose importance is becoming ever more apparent in a world witnessing a rapid knowledge explosion. For us at BYU, lifelong learning is more than a practical necessity: It is a gospel imperative. We understand that we are on earth to learn; that "the glory of God is intelligence";<sup>36</sup> that "intelligence is the great object of our holy religion,"<sup>37</sup> as Joseph put it; and that a "man is saved no faster than he gains knowledge."<sup>38</sup> Of all universities, BYU ought to be committed to lifelong learning as a matter of principle. It is deeply rooted in our doctrine and in our history.<br><br>It follows that faculty as well as students must be lifelong learners. All Latter-day Saints are under the same gospel imperative to be energetically and passionately committed to learning. But as faculty we have a special obligation to become lifelong learners, for learning enlivens teaching. This is why research is so crucial at a fine "teaching university" like BYU. And research is not valuable only because it gives us more--and more current--things to teach. Our students also benefit from seeing us as learners rather than as know-it-all authorities. This is one of the best features of mentored-student research at BYU. But it can occur in more pedestrian ways as well. For example, when I teach writing, I generally try to do one or two assignments myself, then bring my draft to class and open my work up to critique. I discuss the problems I faced as a writer and the strengths and weaknesses of my draft. It makes me feel vulnerable, but I think that my students learn more when they see me as a learner. Similarly, I recently audited a Spanish class. It was humbling to be an adult learner--not to be the authority, not even always to be the sharpest tack in the class. It made me admire Joseph even more--a translator, seer, and revelator willing to study Hebrew grammar alongside his brethren.<br><br>A serious institutional commitment to lifelong learning also, of course, has profound implications for how we teach our students. It forces us to focus less on what <i>we</i> teach and more on what <i>they</i> learn. This can be a difficult paradigm shift for those of us who sometimes indulge exclusively in the "sage-on-the-stage" model of teaching. It is, however, a paradigm shift that for more than a decade has radically altered the landscape of higher education.<br><br>Further, a commitment to our students' lifelong learning forces us to extend our horizon of concern. In the past we may have been satisfied if the student knew enough to pass the final exam. If we truly care about lifelong learning, we must think more seriously about the half-life of our courses in the lives of our students. I am often sobered and surprised to talk with students years after they have been in my classes and find what they remember. Often it is coming to my home or performing scenes from a play or doing a major research paper or project: that is, it is something they <i>did,</i> not something I <i>said.</i> Or, if it is something I said, it may have been a sidebar comment I made about the gospel that made a difference in a later major life decision. Or it may simply be my passion and enthusiasm for my subject they remember most. I encourage you to seek out feedback from your students well after they have studied with you and ask what was most important to them.<br><br>I predict that you will often find that, along with personal interactions with you, it will be the general skills and knowledge your students learned that have benefited them most. A serious commitment to lifelong learning turns traditional educational hierarchies on their heads. Let me explain. I routinely told every new faculty I hired in English that I expected every class to be a course in writing and thinking, no matter what the subject matter. These skills, however, come at the bottom of the hierarchy among the intellectual goals set forth in the Aims of a BYU Education. But this is not because they are unimportant. Rather, it is because they are foundational. In my current assignment as academic vice president, I rely much more heavily on my general skills in writing, thinking, evaluating evidence, etc., than on my technical knowledge as a Miltonist. And I suspect that the same holds true for the doctor, nurse, computer scientist, botanist, psychologist, musician, and engineer with whom I work. Now, to be sure, higher-order thinking skills are often best developed in advanced courses. Still, we need to remember that the most enduring and valuable learning produced in even advanced classes will be the general--and thus transferable--learning skills developed.<br><br>A serious commitment to lifelong learning also requires us to concern ourselves with student motivation. As the Aims of a BYU Education explains, students who pursue lifelong learning need both the ability and the desire or motivation to continue to learn. It follows that we should worry if our students leave our classes burned out rather than burning with passion and enthusiasm to continue to explore the realms of knowledge we have introduced them to.<br><br>A community with a serious commitment to lifelong learning invites us to consider the pedagogical power of requiring learners to teach. The early Saints were told that they were to "teach one another."<sup>39</sup> This principle was practiced in the School of the Prophets, where student became teacher and teacher student. In my own experience I've seen this particular strategy fall on its face when teachers are inept in how they invite students to take a role in teaching. I've also seen it become a powerful way to bring about deep learning.<br><br>Finally, of course, a serious commitment to lifelong learning at BYU also requires attention to helping students learn both by study and also by faith. It requires us to take both elements seriously, as did the Prophet Joseph.<br><br>These are but a few of the implications to consider as we determine to embrace more fully the gospel imperative to "seek learning, even by study and also by faith"<sup>40</sup> at BYU. As we do so, we shall prove ourselves faithful to the legacy left us by our beloved Prophet Joseph, who yearned to build a university that would become "one of the great lights of the world." May we resolve to honor the Prophet and his living successor by striving to become such a learning community.<br><br><i>John S.

<h1>mith: A Legacy of Learning - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Once again it is an exciting and anticipatory pleasure for Sister Samuelson and me to welcome each of you to a new school year. I am confident we will have a special and enlightening series of devotional and forum assemblies this semester that will complement, supplement, and, we hope, enrich what will also be a very productive period in your classrooms, laboratories, and libraries. We look forward to being with you each Tuesday at this same time and hope that you will regularly attend and bring your friends and associates with you. As I have said before, a large part of what constitutes the unique "BYU experience" is found in these gatherings where the Spirit has been invited and where we have the opportunity to discuss and consider things of ultimate worth and importance that are not afforded to the academic community on almost any other campus.<br><br>In this wonderful year of anniversaries and celebration concerning the events of the birth of the Prophet Joseph, the organization of the Church, and other milestones special to us, I would like to spend our precious moments this morning in continuing to reflect on the legacy of learning that we enjoy, largely influenced by the example and efforts of living prophets from Joseph Smith to Gordon B. Hinckley.<br><br>It is both comforting and encouraging to note that even the Lord, Jesus Christ, and prophets of every age, including our own, have over the course of their lives "increased in wisdom and stature, and in favour with God and man" (Luke 2:52). They have provided for us not only the philosophical and doctrinal basis but also the personal examples of the principles of eternal progression that occur in our lives "line upon line, precept upon precept" (D&amp;amp;C 98:12, 128:21). I firmly believe that each of us also enjoys the privilege and has the responsibility of similarly growing, developing, learning, and contributing in our own spheres and within the unique opportunities and circumstances that are afforded us.<br><br>Although it is unlikely that I need to remind this group that learning is both exhilarating and plain hard work, I will do so because this combination is often overlooked by those who would emphasize one dimension or the other. Particularly at the Testing Center, for example, it is tempting to think of the drudgery and demands of preparing to succeed in course work and to diminish the wonderful excitement that should result from the new insights, facts, and understanding that have occurred during a semester's activities.<br><br>Likewise, when we reflect on the magnitude and splendor of the Prophet Joseph's theophany in the Sacred Grove, we may not remember or fully understand that even that most remarkable tutorial was given in the context of considerable effort and contemplation as well as by study and faith. Thus the constant and continuing counsel from the early days of the Restoration that we must "seek learning, even by study and also by faith" (D&amp;amp;C 88:118, 109:7, 14) should not surprise us and, in fact, should lead us in every field of inquiry, both temporal and spiritual.<br><br>Given the fact that Joseph Smith, especially by today's standards but also by his own admission, was not well educated in a formal sense, it is truly remarkable how he became such an example of lifelong learning "by study and also by faith." In addition to his almost incredible ability to master complicated specific concepts and ideas--such as languages, politics, military strategy, and architecture--he was also a tremendous generalist who in his short 38-year life became a great student of men and things.<br><br>Clearly his many revelations came at a time vital to the emerging Church, but also almost always in consequence of a substantial problem or significant question. Some of these questions or problems occurred as the result of external causes or events, but many, particularly spectacular doctrinal insights, were the result of his consistent study, prayer, pondering, and questioning. He considered, as should we, that his revelations were great learning experiences.<br><br>He also was regularly questioned, not only by the Latter-day Saints but by many others as well. He felt obliged to help people learn, and he was obviously a very compelling teacher. He was not afraid of questions--nor should we be. In fact, to my knowledge he was one of the first to use the 20-questions format to teach important principles. In 1838 Joseph published 20 questions with his answers to them. He did this, as he reported, "to save [him]self the trouble of repeating the same a thousand times over and over again" (<i>HC</i> 3:30; <i>Teachings,</i> 121).<br><br>We don't have time to consider all 20 questions and his answers, but I will mention a few because I believe they tell us so much about him and his thought, his humor, his forthrightness, his love of learning, his confidence in his mission, and his desire to share the truths of the Restoration.<br><br><i>First--"Do you believe the Bible?"</i><br><br>[Answer] <i>If we do, we are the only people under heaven that does, for there are none of the religious sects of the day that do. . . .</i><br><br><i>Fifth--"Do you believe Joseph Smith, Jun., to be a Prophet?"</i><br><br>[Answer] <i>Yes, and every other man who has the testimony of Jesus. For the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy.</i> [Revelation 19:10]. . . .<br><br><i>Eighth--"Can they [the Mormons] raise the dead?"</i><br><br>[Answer] <i>No, nor can any other people that now lives, or ever did live. But God can raise the dead, through man as an instrument. . . .</i><br><br><i>Tenth--"Was not Joseph Smith a money digger?"</i><br><br>[Answer] <i>Yes, but it was never a very profitable job for him, as he only got fourteen dollars a month for it.</i><br><br><i>Eleventh--"Did not Joseph Smith steal his wife?"</i><br><br>[Answer] <i>Ask her, she was of age, she can answer for herself. . . .</i><br><br><i>Sixteenth--"If the Mormon doctrine is true, what has become of all those who died since the days of the Apostles?"</i><br><br>[Answer] <i>All those who have not had an opportunity of hearing the Gospel, and being administered unto by an inspired man in the flesh, must have it hereafter, before they can be finally judged. . . .</i><br><br><i>Eighteenth--"Is there anything in the Bible which licenses you to believe in revelation now-a-days?"</i><br><br>[Answer] <i>Is there anything that does not authorize us to believe so? If there is, we have, as yet, not been able to find it.</i><br><br><i>Nineteenth--"Is not the canon of the Scriptures full?"</i><br><br>[Answer] <i>If it is, there is a great defect in the book, or else it would have said so.</i><br><br>And now, for the last question in the series. This is among the most oft quoted of any of Joseph's statements because it is so fundamental to our beliefs and the understanding of them:<br><br><i>Twentieth--"What are the fundamental principles of your religion?"</i><br><br>[Answer] <i>The fundamental principles of our religion are the testimony of the Apostles and Prophets, concerning Jesus Christ, that He died, was buried, and rose again the third day, and ascended into heaven; and all other things which pertain to our religion are only appendages to it. But in connection with these, we believe in the gift of the Holy Ghost, the power of faith, the enjoyment of the spiritual gifts according to the will of God, the restoration of the house of Israel, and the final triumph of truth.</i> [<i>HC</i> 3:28–30; <i>Teachings,</i> 119–21]<br><br>As you see, Joseph was not put off by questions. He was also very clear about what things are basic and fundamental. He understood the difference between what he really knew and those things he did not know. He also never considered himself nor anyone else, except the Savior, to be a finished product. He once said the following in describing himself, but I am sure he would not be offended if fellow disciples were also to apply this analogy to themselves:<br><br><i>I am like a huge, rough stone rolling down from a high mountain; and the only polishing I get is when some corner gets rubbed off by coming in contact with something else, striking with accelerated force against religious bigotry, priestcraft, lawyer-craft, doctor-craft, lying editors, suborned judges and jurors, and the authority of perjured executives, backed by mobs, blasphemers, licentious and corrupt men and women--all hell knocking off a corner here and a corner there. Thus I will become a smooth and polished shaft in the quiver of the Almighty.</i> [<i>HC</i> 5:401; <i>Teachings,</i> 304]<br><br>Likewise, while he was most often modest and careful, he was willing to be absolutely clear on the things of most importance that he learned and that he taught. He said, "I never told you I was perfect; but there is no error in the revelations which I have taught" (<i>HC</i> 6:366; <i>Teachings,</i> 368).<br><br>Joseph Smith was most impressive to some of the men hardest to impress. Elder B. H. Roberts was one such man. Listen to these editorial comments by Elder Roberts in the introduction of volume 2 of the <i>History of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints:</i><br><br><i>The value of the educational movement in the Church by the establishment of a school for the Elders in Kirtland, cannot be fully appreciated even yet. It stands as a direct contradiction to the oft-repeated charges that Mormonism seeks to thrive through the ignorance of its devotees.</i><br><br>B. H. Roberts supported this assertion by referencing some Restoration scriptures that I will share in a moment. He then continued:<br><br><i>I know of nothing that lies outside this boundless field of research into which the Elders of the Church especially were invited--nay, commanded, to enter. It comprehends the whole possible sphere of human investigation; and furnishes all necessary contradiction to the theory that the Church at any time contemplated an ignorant ministry. By intelligence, not stupidity; by knowledge, not ignorance, has the Church from the very beginning hoped to succeed in her mission.</i> [<i>HC</i> 2:xxiv]<br><br>Elder Roberts held that the Prophet Joseph, under the direction of the Lord, was primarily responsible for the beginning of the educational emphasis and movement within the newly restored Church.<br><br>Joseph encouraged continual learning and the acquisition not only of knowledge but also of wisdom. His doctrine was expansive rather than restrictive. These revelatory words, referred to by Elder Roberts, are now well known to us and repeated often, especially at BYU: "Seek ye diligently and teach one another words of wisdom; yea, seek ye out of the best books words of wisdom; seek learning, even by study and also by faith" (D&amp;amp;C 88:118). Likewise, from the same section, consider this counsel to students, faculty, and all of us:<br><br><i>Teach ye diligently and my grace shall attend you, that you may be instructed more perfectly in theory, in principle, in doctrine, in the law of the gospel, in all things that pertain unto the kingdom of God, that are expedient for you to understand;</i><br><br><i>Of things both in heaven and in the earth, and under the earth; things which have been, things which are, things which must shortly come to pass; things which are at home, things which are abroad; the wars and the perplexities of the nations, and the judgments which are on the land; and a knowledge also of countries and of kingdoms.</i> [D&amp;amp;C 88:78–79]<br><br>In these brief verses are encompassed not only our complete BYU curriculum but also all that we are likely to encounter during our entire mortal lives. In my judgment Joseph Smith was not concerned with parsing too finely those things that we should study as long as they are "anything virtuous, lovely, or of good report or praiseworthy" because he affirmed that "we seek after these things" (Articles of Faith 1:13).<br><br>As we all know, Joseph did not live personally to see the Rocky Mountains in mortality; thus BYU came after his time. As grateful as we are and must be to Brigham Young and our other early and current leaders for the establishment and continued support of this great university, we must never forget that it was Joseph Smith who prophesied that the Latter-day Saints would come to these valleys and "become a mighty people" (<i>HC</i> 5:85). In my judgment, our progress as both individuals and as an institution in educational achievement is an important criterion in the fulfillment of that prophecy. While we have made some impressive progress, I am convinced that our best is ahead of us and yet to come.<br><br>I would not be surprised to learn in some future time that Joseph not only saw our day but also what we at BYU will and must yet become as we progress along the eternal continuum of the legacy of learning. "Praise to the man who communed with Jehovah!" and who, under the direction of the Father and the Son, established the foundation for all that we consider basic in our individual and collective efforts to be ever learning and, more important, ever more wise and more faithful ("Praise to the Man," <i>Hymns,</i> 1985, no. 27).<br><br>What a wonderful bequest! And what a remarkable blessing to live at this time with our most fortunate circumstances that bring us the privilege of being at BYU. We have the opportunity to continue the vital process of expanding our understanding and acquiring knowledge and wisdom. Through Joseph we better understand that<br><br><i>whatever principle of intelligence we attain unto in this life, it will rise with us in the resurrection.</i><br><br><i>And if a person gains more knowledge and intelligence in this life through his diligence and obedience than another, he will have so much the advantage in the world to come.</i> [D&amp;amp;C 130:18–19]<br><br>I am grateful to verbalize with gratitude and certitude my convictions concerning the mission of the Prophet Joseph Smith, which includes our legacy of learning. I also bear witness of our current prophet-leader, Gordon B. Hinckley, who is an outspoken advocate for learning and also for Brigham Young University. Our Father in Heaven and the Savior Jesus Christ do live and direct Their servants in this work, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Cecil O.

<h1>. Hinckley: The Voice of a Prophet - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
My dear brothers and sisters, it is a great honor for me to welcome you to a new semester at Brigham Young University. My husband and I want you to know that we love and admire you. Your success and growth spiritually, academically, intellectually, and socially are of great importance to us as well as to others associated with the university. In every area of interest to you we encourage you to strive for integrity and excellence. The experiences and knowledge gained during your time here will influence the rest of your lives.<br><br>A few years ago my husband and I were enjoying visiting Australia. It was promising to be another beautiful spring day in the outskirts of Sydney. We were to be involved in a mission presidents' seminar for presidents and their wives in that area of the world. However, at approximately 5:00 a.m. on a Wednesday morning, the telephone rang and woke us from our sleep. My experience with middle-of-the-night telephone calls has been that they usually portend bad news. Thus, as my husband got out of bed to answer the phone, I was quite nervous and concerned. As he answered the phone, I heard him say, "Hello, Emma."<br><br>I relaxed somewhat, knowing that Emma was his secretary in the Office of the Seventy. I knew that we were 16 hours ahead of Salt Lake City time and it was Tuesday during working hours there. My thought was that she just wanted to talk to him before he became involved in the meetings of the day. However, his response to whatever she was saying to him was a very shocked "Oh, no!"<br><br>Again I became very concerned and surmised that it was not good news but involved something or someone from the Church family and not our own immediate one. I recall that he hung up the telephone and came and said to me that Emma had just reported to him that two planes had hit the World Trade Center buildings in New York City. We were instructed to remain in Australia until further notice.<br><br>We, of course, got up and turned on the television and were filled with shock, horror, and great sadness as we saw and heard of the devastating attacks in our homeland. The seminar began that day, but, as you can imagine, it wasn't quite business as usual. A great somberness filled all our hearts. I felt such a heaviness of spirit.<br><br>The day proceeded with an abbreviated schedule as well as phone calls by the participants in the seminar to their homes and families. We were also informed that we would be able to receive the audio portion of a program to be held that evening originating from the Tabernacle on Temple Square.<br><br>The time came to hear the broadcast from Salt Lake City. I cannot recall exactly what was said or sung that night; however, I can vividly recall how I was affected when I heard the voice of our beloved prophet, Gordon B. Hinckley, as he spoke from thousands of miles away. Just to hear his voice seemed to lift much of the sadness and gloom I was feeling. I will always remember and treasure the comfort and peace I felt from hearing the love and tenderness in his voice that day. Others in the meeting expressed having the same overwhelming feelings of calmness and solace as I did upon hearing his voice. This peace came from our knowledge that we had a prophet to lead and guide us and that if we but listen and obey the words of such a man, who speaks for the Master, all would be well in our lives--no matter what else happened.<br><br>Prophets in ancient and modern times have been chosen before they come to the earth. They were "prepared from the foundation of the world according to the foreknowledge of God" (Alma 13:3). They have been selected and reared by the Lord to be the leaders of His church and preside over it at specific times in which they have served. They have and will be protected until their missions are completed. In this time and place, President Gordon B. Hinckley is our prophet. In today's world, as in past dispensations, there always has been a need for the steady and reassuring voice of a prophet. All of the Lord's prophets have had the faith, courage, and conviction to speak with boldness the words of God.<br><br>President Hinckley had been praised by some with descriptions such as "clearly a man for the season. . . . He's a hand shaker, a praiser, a man who knows what to say and how to say it, often with a sense of humor."<sup>1</sup> Those who do not understand his calling as a prophet see him only as such. They view him as a very nice and wise elderly man who speaks of wonderful values and seems to love people. His message may be pleasing to some, but they might also feel he may not fully understand what life is really like in today's world. They may consider that he is just a little bit old-fashioned in his advice and that his messages and counsel are only his opinions and can be accepted or rejected as desired. If his advice seems nice and acceptable to them, it may be heeded. If it doesn't, they may feel justified in rejecting it. This is how most of the world may view him, but we who are faithful members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints are asked to sustain him as a prophet, seer, and revelator, as well as the president of the Church.<br><br>We are told in the scriptures that the message of a prophet is not his own but what the Lord would have him say. We are told by the Lord, "My word shall not pass away, but shall all be fulfilled, whether by mine own voice or by the voice of my servants, it is the same" (D&amp;amp;C 1:38). Heeding the voice of the prophet is obeying the will of the Lord. Therefore, if we reject the message of the prophet, we are rejecting God and we are choosing the influence of another who seeks our eternal destruction and misery.<br><br>We are blessed to know that the Lord has established a means of communication with His children through His ordained prophets. Our prophet's voice and the message it shares can be trusted to teach and guide us in the will of the Lord. When we sustain President Hinckley as our prophet, we place ourselves under solemn covenant to heed his counsel. There is safety in obeying the counsel of a prophet, even though at times we may not understand the counsel and may think that it doesn't apply to us. Remember, he is the Lord's mouthpiece.<br><br>President Hinckley has spoken many times on this campus. The words he has spoken are for all students who have or will attend here as well as for young men and women throughout the world. He loves you and knows and understands the world in which you live. He wants you to be successful in your academic and spiritual lives.<br><br>May I take the opportunity to quote a very small sample of advice that he has given you. This is counsel he has felt is valuable to heed as you are in this stage of your lives and as you move forward into the future. He has said:<br><br><i>Every one of us who is here has accepted a sacred and compelling trust. With that trust, there must be accountability. That trust involves standards of behavior as well as standards of academic excellence.</i><sup>2</sup><br><br><i>I encourage you to speak up for moral standards in a world where filth, sleaze, pornography, and their evil brood are sweeping over us as a flood. In the first place, none of us can afford to be partakers of this rubbish. . . .</i><br><br><i>Stand up for integrity in your business, in your profession, in your home, in the society of which you are a part. . . .</i><br><br><i>Stand up for loyalty to your heritage. Each of us represents the latest chapter in a long line of generations. . . . The name that you carry is a treasured possession. Keep it unsullied. . . .</i><br><br><i>Be loyal to the Church. Stand tall for it. Defend it. Speak no evil against it. It is the work of God. He who ridicules it or defames it offends him whose church it is. It carries the sacred name of the Lord Jesus Christ.</i><sup>3</sup><br><br><i>You young men and you young women, most of you will marry and have children. Your children will have children, as will the children who come after them. Life is a great chain of generations that we in the Church believe must be linked together.</i><br><br><i>I fear there will be some broken links. Do not let yourself become such.</i><sup>4</sup><br><br><i>Take a little time, now and again, to reach out to help others--there are those right around you, students in need of a little kindness, a little attention, a little appreciation. . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . You can bring sunlight into lives filled with gloom, sadness, and pain. . . .</i><br><br><i>Every one of you is precious. You are precious in the sight of God. You are precious in the sight of your parents. You are precious to us who count on you to take advantage of this great season of preparation for the world in which you will live.</i><sup>5</sup><br><br>These are valuable words of advice and concern for all of us, and we honor our prophet and the Lord by heeding them.<br><br>We do honor and love our beloved prophet. One cannot help but love him. We love him when he walks with a speedy gait for a man now in his 96th year and waves his cane.<br><br>We love him when we feel the tenderness in his voice as he speaks of Sister Hinckley.<br><br>We love him as we see him shake the hands of people throughout the world and see the tears in the eyes of those who meet him.<br><br>We love him when his sense of humor makes us laugh and smile.<br><br>But, most important, we love and honor him because we know that he is a man of God who follows the Lord Jesus Christ in everything he does.<br><br>My dear brothers and sisters, I do have a testimony that Gordon B. Hinckley is a prophet of the Lord. Listening to and heeding his voice can give us direction in our lives that can lead us once again to our Father in Heaven and His Son, Jesus Christ. I express this to you in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>1. "Pres. Hinckley, 87, Charms World as He Leads Church," <i>Deseret News,</i> 23 May 1998, A1; see Virginia U.

<h1>s of the Earth Shall Inquire After Thy Name” - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
During the observance of the 200th anniversary of the birth of the Prophet Joseph Smith, Church members have been reminded of the breadth and depth of his influence as the priesthood leader of this dispensation. Our knowledge has been renewed of the miracles associated with the coming forth and spreading of the gospel, the growth of the Church, and the continuing role of modern-day prophets who lead the Church in latter-day preparation to greet the Savior in a coming day as He ushers in the millennial era. We expect the Prophet Joseph to be with Him when He comes!<br><br>How do we prepare to meet the Savior? As we follow the Prophet, every faithful member of the Church must understand and accept a personal commitment to support the work of carrying the message of the restored gospel to the world. The life of each Church member will continue to be directly affected by missionary responsibility. We or our families will have been brought into the Church by missionaries, be now preparing for a mission, have already served at least one mission, or be supporting and sustaining others in fulfilling their calls. Knowledge about how the work is unfolding across the world will strengthen our faith and our desire to fulfill our personal missionary responsibilities.<br><br>I pray for the sustaining influence of the Holy Spirit as I offer thoughts about the Prophet Joseph and the coming forth of the Church on the African continent. The dedication of the Accra Ghana Temple in January of 2004 and of the Aba Nigeria Temple one month ago have been acknowledged by President Hinckley as truly miraculous in many ways, and these dedications constitute important parts of the fulfillment of the 1839 prophecy to Joseph Smith in Liberty Jail, when he was told, "The ends of the earth shall inquire after thy name" (D&amp;amp;C 122:1).<sup>1</sup><br><br>Africa remains substantially unknown to most of the world. Although it occupies nearly 20 percent of the earth's surface and its population is almost 15 percent of the world's total, there are still relatively few who have visited the continent or found reason to inform themselves about it.<br><br>For those who have been there, simply hearing the word <i>Africa</i> is exhilarating. It arouses an unending panorama of images and emotions for those who have visited the broad plains, the wondrous natural sights, the small villages, and the teeming cities or who have met any of the vast variety of heartwarming, disarmingly positive, and resourceful African people. A spiritual dimension is evidenced in the lives of so many of them, and they are warmly open and responsive to any sincere expression of friendship. It is primarily the African people who inspire such positive reactions and loyalties from foreign observers, but natural and physical Africa does as well.<br><br>Physically, Africa is vast, enormously complicated, and not easily described. It is a huge landmass of deserts, rain forests, boundless plains, wild animals, uncountable millions of people, and the ironies of fabulous wealth in resources, glorious natural beauty, and great human promise--all alongside terrible disease, grinding poverty, and incessant famine. It is challenging in its scale, including nearly 12 million square miles (slightly fewer than Asia), and is the world's second-largest continent. It is more than three times the size of the United States, and its continental area is large enough to encompass the USA, China, India, Europe, Argentina, and New Zealand combined.<br><br>Africa's anthropological heritage has provided evidence that qualify parts of it to be called "the cradle of human civilization" and prove the continent to have been the home of well-developed kingdoms several hundred years before the Christian era. Extensive trade routes from the East crossed Africa from the Arab states and Asia, as did trans-Saharan routes from the Guinea Coast to North Africa that have linked the subcontinent to Europe for more than a thousand years. Beginning in the seventh century A.D., Islam spread steadily across these routes from the Arab peninsula through North Africa.<br><br>From as early as the ninth and tenth centuries, and continuing through the mid-nineteenth century A.D., these trade routes provided pathways for the extensive slave trade to Europe, the Americas, and the African East Coast. This trade decimated families, villages, tribes, and nations, with as many as 20 million Africans removed from their homes and lands. With slavery as the worst example, African political and economic history since the late 19th century continued to reflect dominance and exploitation by European powers through World War II and then subjugation to Western and East European influences during the Cold War between 1950 and 1989.<br><br>The exhaustion of European powers in World War II, as well as the expansion of international pressures for self-determination, provided opportunities for African independence, and a wave of new states began to emerge in the late 1950s--first in Libya, then in West Africa, and, by the early 1960s, across the entire continent. There are now 53 separate and sovereign African nations--making up nearly one-fourth of the membership of the United Nations. The continental population is between 830 million and 900 million people and cannot be estimated with accuracy. Africans speak more than 1,000 languages and dialects, and the population is divided among several thousand family, village, and tribal traditions.<br><br>The more one learns about Africa and Africans, the greater seems the enormity of undertaking and pursuing missionary work there. Elder Alexander Morrison of the Seventy wrote in 1990, "In some ways, at least, I believe that establishing the gospel in Africa represents the most difficult challenge the Church has ever had to face."<sup>2</sup> Without the unbounded faith and complete assurance of the Lord's prophets, it could never be attempted. Several thousand Church members have now served missions on the continent, and they bring firm testimony that the Lord's hand is directing the work. There soon will be a quarter of a million members in Africa spread throughout 17 missions, 45 stakes, and 700 wards and branches. Most of you in this audience were born between 1983 and 1987, and most of the growth of the Church in Africa has happened within your lifetimes. Many of you have served missions there already, and many more of you will have that blessing in your future.<br><br>The work in Africa started, of course, well before your lifetimes. It was always intended in the great plan of God that this last dispensation would be commanded to carry the gospel to "the ends of the earth." Because of the increased pace of the work, the Church recently passed the inevitable milestone of having more members spread across the world in other countries than we have in the United States.<br><br>The 1839 promise to Joseph Smith about "the ends of the earth" came during the latter weeks of the Prophet's confinement in Liberty Jail. Gravely concerned about his loved ones, aware that the Saints were being harassed and murdered, in desperation he cried out to the Lord:<br><br><i>O God, where art thou? . . .</i><br><br><i>How long shall thy hand be stayed? . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . Stretch forth thy hand. . . .</i><br><br><i>Let thine anger be kindled against our enemies; and . . . avenge us of our wrongs.</i> [D&amp;amp;C 121:1–2, 4–5]<br><br>The Lord's answer was gentle and reassuring:<br><br><i>My son, peace be unto thy soul; thine adversity and thine afflictions shall be but a small moment;</i><br><br><i>And then, if thou endure it well, God shall exalt thee on high; thou shalt triumph over all thy foes.</i> [D&amp;amp;C 121:7–8]<br><br>Then came the unmistakable affirmations in section 122:<br><br><i>The ends of the earth shall inquire after thy name, and fools shall have thee in derision, and hell shall rage against thee. . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . Know thou, my son, that all these things shall give thee experience, and shall be for thy good.</i> [D&amp;amp;C 122:1, 7]<br><br>The Lord's firm assurance to the Prophet was laden with profound implications for the future of missionary work in the Church. Joseph must have wondered, even if he did not doubt, how the great prophecies and promises made to and through him were to be fulfilled if he were separated from the Church. These questions were put to rest with this prophecy. The Restoration and the gospel message would go forth!<br><br>Having received this assurance, how specifically might the Prophet have thought of missionary work across the various nations of the earth? We know that he had thought about and sent missionaries to England in 1837 and 1839 and that he thought about rededicating Palestine for the return of the Jews. He sent Apostle Orson Hyde to Jerusalem to do so in 1841. Might he have thought of eventual missionary work in Asia, South America, or Africa?<br><br>In light of known revelation, it cannot be doubted that the Prophet contemplated missionary work throughout the world. However, little was generally known about Africa before his Martyrdom in 1844. Following his death, the responsibility for carrying the gospel message to the ends of the earth passed to his successors, and as soon as President Brigham Young could pursue it, he did so with zeal. By the early 1850s, apostles as special witnesses and other missionaries as well had been sent to open missions in Chile, France, Germany, Gibraltar, Hawaii, India, Malta, Scandinavia, the South Pacific, and Switzerland.<sup>3</sup> Professor Dale LeBaron wrote about historical events in 1852 that affected South Africa:<br><br><i>At a special Church conference in Salt Lake City in August 1852, . . . President Brigham Young called 106 men to . . . go on missions to various lands. . . . Three . . . to South Africa: Jesse Haven, William H. Walker, and Leonard I. Smith, with Elder Haven assigned to preside. . . . They arrived at the Cape of Good Hope on April 18, 1853, and set about to establish the Church in South Africa, encouraging the converts to "gather to Zion" in Utah.</i><sup>4</sup><br><br>The first missionaries on the African continent--preaching solely to white South Africans--organized branches near Cape Town and in Port Elizabeth, and by 1865, 278 converts to the Church emigrated from South Africa to Utah.<sup>5</sup> Between 1865 and 1903 no missionaries were on the African continent. Between 1903 and 1940, however, 230 missionaries served until they had to be withdrawn because of World War II. New missionaries returned in 1944 and have been in South Africa ever since.<sup>6</sup> Until 1978 their work was strictly confined to white South Africans.<br><br>Eventually the South Africa Mission was expanded to include what is now called Zimbabwe, and an impressive Church membership of several thousand exceptionally strong and faithful members have since provided exemplary Church leadership. In 1954 President David O. McKay became the first prophet to visit South Africa. In 1970 the first stake there was organized in Johannesburg. And in 1973 President Spencer W. Kimball visited the country and pronounced a special rededicatory prayer for South Africa. Here is some of that inspired prayer:<br><br><i>We come to Thee today . . . to re-dedicate the land, that the people may open their hearts, that the government may open doors, that the things which we teach . . . may reach the great masses of people in this area. . . .</i><br><br><i>Let peace envelop this land. Bless the leadership of this country. . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . We look forward to the day, our Father, when all the processes might converge to bring a temple to this land, wherein all the . . . people . . . may have their endowments and the blessings that are available to righteous people. . . . We rededicate</i> [this land] <i>for Thy Holy purposes. . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . And</i> [we] <i>ask Thee, our Father, to keep it in mind, to keep it in Thy sight, to never let it be forgotten by Thee.</i><sup>7</sup><br><br>This prayer preceded President Kimball's revelation on the priesthood by four and a half years, yet it includes appeals that the government might open doors, that the message might "reach the great masses of people in this area," and that peace might envelop the land. And it prophetically calls for a temple wherein <i>all</i> the people may have their endowments. South Africa in 1973 was home to some 5 million whites and 35 million blacks. References to "the great masses of people" would clearly include both groups.<br><br>On June 1, 1978, the revelation on the priesthood was received in the Salt Lake Temple. President Hinckley spoke of that remarkable and momentous event during a Churchwide fireside commemorating the 159th anniversary of the restoration of the priesthood:<br><br><i>There was a hallowed and sanctified atmosphere in the room. For me, it felt as if a conduit opened between the heavenly throne and the kneeling, pleading prophet of God who was joined by his Brethren. . . .</i><br><br><i>Every man in that circle, by the power of the Holy Ghost, knew the same thing. . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . Not one of us who was present on that occasion was ever quite the same after that. Nor has the Church been quite the same. . . .</i><br><br><i>Tremendous, eternal consequences for millions over the earth are flowing from that manifestation. . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . This has opened great areas of the world to the teaching of the everlasting gospel. . . .</i><br><br><i>We have cause to rejoice . . . that we have seen this glorious day.</i><sup>8</sup><br><br>The revelation declares that "all worthy male members of the Church may be ordained to the priesthood without regard for race or color" (Official Declaration 2). While of utmost importance to the entire world, the foundational importance of this revelation for Africa cannot be misunderstood. Even prior to the opening of missionary work among black West Africans, early contacts had been made, and following the priesthood revelation missionaries were sent there in 1978 authorized to teach, baptize, ordain, and organize. The Africa West Mission began operations on July 1, 1980.<br><br>President Kimball had announced at general conference in April 1980 that the Church would build seven new temples. He announced plans for nine more at the next April conference in 1981. Thirteen of the 16 new structures were to be constructed outside the United States. This was the most dramatic acceleration in temple building in the history of the Church until that time. One of the new temples announced in 1981 was to be in South Africa.<sup>9</sup><br><br>Ground in Johannesburg was broken and a site dedicated in late November 1982 by Elder Marvin J. Ashton. The beautiful structure--the first of what will surely be many temples on the African continent--was completed and dedicated by President Hinckley, then second counselor in the First Presidency, on August 24 and 25, 1985. Following is some of what the dedicatory prayer included:<br><br><i>We pray for peace in this troubled land. Bless this nation which has befriended Thy servants. May those who rule in the offices of government be inspired to find a basis for reconciliation among those who now are in conflict one with another. May the presence of Thy house on the soil of this land bring blessings to the entire nation.</i><sup>10</sup><br><br>This prayer calling for reconciliation among those in conflict--added to the physical presence of the temple and supported by the steadfast faith and loyalty of a remarkable group of Church members--contributed to historic changes in South Africa's political and economic status over the ensuing decade. Consider the following:<br><br><b>First,</b> crucially important changes in Eastern Europe in 1988 and 1989 led to a withdrawal of Russian influence in southern Africa, to a departure of Cuban troops from Angola, to a brokered peace ending a long war between South Africa and Angola, and to resolution of major international issues of conflict between South Africa and other nations--both in Africa and elsewhere.<br><br><b>Second,</b> following a half century of a formal policy for separation of races in South Africa known as "apartheid," the National Party that controlled Parliament and internal security announced significant changes in its policies and elected new leaders in 1989. By February of 1990, state president F. W. de Klerk announced the intention of the government to release Nelson Mandela. A Council for a Democratic South Africa began negotiations leading to a new constitution.<br><br><b>Third,</b> following 300 years of fragmented political, economic, and social relations between races, the first fully democratic election in the history of South Africa took place in April 1994. Though far from problem free, this election and the compromises that led to and followed it transformed South African society.<br><br>South Africa has experienced much violence and is far from resolving its problems. Indeed, new challenges have emerged. However, it has passed through a more peaceful revolution than the civil war between the races that was both feared and predicted in the mid-1980s, just as the temple was being dedicated. President Hinckley prayed in 1985 that the presence of the Lord's house in South Africa would bring blessings to the entire nation, and it surely has!<br><br>How has the Church expanded across the continent and what is its present status? There are now Church members in 29 of the 53 African countries. Those 29 nations have an estimated combined population of 570 million--about twice the population of the United States. Church membership in these countries has grown steadily in the past two decades. By 1995 the Church had grown to 79,000 members in 21 countries. By 2000, membership was 109,000, and by early 2005 it was 203,597, reflecting growth of 87 percent over the previous five years.<sup>11</sup><br><br>During the 20 years since the dedication of the South Africa temple, the Church in Africa has experienced an increase in membership of nearly 800 percent. It remains true, however, that the current members represent only about four-tenths of 1 percent of the 570 million people in countries with Church branches, and that nearly half of the African countries (24) and one-third of the continent's population (300 million) have yet to have missionaries and develop Church activity. A great work remains to be done!<br><br>Still, in some countries, growth has been dramatic. South Africa's membership has tripled to more than 40,000 since 1987. Ghana's membership has doubled to 24,000 in the 10-year period since 1995. And Nigeria's membership has nearly doubled in just five years to 64,000.<br><br>Church leaders have established good relationships of mutual respect with governmental, provincial, tribal, religious, and humanitarian-aid officials as aid projects have been instituted and buildings dedicated. Current Ghana president John A. Kufuor met with the First Presidency in Salt Lake City on September 17, 2002, and stated, "We consider you as part of Ghana."<sup>12</sup> In December of 2003 he attended the temple open house with several members of Ghana's parliament.<sup>13</sup><br><br>President Hinckley also stated during his recent trip:<br><br><i>During the last five years, this Church has sent $77,196,000</i> [in] <i>aid to Africa. . . .</i><br><br>[The Church has] <i>drilled enough wells to provide enough clean water to 1,083,000 people. . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . We've also been helping the poor and the needy . . . those in trouble . . . those with diseases. . . . We'll need to do more.</i><sup>14</sup><br><br>The two recent West African temples promise to bring further growth and many additional blessings. As President Hinckley dedicated the Accra Ghana Temple on January 11, 2004, he prayed:<br><br><i>We thank Thee for the brotherhood that exists among us, that neither color of skin nor land of birth can separate us as Thy sons and daughters. . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . Touch the hearts of the members of the Church in this and surrounding nations. . . . May they be good citizens . . . and may the rulers of these nations be generous toward Thy people and safeguard their liberties. . . .</i><br><br><i>May Thy work spread in this land and in adjoining nations. . . .</i><br><br><i>We pray for this nation of Ghana and for all who constitute its government. May it become a model among the nations of this vast continent. May it grow in strength and influence for good. Incline the hearts of its rulers that they may befriend Thy people, even Thy faithful Saints.</i><sup>15</sup><br><br>On the day preceding the dedication, President Hinckley stated in an interview:<br><br><i>This is a great nation . . . where there has been peace and constitutional government for a long time. This nation stands as an example to all of the nations of Africa for its stability and good government. Pray that it may continue.</i><sup>16</sup><br><br>The Aba Nigeria Temple posed special problems associated with obtaining permits, building materials, and professional services, but it was completed just weeks ago and became the 121st dedicated temple in the Church. In President Hinckley's dedicatory prayer on August 7, he prayed:<br><br><i>In the spread of Thy work over the earth, we have in this good land and in other nations of Africa, strong stakes of Zion with disciples of great faith, obedient to Thee, and with a desire to carry eternal truth to many more.</i><br><br><i>Bless this nation that it may rise in strength and freedom among the nations of Africa. Bless its leaders that they may look with favor upon Thy Saints and safeguard their rights, property, and privileges.</i><br><br><i>Bless Thy faithful people and keep them from disease and pestilence, from poverty and want, from conflict of any kind, and from political oppression. . . .</i><br><br><i>We pray for Thy work throughout the earth.</i><sup>17</sup><br><br>During a Church meeting on August 6, President Hinckley told members that the presence of a temple in Nigeria "will make of this a better country, a better nation, a better place to live" and that it will strengthen families.<sup>18</sup> At a news conference the day before the dedication, he said to reporters, "I have confidence that the presence of this temple will become a great blessing to the people of Nigeria. . . . A whole nation will be strengthened.<sup>19</sup><br><br>A wonderful aspect of living during the latter days is that this period is an era of fulfilled prophecy. As the 21st century unfolds rapidly in our view, we see more clearly that prophecies, both ancient and modern, are being fulfilled with such regularity that their miraculous nature is nearly invisible. Such, it seems, is the case with President Hinckley's recent trip around the world. Is there any other instance in all of history of a single-trip circumnavigation of the world by a living prophet?<br><br>The trip is miraculous in a number of ways:<br><br><b>First,</b> that the Lord has preserved and sustained the prophet's health and strength in this manner.<br><br><b>Second,</b> that the laws and regulations of nations in a high-security age could be so aligned as to permit such a trip.<br><br><b>Third,</b> that the hardware for round-the-world flight exists and is available to the Lord's prophet.<br><br><b>Fourth,</b> that there are audiences and agenda requiring the presence of the prophet in Vladivostok, Seoul, Taipei, Hong Kong, Delhi, Nairobi, Aba, Rome, and Paris, not to mention Salt Lake City!<br><br>In the 21st-century Church there is now a literal capacity for the message of the gospel to be carried electronically to every corner of the earth instantly and for personal visits by the prophet to occur within hours. While there are still "ends of the earth" we have not reached, we have the physical and technological capacity to do so for the first time in the earth's history. And as missionaries throughout the world teach about the 200th anniversary of the Prophet's birth, the ends of the earth continue to inquire after his name.<br><br>In conclusion, consider the revelation given to Joseph Smith in October of 1831 that is now recorded as section 65 of the Doctrine and Covenants. The Prophet called it "a prayer." Its words make clear our missionary responsibility for our day and the purposes served as we fulfill it:<br><br><i>The keys of the kingdom of God are committed unto man on the earth, and from thence shall the gospel roll forth unto the ends of the earth . . . until it has filled the whole earth. . . .</i><br><br><i>Call upon the Lord, that his kingdom may go forth upon the earth, that the inhabitants thereof may receive it, and be prepared for the days to come, in the which the Son of Man shall come down in heaven, clothed in the brightness of his glory, to meet the kingdom of God which is set up on the earth.</i><br><br><i>Wherefore, may the kingdom of God go forth, that the kingdom of heaven may come.</i> [D&amp;amp;C 65:2, 5–6]<br><br>May each of us fully accept and fulfill our personal and individual role in missionary work, helping the kingdom of God to roll forth unto the ends of the earth and preparing ourselves and each other for the days to come when the Son of Man will bring the kingdom of heaven and begin His millennial reign. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>R. J. Snow was a BYU professor of political science when this devotional address was given on 6 September 2005.</i><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>1. "The ends of the earth" is a significant and recurring phrase in both the Old Testament and the Book of Mormon and is prominent in the revelations of the Doctrine and Covenants as well, having been drawn by the Lord from its ancient origins into Restoration scripture through the Prophet Joseph Smith.<br><br>It appears 35 times in the Old Testament, beginning with its use by Moses, then by Samuel, Job, David, and Solomon in Psalms and Proverbs, and by Isaiah, Jeremiah, Daniel, Micah, and Zechariah. Many of the Old Testament references are not related to spreading the gospel but are used to clarify the extensiveness of God's creations and powers, the completeness of the blessings of salvation to all mankind, and the infinite praise and glory owed to God by His sons and daughters.<br><br>The phrase appears only once in the New Testament in connection with the mission of Paul and Barnabas "to be a light of the Gentiles . . . for salvation unto the ends of the earth" (Acts 13:47).<br><br>There are 15 references to the phrase in the Book of Mormon, 10 of which are nearly identical to their earlier appearances in Isaiah. As it is used in Mosiah, Alma, 3 Nephi, Mormon, Ether, and Moroni, it defines the scriptural admonition that the gospel message is to be carried unto the ends of the earth.<br><br>In modern revelation the phrase "the ends of the earth" is mentioned 19 times, sprinkled across 15 sections of the Doctrine and Covenants beginning with section 1 and extending through section 133. These references are almost entirely directed to the missionary responsibility of the Church.<br><br>The Book of Mormon and the Doctrine and Covenants also include the familiar phrase "every nation, kindred, tongue, and people," which does not appear in either the Old or New Testament. The two phrases clearly are meant to define the full extent of God's creation.<br><br>2. Alexander B.

<h1>es—More Precious Than Gold and Sweeter Than Honey - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Thank you to the wonderful choir. The music was beautiful, and it invited the Spirit. I also appreciated the opening prayer. I noticed particularly that the prayer asked that each of us would feel the Spirit tonight and that we would be inspired in the ways that we particularly need it. That certainly is my prayer. I'm so grateful for the opportunity to be with you tonight. But if I could have my wish, I would wish that this devotional could be a real old-fashioned fireside where I could pull you into my family room and we could have a heart-to-heart conversation--just as I would do if you were my own children, who are your age. I would probably begin by telling you about my missionary daughter. Isn't that what most missionary moms do? I told her in a recent letter that I was going to talk tonight about my love for the scriptures. This is how she responded:<br><br>"I'm excited that Mom is talking about scripture study! I feel like one of the ways I've changed the most is the way I study my scriptures. I <i>love</i> studying the scriptures now. I get so excited every time I have a chance to study. I can hardly explain it, except that it's just like Alma 32:28, where the word becomes delicious. I love it! I think I used to like the scriptures, and now I <i>love</i> them! My companion says she always knows when we're teaching and I'm about to turn to a scripture because my eyes light up and then I start flipping through pages. I just love answering people's questions through the scriptures."<br><br>I hope my daughter has a chance to listen to this message in Australia and that she'll be even more motivated, if that's possible, in her scripture studies. Likewise, I hope that the word will become delicious for you too, as it is for her and for me because the scriptures truly are "more to be desired . . . than gold . . . : sweeter also than honey" (Psalm 19:10).<br><h2><b>Sweetness of Scriptures</b></h2><br>Do you remember Tevye, the poor milkman with five daughters in the musical <i>Fiddler on the Roof</i> who dreamed of being rich? What would you hope for if you were rich? Probably for some of the same things that he did. He wanted to be prominent, have a big house, not have to work so hard, and so on. But these were not his deepest desires. His fondest dream, if he were to strike it rich, may seem unusual to us. Remember, he sang:<br><br><i>If I were rich I'd have the time that I lack</i><br><br><i>To sit in the synagogue and pray</i><br><br><i>And maybe have a seat by the eastern wall.</i><br><br><i>And I'd discuss the holy books with the learned men</i><br><br><i>Seven hours ev'ry day.</i><br><br><i>This would be the sweetest thing of all.</i><br><br>[Lyrics by Sheldon Harnick, "If I Were a Rich Man," <i>Fiddler on the Roof</i> ([New York]: Times Square Music Publications, 1965), 46–47]<br><br>If you were rich, would you spend your free time studying the "holy books," or the scriptures, for several hours a day? If you were rich, would the sweetest joy that you could imagine be to have more time for intensive scripture study?<br><br>To study holy books is regarded by Orthodox Jews as a sweet blessing and a great privilege. In fact, in some Jewish traditions, when the child was to start his education in the Torah, a taste of honey was given to the student so that he would associate the study of the holy books with sweetness. This was intended to reinforce what it says in Psalms: "How sweet are thy words unto my taste! yea, sweeter than honey to my mouth!" (Psalm 119:103).<br><br>Similarly, Psalm 19 compares the scriptures to gold and honey. The Psalmist beautifully exults in the word of the Lord, as follows:<br><br><i>The law of the Lord is perfect, converting the soul: the testimony of the Lord is sure, making wise the simple.</i><br><br><i>The statutes of the Lord are right, rejoicing the heart: the commandment of the Lord is pure, enlightening the eyes.</i><br><br><i>The fear of the Lord is clean, enduring for ever: the judgments of the Lord are true and righteous altogether.</i><br><br><i>More to be desired are they than gold, yea, than much fine gold: sweeter also than honey and the honeycomb.</i><br><br><i>Moreover by them is thy servant warned: and in keeping of them there is great reward.</i> [Psalm 19:7–11]<br><br>All of these terms in this scripture--<i>law, testimony, statutes, commandments, fear</i> (or <i>reverence</i>), and <i>judgments--</i>are synonyms for the word of the Lord, or scriptures. They are "more to be desired . . . than gold, yea, than much fine gold: [and] sweeter also than honey and the honeycomb."<br><br>I sometimes think that we should feel more like Tevye and my missionary daughter. Are the scriptures delicious to us--as precious as gold and sweeter than honey? Do we feast on them, delight in them, and ponder them as Nephi taught? (See 2 Nephi 4:15–16.) Do we liken them unto ourselves as Jacob counseled? (See 2 Nephi 6:5.) Do we search them for the Lord's specific words to us--bringing conversion, wisdom, enlightenment, revelation, comfort, and rejoicing? Do we recognize them as one of the sweetest, most sublime blessings we have?<br><h2><b>Hungering for Scriptures</b></h2><br>Perhaps if we were hungrier for the scriptures, they would be even sweeter and more precious to us. A few months ago I traveled to Africa, where the Saints were often hungry for food but, interestingly, even hungrier to feast on the word of the Lord. In each of the four countries I visited, I felt the powerful spirits and the great faith of the people. They had so little temporally, but they were rich spiritually. They had the glad tidings of the gospel--the plain and precious truths from the scriptures. Their well-worn scriptures accompanied them at every meeting. They taught from them, read from them, knew them, and loved them.<br><br>In fact, in one sacrament meeting a youth speaker went to the pulpit with nothing but his scriptures. He had a lot of the same mannerisms that youth speakers often have, where they kind of duck their head and shuffle their feet, but his message was powerful. He taught about sacrifice, beginning with scriptures from the Old Testament about blood sacrifice. Then he moved very comfortably to 3 Nephi in the Book of Mormon and told that old things were done away with the coming of the Savior, who now required the sacrifice of a broken heart and a contrite spirit. He used no notes, just his knowledge of the doctrine. It was exemplary of the way each of us should teach from the scriptures.<br><br>I thought again of Psalm 19 in relation to these Saints. The law of the Lord had been their means of conversion. The testimony of the Lord made these simple, intelligent people wise. They had light in their eyes and rejoicing in their hearts because they had the law, the testimony, the statutes, and the commandments of the Lord. In one place I visited, the people had walked for as many as four hours to come to a meeting. They had no means of transportation, sometimes no shoes, and very little to eat. They are subsistence farmers who have been in a severe drought for several years. But still they feasted on the words of God. This was "more to be desired . . . than gold . . . : [and] sweeter . . . than honey."<br><br>In another African country I found more people hungering to be taught the word of the Lord. The day we arrived there was a government crackdown on transportation because there was no fuel. The stake president was sure that the 700 members who had planned on attending our fireside would have no way to get there. We assured him we would teach as many or as few as could come. When we walked into the arranged room 20 minutes prior to the beginning of the meeting and saw more than 300 reverent Saints assembled, quietly listening to hymns being played on a recorder, I was overcome by the Spirit. During the course of the meeting, somehow, by some miracle, 300 more people arrived. They were hungry for the words of the Lord. They all had their scriptures and followed along eagerly as we taught them from the standard works. Because of their examples I saw with new eyes my own need for improvement. Perhaps many of us set our hearts too much upon worldly treasures. I wonder if we have grown casual or complacent in studying the word and living the doctrine.<br><br>The Old Testament prophet Amos talked about a famine for hearing the word--or, in other words, a spiritual hunger. "Behold, the days come, saith the Lord God, that I will send a famine in the land, not a famine of bread, nor a thirst for water, but of hearing the words of the Lord" (Amos 8:11). In Africa I met Saints who were not only hungry for bread and water but were hungry to hear the words of the Lord. Because they have known spiritual hunger, they have learned, as Nephi taught, how to "feast upon the words of Christ; for behold, the words of Christ will tell you all things what ye should do" (2 Nephi 32:3).<br><br>Imagine the spiritual hunger we might feel if we had no scriptures on which to feast. Through the ages many people have been without a record of the law. Think of Lehi's family when they first fled into the wilderness, for example, or the Mulekites, who "had brought no records with them" (Omni 1:17), or the times in the Old Testament when the people either did not have the book of the law or had forgotten it, as when Ezra and Nehemiah had to reeducate the Jews returning from captivity in Babylon in the book of the law (see Nehemiah 8:1–13).<br><h2><b>Learn in Your Youth to Love the Scriptures</b></h2><br>My favorite example from the Old Testament is Josiah, the boy-king who took the throne at the age of eight. His story illustrates the impact of a young person who found the scriptures to be more precious than gold and sweeter than honey. All of the kings before Josiah and after him were wicked. Either they did not have the law or they chose not to read it and heed it. But during Josiah's reign, Hilkiah the high priest found the lost book of the law in the house of the Lord (see 2 Kings 22:8). It was read to Josiah. Josiah's heart was tender, and he repented and wept before the Lord (see 2 Kings 22:19). Then he gathered all of his people to the temple and read the words to them, and together they covenanted to keep God's commandments:<br><br><i>And he read in their ears all the words of the book of the covenant which was found in the house of the Lord.</i><br><br><i>And the king</i> [and his people] <i>stood by a pillar, and made a covenant before the Lord, to walk after the Lord, and to keep his commandments and his testimonies and his statutes with all their heart and all their soul, to perform the words of this covenant that were written in this book. And all the people stood to the covenant.</i> [2 Kings 23:2–3]<br><br>What an inspiring story that is. I often wonder why Josiah was such a valiant spirit who responded to the teachings in the book of the law. Why was his response different than that of kings both before and after him? Is there an application in this to you at your young age about prizing the scriptures by reading them, heeding them, covenanting to keep the commandments in them, and then standing by the covenant?<br><br>Maybe the scriptures struck an immortal chord in Josiah or jogged some remembrance of a premortal teaching. Elder Neal A. Maxwell said at a CES symposium at BYU in 1991:<br><br><i>Perhaps the special, evocative powers of scriptures are bound up with our flashes of memory from the premortal world or at least call forth our predispositions nurtured for so long there.</i> ["Teaching by the Spirit--'The Language of Inspiration,'" <i>Old Testament Symposium Speeches, 1991</i> (Salt Lake City: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 1991), 1]<br><br>Perhaps that is why so often in the scriptures we see the injunction to "remember, remember" (Mosiah 2:41; Alma 37:13; Helaman 5:9, 12; 14:30). Not only are we remembering miracles and mercies in this life but also tender teachings from our premortal life. Elder Maxwell taught that we can learn much from our studying and pondering, thus awakening glimpses into previous lessons learned from our Heavenly Father.<br><br>On a visit he made to a mission president and his family in Russia, Elder Maxwell sat down with the five young daughters in the family one morning to converse. The first thing he asked them was what scripture they had been pondering that day. The question took the girls by surprise. But think about it. Elder Maxwell just assumed that the scriptures were as precious as gold and sweeter than honey to them as they were to him. If we did as he suggested and always had a scripture in mind, scripture study would be happening as we walked between classes, drove to appointments, or cleaned our houses. It would begin early in our lives and be ongoing and constant. We would be continually feasting, averting personal famine and spiritual hunger. The words of God would be "written . . . not in tables of stone, but in fleshy tables of [our] heart[s]" (2 Corinthians 3:3).<br><br>Even Elder Maxwell's young grandchildren knew him for his emphasis on the scriptures. Many of you will probably remember that in his final general conference message he told about a time he visited his grandchildren late one evening. His grandson Robbie had already gone to bed. When Elder Maxwell arrived, his mother said, "Robbie, Grandpa Neal is here!" He heard a tired little voice from the bedroom saying, "Shall I bring my scriptures?" (<i>CR,</i> April 2004, 48; or "Remember How Merciful the Lord Hath Been," <i>Ensign,</i> May 2004, 46). Like Josiah the boy-king and little grandson Robbie, we should learn early in our lives to love the scriptures, to feast upon them, and to learn from them.<br><br>Our own little grandchildren are also learning at this point in their lives to love the scriptures. We are so delighted in their responses. For instance, three-year-old Joshua, who loves heroes in all stories, used to blurt out at the climax of each scripture story: "And then, who saves the day? Jesus saves the day!" Joshua was learning an important lesson: that Jesus really is our Savior. Even His name means "save." Now in his prayers he prays about the characters that he has met on a daily basis. Once he prayed that Peter would not sink again, and then he prayed that the swine would not drown when they ran into the sea. Another time he prayed that Laman and Lemuel would be nice to Nephi. And we've even heard him pray for Jesus' daddy, who is Heavenly Father. Joshua recently received his own real copy of the Book of Mormon from his nursery leader in Primary. He no longer wants his mommy to read from the Book of Mormon reader. He told her he likes the real words the best.<br><br>Another grandson, Tanner, who is six, took swimming lessons this summer. At first he was really quite fearful of the water. On the day they were finally supposed to jump into the deep end all on their own, the family apparently had not read scriptures at breakfast time as they usually do. Although he was nervous, Tanner made the jump into the deep water. But when he got out, he made sure that his mother knew that he was upset. He said, "If we had remembered to read scriptures this morning, I wouldn't have been so scared to jump in." Our daughter felt reprimanded but also pleased that her little son placed such value on the Spirit and the strength that the scriptures bring into his life. Scripture study can give us strength to jump into the deep water that we too are sometimes called to swim in (see D&amp;amp;C 127:2).<br><h2><b>Doctrine Can Change Our Lives</b></h2><br>The Apostle Paul praised Timothy for learning early in his life to know and love the scriptures; in so doing, he described the great blessings of scriptures in our lives as well:<br><br><i>From a child thou hast known the holy scriptures, which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus.</i><br><br><i>All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness:</i><br><br><i>That the man of God may be perfect, throughly furnished unto all good works.</i> [2 Timothy 3:15–17]<br><br>What wonderful blessings come from studying the holy scriptures. They can make us "wise unto salvation." They can increase our faith in Jesus Christ and His plan. They can teach us of our weaknesses and of our need for repentance. They can teach us doctrine.<br><br>President Boyd K. Packer has said many times: "True doctrine, understood, changes attitudes and behavior. The study of the doctrines of the gospel will improve behavior quicker than a study of behavior will improve behavior" (<i>CR,</i> April 2004, 80; or "Do Not Fear," <i>Ensign,</i> May 2004, 79). Through the scriptures we can learn true doctrine right from the source, which in turn will help us become perfect, or complete, as Paul says. It is never too late to begin seriously feasting on the doctrine contained in the scriptures. In fact, even tonight would be a great time for all of us to get started.<br><br>Now is a time in your lives when you are making major and important decisions about virtually everything--schools, jobs, careers, missions, friends, dating, marriage, children, finances, living situations, faithfulness in Church service, and so on. I've thought and prayed long and hard about what I could say that would help each one of you individually during these important decision years. You need individual guidance. You need personal revelation that will help you through your own unique circumstances. Alma taught that<br><br><i>the preaching of the word had a . . . more powerful effect upon the minds of the people than the sword, or anything else, . . . therefore Alma thought it was expedient that they should try the virtue of the word of God.</i> [Alma 31:5]<br><br>I know and I testify that as we "try the virtue of the word of God," comfort, guidance, and personal revelation will come to each of us.<br><br>How does scripture study have this powerful effect on us? The scriptures invite the Spirit. It is the Spirit that comforts and guides us. It is the Spirit that teaches us and reveals the Lord's mind and will for us. President Spencer W. Kimball said:<br><br><i>I find that when I get casual in my relationships with divinity and when it seems that no divine ear is listening and no divine voice is speaking, that I am far, far away. If I immerse myself in the scriptures the distance narrows and the spirituality returns.</i> [<i>TSWK,</i> 135]<br><h2><b>Scriptures Bless Us with Comfort</b></h2><br>In a movie portrayal about C. S. Lewis, his character made a profound statement about praying, which I think works equally well for reading scriptures. He said:<br><br><i>I pray because I can't help myself. I pray because I'm helpless. I pray because the need flows out of me all the time, waking and sleeping. It doesn't change God; it changes me.</i> [William Nicholson, <i>Shadowlands,</i> stage play and screenplay, 1994]<br><br>I feel the same way about the scriptures. I turn to them because "the need flows out of me all the time." I know of my profound need to have the words of God feed my soul and teach me all things that I should know. They change me.<br><br>Many of you will remember and love the inspirational story of Betsie and Corrie ten Boom, Dutch sisters who became prisoners of war in Nazi Germany, and how they turned to the Bible in their great need in Ravensbrü, the notorious women's concentration camp. Corrie told us:<br><br><i>As for us, from morning until lights-out, whenever we were not in ranks for roll call, our Bible was the center of an ever-widening circle of help and hope. Like waifs clustered around a blazing fire, we gathered about it, holding out our hearts to its warmth and light. The blacker the night around us grew, the brighter and truer and more beautiful burned the word of God. "Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword? . . . Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us."</i><br><br><i>I would look about us as Betsie read, watching the light leap from face to face.</i> [Corrie ten Boom, <i>The Hiding Place</i> (New York: Bantam Books, 1971), 194–95]<br><br>The words of God fed and sustained these women. They brought warmth and light. They were more precious than gold and sweeter than honey.<br><h2><b>Scriptures Bless Us with Revelation</b></h2><br>Sometimes the exact words from the scriptures forcefully answer our prayers. Reading the scriptures also opens our minds and hearts to thoughts prompted by the Spirit. We are much more apt to receive such help if we go to the scriptures seeking, desiring, and asking.<br><br>Revelation came over and over again to Joseph Smith as he read the scriptures and asked inspired questions. We all know that we have that glorious First Vision as a result of this 14-year-old boy studying the scriptures and asking an important question. He needed to know which church was true, and he clung to the promise in James that the Lord would answer those who sincerely ask Him. Did you also know that section 76 came as Joseph pondered the writings of the Gospel of John about the salvation of men? The vision of the degrees of glory opened to his view. In fact, one LDS scholar has calculated that<br><br><i>over 50 percent of the revelations in the Doctrine and Covenants were received during the time period associated with the inspired revision of the Bible. . . . We have in the translation activities of Joseph Smith a living lesson in the matter of how to receive revelations; as the Prophet immersed himself in the scriptures, issues and curiosities and questions surfaced, eventuating in many cases in further light and knowledge to the Latter-day Saints in the form of contemporary revelations.</i> [Robert L. Millet, "Joseph Smith's Translation of the Bible and the Doctrine and Covenants," in <i>The Doctrine and Covenants,</i> Studies in Scripture, vol. 1, ed. Robert L. Millet and Kent P. Jackson (Sandy, Utah: Randall Book, 1984), 139]<br><br>Other prophets' revelations followed the same pattern. Doctrine and Covenants 138 was revealed to President Joseph F. Smith as he pondered the writings of Peter about the spirit world.<br><br>Each of us is entitled to personal revelation. The scriptures may be our most profound source for this. A professor at BYU told this story of a woman being guided by the Spirit through her study of the scriptures. The professor said:<br><br><i>One woman was guided to learn how to hear the voice of the Spirit while reading the scriptures. She was tutored to kneel in prayer, to thank her Heavenly Father for the scriptures, to request that the Spirit be with her as she read, and then to tell the Lord what she needed from the scriptures that particular day--one question she needed answered, perhaps guidance in a relationship, perhaps confirmation of a decision. She would then open her scriptures . . . and begin reading. She never had to read very far . . . before the Spirit gave her the answer she was seeking. Through these daily question-and-answer sessions with the scriptures and the Spirit, her sensitivity to the whisperings of the Spirit increased--and she fell in love with the scriptures.</i><br><br><i>I have related her experience to others who then tried the same experiment; the results have been astonishing. Everything from financial problems to relationship concerns have been solved. And in the process, their ability to hear the voice of the Holy Ghost has increased.</i> [Wendy L. Watson, "Let Your Spirit Take the Lead," in <i>The Power of His Redemption: Talks from the 2003 BYU Women's Conference</i> (Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 2004), 326]<br><br>I too have come to love and rely on the scriptures in my life. They are more precious than gold to me. Answers do not always come easily for me, but they do come. Sometimes it is even in the form of peace and comfort while I am waiting to understand the Lord's will or His timetable. When I was a young mother, President Spencer W. Kimball encouraged the women of the Church to "become scholars of the scriptures" ("The Role of Righteous Women," <i>Ensign,</i> November 1979, 102). If time permitted, I could tell you of innumerable ways that following his injunction helped me in my mothering. If you looked throughout my scriptures, you could see my children's names written out to the side of many passages that I knew by the force of revelation I needed to share with them.<br><br>Likewise, the words of the Lord have blessed me in my Church service. When I was first called to be the Young Women president, I went to the scriptures seeking. I sought comfort and guidance in my feelings of inadequacy and being overwhelmed by a responsibility that dwarfed my limited capacity. The scripture stories of prophets and leaders who felt inadequate in their callings brought peace and taught me that the Lord magnifies those whom He calls.<br><br>One such prophet, Enoch, said:<br><br><i>Why is it that I have found favor in thy sight, and am but a lad, and all the people hate me; for I am slow of speech; wherefore am I thy servant?</i><br><br><i>And the Lord said unto Enoch: Go forth and do as I have commanded thee. . . . Open thy mouth, and it shall be filled, and I will give thee utterance.</i> [Moses 6:31–32]<br><br>Moses also felt inadequate, and the Lord promised, "I will be with thy mouth, and teach thee what thou shalt say" (Exodus 4:12). And Jeremiah received this blessing: "Be not afraid . . . : for I am with thee to deliver thee. . . . [And] I have put my words in thy mouth" (Jeremiah 1:8–9).<br><br>As I studied, I was especially comforted by promises given to the Savior. I felt that Heavenly Father intended for me to liken those blessings to myself in my need. "The Lord God hath given me the tongue of the learned, that I should know how to speak a word in season to him that is weary" (Isaiah 50:4). This scripture referred me to another one that I have clung to as my theme: "For I will give you a mouth and wisdom, which all your adversaries shall not be able to gainsay nor resist" (Luke 21:15). Every single day for the past three years I have prayed for a mouth and for wisdom. It was my greatest desire (and precisely where I felt most inadequate) to know what it was the Lord wanted me to teach--to have wisdom--and then to be able to have the words to articulate that message--to have a mouth. Through the scriptures I found personal revelation that has guided me and comforted me in this calling. The words of the Lord are "more to be desired . . . than gold . . . : [and] sweeter . . . than honey" in my life (Psalm 19:10).<br><h2><b>Scriptures Bless Us with Testimony</b></h2><br>One of the great blessings we have as members of the Church is modern-day scripture, which gives additional witness that Jesus is the Christ and restores a fullness of the doctrines of His gospel. Each of our latter-day prophets has encouraged us to read the Book of Mormon and to live by its precepts with the promise that great blessings will come into our lives.<br><br>I think by now we all know that in August President Gordon B. Hinckley asked every member of the Church to read or reread the Book of Mormon by the end of this celebratory year. Why do you think our prophet has asked us to do this? Why? Each of us should ask ourselves: What do I need to learn? How do I need to improve? Where do I need help? We will find personal reasons and needs for this reading of the Book of Mormon. Then President Hinckley promised us that<br><br><i>there will come into your lives and into your homes an added measure of the Spirit of the Lord, a strengthened resolution to walk in obedience to His commandments, and a stronger testimony of the living reality of the Son of God.</i> ["A Testimony Vibrant and True," <i>Ensign,</i> August 2005, 6]<br><br>The Spirit of the Lord accompanies the Book of Mormon. My friends Wilford and Kathleen Andersen, who served as mission presidents in Guadalajara, Mexico, literally saw the spirit of the Book of Mormon at work. Sister Andersen felt impressed during the final year of their mission to educate her three sons at home rather than in a public school. However, she needed help in teaching them Spanish. She prayed to find a suitable tutor. She was led to Irma Encinas, who had been a teacher for 20 years and had just recently moved into this new city. Irma Encinas came twice a week to work with the boys.<br><br>Three weeks into the school year, Sister Andersen realized that she had hired someone who might be interested in learning more about our Church. So she told her about Joseph Smith and the Book of Mormon. Sister Andersen then decided to have the Spanish curriculum for her boys be the Book of Mormon. The boys each read out loud in Spanish from the scriptures on every visit. Then the teacher was instructed to ask them questions about the reading, and the boys had to answer her in Spanish. While the boys were learning Spanish, Irma Encinas was learning about the Book of Mormon.<br><br>After Christmas, Irma Encinas came to Sister Andersen and started to cry. She needed to tell her what was happening. She said that every time the boys read from the Book of Mormon, she saw light around their faces. When they closed their books, the light immediately went away. She confessed that her sister who lived with her had received a copy of the Book of Mormon 11 years earlier but had not read it. This unusual experience caused them both to search their bookshelves to find that dusty book. They wanted to discover for themselves what this light was that emanated from this book. I'm sure you can figure out the rest of the story. They started reading the Book of Mormon and desired to have missionaries teach them. Two weeks after their first missionary discussion, they were baptized.<br><h2><b>My Testimony</b></h2><br>President Hinckley has promised each of us that same light as we read the Book of Mormon. I have reread the Book of Mormon in the past several weeks. It has rekindled a testimony burning in my heart that Jesus Christ is the Redeemer of the world. Almost every verse testifies of Him. President Boyd K. Packer said, "Of more than 6,000 verses in the Book of Mormon, far more than half refer directly to Him" (<i>CR,</i> April 2005, 8; or "The Book of Mormon: Another Testament of Jesus Christ," <i>Ensign,</i> May 2005, 8–9).<br><br>The Book of Mormon people looked forward to Him with hope in His Redemption, and they looked back upon His exemplary life and redeeming death with hope in His Atonement. Long before Christ was born, Jacob wrote:<br><br><i>Believest thou the scriptures? . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . For they truly testify of Christ. Behold, I say unto you that none of the prophets have written, nor prophesied, save they have spoken concerning this Christ.</i> [Jacob 7:10–11]<br><br>And long after Christ had come, Mormon wrote: "And the things which are upon these plates pleasing me, because of the prophecies of the coming of Christ; and my fathers knowing that many of them have been fulfilled" (Words of Mormon 1:4). What a broad and wonderful perspective to witness. As I read, I knew it was through the people's faith in Christ and His Atonement that they endured pain and affliction and overcame sin and temptation. I know that Jesus is the living Christ. I have felt to sing the song of His redeeming love (see Alma 5:26).<br><br>Also in this rereading I started to catch a glimpse of the significance of the plates--the brass plates, the 24 gold plates, and the record of the Nephites upon large and small plates. I realized they were more precious than gold to Lehi and his descendants. Alma pulls us into his home--as I wish I could have done tonight--and lets us listen in on his teachings to his son Helaman. He recounts to him why each of these records is so important. He entrusts him with the great responsibility of not only caring for the plates and continuing to write on them but of also teaching their truths. He said:<br><br><i>For just as surely as this director</i> [the Liahona] <i>did bring our fathers, by following its course, to the promised land, shall the words of Christ, if we follow their course, carry us beyond this vale of sorrow into a far better land of promise.</i> [Alma 37:45]<br><br>I have received the blessings promised by President Hinckley--a greater measure of the Spirit, a desire to repent and walk in more stalwart obedience, and a testimony of the living reality of the Son of God. I pray that you will use this time in your youth to feast on the scriptures, to set a pattern to follow throughout your life, to invite personal revelation through the scriptures and learning the doctrine of Jesus Christ.<br><br>"I love the Lord, / In Him my soul delights" (John Tanner, "I Love the Lord" [Orem, Utah: Jackman Music Corporation, 2000], 2; see also 2 Nephi 4:15–16). I know that Heavenly Father lives and that He loves us enough to speak to us through His scriptures. I testify with Nephi, "My soul delighteth in the scriptures" (2 Nephi 4:15). The scriptures have bolstered my testimony, taught me truths, guided my path, and comforted my sorrows--as I know they will for you. "By them [I have been] warned: and in keeping . . . them [I have received] great reward" (Psalm 19:11). They are "more to be desired . . . than gold, yea, than much fine gold: [and] sweeter also than honey and the honeycomb" (Psalm 19:10). In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Susan W.

<h1>l Try to I Will Do - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Right up front I would like to thank Kay Johnson. She has helped me with all of the details and has granted all of my wishes except one. I asked her if I could bring my cardiologist along with me to sit by my side. Hopefully I can get through this talk without needing one.<br><br>I love BYU. I love the students here. I love the faculty and the staff and the administrators. I have made many friends while being here.<br><br>I'm going to focus on being a good friend, and I ask that all of you might reflect on what kind of a friend you are. We all function so much better when we are friends. We are united.<br><br>I love to tell stories. I hope you like to listen to stories. I'm going to start with life before kindergarten, then life during grade school, then junior high, then high school, and then college. Now, I very much dislike boasting, so I'm going to tell you stories, by and large, of events in which I did some dumb things and good friends picked me up.<br><br>How do we qualify as a good friend? How may we be a good friend to others on a constant basis? I believe a true friend is a person who will bring out the best in us. We can have friends who do not bring out the best in us. I hope we all have friends who lift us up. We all need to be lifted in life.<br><br>My first story involves a time when I was three and a half years of age. My mother called to me and said, "Lee, hurry up and get ready for church."<br><br>I was very defensive and said, "I do not want to go to church."<br><br>She said, "But Jesus wants you to."<br><br>I defiantly stated, "I never see Him there."<br><br>Well, it is funny, but my mother wasn't amused. She knew her work was cut out for her, and she started reading from a book that she had had when she was a small girl--the same book that President Hinckley had had when he was the same age as my mother. Their mothers read to them.<br><br>This is a book that I still have. Light blue and dog-eared, it's entitled The Life of Our Lord, and it was a beautiful book, especially when Mother read.<br><br>I remember that she placed a beautiful picture of the Savior over the piano in our living room as a constant reminder, and I have loved that picture. When my mother passed away, we hung the picture on the wall in our family room. Oh, how I love my family: my mother and father, my grandparents, and my many relatives. Eight of my 10 children are here, and one is in Detroit and one is in Baltimore. I know I love all of them more because I learned to love my Savior.<br><br>Going to elementary school in the fifth grade, I did something really dumb. Just before Valentine's Day my teacher asked all of us children to make Valentine boxes out of shoeboxes. You've probably done the same thing; you might still do it today. We had white paper and white paper lace and red hearts. On Valentine's morning Mother said, "Now, Lee, you remember to give a Valentine to each one of the pupils in your class."<br><br>Well, I went to school, and before school began I started stuffing valentines into boxes, but I didn't take the advice of my mother. Have you ever done that? It's dumb, isn't it? Well, I gave a valentine to everyone except for one girl. She was obnoxious, she was mean, and she probably could have beaten up on me if she wanted to.<br><br>When it came time to tear our Valentine's boxes apart, I glanced over at the girl. She had tears rolling down her cheeks; she didn't have a single valentine. I hurt to this day that I didn't pay heed to my mother. I've noticed during the years that a lot of people need friends, true friends. And if anyone ever did, she did. I became a better friend to her, but it was too late to relieve the negative situation. May we listen to our true friends and do the right things.<br><br>Of junior high, probably like most of you, I can't remember too much. But I remember my grandfather. He was old, and he related stories to me as a small boy. I heard those stories at least three dozen times. But I tried hard to listen intently. I think I was the only one who ever listened to him. I listened because I loved him.<br><br>Well, when I got into high school, my friends and my brother and I would play basketball at the end of our barn with an old rusty rim, a homemade backboard, and a gunnysack for a net. We had fun there. One day it was very overcast, and I looked across the wet, recently plowed field and saw my little granddaddy from England trudging across the field. As he got closer I noticed that he had huge mud balls on his boots.<br><br>I went up to him, and he said, "Lee, if you will practice over and over many times, you will get good." Then he turned and went back and made larger balls of mud on his feet.<br><br>I thought, "Granddaddy, you are crazy! You came all this way just to tell me that?" But over the years I found he was a true friend. He helped me practice and practice.<br><br>He helped me when I went to college. I took a class for which I had little preparation. I was very frightened. I didn't think I could pass it, let alone get a good grade. I remembered my granddaddy's story, and I studied, believe it or not--and surprising to myself--six hours each school day. If we practice and practice, we will get good. I hope all of you students will study hard, not only the subjects that you really like but especially those that you have been avoiding. Study and study until you do well.<br><br>In high school something really special took place. One beautiful Sabbath morning my mother called upstairs to me and said, "Lee, are you ready to go to conference?"<br><br>I said, "No, I don't feel well."<br><br>Trusting me, she said, "Okay."<br><br>Well, I didn't feel bad physically, but I was really bad as far as attitude goes. It was the first time I had done that, and all during conference I couldn't read the books I loved to read. I couldn't concentrate. I wished I had gone.<br><br>Father was in the stake presidency, and once he found out what really happened, I knew that he would know I had let him down. After conference the stake presidency and Elder Mark E. Petersen and his wife came to our home. When Elder Petersen came into our living room, I could hear him; he had a strong voice. He said, "I'd like to meet your family."<br><br>Oh, I felt bad. I wished I were in my best clothes. My father introduced my good brother and my three good sisters, and Elder Petersen said, "Is this all?"<br><br>Father said, "No. I have one more son."<br><br>I then really felt badly when Elder Petersen asked, "Where is he?"<br><br>Father said, "Upstairs."<br><br>Elder Petersen said, "I would like to meet him."<br><br>I felt like leaping out of our attic window, but I decided to stay and take it. Two pairs of giant steps came up the wooden stairs. When Elder Petersen got up to the top, he looked all around. I was really shaking. He looked and saw all the marine specimens I had on my shelves, all the books I had purchased, and my microscope. He saw my little room that I had turned into a lab of study. Then, instead of calling me to repentance, he very kindly said, "Lee." And in that powerful voice he said, "What are you going to do with all of this?"<br><br>I could hardly talk, and I said, "I would like to be a marine biologist."<br><br>He said, "What do you mean, 'like to'? Are you?"<br><br>A powerful lesson was learned. There is a big difference between liking to accomplish something and doing it--a big difference. I tell that story often to students. It can mean the difference between trying to reach the celestial kingdom and qualifying for it. It can mean graduating from BYU--not just trying, but doing it. It can mean getting a master's degree. It can mean getting a PhD. Oh, how Elder Petersen helped me. He helped me through the tough times.<br><br>Now I'd like to focus on the time I've been here. I'm no spring chicken; I've been teaching here since 1964. I've learned some important things. I have learned to be kind to everyone wherever I go, but especially here at BYU. I have learned that it really pays to make friends with as many professors, administrators, staff, physical plant people, and even custodians as I can. Some of my best friends at BYU are found scattered all over the campus. I wish I had more time to get into more buildings and make more friends.<br><br>Friends are really important, and, as a professor, I truly believe that it is very important to be friends with students. When I first started teaching at BYU, one of the senior faculty members counseled me. He said, "Never get too close to your students or they won't work as hard." Well, I really like that professor, and I tried to follow his advice, but in time I found that he was wrong--very wrong. If I become a friend to my students, they work more, not less.<br><br>One day, just after I started teaching at BYU, an aunt of mine who was like a second mother to me posed a question: "Lee, do you give all of your students A's?"<br><br>I said, "Of course not. They don't all earn A's."<br><br>And she said, "If you taught well enough, they would get A's."<br><br>Wow, I'd never thought of that before. I didn't believe her at first. Then, as I got a little bit older and a bit wiser--the older part came easy, the wiser part was difficult--I found out that if I got close to my students and required them to work hard, they would be better students. It doesn't benefit a student at all if we give that student a high grade and the student hasn't earned it. It doesn't benefit us as professors here at BYU or benefit the students if we send them off with perfect letters of recommendation when they are not at the level to earn all of the compliments given. It will be hard for our students to get into schools from that point on. And professors will lose their credibility.<br><br>I had a good friend who retired from geology a short time ago. He said, "Lee, if I had to do it over again, I would take better care of the students who are struggling." He said, "I have noticed over the years that you have done that." I have given extra help to some, but there are so many that I haven't been able to give it to all.<br><br>Let me tell you one last story--about a student I took to the Friday Harbor labs at the University of Washington. One day after fieldwork I gave the students an examination to see if they retained the names of the critters that they saw and collected. I came up to this fellow and said, "That's a great grade. You only missed six."<br><br>He said, "Dr. Braithwaite, six is the number I got right."<br><br>I started noticing him. He was very quiet. I could tell he was a troubled young man. In time I got close to him, and he related to me that when he was a small boy, he was put in charge of tending his little brother, and he got distracted by his friends. His mother came home, and she asked where his little brother was.<br><br>"Oh," it dawned on this student, "I have left him for a long time!" He and his friends and mother went searching, and the little brother was found in the ditch, drowned.<br><br>That had haunted him all those days and was still haunting him. He never smiled; he was always quiet. I thought, "What can I do to pick this student up?" Then the branch president asked me if I would select some of my students to speak and sing in sacrament meeting, and I thought, "I will ask this student to sing." I had heard him sing to himself, and he had a beautiful voice. So he sang "I Know That My Redeemer Lives." Everyone in the congregation had tears running down their face. I did, too. From that time on that young man was accepted by the students. He was a hero. He had many good friends.<br><br>Brothers and sisters, good friends are so important to each of us. May we be true friends and lift up as many as we can. May we do this with the spirit that President Hinckley so beautifully extends to us. May we follow our prophet perfectly. May we follow our Father in Heaven as perfectly as possible. May we follow our Savior the very best we can. May we be good friends, true friends. May we not disappoint our families and our friends as we sojourn here at BYU and after. I say these things from my heart and in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><em>Lee F. Braithwaite was a BYU professor of integrative biology when this devotional address was given on 13 September 2005.</em><br><br>© Brigham Young University. All rights reserved.

<h1>on of the Joseph F. Smith Building - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
It is a wonderful thing we do in honoring the memory of President Joseph F. Smith as we dedicate the magnificent new building that carries his name.<br><br>He was the sixth president of the Church. I am the 15th, and I feel like a pygmy when I think of standing in the same circle with him. I have felt to talk about him in this gathering with the hope that each one here might profit from his life and words. Much of what I say will be familiar to many of you, but it bears repeating.<br><br>He was the last president of the Church who was personally acquainted with the Prophet Joseph. He was, of course, a nephew of the Prophet, and the son of Hyrum Smith, Joseph's esteemed older brother. Of his familiarity with the Prophet he said on one occasion:<br><br><i>As a child I knew the Prophet Joseph Smith. As a child I have listened to him preach the gospel that God had committed to his charge and care. As a child I was</i> [as] <i>familiar in his home, in his household, as I was familiar under my own father's roof. I have retained the witness of the Spirit that I was imbued with, as a child, and that I received from my sainted mother, the firm belief that Joseph Smith was a prophet of God; that he was inspired as no other man in his generation, or for centuries before, had been inspired; that he had been chosen of God to lay the foundations of God's Kingdom.</i> [<i>GD,</i> 493]<br><br>Joseph F. Smith was born at Far West, Missouri, November 13, 1838. This was a terrible season in the history of this Church. The Prophet and Hyrum with others were cast into that foul dungeon prison known as Liberty Jail. His mother's home was searched and ransacked by the brutal mob that killed and threatened and finally forced our people to leave and, in winter weather, go east across most of the state of Missouri and then across the Mississippi to Quincy, Illinois, where they were afforded temporary hospitality.<br><br>In Nauvoo they enjoyed a brief respite from persecution. Then it raised its ugly fangs again. As a little boy of five, he watched his father and the Prophet mount their horses for the ride to Carthage and to death.<br><br>Hyrum, his father, reached down and lifted little Joseph. He affectionately held him in his arms and kissed him for the last time in mortality.<br><br>Joseph never forgot the night when a man knocked on his mother's window and said, "Sister Smith, your husband has been killed." The image of his weeping mother, now widowed, remained with him throughout his life. Nor did he ever forget his mother's faith in the face of adversity.<br><br>His mother did not have the means to go with the first group that left Nauvoo. She went later, and her son told of the time when she and her brother, also named Joseph Fielding, and the little boy Joseph, then a mere child, drove their wagons down to St. Joseph, Missouri, to buy provisions for the long journey ahead. On their return to Winter Quarters they camped for the night. During the night two of their oxen disappeared. Men with a herd of cattle were about three-quarters of a mile away. Joseph and his uncle searched all through the morning looking for their lost oxen. Exhausted and wet to the skin, they returned to their wagons to report their inability to find the oxen.<br><br>Joseph F. Smith recorded:<br><br><i>As I approached I saw my mother kneeling down in prayer. I halted for a moment and then drew gently near enough to hear her pleading with the Lord not to suffer us to be left in this helpless condition, but to lead us to recover our lost team, that we might continue our travels in safety. When she arose from her knees I was standing near by. The first expression I caught upon her precious face was a lovely smile, which, discouraged as I was, gave me renewed hope and assurance that I had not felt before.</i> [In Preston Nibley, <i>The Presidents of the Church</i> (Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1974), 185]<br><br>His uncle told her that the oxen were lost and that there was no way to find them. They had searched everywhere. She replied that he and Joseph should eat their breakfast that she had prepared. She then began to walk in a new direction. Seeing her, the chief herdsman of the cattle rode up to her and said:<br><br><i>"Madam, I saw your oxen over yonder in that direction this morning about daybreak," pointing in the opposite direction from that in which</i> [she] <i>was going.</i> [In Nibley, <i>Presidents,</i> 186]<br><br>She totally disregarded him and continued to walk in the opposite direction from which he had directed her. She came directly to what she was looking for. There were her oxen down by a little stream fastened to a clump of willows.<br><br>That example of his mother's tremendous faith became the rootstock of his own faith.<br><br>In the spring of 1848 they set out for the valley of the Great Salt Lake. Joseph, then a nine-year-old boy, drove an ox team on that long and difficult journey.<br><br>One day while on that journey, one of their oxen suddenly stopped, dropped to its knees, and rolled over, apparently dying. Those who looked on declared the animal dead.<br><br>His mother searched through her belongings and found a bottle of consecrated oil. She asked the brethren to anoint and bless the oxen. They did so. Miraculously he came alive, gathered up his legs, rose to his full stature, and moved forward as if nothing had happened. (See Nibley, <i>Presidents,</i> 188.)<br><br>They arrived in the valley in September of 1848. Four years later, in 1852, Mary Fielding Smith passed away. Joseph was now left an orphan--not yet 14 years of age. Not long after, he discontinued school, receiving no more formal education for the remainder of his life. Yet he became one of the most eloquent speakers this Church has ever known.<br><br>At the age of 15 he was ordained an elder and called on a mission to the Hawaiian Islands. Much of the time he labored alone. He had no money. Concerning this discouraging time, he later said:<br><br><i>I was almost naked and entirely friendless, except</i> [for] <i>the friendship of a poor, benighted, degraded people. I felt as if I was so debased in my condition of poverty, lack of intelligence and knowledge, just a boy, that I hardly dared look a ... man in the face.</i><br><br><i>While in that condition I dreamed</i> [one night] <i>that I was on a journey, and I was impressed that I ought to hurry--hurry with all my might, for fear I might be too late. I rushed on my way as fast as I possibly could, and I was only conscious of having just a little bundle, a handkerchief with a small bundle wrapped in it. ... I came to a wonderful mansion. ... It seemed too large, too great to have been made by hand, but I thought I knew that was my destination. As I passed towards it, as fast as I could, I saw a notice</i> [that read], <i>"Bath." I turned aside quickly and went into the bath and washed myself clean. I opened up this little bundle that I had, and there was a pair of white, clean garments, ... and I put them on. Then I rushed to what appeared to be a great opening, or door. I knocked and the door opened, and the man who stood there was the Prophet Joseph Smith. He looked at me a little reprovingly, and the first words he said</i> [were]: <i>"Joseph, you are late."...</i><br><br>[I replied,] <i>"Yes, but I am clean--I am clean!"</i><br><br><i>He clasped my hand and drew me in, then closed the great door. I felt his hand just as tangible as I ever felt the hand of man. I knew him, and when I entered I saw my father, and Brigham and Heber, and Willard, and other good men that I had known, standing in a row. ... My mother was there....</i><br><br><i>When I awoke that morning</i> [alone, away up in the mountains of Hawaii] <i>I was a man, although only a boy. There was not anything in the world that I feared. I could meet any man or woman or child and look them in the face, feeling in my soul that I was a man every whit. That vision, that manifestation and witness that I enjoyed at that time has made me what I am, if I am anything that is good, or clean, or upright before the Lord, if there is anything good in me. That has helped me out in every trial and through every difficulty....</i><br><br><i>...I felt as if I had been lifted out of a slum, out of a despair, out of the wretched condition that I was in; and naked as I was, or as nearly as I was, I was not afraid of any ... man ..., and I have not been very much afraid of anybody else since that time. I know that that was a reality, to show me my duty, to teach me something, and to impress upon me something that I cannot forget. I hope it never can be banished from my mind.</i> [<i>GD,</i> 542–43]<br><br>He subsequently served as a missionary in the British Isles. While laboring in Sheffield, he was present in a meeting when William Fowler asked that the choir sing the hymn he had just composed. That hymn was "We Thank Thee, O God, for a Prophet" (<i>Hymns,</i> 1985, no. 19).<br><br>When he was only 27 years of age, Brigham Young ordained him an Apostle and called him as a counselor to the First Presidency.<br><br>He served as a counselor to Brigham Young, John Taylor, Wilford Woodruff, and Lorenzo Snow--the only man to serve as counselor to four presidents of the Church. Joseph F. Smith became president of the Church on October 17, 1901. He served for 17 years, dying November 19, 1918, at the age of 80.<br><br>It is my opinion that no man, save the Prophet Joseph only, has had a greater and better understanding of the origin and history of the Church and of its doctrines--not only concerning this life but also concerning the eternities. There have been other great exponents, but I think none has had a broader or deeper understanding, nor spoken so eloquently concerning these matters.<br><br>He spoke of true education, the kind we hope is imparted at this university. Said he:<br><br><i>The mere stuffing of the mind with a knowledge of facts is not education. The mind must not only possess a knowledge of truth, but the soul must revere it, cherish it, love it as a priceless gem; and this human life must be guided and shaped by it in order to fulfil its destiny. The mind should not only be charged with intelligence, but the soul should be filled with admiration and desire for pure intelligence which comes of a knowledge of the truth. The truth can only make him free who hath it, and will continue in it. And the word of God is truth, and it will endure forever.</i><br><br><i>Educate yourself not only for time, but also for eternity.</i> [<i>GD,</i> 269]<br><br>To provide this kind of education the Church maintains this university with a great infusion of its resources. It demonstrates to all the world that the acquisition of secular knowledge is important, but just as important is the acquisition of spiritual truth.<br><br>President Joseph F. Smith had an understanding of the eternal nature of man that few others have ever possessed. As a member of the Quorum of the Twelve, I participated in the motion to include in the Doctrine and Covenants section 138--the vision of President Smith in 1918. It is a document without parallel. Let me read just a small portion of it. Said he:<br><br><i>On the third of October, in the year nineteen hundred and eighteen, I sat in my room pondering over the scriptures;</i><br><br><i>And reflecting upon the great atoning sacrifice that was made by the Son of God, for the redemption of the world;</i><br><br><i>And the great and wonderful love made manifest by the Father and the Son in the coming of the Redeemer into the world;</i><br><br><i>That through his atonement, and by obedience to the principles of the gospel, mankind might be saved....</i><br><br><i>As I pondered over these things ..., the eyes of my understanding were opened, and the Spirit of the Lord rested upon me, and I saw the hosts of the dead, both small and great.</i><br><br><i>And there were gathered together in one place an innumerable company of the spirits of the just, who had been faithful in the testimony of Jesus while they lived in mortality;</i><br><br><i>And who had offered sacrifice in the similitude of the great sacrifice of the Son of God, and had suffered tribulation in their Redeemer's name.</i><br><br><i>All these had departed the mortal life, firm in the hope of a glorious resurrection, through the grace of God the Father and his Only Begotten Son, Jesus Christ.</i><br><br><i>I beheld that they were filled with joy and gladness, and were rejoicing together because the day of their deliverance was at hand.</i> [D&amp;amp;C 138:1–4, 11–15]<br><br>And then he went on to speak of his vision of the redemption of the dead, setting forth the deep and eternal meaning of the Atonement of the Redeemer. There is nothing quite like it in all of our sacred literature.<br><br>Suffice it to say that no man, save the Prophet only, has spoken in the defense, advocacy, and explanation of this work more eloquently and more persuasively than Joseph F. Smith, in whose name we dedicate this building today.<br><br>President Heber J. Grant, who succeeded him in the presidency, said at his funeral:<br><br><i>No man that ever lived had a more powerful testimony of the living God and of our Redeemer than Joseph F. Smith. ... I loved Joseph F. Smith as I never loved any other man that I have ever known. May God bless his memory.</i> [In Nibley, <i>Presidents, </i>208–9]<br><br>To which I add my testimony--based on my study of his life and my reading of his sermons--that he was a man of unshakable courage in the face of adversity, of industry and devotion, and of faith and knowledge concerning this great Latter-day work of the Redeemer. It is proper that this wonderful new building carry the name of this remarkable man. Of this I testify, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br>I now invite all of you to bow your heads and close your eyes as we offer a prayer of dedication on the Joseph F. Smith Building.<br><h2><b>Dedicatory Prayer</b></h2><br>O God, our Eternal Father, we bow our heads in love and gratitude on the occasion of the dedication of the Joseph F. Smith Building on the Brigham Young University campus.<br><br>We thank Thee for him whose name it bears, for his integrity, for his great devotion, and for his remarkable faith. He served as sixth president of the Church, the son of Hyrum Smith and a nephew of the Prophet Joseph Smith. He was undeviating in his testimony of Thy living reality and of that of Thy Beloved Son, our Redeemer. He was a man of practical wisdom and industry, of work and study, with an appreciation for the temporal aspects of life. His mind likewise reached into the depths of the things of eternity, the great spiritual architecture of Thy divine and eternal plan. Great was his wisdom, great his understanding of things both of life and eternity.<br><br>Orphaned as a boy, he served Thee with faith and courage, with industry and love throughout his life. How fitting it is therefore that this beautiful new facility on this campus should carry his name.<br><br>And so, acting in the authority of the holy priesthood in us vested, and in the name of Jesus Christ, our Redeemer, we dedicate and consecrate this structure. We dedicate it to the accomplishment of Thy divine purposes. We dedicate it as a place for teaching and learning, for pondering and reflecting on the wonders of the world in which we live and on the eternal verities of life.<br><br>We pray that all who use this facility may do so with appreciation and gratitude for the consecrations of Thy people throughout the world who have made this possible. We pray that the instructors who serve here may feel Thy inspiration in their sacred work of education. We pray that the minds of their students may be enlightened and their intellects sharpened as they partake of the knowledge here to be obtained.<br><br>These facilities will be used not only for weekday university education but also for instruction and worship on the Sabbath. It will house wards and stakes in their appointed activities. We pray that the truths of the restored gospel may ring forth from the pulpits of this building. We pray that testimony and a witness of the truth may be experienced and spoken in these halls in Sunday worship. We pray that pleasant sociality may be maintained and here nurtured.<br><br>Father, we are grateful for this unique and beautiful structure, designed with unusual features that speak of the glories of the universe and of Thine overruling hand. With thanksgiving unto Thee, we thus dedicate and consecrate this structure to the many purposes for which it will be used and to Thy glory and to Thine honor in the spirit of this university where young men and women come to learn and from where they go forth to serve in all the world.<br><br>We do so humbly and gratefully to Thy glory, and to the glory of Thy Beloved Son, in His sacred name, even the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Gordon B. Hinckley was president of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when this dedication service was heldat BYU on 20 September 2005.</i><br><br><i>© Intellectual Reserve, Inc.

<br>
One of the hardest, and I think the most important, realities of history to convey to students or readers of books or viewers of television documentaries is that nothing ever had to happen the way it happened. Any great past event could have gone off in any number of different directions for any number of different reasons. We should understand that history was never on a track. It was never preordained that it would turn out as it did.<br><br>Very often we are taught history as if it were predetermined, and if that way of teaching begins early enough and is sustained through our education, we begin to think that it had to have happened as it did. We think that there had to have been a Revolutionary War, that there had to have been a Declaration of Independence, that there had to have been a Constitution, but never was that so. In history, chance plays a part again and again. Character counts over and over. Personality is often the determining factor in why things turn out the way they do.<br><br>Furthermore, nobody ever lived in the past. Jefferson, Adams, George Washington--they didn't walk around saying, "Isn't this fascinating living in the past? Aren't we picturesque in our funny clothes?" They were living in the present, just as we do. The great difference is that it was their present, not ours. And just as we don't know how things are going to turn out, they didn't either.<br><br>We can know about the years that preceded us and about the people who preceded us. And if we love our country--if we love the blessings of a society that welcomes free speech, freedom of religion, and, most important of all, freedom to think for ourselves--then surely we ought to know how it came to be. Who was responsible? What did they do? How much did they contribute? How much did they suffer?<br><br>Abigail Adams, writing one of her many letters to her husband, John, who was off in Philadelphia working to put the Declaration of Independence through Congress, wrote, "Posterity who are to reap the blessings, will scarcely be able to conceive the hardships and sufferings of their ancestors."&amp;lt;<sup>1</sup> Alas, she was right. We do not conceive what they went through.<br><br>We tend to see them--Adams, Jefferson, Thomas Paine, Benjamin Rush, George Washington--as figures in a costume pageant; that is often the way they're portrayed. And we tend to see them as much older than they were because we're seeing them in the portraits by Gilbert Stuart and others when they were truly the Founding Fathers--when they were president or chief justice of the Supreme Court and their hair, if it hadn't turned white, was powdered white. We see the awkward teeth. We see the elder statesmen.<br><br>At the time of the Revolution, they were all young. It was a young man's–young woman's cause. George Washington took command of the Continental Army in the summer of 1775 at the age of 43. He was the oldest of them. Adams was 40. Jefferson was all of 33 when he wrote the Declaration of Independence. Benjamin Rush--who was the leader of the antislavery movement at the time, who introduced the elective system into higher education in this country, who was the first to urge the humane treatment of patients in mental hospitals--was 30 years old when he signed the Declaration of Independence. Furthermore, none of them had any prior experience in revolutions; they weren't experienced revolutionaries who'd come in to take part in this biggest of all events. They were winging it. They were improvising.<br><br>George Washington had never commanded an army in battle before. He'd served with some distinction in the French and Indian War with the colonial troops who were fighting with the British Army, but he'd never commanded an army in battle before. And he'd never commanded a siege, which is what he took charge of at Boston, where the rebel troops--the "rabble in arms"<sup>2</sup> as the British called them--had the British penned in inside Boston.<br><br>Washington wasn't chosen by his fellow members of the Continental Congress because he was a great military leader. He was chosen because they knew him; they knew the kind of man he was; they knew his character, his integrity.<br><br>George Washington is the first of our political generals--a very important point about Washington. And we've been very lucky in our political generals. By political generals, I don't mean to suggest that is a derogatory or dismissive term. They are political in the sense that they understand how the system works, that they, as commander in chief, are not the boss. Washington reported to Congress. And no matter how difficult it was, how frustrating it was, how maddening it could be for Washington to get Congress to do what so obviously needed to be done to sustain his part in the fight, he never lost patience with them. He always played by the rule.<br><br>Washington was not, as were Adams, Jefferson, Franklin, and Hamilton, a learned man. He was not an intellectual. Nor was he a powerful speaker like his fellow Virginian Patrick Henry. What Washington was, above all, was a leader. He was a man people would follow. And as events would prove, he was a man whom some--a few--would follow through hell.<br><br>Don't get the idea that all of those who marched off to serve under Washington were heroes. They deserted the army by the hundreds, by the thousands as time went on. When their enlistments came up, they would up and go home just as readily as can be, feeling they had served sufficiently and they needed to be back home to support their families, who in many cases were suffering tremendously for lack of income or even food. But those who stayed with him stayed because they would not abandon this good man, as some of them said.<br><br>What Washington had, it seems to me, is phenomenal courage--physical courage and moral courage. He had high intelligence; if he was not an intellectual or an educated man, he was very intelligent. He was a quick learner--and a quick learner from his mistakes. He made dreadful mistakes, particularly in the year 1776. They were almost inexcusable, inexplicable mistakes, but he always learned from them. And he never forgot what the fight was about--"the glorious cause of America," as they called it. Washington would not give up; he would not quit.<br><br>When he took command of the Continental Army at Cambridge in the summer of 1775, Washington had probably 14,000 troops. And from those troops and from the officers who were there at the time when he arrived, he selected two men as the best he had. Here is another aspect of his leadership that must not be overlooked or underestimated: Washington was a great judge of other people's ability and capacity to stay where the fighting was the toughest and to never give up. He picked out Nathanael Greene and Henry Knox.<br><br>Nathanael Greene was a Quaker with a limp from a childhood injury. He knew no more of the military than what he had read in books, and he was made a major general at 33 years of age. Henry Knox was 25. He was a Boston bookseller. He was a big, fat, garrulous, keenly intelligent man who, like Greene, had only about the equivalent of a fifth-grade education but had never stopped reading. He, too, knew of the military only what he had read in books. But keep in mind that this was occurring in the 18th century, their present. It was the Age of Enlightenment, an era when it was widely understood that if you wanted to know something, a good way to learn was to read books--a very radical idea to many in our day and age.<br><br>Those two men were quintessential New Englanders. Greene was from Rhode Island and Knox had grown up in Boston. Washington had discovered very soon after arriving in New England that he ardently disliked New Englanders, so to single out these two, he also overcame a personal bias.<br><br>To skip far ahead, let me point out that Nathanael Greene and Henry Knox, along with Washington, were to be the only general officers in the Revolutionary War who stayed until the very end. So Washington's judgment could not have been better. Nathanael Greene turned out to be the best general we had, and I'm including Washington in that lineup--Greene, the Quaker with a limp, the man who knew nothing but what he had read in books, who, like Washington, learned from his mistakes.<br><br>Let's not forget what a war it was--eight and a half years, the longest war in our history, except for Vietnam. Twenty-five thousand Americans were killed. That doesn't sound like very much to those of us who have been bludgeoned, who have been numbed by the horrible statistics of war in the 20th or 21st centuries. This was 1 percent of the American population of 2.5 million. It was a lot. If we were to fight for our independence today and the war were equally costly, there would be more than 3 million of us killed. It was a long, bloody, costly war.<br><br>And as it wore on in the year 1776, we suffered one defeat after another. At Brooklyn--a huge battle over an area of six miles with 40,000 soldiers involved--we were soundly defeated. We were made to look foolish. We were outsmarted, outflanked, outgeneraled, outnumbered. Some of us were immensely heroic, but we never had a chance.<br><br>But then, in a miraculous escape from Brooklyn Heights on the night of Oct. 29, we got back across the East River and were saved. It was the Dunkirk of the Revolution. If the wind had been in the other direction that night or the two or three nights preceding it, there's not much question that the war would have been over then because Washington and 9,000 American troops would have been captured. If the British had been able to bring their warships up into the East River, between Brooklyn and Manhattan, they would have had us right in the trap. But because there was a howling storm out of the northeast, they weren't able to do that.<br><br>Washington ordered that every possible small craft be rounded up and be made ready to bring the army back to New York. It was to be done at night. An organized retreat for an experienced army is the most difficult maneuver of all when faced by a superior force. But for this amateur pick-up team, this rude, crude, un-uniformed, undisciplined, untrained American army of farm boys--some of whom had been given a musket and told to march off only a few weeks before--for that kind of an army to make a successful retreat across water at night, right in the face of the enemy without the enemy knowing, was a virtual impossibility. And yet they did it.<br><br>When they went down to the shores of the East River, right where the Brooklyn Bridge now stands, to start the crossing, the same wind that was keeping the British from bringing their fleet up was keeping the river too rough for them to make the crossing. It looked as though they weren't going to be able to pull it off. Then, all of a sudden, almost like the parting of the waters, the wind stopped. The makeshift armada started going back and forth, back and forth, all night long, ferrying men, horses, cannon--everything--back across the river to New York. And they succeeded. Nineteen thousand men and all their equipment--horses, cannon, and the rest--were taken across the river that night without the loss of a single man and without the British ever knowing it.<br><br>I wanted to write about that event, the reality of what happened there, as much as anything else in my book <i>1776</i>. It shows so much that we need to understand. First of all, it was said right away that the hand of God had intervened in behalf of the American cause. Others trying to interpret what had happened used the words <i>Providence</i> or <i>chance.</i> But it couldn't have happened only because of chance or the hand of God. It also required people of skill and experience with the nerve to try it.<br><br>That escape was organized and led by a man named John Glover from Marblehead, Mass., and his Marblehead Mariners--fishermen, sailors who knew how to handle small boats. During the crossing--and the East River can be a treacherous place to cross, even in the best of conditions--boats were loaded down so that the gunwales were only a few inches above the water. No running lights, no motors, no cell phones to talk back and forth. And they did it. It was character and circumstance in combination that succeeded.<br><br>The men were totally demoralized. They had been defeated; they were soaking wet; they were cold; they were hungry. They lost again pathetically at Kip's Bay. They lost again in the great battle of Fort Washington, when nearly 3,000 of our troops and all of their equipment were taken captive.<br><br>By the time Washington started his long retreat across New Jersey, they were down to only a few thousand men. Probably a quarter of the army were too sick to fight, victims of smallpox, typhoid, typhus, and, worst of all, camp fever, or epidemic dysentery. Men deserted, men defected--went over to the enemy by the hundreds. Or they just disappeared, they just went away, never heard from again. By the time Washington was halfway across New Jersey, he had all of 3,000 men.<br><br>We are taught to honor and celebrate those great men who wrote and voted for the Declaration of Independence in Philadelphia. But none of what they committed themselves to--their lives, their fortunes, their sacred honor--none of those noble words about life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, about all men being created equal, none of that would have been worth any more than the paper it was written on had it not been for those who were fighting to make it happen. We must remember them, too, and especially those who seem nameless: Jabez Fitch and Joseph Hodgkins; little John Greenwood, who was all of 16 years old; and Israel Trask, who was 10 years old. There were boys marching with the troops as fifers or drummers or messenger boys, not just Nathanael Greene and Henry Knox and John Glover and George Washington. And they were in rags--they were in worse than rags. The troops had no winter clothing. The stories of men leaving bloody footprints in the snow are true--that's not mythology.<br><br>Washington was trying to get his army across the Delaware River, to put the river between his army and the oncoming British army, which was very well equipped, very well fed, very well trained--the best troops in the world led by an extremely able officer, Cornwallis. On they were coming, and they were going to end the war. But Washington felt that if he could just get across the river, get what men he had left over on the Pennsylvania shore on the western side, destroy any boats the British might use to come chasing across the river, that they'd have time to collect themselves and maybe get some extra support. Again they went across at night. Again it was John Glover and his men who made it happen. They lit huge bonfires on the Pennsylvania side of the river to light the crossing.<br><br>The next morning a unit from Pennsylvania rode in--militiamen, among whom was a young officer named Charles Willson Peale, the famous painter. He walked among these ragged troops of Washington's who had made the escape across from New Jersey and wrote about it in his diary. He said he'd never seen such miserable human beings in all his life--starving, exhausted, filthy. One man in particular he thought was just the most wretched human being he had ever laid eyes on. He described how the man's hair was all matted and how it hung down over his shoulders. The man was naked except for what they called a blanket coat. His feet were wrapped in rags, his face all covered with sores from sickness. Peale was studying him when, all of a sudden, he realized that the man was his own brother.<br><br>I think we should feel that they were all our brothers, those brave 3,000, and remember what they went through, just as Abigail Adams stressed in her letter. And that they didn't quit!<br><br>Washington took stock, just as the British army was taking stock, of the situation, as were most every officer and all of the politicians, many of whom had fled from Philadelphia by this time. It seemed clear that the British were heading for Philadelphia and there was nothing to stop them. Most everybody concluded that the war was over and we had lost. It was the only rational conclusion one could come to. There wasn't a chance. So Washington did what you sometimes have to do when everything is lost and all hope is gone. He attacked.<br><br>They went up the river nine miles to McKonkey's Ferry on Christmas night. They crossed the Delaware, famously portrayed in the great painting <i>Washington Crossing the Delaware,</i> which as everyone knows is inaccurate in many ways. But it does portray with drama and force what was one of the most important turning points, not just in the history of the war, but in the history of our country and, consequently, of the world. He had the nerve, the courage, the faith in the cause to carry the war once more to the enemy. After the crossing, they marched nine miles back down the river on the eastern side and struck at Trenton the next morning.<br><br>The worst part of the whole night was not the crossing, as bad as it was. The worst part was the march through the night. Again a northeaster was blowing, and again that northeaster was beneficial to our cause because it muffled the noise of the crossing and the noise of the march south. But it also increased by geometric proportions the misery of the troops. It was very cold. What the wind chill factor must have been can only be imagined. It was so cold that two men froze to death on the march because they had no winter clothing.<br><br>They struck at Trenton the next morning. It was a fierce, house-to-house, savage battle. It was small in scale but very severe. It was all over in about 45 minutes, and we won. For the first time, we defeated the enemy at their own profession.<br><br>Now it wasn't a great battle like Brooklyn. But its consequences were enormous, beyond reckoning. Because of the psychological effect, it transformed the attitude of the army and of much of the country toward the war. It was a turning point. They struck again at Princeton a few days later and won there too--again by surprise, again after marching through the night, again taking the most daring possible route, risking all and winning.<br><br>In conclusion I want to share a scene that took place on the last day of the year of 1776, Dec. 31. All the enlistments for the entire army were up. Every soldier, because of the system at the time, was free to go home as of the first day of January 1777. Washington called a large part of the troops out into formation. He appeared in front of these ragged men on his horse, and he urged them to reenlist. He said that if they would sign up for another six months, he'd give them a bonus of 10 dollars. It was an enormous amount then because that's about what they were being paid for a month--if and when they could get paid. These were men who were desperate for pay of any kind. Their families were starving.<br><br>The drums rolled, and he asked those who would stay on to step forward. The drums kept rolling, and nobody stepped forward. Washington turned and rode away from them. Then he stopped, and he turned back and rode up to them again. This is what we know he said:<br><br><i>My brave fellows, you have done all I asked you to do, and more than could be reasonably expected, but your country is at stake, your wives, your houses, and all that you hold dear. You have worn yourselves out with fatigues and hardships, but we know not how to spare you. If you will consent to stay one month longer, you will render that service to the cause of liberty, and to your country, which you can probably never do under any other circumstance.</i><sup>3</sup><br><br>Again the drums rolled. This time the men began stepping forward. "God Almighty," wrote Nathanael Greene, "inclined their hearts to listen to the proposal and they engaged anew."<sup>4</sup><br><br>Now that is an amazing scene, to say the least, and it's real. This wasn't some contrivance of a screenwriter. However, I believe there is something very familiar about what Washington said to those troops. It was as if he was saying, "You are fortunate. You have a chance to serve your country in a way that nobody else is going to be able to, and everybody else is going to be jealous of you, and you will count this the most important decision and the most valuable service of your lives." Now doesn't that have a familiar ring? Isn't it very like the speech of <i>Henry V</i> in Shakespeare's play Henry V: "We few, we happy few, we band of brothers . . . And gentlemen in England now a-bed / Shall think themselves accursed they were not here"?<sup>5</sup> Washington loved the theater; Washington loved Shakespeare. I can't help but feel that he was greatly influenced.<br><br>He was also greatly influenced, as they all were, by the classical ideals of the Romans and the Greeks. The history they read was the history of Greece and Rome. And while Washington and Knox and Greene, not being educated men, didn't read Greek and Latin as Adams and Jefferson did, they knew the play <i>Cato,</i> and they knew about Cincinnatus. They knew that Cincinnatus had stepped forward to save his country in its hour of peril and then, after the war was over, returned to the farm. Washington, the political general, had never forgotten that Congress was boss. When the war was at last over, Washington, in one of the most important events in our entire history, turned back his command to Congress--a scene portrayed in a magnificent painting by John Trumbull that hangs in the rotunda of our national Capitol. When George III heard that George Washington might do this, he said that "if he does, he will be the greatest man in the world."<br><br>So what does this tell us? That the original decision of the Continental Congress was the wise one. They knew the man, they knew his character, and he lived up to his reputation.<br><br>I hope very much that those of you who are studying history here will pursue it avidly, with diligence, with attention. I hope you do this not just because it will make you a better citizen, and it will; not just because you will learn a great deal about human nature and about cause and effect in your own lives, as well as the life of the nation, which you will; but as a source of strength, as an example of how to conduct yourself in difficult times--and we live in very difficult times, very uncertain times. But I hope you also find history to be a source of pleasure. Read history for pleasure as you would read a great novel or poetry or go to see a great play.<br><br>And I hope when you read about the American Revolution and the reality of those people that you will never think of them again as just figures in a costume pageant or as gods. They were not perfect; they were imperfect--that's what's so miraculous. They rose to the occasion as very few generations ever have.<br><br><i>David McCullough, two-time Pulitzer-Prize-winning author of </i>1776<i> and </i>John Adams,<i> gave this forum assembly address at BYU on 27 September 2005.</i><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>1.

<h1>to Make a Difference - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Today as I stand before you, I am humbled by the invitation to share my thoughts and bear my testimony of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ. It has been mentioned that I am in my 31st year here at Brigham Young University, and I can truly say that this opportunity to address you has never been on my radar screen. Indeed, I have comfortably sat in the audience for more than three decades now and have never ceased to be inspired each week by the music and the spoken word. Rosalind, your selection today was marvelous, and the choir has set the tone and tenor of the message that I wish to share with you.<br><br>First let me tell you marvelous students how awed I am to be in your presence. Do you know who you are? You come to this university from all 50 states and from 120 countries around the world. You come from big cities and small towns, from farms and foreign capitols. Seventy-five percent of the young men and 12 percent of the young women have served missions throughout the world for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Almost three-quarters of this student body speak fluently a language other than English. You are literally an "army of God" in that most of you have given two years of your life to preach, teach, testify, and expound on the life and mission of the Only Begotten of the Father, the Redeemer of the World, the Lamb of God, our Lord and Master, Jesus Christ. You have given freely of your time, energy, talents, and resources to declare to the world that He lives!<br><br>You are as bright and talented as any students we have ever had at this great university. Your college boards and your grade point averages rank you among the best college students on any university campus in America. Year after year you place BYU in the top 10 universities in the land for students who go on to obtain advanced degrees. You are highly sought after by recruiters in science and industry. You later become our bishops and stake presidents, our Relief Society and Young Women presidents. You are schooled in the gospel of Jesus Christ, and His image is in your countenance. You are obedient to the laws and commandments of our Father in Heaven; you have exercised faith in the redemption of Him who created you; you have experienced "a<b></b>change of heart." You "have felt to sing the song of redeeming love," and, like Alma, I would ask, "Can ye feel so now?" (Alma 5:26).<br><br>In 1997, while building a deck on my home, I received a call from a stake president who resides in Argentina. He had dropped by the athletic department and wanted to visit with me about our swimming program and the possibility of athletic scholarships for swimmers from his stake. I told him that I was quite dirty from the construction project I was working on, but if he would come to my home on Sunday, I would be glad to visit with him.<br><br>When he arrived he brought with him a young former bishop from his stake who was at that time doing graduate work at BYU and was to act as his translator. A few days earlier we had participated in a sesquicentennial celebration of the arrival of the Saints into Utah. The celebration took place at what is now LaVell Edwards Stadium, and President Hinckley was in attendance and spoke to us. At the end of the evening all the missionaries from the MTC marched into the stadium. It was an electrifying moment for all of us as we realized that we have enough missionaries around the world to fill that stadium. When I asked my visitors if they had been able to attend the celebration, the young bishop responded that it was a direct fulfillment of his patriarchal blessing. He stated that his blessing received many years earlier had specified that he would study abroad and that he would behold an "army of God." As the missionaries marched in, he realized that that specific blessing had been fulfilled.<br><br>Brothers and sisters, you are in a real sense a part of that same army of God. Have you wondered why the Lord through His appointed leaders would set aside the sacred offerings of the faithful members of the Church--indeed, the "widow's mite"--to provide each of you with an opportunity to grow intellectually and spiritually? Have you wondered why He would create a sanctuary where you can develop and nurture your talents while being taught and tutored at the feet of apostles and prophets? You have been given much, and the Lord expects you to be "stripling warriors," as were the sons of Helaman.<br><br>There has never been a time in our history when you were needed more. I am convinced that you have been held in reserve for this very time when your talents, abilities, and testimonies are most needed on the earth. You can truly make a difference to this generation and greatly affect the generations to come. For some of you it will be on a public stage, and for others it will be in quiet settings where your personal influence, kind word, or example is most needed. You will be called on to raise a righteous generation, and you will draw on the powers of heaven in your efforts to overcome the world. Your greatest challenge will not be persecution or the cold and bleak conditions your ancestors faced; yours will be the challenge of success and affluence.<br><br>While you are here I hope that you will take every opportunity to match your spiritual growth and knowledge with your intellectual development. Our libraries on this campus hold millions of volumes of the collected knowledge of the civilized world. Our faculty will guide you in how to apply this knowledge to your chosen field, and the Spirit will give you the wisdom to use these tools in serving your fellowman.<br><br>Since my expertise is in coaching and mentoring young athletes, I am sometimes asked by faculty members and colleagues about what role athletics or being a member of the swimming and diving team plays in this university setting and what gospel principles are learned that are preparing students for the challenges that face this generation. Let me try to answer this question for you.<br><br>It is my experience that being a swimmer on a highly competitive team runs counter to popular culture. In a world of instant gratification and shortcuts, swimmers have to work first and wait for the results. Success comes only after the work has been done. As we compete, weaknesses in body or technique become apparent, and through hard work and diligence these weaknesses become strengths.<br><br>You must challenge yourself daily to be the best you can be. Constant effort yields perfection in a skill and a glimpse of the capacity our Heavenly Father has endowed us with. Trust and coachability are akin to faith and obedience, and, when tested, prepare you--and your confidence waxes strong. Setbacks or defeats, like victories, are never a permanent condition but rather an opportunity to gather more information to help meet oncoming challenges. Having completed the experience, you are ready to lead and be led, to use your skills to bless others.<br><br>I have always felt that my swimmers are stripling warriors. Yearly we watch them with excitement as they receive their mission calls and march forward in faith to bring the gospel message to the world. I love these young men as they return to our team. They have grown in their love for the Savior and for their fellowman. They have spent two years thinking about everyone but themselves. They know how to put their arm around a young freshman who is away from home for the first time and offer reassurance and love. We are a missionary team, and I feel that is our greatest strength.<br><br>Today I will introduce you to three former Brigham Young University swimmers who are setting examples and influencing others by how they live their lives.<br><br>The first former Cougar swimmer is Lieutenant Colonel Gary Reynolds. Gary has served as a bishop and a branch president and is a navigator on a C-130 aircraft that has been equipped for special operations and provides fire support for Army Special Forces units engaged in combat. When he showed up on the pool deck last summer during our swim camps, he told me that his experience here at BYU made all the difference in his life. He wanted me to have this coin, which you can see on the screen. Each member of his unit carries one just like it every day to remind them who they are and what they are about.<br><br>Gary's crew has served two tours in Iraq and two tours in Afghanistan. Although stationed in Florida, they have supported the 5th and 19th Army Special Forces Groups and provided lifesaving cover for these heroic soldiers. Some of you here may have fathers or other relatives that serve in the 19th Special Forces, as they are home based in Utah. Many of our local servicemen may indeed owe their lives to the fire support Gary's plane has provided.<br><br>As you can see, the engraving on the coin is based on Ephesians 6:11–18, which reads:<br><br><i>Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil.</i><br><br><i>For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.</i><br><br><i>Wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand.</i><br><br><i>Stand therefore, having your loins girt about with truth, and having on the breastplate of righteousness;</i><br><br><i>And your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace;</i><br><br><i>Above all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked.</i><br><br><i>And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God:</i><br><br><i>Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit.</i><br><br>I was deeply touched by this unit's commitment to live righteous lives so that they might be an effective tool in defending our country. Gary served his mission in Hong Kong and has served in the U.S. Air Force now for more than 20 years. Gary is still being an influence for good.<br><br>The second former swimmer I want to introduce to you is Billy Betz. Billy was named National Swimmer of the Week during his senior year but has excelled much more outside the pool in his service to others. He served his mission in El Paso, Texas, and upon returning home felt that his service was not over but just beginning. He was excited about giving Christlike service and reaching out to those in need.<br><br>He spent the first summer after his mission working at a small medical clinic in El Salvador, suturing wounds and helping to deliver babies. He was struck by the total lack of basic medical supplies and the enormous need in the local villages. Billy has always had a "can-do" attitude and used this challenge as an opportunity to make a difference. He returned home and began visiting doctors in Provo, Salt Lake City, and Logan in an effort to collect medical supplies. After buying an old van with holes in the floorboards, he and his friend drove eight days to El Salvador to deliver the much-needed supplies. The van overheated and broke down many times along the way. Finally, after much prayer, the heavens opened, and a cooling rain made their delivery possible. They were able to inoculate hundreds of children and bring desperately needed medicine and supplies to those humble villagers. The following year Billy returned with two loaded semitrucks. This time they brought an X-ray machine, a mammography machine, hospital beds, and much more. What a blessing Billy and his friends have been to the people of El Salvador.<br><br>During his senior year Billy heard of a village in Mexico that had been flooded, and he organized a relief effort with some of his friends. They collected clothing and food and with a good number of trucks and trailers delivered the provisions to the ravaged town. Billy and his bride, Amy, are now living in Southern California, where he teaches early-morning seminary. A criterion for the corporate position that he ultimately took was that he would have the time he needed to continue to make a difference.<br><br>Billy took seriously the parable of the sheep and the goats as taught by Jesus and recorded in Matthew 25:34–37, 40:<br><br><i>Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand, Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world:</i><br><br><i>For I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me in:</i><br><br><i>Naked, and ye clothed me: I was sick, and ye visited me. . . .</i><br><br><i>Then shall the righteous answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, and fed thee? or thirsty, and gave thee drink? . . .</i><br><br><i>And the King shall answer and say unto them, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me.</i><br><br>Billy's service drew national and international attention, and he became the recipient of the first-ever Coca Cola All-American Service Award and the John Wooden Cup, representing Athletes for a Better World. When I was in Southern California for the presentation of the Wooden Cup, Billy asked me to come and bear my testimony to his 6 a.m. seminary class. Not one of his students knew that Billy had been a champion athlete or that he was the recipient of the most prestigious service awards in athletics. Billy didn't need hoopla. His service and the knowledge that his offering was accepted by the Lord were all the accolades he needed.<br><br>The last former swimmer that I wish to highlight is Richard Barnes. Richard is an attorney in Salt Lake City. In 1996 he swam on our Western Athletic Conference championship team, where he was an All-Conference performer. He served in the Micronesia-Guam Mission. Some of you may have followed his story on the local news this summer. He and his brother David, an emergency room physician, were attempting to become the first-ever swimmers from the state of Utah to swim the English Channel.<br><br>Since their swims, Richard and David have been in demand for youth firesides. One of the things that Richard is quick to point out is that the Channel swim didn't start at Shakespeare Beach. In reality it started many years before in developing the work ethic and dealing with the demands of being a competitive distance swimmer. While here at BYU, Richard daily swam the equivalent of a marathon. That means four hours a day with heart rates in excess of 150 beats per minute. Later, as he and his brother prepared for the "Mount Everest" of swims, it meant putting their bodies into Jordanelle or Deer Creek Reservoir in the month of May when the water was 55 degrees and swimming for six hours. That would be enough to put most of us off. This was done in addition to their regular training so that they could prepare for the 60-degree temperatures they would face in the waters off England.<br><br>In fact, the Channel Swimming Association will not allow swimmers to attempt the crossing unless they have proven the ability to withstand at least six hours of swimming in such frigid water. They are allowed to wear a Speedo and a pair of goggles and to use some "Channel grease," a mixture of petroleum jelly and lanolin that aids in reducing the kind of chafe that rubs you raw around your neck and armpits. By the time they had pushed off the shore at Shakespeare Beach at 3:30 a.m., they had prepared as though their lives literally depended upon it. The sacrifices of time and training had been made, airline tickets had been purchased, the boats and support teams were standing by, prayers were offered, and, I submit, their confidence waxed strong in the face of the task before them because they had paid the price.<br><br>Elder Henry B. Eyring spoke in the general conference of the Church just a few weeks ago about spiritual preparedness. He said:<br><br><i>What we will need in our day of testing is a spiritual preparation. It is to have developed faith in Jesus Christ so powerful that we can pass the test of life upon which everything for us in eternity depends. . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . Learning to start early and to be steady are the keys to spiritual preparation. Procrastination and inconsistency are its mortal enemies.</i>["Spiritual Preparedness: Start Early and Be Steady,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 2005, 37, 38]<b></b><br><br>Richard and David know about such preparation.<br><br>In the priesthood session of the same conference, Elder David A. Bednar spoke of preparation as well. In giving counsel to young men about preparing for missions, Elder Bednar stated, "My dear young brethren, the single most important thing you can do to prepare for a call to serve is to<i>become</i>a missionary long before you<i>go</i>on a mission" ("Becoming a Missionary,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 2005, 45).<br><br>Richard and David are swimmers. They have grown up as swimmers, and it is woven into the fabric of their lives--much like the gospel of Jesus Christ is part and parcel of who we are. Can you imagine them heading out to sea with no training and no preparation? Can you imagine Richard swimming for 16 hours and 45 minutes--fighting currents, tides, hypothermia, and discouragement; his swim covering 36 miles of wind-tossed sea; his rest only to take nourishment while treading water--without any kind of preparation?<br><br>My swimmers have come to know that you can spend all night on your knees asking for the Lord to help you with a test or a swim race, but He expects you to prepare and do your part. Think of the counsel the Lord gave to Oliver Cowdery through the Prophet Joseph Smith in Doctrine and Covenants 9, verse 7: "Behold, you have not understood; you have supposed that I would give it unto you, when you took no thought save it was to ask me."<br><br>In becoming the first person in the state of Utah to successfully swim the English Channel, Richard could not do it alone. His wife, Darcy, afforded him time away from his family to train and was willing to commit family resources because she believed in her husband. She was onboard in every sense of the word. She was there along with his brother John offering encouragement and reassurance. Richard's brother Dave, who also dreamed of swimming the Channel, trained by his side month after month. Although he finally succumbed to hypothermia and had to abandon the attempt, it must be noted that Richard's victory over the Channel would not have happened if it had not been for his brother Dave. This is always the case. We can always accomplish much more together than we can alone. Let us look for ways to strengthen our brothers and sisters, and we will all rejoice together as the Barnes family has.<br><br>I have been asked by many if I was surprised that Richard was able to conquer the English Channel. My answer is no. Richard Barnes knows how to set a goal and keep his eye on it. I have watched him work toward goals for many years and know of his willingness to put in the work and not become discouraged when at first he doesn't succeed.<br><br>There were occasions during the swim when Richard would swim for hours without progressing toward the opposite shore. This can often be the case in life. Richard shared with me that at the three-hour mark he was quite discouraged from "breathing diesel fumes and being tossed about by the waves." His stomach finally gave out, and he threw up violently. He thought for a second that this was surely the end. His brother John calmly looked at him and said, "Take your time." His calmness reassured Richard. A minute or so later Richard began swimming anew, and thus began the best portion of his entire swim. A well-placed word of encouragement can make all the difference.<br><br>As a former bishop and as a coach, I counsel ward members and my swimmers to make their plans and dreams big enough to include the Lord. Richard Barnes has done just that. I would relate to you many of the insights that Richard has shared with me about gospel principles that took on new meaning during this life-altering swim, but I will leave that to him. I think he has earned the right to share what he has learned through his labors. I mentioned that this swim was the Mount Everest of swims. Mount Everest has been conquered by approximately 1,500 climbers and is the pinnacle of mountaineering. The English Channel has recorded only 680 swimmers accomplishing its crossing since the first successful attempt in the 1880s. It gives me great satisfaction to know that the first person from Utah to have his name recorded among the great long-distance swimmers is a former Cougar swimmer and BYU graduate. Richard Barnes is here with us today. Richard, would you please stand so that our students and faculty can recognize you?<br><br>Finally, brothers and sisters, I cannot let this opportunity pass without adding my testimony that Jesus is the Christ. He lives! I know this truth with every fiber of my being. We are His, bought with a price. Through Him all things are possible. He is Alpha and Omega, the Prince of Peace, the Good Shepherd, and the Messiah. He loves you and me.<br><br>I would not be here today if it wasn't for my beautiful wife, Patcee, who is seated here on the stand. She is the love of my life, and she introduced me to the gospel of Jesus Christ. She exemplifies the gospel in action. She inspires me to strive to be the best priesthood holder I can be. Early on she brought the Lord into our relationship, and that has made all the difference in our marriage and in my life. She looks for opportunities to serve our neighbors. She is sensitive to the needs of others. Isn't that what the Lord has asked us to do?<br><br>It is my prayer that while you are here at Brigham Young University you will grow intellectually and spiritually and that you will sharpen your gospel skills and increase your testimony through service in your student wards and associations. Continue to be disciples of Jesus Christ and examples of the "true believers" described in Acts 2:41–42:<br><br><i>Then they that gladly received his word were baptized: and the same day there were added unto them about three thousand souls.</i><br><br><i>And they continued stedfastly in the apostles' doctrine and fellowship, and in breaking of bread, and in prayers.</i>[See also Alma 46:14–15 and 4 Nephi 1:36–37]<br><br>If you will do this, the Lord will have in you a mighty force for good. You then will be prepared to make a difference. I say this in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i><i>Timothy J. Powers was coach of the BYU men's swim team when this devotional address was given on 25 October 2005.</i></i><br><br><i>© Brigham Young University. All rights reserved.</i>

<h1>: A Celestial Touchstone - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I am blessed to work and serve in the David O. McKay School of Education. President McKay was a great prophet and educator--the beloved prophet of my youth. He spoke often about the importance of noble character. A summary of his teachings would be that the highest purpose of education is not just to teach facts, however important they may be, but to train the mind, to make good citizens, and to develop character.<br><br>My message today is really quite simple but, I believe, very important. My focus is primarily on one specific virtue of a noble character: constantly acting with kindness. President Ezra Taft Benson defined kindness as follows:<br><br><i>One who is kind is sympathetic and gentle with others. He is considerate of others' feelings and courteous in his behavior. He has a helpful nature. Kindness pardons others' weaknesses and faults. Kindness is extended to all.</i> [<i>CR,</i> October 1986, 62; "Godly Characteristics of the Master," <i>Ensign,</i> November 1986, 47]<br><br>In the context of the gospel, acts of kindness are not optional. They are a responsibility, even a covenant. In a BYU devotional President Gordon B. Hinckley emphasized this responsibility:<br><br><i>It is a responsibility divinely laid upon us to bear one another's burdens, to strengthen one another, to encourage one another, to lift one another, to look for the good in one another, and to emphasize that good.</i> ["Let Not Your Heart Be Troubled" (29 October 1974), in <i>Speeches of the Year, 1974</i> (Provo: Brigham Young University Press, 1975), 272]<br><br>President McKay spoke of kindness as a temple covenant in his remarks prior to the first session of the dedicatory services for the Oakland Temple. He taught:<br><br><i>There are certain obligations taken by those who make covenants at the altar and those obligations must be manifest after they go out of the Temple. One is</i> Kindness. <i>There should be no unkindness manifest in the homes occupied by couples who leave the House of God.</i> [In Jeanette McKay Morrell, <i>Highlights in the Life of President David O. McKay</i> (Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1966), 275; emphasis in original]<br><br>I think of the peace we feel in the temple. How many of us would love to have that feeling with us constantly? Why does this feeling often leave as we go back to our daily routines? Obviously there are many reasons, but if we would prolong those feelings, perhaps one key would be to increase the constancy of kindness in our lives.<br><br>In the incident recorded in Luke 10:25–28, the Savior emphasized the importance of how we treat one another.<br><br>A lawyer approached Jesus and asked, "Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?"<br><br>Jesus replied with a counterquestion: "What is written in the law? how readest thou?"<br><br>The man replied: "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy strength, and with all thy mind; and thy neighbour as thyself."<br><br>The Master responded, "This do, and thou shalt live."<br><br>To a large degree Jesus measures our commitment to Him by how we love and serve each other--by how kindly we behave.<br><br>Anciently, one test of the purity of gold was performed with a hard, smooth, black stone referred to as a "touchstone." Rubbing a metal object across the touchstone left a colored mark. The color of the mark was then matched to a goldsmith's chart of graded colors. The amount of red in the mark indicated the degree of imperfection in the metal. As the percentage of gold increased, the color of the mark became more yellow. This quick test demonstrated the purity of gold with sufficient accuracy for most purposes.<br><br>Today the word <i>touchstone</i> is used to refer to a standard by which something is judged or that tests the genuineness or quality of some act. President Howard W. Hunter used this metaphor in speaking of the quality of our discipleship. He said, "The Lord has prepared a touchstone for you and me, an outward measurement of inward discipleship" ("The Lord's Touchstone," <i>Ensign,</i> November 1986, 34). The Lord's touchstone for us--our personal, celestial touchstone--is how we love and serve Christ and Heavenly Father, and our treatment of Them is measured by how we treat our brothers and sisters. The Savior said, "Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me" (Matthew 25:40). Thus kindness is a test of the quality or genuineness of our character. Each act of kindness leaves a yellow or positive mark on our personal touchstone.<br><br>My grandmother, Vera Allen, created such a mark on her celestial touchstone. During the Great Depression she lived in a rural area outside of Dallas, Texas. Homeless and unemployed men looking for work (referred to as "hoboes" in those days) frequently stopped at her home, asking if she had a job they could do or if she could give them a bite to eat. She always managed to find something for them.<br><br>On one occasion she asked one such destitute man why so many stopped at her home and not others. The man replied with a question: "You really don't know?"<br><br>After she convinced him she did not know, he led her to the corner of her property and showed her a mark on a tree, put there many months before by a weary traveler. The mark signaled travelers who followed that this was the home of a kind, good-hearted woman who would provide assistance. I know Grandmother had many yellow marks on her touchstone, but to our family the mark on the tree was a special, well-earned honor.<br><br>I was fortunate, like many of you, to be raised by parents who practiced kindness both within and outside our home throughout their lives. These acts of kindness provided a secure and comfortable home where I knew I was loved. I remember Mother's comfort and the times when she listened, understood, expressed confidence, and gave counsel. I remember my father's patience as he taught his sons to work and how after long hours of work providing for us, Father frequently spent additional hours in Church and community service. And I cannot forget a father-in-law who continually took produce and other much-needed items to relatives, neighbors, and friends, including a certain young married couple struggling to get through college.<br><br>Today, in a world filled with trials, youth and adults alike need refuge from the storms of life. Let us fill our homes with acts of kindness, which will strengthen our families and help prevent Satan's influences from pulling us apart.<br><br>We are blessed by examples of latter-day prophets who are kind and gentle leaders. In 1965 evangelist Norman Vincent Peale described then 91-year-old David O. McKay as "a man with a secret," because he radiated so much happiness. Dr. Peale wrote:<br><br><i>What a wonderful thing it would be if there were such a secret, and all of us could discover and use it to make our lives the joyous walk with God that his has been.</i> [Norman Vincent Peale, "David O. McKay: A Man with a Secret," <i>Instructor,</i> April 1965, 138; reprinted from <i>Guideposts,</i> March 1965, 12]<br><br>Dr. Peale searched for President McKay's secret through many interviews with those who knew him and through hours of reading the prophet's words. Near the end of his article, Dr. Peale remarked:<br><br><i>And then one day . . . I found the answer to my question: four lines of a poem by Edwin Markham that President McKay long ago committed to memory as a guide for everyday living.</i><br><br><i>There is a destiny, which makes us brothers;</i><br><br><i>None lives to self alone;</i><br><br><i>All that we send into the lives of others</i><br><br><i>Comes back into our own.</i><br><br>[Peale, "Man with a Secret," 139]<br><br>President McKay considered kindness to be essential to the happiness of every human soul. As a young missionary I witnessed such an example in the conduct of President Harold B. Lee. I had the privilege of traveling through my mission with Elder Lee, who at the time was a member of the Quorum of the Twelve. During the trip he was suffering with stomach pain from what was thought to be an ulcer. Some individuals might be unpleasant traveling companions with such discomfort, perhaps feeling irritable or complaining, but Elder Lee was not the least bit unpleasant.<br><br>One evening, after driving several hours, we stopped for dinner, and a young waitress came to take our orders. Elder Lee, feeling the painful effects of his condition, asked only for a bowl of "milk toast." The young lady replied that he could not have milk toast because it was not on the menu. Elder Lee, in a kindly manner, simply requested two slices of toast and a glass of milk. He then asked if it would be too much trouble to warm the milk. When his meal was served, he politely asked if he might please have an empty bowl. After he received the bowl, he thanked the waitress and proceeded to break the bread into the bowl and pour the warm milk over it. He did not get upset or impatient; he just kindly resolved the situation. I have always been grateful to have observed this mark as it was added to President Lee's touchstone.<br><br>The greatest example of all is the kindness displayed by our Heavenly Father and our Savior, Jesus Christ. Whenever I ponder Their goodness, I envision kind, caring, and nurturing parents. I believe our Father constantly acts with love. Constancy is a characteristic of Deity. Man is variable; Father is constant. Could we have faith in our Heavenly Father if He responded to our needs according to a mood? What if our blessings were contingent not on our behavior or on our Father's wisdom but on whether He was having a good or bad day? It would be impossible to develop strong, unshakable faith in such a being. But God <i>is</i> constant. We can go to our Heavenly Father in prayer, trusting that He loves us and that He truly understands our needs far better than we do. We know that He will tutor us, guide us, and bless us in His kindly manner according to His knowledge and wisdom. If we desire to guide our children, bless the life of a spouse, or be worthy of a friend's confidence, we need to display more constant kindness. Then others may have trust in us, similar to the trust and faith we have in our Heavenly Father.<br><br>There is much kindness in the world; every day many kind acts leave their marks on personal touchstones. Still, we know that one of our challenges here on earth is to develop godlike constancy in kindness. We must learn to respond consistently to life's ups and downs, acting with love and kindness regardless of challenges that lie in our path.<br><br>Perhaps total, complete constancy will not be achieved by anyone in this life. We all have moments when we are impatient and may act unkindly toward a spouse, a child, a co-worker, a friend, or a stranger--days when the red marks on our touchstones reveal imperfections. Constant kindness does require considerable effort. President McKay often quoted James Allen:<br><br><i>A noble and Godlike character is not a thing of favor or chance, but is the natural result of continued effort in right thinking, the effect of long-cherished association with God-like thoughts.</i> [James Allen, <i>As a Man Thinketh</i> (Mount Vernon, New York: Peter Pauper Press, 1957), 9]<br><br>There never will be too much kindness in the world. People daily experience physical pain, poverty, neglect, illness, crime, natural disasters, conflicts, and struggles of many kinds. And many individuals are suffering from mental and emotional agony, loneliness, depression, discouragement, and other less noticeable infirmities. These are not just individuals living in faraway places but often members of our own communities and neighborhoods or those living in our own homes. There are thousands every day in need of an act of kindness. Sometimes even a simple word of praise will fulfill this need. In a talk given to the BYU Marriott School of Management, Elder Neal A. Maxwell said:<br><br><i>Whether in the work place, around the fireplace, or in community service--we can all do something else which is simple but powerful. Isaiah spoke of providing the "garment of praise." (Isaiah 61:3.) Of course, there are times in rendering humanitarian service when we need to give an actual, physical cloak, but, most often, those with whom most of us work need material clothing less than the "garment of praise."</i> [In fireside given on 21 June 1996, in <i>The Neal A. Maxwell Quote Book,</i> ed. Cory H. Maxwell (Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1997), 258]<br><br>Although we strive to constantly act with kindness, our individual touchstones will still include red marks reflecting bad decisions, thoughtless remarks, or hasty reactions to both intended and unintended offense. But as we love and nurture each other with kindness, many more yellow marks will appear. As time passes, hopefully the yellow marks of kindness will crowd out the red marks of thoughtlessness.<br><br>To develop a habit of kindness, we need to seize every opportunity available. In his book <i>The Promise of Discipleship,</i> Elder Maxwell wrote of times when we encounter others who at that very moment are in need of an act of kindness--times when the need for help, whether small or large, is urgent. These moments are character-building opportunities. As Elder Maxwell explained:<br><br><i>Such individualized opportunities may be deflected or rejected by us, of course. Or they may simply go unrecognized. Nevertheless, the moments were there, and they could have been seized "for</i> [our] <i>good" (D&amp;amp;C 122:7). Granted, such moments may be fleeting, but they can still be defining, depending upon our responses. . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . For instance, we can decide daily, or in an instant, in seemingly little things, whether we respond with a smile instead of a scowl, or whether we give warm praise instead of exhibiting icy indifference. Each response matters in its small moment. After all, moments are the molecules that make up eternity, affecting not only ourselves but others, because our conduct even in seemingly small things can be contagious.</i> [Neal A. Maxwell, <i>The Promise of Discipleship</i> (Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 2001), 71]<br><br>Our capacity to be kind will enlarge as we learn to listen and respond to the promptings of the Spirit. Several years ago, when I lived in North Logan, Utah, I had the wonderful opportunity of serving as a home teacher to a John and Ruth Jenkins, who at the time were well into their retirement years. I learned far more from this wonderful couple than they ever did from me.<br><br>Sister Jenkins served faithfully for years after Brother Jenkins passed away. Because of her self-reliance, an attentive family, and caring neighbors, she lived humbly and happily. The time came when she was released from a Church calling and not given a new calling. She was somewhat distraught over "not having a way to serve." She sought counsel from her son. He wisely advised her that she could still provide important and much-needed service to others by seeking the promptings of the Lord as to who, on any particular day, could benefit from her visit.<br><br>Sister Jenkins followed her son's counsel. Each morning after rising, she studied her scriptures and then knelt in prayer to seek the inspiration of the Lord as to who might benefit from her help that day. Promptings always came, and acts of kindness followed. Both at her funeral and during months that followed, person after person bore witness of how Sister Jenkins appeared unexpectedly--in storms of winter or in heat of summer--and provided kind service. Brothers and sisters, I testify that if we learn to be sensitive to the needs of others and if we pray for a discerning spirit, the Lord will lead us to those who need our help, our love, and our acts of kindness. When the promptings come, will we hear? Will we respond? Will additional yellow marks--signifying kind acts--continue to appear on our touchstones?<br><br>When we act with kindness we radiate a special warmth and light that is godlike in its origin and nature.<br><br>In October 1969, during general conference, President David O. McKay taught:<br><br><i>There is one responsibility that no man can evade. That is the responsibility of personal influence. The effect of your words and acts is tremendous in this world. Every moment of life you are changing to a degree the life of the whole world. Every man has an atmosphere or a radiation that is affecting every person in the world. You cannot escape it. Into the hands of every individual is given a marvelous power for good or for evil. It is simply the constant radiation of what a man really is. Every man by his mere living is radiating positive or negative qualities. Life is a state of radiation. To exist is to be the radiation of our feelings, natures, doubts, schemes, or to be the recipient of those things from somebody else. You cannot escape it. Man cannot escape for one moment the radiation of his character. You will select the qualities that you will permit to be radiated.</i> [<i>CR,</i> October 1969, 87]<br><br>Mary Hill Peterson, a teacher of at-risk students in an inner-city junior high school, radiated such qualities. Mary, not a member of our faith, was a special colleague and friend. I observed her classroom often. On each occasion I saw patient acts of kindness, genuine words of commendation, and sincere, honest praise expressed to every one of her students. It was obvious to everyone in the school that Mary was having a special effect on difficult students. One experience in particular illustrates this effect and her radiating qualities.<br><br>Early in the school year Mary was approached after class by one of her students. He was a ninth-grade boy--unkempt in his appearance, failing in school, frequently disciplined for his inappropriate behavior, and probably involved in a local gang.<br><br>He spoke to Mrs. Peterson in a rude, disrespectful manner, saying (in more colorful language than I will use): "You're a phony. No one goes around praising others. People tell you how bad you are and that you do everything wrong. They don't praise you."<br><br>Mary paused for only a moment and then simply responded, "I know that not everyone compliments others, but a few years ago I decided that I didn't care what others did. I want to be the kind of person who looks for the good in others, finds it, and then praises them for it."<br><br>The student muttered some inappropriate remarks as he hurriedly left the room.<br><br>The significant part of the experience occurred several months later, in the spring. Again approaching his teacher privately after class, the student, this time very politely, remarked, "Mrs. Peterson, I just wanted to tell you that I have decided that I want to be like you."<br><br>I believe that Mary's work with those highrisk students has produced thousands of positive marks on her touchstone.<br><br>As we reflect on both our imperfections and our acts of kindness, we might ask ourselves: Are we sensitive enough to the needs of others? Do we search, or even casually glance around, for opportunities to lighten the burdens of those weighed down with life's challenges? Do we brighten the day of those who are discouraged, commend those who are becoming stronger in their struggles, or encourage those who have experienced failure and want to give up just short of success? Are we alert and sensitive enough to even recognize these individuals when they cross our paths? What color are the marks on our touchstones?<br><br>I have been the recipient of much kindness. This is a great blessing, which continues daily. I feel deep gratitude for the acts of kindness in my behalf. I must give special thanks to my wife, Janet, who has blessed me with constant kindness for more than 30 years, including kind and helpful assistance in preparing this devotional talk. In terms of kindness, I have a great debt to repay.<br><br>Brothers and sisters, I close with a statement from President Howard W. Hunter:<br><br><i>We need to extend the hand of friendship. We need to be kinder, more gentle, more forgiving, and slower to anger. We need to love one another with the pure love of Christ. May this be our course and our desire.</i> ["A More Excellent Way," <i>Ensign,</i> May 1992, 63]<br><br>I pray that we may be more aware of our actions and devote ourselves to achieving constancy in kindness. If our personal touchstones are more fully covered with the yellow marks of kindness, the world will be a better place for all. I testify that this is the will of our Father in Heaven. If we will say, "Thy will be done," then, as was spoken of President McKay, our lives may be a "joyous walk with God." In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>K.

<h1>s Determine Destiny - Thomas S. Monson - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
You are a glorious group, even a chosen generation, assembled both here in the Marriott Center at Brigham Young University and in many other locations. It is an honor for me to be with you, and I want you to know that there is nowhere else on earth I would rather be this evening.<br><br>I approach this assignment after earnest personal prayer. I seek your faith; I ask for your prayers.<br><br>As I look at you assembled here and contemplate those of you who are assembled elsewhere, my thoughts turn to your parents. For many years it was my privilege nearly every week to attend stake conferences and to be in the home of a stake president or a counselor to a stake president. Sometimes, rather interesting things would occur. There were occasions when a tiny brother or sister, not knowing that Mother and Dad had given their bedroom and their bed to a General Authority, would creep in the bedroom early in the morning and think that he or she was crawling into bed with Mother and Father--only to be amazed and confused to find that such was not the case.<br><br>On one occasion many years ago, while visiting the Indianapolis Stake, I remember President Lowe, who was with Purdue University there, saying to me, "Brother Monson, would you like to come out to my home and stay with us Saturday evening, or would you prefer to forego the 40-mile drive and stay here with my counselor in Indianapolis?"<br><br>I responded, "Well, President Lowe, it's late at night, and, if it's all the same to you, I'll stay with your counselor here in Indianapolis."<br><br>The next morning President Lowe greeted me at eight o'clock and said, "Brother Monson, you made an inspired decision."<br><br>I asked, "How's that?"<br><br>"Well," he replied, "we have a son away attending the university, and our anticipation was that we, of course, would have you occupy our bedroom on Saturday evening. But, unknown to us and totally unexpectedly, our son returned home from school at two in the morning, came in the front door, walked up the stairs to our bedroom, turned on the light, and yelled, 'Surprise!'"<br><br>I'm not certain who would have been more surprised on that occasion had I stayed with the stake president--the student or me! I think it's rather a good thing we didn't find out.<br><br>Well, my young friends, what a thrilling life awaits you! You may not be a John Cabot, sailing off into the blue with the king's patent to discover new lands, nor a Captain James Cook, whose voyages of discovery carried him to "far away places with strange-sounding names."<sup>1</sup> But you can be explorers in spirit, with a mandate to make this world better by discovering improved ways of living and of doing things. The spirit of exploration, whether it be of the surface of the earth, the vastness of space, or the principles of living greatly, includes developing the capacity to face trouble with courage, disappointment with cheerfulness, and triumph with humility.<br><br>Many of you are familiar with the musical <i>Fiddler on the Roof.</i> It is a favorite of mine. One laughs as he observes the old-fashioned father of a Jewish family in Russia attempting to cope with the changing times brought forcibly home to him by his beautiful daughters. With abandon they sing, "Matchmaker, matchmaker, make me a match." Tevye, the father, sings his reply with "If I Were a Rich Man." Tears come to the viewer as he hears the beautiful strains of "Sunrise, Sunset," and he seems to appreciate Tevye's love for his native village when the cast sings "Anatevka."<br><br>The gaiety of the dance, the rhythm of the music, and the excellence of the acting all fade in significance when Tevye speaks what to me becomes the message of the musical. He gathers his lovely daughters to his side, and, in the simplicity of his peasant surroundings, he counsels them as they ponder their future. "Remember," cautions Tevye, "in Anatevka we know who we are and what God expects us to become."<br><br>As Latter-day Saints, we know who we are and what God expects us to become. Listen to the truth taught to us in the first book of Moses, called Genesis:<br><br><i>God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness. . . .</i><br><br><i>So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.</i><br><br><i>And God blessed them.</i> [Genesis 1:26–28]<br><br>Created in the image of God. We cannot sincerely hold this conviction without experiencing a profound sense of strength and power. As Latter-day Saints, we know that we lived before we came to earth, that mortality is a probationary period wherein we might prove ourselves obedient to God's command and thus worthy of celestial glory. Yes, we know who we are and what God expects us to become. Such knowledge, however, does not ensure our success in reaching our goal of eternal life.<br><br>During the last half century or so, there has been throughout the world a gradual but continual decline in many phases of life. We observe relationships without morality, science without humanity, knowledge without character, business without ethics, worship without sacrifice, pleasure without conscience, politics without principle, and wealth without works.<br><br>Perhaps the renowned author Charles Dickens best described our day when he spoke of a period over two centuries ago. His classic <i>A Tale of Two Cities</i> begins:<br><br><i>It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair, we had everything before us, we had nothing before us.</i><br><br>This is your world. The future is in your hands. The outcome is up to you. The way to exaltation is not a freeway featuring unlimited vision, unrestricted speeds, and untested skills. Rather, it is known by many forks and turnings, sharp curves, and controlled speeds. Your driving skill will be put to the test. Are you ready? You are driving. You haven't passed this way before. Fortunately, the Master Highway Builder, even our Heavenly Father, has provided a road map showing the route to follow. He has placed markers along the way to guide you to your destination. Perhaps you may recognize some of His signs:<br><ul><br> 	<li>"Honour thy father and thy mother" (Exodus 20:12).</li><br> 	<li>"Search the scriptures; for . . . they are they which testify of me" (John 5:39).</li><br> 	<li>"Seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness" (Matthew 6:33).</li><br> 	<li>"Be ye clean" (3 Nephi 20:41).</li><br></ul><br>That evil one too has placed road signs to frustrate your progress and to lead you from the path of truth into detours of sin. His detours all lead to a dead end. Have you noticed his markers?<br><ul><br> 	<li>Just this once won't matter.</li><br> 	<li>It can't hurt anyone but me.</li><br> 	<li>My love is mine to give; my life is mine to live.</li><br> 	<li>Times have changed.</li><br></ul><br>Now we see coming into focus the responsibility to choose, that inevitable crisis at the crossroads of life. He who would lead you down waits patiently for a dark night, a wavering will, a confused conscience, a mixed-up mind. Are you prepared to make the decisions at the crossroads?<br><br>I can't stress too strongly that decisions determine destiny. You can't make eternal decisions without eternal consequences.<br><br>May I provide a simple formula by which you can measure the choices which confront you. It's easy to remember, sometimes difficult to apply: You can't be right by doing wrong; you can't be wrong by doing right. Your personal conscience always warns you as a friend before it punishes you as a judge.<br><br>The Lord, in a revelation given through Joseph Smith the Prophet at Kirtland, Ohio, May 1831, counseled:<br><br><i>That which doth not edify is not of God, and is darkness.</i><br><br><i>That which is of God is light.</i> [D&amp;amp;C 50:23–24]<br><br>Some foolish persons turn their backs on the wisdom of God and follow the allurement of fickle fashion, the attraction of false popularity, and the thrill of the moment. Their course of conduct so resembles the disastrous experience of Esau, who exchanged his birthright for a mess of pottage.<br><br>To illustrate, may I share with you the results of a survey conducted by a reputable organization and reported in a national magazine.<sup>2</sup> The survey was entitled, "Would You, for Ten Million Dollars?" Let me ask you the same questions which were asked in the survey:<br><ul><br> 	<li>For 10 million dollars in cash, would you leave your family permanently?</li><br> 	<li>Would you marry someone you didn't love?</li><br> 	<li>Would you give up all your friends permanently?</li><br> 	<li>Would you serve a year's jail term on a framed charge?</li><br> 	<li>Would you take off your clothes in public?</li><br> 	<li>Would you take a dangerous job in which you had a 1-in-10 chance of losing your life?</li><br> 	<li>Would you become a beggar for a year?</li><br></ul><br>Of the people polled, 1 percent would leave their families, 10 percent would marry lovelessly, 11 percent would give up friends, 12 percent would undress in public, 13 percent would go to jail for a year, 14 percent would take the risky job, and 21 percent would beg for a year.<br><br>Where money, rather than morality, dictates one's actions, one is inclined away from God. Turning away from God brings broken covenants, shattered dreams, vanished ambitions, unfulfilled expectations, crushed hopes, and ruined lives.<br><br>Such a quagmire of quicksand I plead with you to avoid. You are of a noble birthright. Eternal life in the kingdom of our Father is your goal. Such a goal is not achieved in one glorious attempt but rather is the result of a lifetime of righteousness, an accumulation of wise choices, even a constancy of purpose. Like the coveted A grade on the report card of a difficult and required college course, the reward of eternal life requires effort.<br><br>There is a fable told about Euclid and Pharaoh and geometry. It is said that Pharaoh, entranced by some of the explanations and demonstrations of Euclid, wished to learn geometry, and Euclid undertook to teach him. He studied for a brief period and then called in Euclid and said the process was too slow for him. He was a Pharaoh; there must be a shorter road. He did not want to spend all his time to learn geometry. Then Euclid gave voice to this great truth. Said he to his Majesty, "There is no royal road to geometry."<sup>3</sup><br><br>My young friends, there is no royal road to salvation and exaltation. There is no royal road to success in any endeavor. The A grade is the result of each theme, each quiz, each class, each examination, each term paper. So each heartfelt prayer, each Church meeting attended, each worthy friend, each righteous decision, each act of service performed all precede that goal of eternal life.<br><br>A few months ago, as I returned from an assignment in Germany, I gazed out the window of the plane and marveled at the stars by which the navigator charted our course. My thoughts were upon you and the opportunity given me to meet with you tonight. I thought of the truth "Ideals are like stars; you will not succeed in touching them with your hands. But . . . you choose them as your guides, and following them you will reach your destiny."<sup>4</sup><br><br>What ideals, when followed, will bring to you those blessings you so much seek, even a quiet conscience, a peace-filled heart, a loving family, a contented home?<br><br>May I suggest these three:<br><br><i>Choose your friends with caution.</i><br><br><i>Plan your future with purpose.</i><br><br><i>Frame your life with faith.</i><br><h2><b>First: Choose Your Friends with Caution</b></h2><br>In a survey which was made in selected wards and stakes of the Church, we learned a most significant fact. Those persons whose friends married in the temple usually married in the temple, while those persons whose friends did not marry in the temple usually did not marry in the temple. The influence of one's friends appeared to be a more dominant factor than parental urging, classroom instruction, or proximity to a temple.<br><br>We tend to become like those whom we admire. Just as in Nathaniel Hawthorne's classic account "The Great Stone Face," we adopt the mannerisms, the attitudes, even the conduct of those whom we admire--and they are usually our friends. Associate with those who, like you, are planning not for temporary convenience, shallow goals, or narrow ambition but rather for those things that matter most--even eternal objectives.<br><br>Inscribed on the east transept wall of Stanford University Memorial Church is the truth: "All that is not eternal [is] too short, [and] all that is not infinite [is] too small."<sup>5</sup><br><br>Beyond your circle of earthly friends, I urge you to make a friend of your Heavenly Father. He stands ready to answer the prayer of your heart. Being the Father of your spirit and having created you in His own image, knowing the end from the beginning, His wisdom will not fail and His counsel is ever true. Make a friend of Him.<br><br>There is another important friend you should have, and that is the bishop of your ward. He has been called of God by prophecy and the laying on of hands by those who are in authority. He is entitled to heavenly help in providing you with counsel and guidance. Make a friend of him.<br><br>How well I remember the challenges confronting the youth in the ward over which I once presided as a bishop. One evening a lovely teenage girl came to my office with her boyfriend to talk things over with me. The two of them were very much in love, and temptation was beginning to get the best of them.<br><br>As we counseled together, each made a pledge to the other to resist temptation and keep uppermost in their minds the goal of a temple marriage. I suggested a course of action to follow and then felt impressed to say: "If you ever find yourselves in a position of compromise and need additional strength, you call me, regardless of the hour."<br><br>One morning at 1:00 a.m., the telephone rang and a voice said: "Bishop, this is Susan. Remember how you asked me to call if I found myself being tempted? Well, Bishop, I'm in that situation." I asked where she was, and she described a popular parking spot in the Salt Lake Valley. She and her fiancé had walked to a nearby phone booth to make the call. The setting wasn't ideal for providing counsel, but the need was great, and the young couple was receptive.<br><br>I won't mention how often Susan called. However, when the mailman delivered her wedding announcement to our home and Sister Monson read, "Mr. and Mrs. Jones request the pleasure of your company at the wedding reception of their daughter, Susan," she sighed, "Thank heaven!" When I noticed the small print at the bottom, which read, "Married in the Salt Lake Temple," I said silently, "Thank heaven for the strength of Latter-day Saint youth."<br><br><i>Choose your friends with caution.</i><br><h2><b>Second: Plan Your Future with Purpose</b></h2><br>The great Thomas Carlyle said: "The man without a purpose is like a ship without a rudder--a waif, a nothing, a no man. Have a purpose in life, and, having it, throw such strength of mind and muscle into your work as God has given you."<sup>6</sup><br><br>Many years ago I served as a mission president. I had 450 wonderful, dedicated missionaries. When we returned home to Salt Lake City after three years, my dear wife and I were a little surprised one evening as we ran a tally on our missionaries, only to find that there were some sister missionaries who had not as yet found an eternal companion. We determined we would do what we could to help out. I said to Sister Monson, "Frances, let's plan with a purpose and invite three or four of our lovely sister missionaries to our home. We'll have an activity where they can tell us who of all the single returned male missionaries they would like to have invited to a little fireside in our home. Then we will show pictures of the mission, and we will arrange the seating so that they can become well acquainted with one another." This was done, and I might say that the four girls whom we invited eagerly responded to the challenge.<br><br>In shoe boxes we maintained individual five-by-seven-inch photographs of every missionary. We had four such boxes, with missionary pictures in each. As those four girls sat around our living room, I said to each of them, "Here is a gift. Thumb through your box of pictures and tell me which of all the pictures represents the young man whom you would most like to have invited to come to this fireside." My, that was an interesting scene. I think that the only way I could adequately describe it is to ask a question. Have you ever seen children on Christmas morning? We went forward and invited the chosen four young men to join these four young ladies in our home, and we had a glorious evening. At the conclusion of the evening, I noticed two of them slowly walking down our driveway, and I said to Sister Monson, "This looks promising." They were walking very close together.<br><br>It wasn't long afterward that I received a telephone call from the young man. He said, "President Monson, do you remember that I promised you if I ever fell in love, I would let you know?"<br><br>I said, "Yes, sir."<br><br>He continued, "President, I have fallen in love."<br><br>I replied, "Good. With whom?"<br><br>He said, "You'll never guess."<br><br>I was discreet; I didn't guess. I said, "You tell me." And he named the sister missionary with whom he walked side by side and hand in hand from our party that evening. They have now been married for 42 years and have five children and many grandchildren.<br><br>Some of you within the sound of my voice have already married; others are still seeking that special someone with whom you would want to spend eternity. For those of you in the latter category, in your quest for the man or woman of your dreams, you may well heed the counsel given by King Arthur in the musical <i>Camelot.</i> Faced with a particularly vexing dilemma, King Arthur could well have been speaking to all of us when he declared, "We must not let our passions destroy our dreams."<sup>7</sup> May you follow this most essential counsel. I urge you to hold fast to your standards. I plead with you not to waver.<br><br>As a young boy I had a very special Sunday School teacher who has since passed away. Her name was Lucy Gertsch.<br><br>Lucy was lovely and ever so sweet. She was deserving of a worthy companion, yet none had come her way. The years flew by and Lucy was becoming resigned to the fact that she would never marry. And then, when she was in her mid-forties, she met Dick. It was a case of love at first sight. Just one problem: Dick was not a member of the Church. Did Lucy succumb to the age-old fallacy of marrying out of desperation, with the fleeting hope that one day he would become a member? Not Lucy. She was wiser than this. She simply told him, "Dick, I think you're wonderful, but we would never be happy dating each other."<br><br>"Why not?" he countered.<br><br>"Because you're not a Mormon."<br><br>"How do I become a Mormon? I want to date you." He studied the gospel. She answered his questions. He gained a testimony and was baptized.<br><br>Then he said, "Lucy, now that I'm a member, we can be married at last."<br><br>Lucy replied, "Oh, Dick, I love you so much. Now that you are a member of the Church, you wouldn't be content with anything but a temple marriage."<br><br>"How long will that take, Lucy?"<br><br>"About a year, if we meet the other requirements."<br><br>One year later Lucy and Dick entered the house of the Lord.<br><br>Lucy lived the truth of the verse:<br><br><i>Dare to be a Mormon;</i><br><i>Dare to stand alone.</i><br><i>Dare to have a purpose firm,</i><br><i>And dare to make it known.</i><sup>8</sup><br><br><i>Plan your future with purpose.</i><br><h2><b>Third: Frame Your Life with Faith</b></h2><br>Amidst the confusion of the times, the conflicts of conscience, and the turmoil of daily living, an abiding faith becomes an anchor to our lives.<br><br>Little children can give us interesting examples of faith. Some time ago I jotted down from one of our national magazines a short compilation of "Children's Letters to God." I found them most interesting.<br><br>Little Mark wrote: "Dear God, I keep waiting for spring but it never [did] come yet. Don't forget."<br><br>Another child stated: "Dear God, If you made the rule for kids to take out the garbage please change it."<br><br>Little Mickey wrote: "Dear God, If you watch in Church on Sunday I will show you my new shoes."<br><br>Jeff wrote: "Dear God, It is great the way you always get the stars in the right places. Why can't you do that with the moon?"<br><br>Joyce wrote: "Dear God, Thank you for the baby brother but what I prayed for was a puppy."<br><br>I like this one from Matthew the best: "Dear God, I read your book and I like it." Then he asked, "I would like to write a book someday with the same kind of stories. Where do you get your ideas? Best wishes."<sup>9</sup><br><br>True faith requires determination, and the kind of determination which is required is that set forth by a 21-year-old female college senior, who declared:<br><br><i>Our generation has been exposed, through every means of communication, to major and minor fears--the little threat of not finding a mate if one does not use a certain mouthwash or fear of nonacceptance if one does not succumb to a low moral standard because it is "the nature of the beast."</i><br><br><i>Many of us accept the premises that "You can't fight city hall" and "Live life to its fullest now, for tomorrow we will be destroyed by nuclear war or some other catastrophe."</i><br><br><i>I am old-fashioned enough to believe in God; to believe in the dignity and potential of His creature, man; and I am realistic, not idealistic, enough to know that I am not alone in these feelings.</i><br><br><i>Some say that, unlike other generations, we have no mission in life--that everything has been handed to us. We have not been pampered but spiritually impoverished. I don't want to live in the poverty of affluence--and I cannot live alone.</i><br><br>Remember that faith and doubt cannot exist in the same mind at the same time, for one will dispel the other. Be firm in your faith.<br><br>I think of an account I read about the wife of one of our early pioneers. Her name was Catherine Curtis Spencer. Her husband, Orson Spencer, was a sensitive, well-educated man. She had been reared in Boston and was cultured and refined. She and Orson had six children. After leaving Nauvoo, her delicate health declined from exposure and hardship. Elder Spencer wrote to her parents and asked if she could return to live with them while he established a home for her in the West. Their reply: "Let her renounce her degrading faith, and she can come back, but never until she does." Sister Spencer would not renounce her faith. When her parents' letter was read to her, she asked her husband to get his Bible and read to her from the book of Ruth: "Intreat me not to leave thee, or to return from following after thee: for whither thou goest, I will go; and where thou lodgest, I will lodge: thy people shall be my people, and thy God my God" (Ruth 1:16). Outside the storm raged, the wagon covers leaked, and friends held milk pans over Sister Spencer's head to keep her dry. In these conditions, and without a word of complaint, she closed her eyes for the last time.<sup>10</sup><br><br>Though we may not necessarily forfeit our lives in service to our God, we can certainly demonstrate our love for Him by how well we serve Him. He who hears our silent prayers, He who observes our unheralded acts will reward us openly when the need comes.<br><br>Should doubt knock at your doorway, just say to those skeptical, disturbing, rebellious thoughts: "I propose to stay with my faith, with the faith of my people. I know that happiness and contentment are there, and I forbid you, agnostic, doubting thoughts, to destroy the house of my faith. I grant that I cannot explain the miracles of the Bible, and I do not attempt to do so, but I accept God's word. I wasn't with Joseph, but I believe him. My faith did not come to me through science, and I will not permit so-called science to destroy it. When I change my mind about God and His work, only the inspiration of God will change it."<br><br><i>Frame your life with faith.</i><br><br><i></i>When you choose your friends with caution, plan your future with purpose, and frame your life with faith, you will merit the companionship of the Holy Spirit. You will have a perfect brightness of hope. You will testify through your own experience to the truth of the Lord's promise:<br><br><i>I, the Lord, am merciful and gracious unto those who fear me, and delight to honor those who serve me in righteousness and in truth unto the end.</i><br><br><i>Great shall be their reward and eternal shall be their glory.</i> [D&amp;amp;C 76:5–6]<br><br>To these perfect truths I bear my solemn witness and invoke the blessings of our Heavenly Father upon each of you, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Thomas S.

<h1> Obligation - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Thank you, Dr. Broomhead and members of the University Chorale, for that wonderful rendition of "For All the Saints" (<i>Hymns,</i> 1985, no. 82). That song is to be sung majestically, which you certainly did. Your words set the tone for my address today. I would like to look at how we as Saints--"faithful, true, and bold"--might increase our efforts to profess our faith.<br><br>On a rather cold, rainy day many years ago, I found myself in a meeting over a difficult issue. Waiting outside this meeting was what appeared to be an army of reporters. To say that I was a bit unnerved by their presence is an understatement. I was new to the office of University Communications, having spent 12 years with <i>BYU Magazine,</i> and was still trying to adjust to the media scrutiny that accompanies a breaking story.<br><br>As the meeting concluded, someone asked the question "Who is going to talk to all of those reporters?"<br><br>The person in charge responded, "Carri is."<br><br>And with that, everyone got up and left.<br><br>Do you remember how Moses felt when the Lord asked him to represent the Israelites before Pharaoh? In my own small way, I think I caught a glimpse of it on that rainy day. I too wanted to cry out, "O my Lord, I am not eloquent ... : but I am slow of speech, and of a slow tongue" (Exodus 4:10).<br><br>But, just as the Lord beckoned Moses to "therefore go, and I will be with thy mouth" (Exodus 4:12), I felt the Lord's gentle push in response to my hasty prayer. And so I walked out that door confident in the message I needed to deliver, even if I was not confident as the messenger.<br><br>I faced the reporters, and all went well until the final question, when they asked if they could interview BYU students about the Honor Code. I knew I could not say no, even though I really wanted to just handpick a few students who I knew would respond in a predictable and positive way.<br><br>Instead I responded, "Absolutely. Talk to anyone you like."<br><br>That night as I waited for the 10 o'clock news to air, my heart was racing. I knew what I had said, but what I didn't know was how the students had responded. I wondered if they would challenge and negate everything I had said.<br><br>As I watched the various news reports and those random students--students just like you--talk about their feelings and belief in the Honor Code, my once-racing heart swelled with pride. I realized that while in this instance I had been asked to be the official spokesperson for BYU, the most important spokespeople were you, the students. It was your voices people would remember; it was your voices that turned a rather negative news story into a positive one.<br><br>Today I would like to talk about what it means to be a spokesperson--at BYU and in the kingdom of God--a role that each one of us plays. The incident that I described above is not unique; in fact, it happens on an almost daily basis. Perhaps you saw this recent story in the <i>Salt Lake Tribune,</i> written by Shinika Sykes and Todd Hollingshead: "BYU Students Proud of 'Stone Cold Sober' Rank."<br><br>In Shinika and Todd's story, you will notice that my comment, shown here on the screen in yellow, is quite buried, but your comments, shown in blue, carry the story. Anthony Strike, one of the students quoted, sums up things when he says, "Students here don't have to worry about their lifestyle choices being challenged by their peers. I am proud to go to a school that gets that ranking" (in Shinika A. Sykes and Todd Hollingshead, "BYU Students Proud of 'Stone Cold Sober' Rank," <i>Salt Lake Tribune, </i>24 August 2005, B3).<br><br>Now, I ask you, who is the spokesperson in this article? As a student, aren't you far more interested in hearing comments from your fellow students than in hearing from me?<br><br>There is a common theory in public relations that the most important source--or spokesperson--is the source closest to you. We are far less likely to believe a company's official spokesperson than we are a trusted brother--or even a cousin twice removed--who works for that same company, even if this individual just started his or her job two days ago and washes the windows.<br><br>Although there can be obvious and even detrimental errors in this mode of thinking, we all succumb to it. As students, faculty, and staff at BYU who hold dear the principles of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, we must accept that for someone--and perhaps for a great many--we are their closest source to BYU and to the Church. Their opinions rest on our words and on our actions.<br><br>William Shakespeare reminded us that we are all players on the world's stage (see <i>As You Like It,</i> act 2, scene 7, lines 139–40). Yet at times we don't realize that the curtain has been drawn open and eyes are focused on us. We are not aware that the plot, based on our own deeds, has turned. We are not aware that our fellow actors are taking their cues from us and that the critics in the audience are frantically writing. After all, we may say, I have just a bit part.<br><br>Elder Jeffrey R. Holland said:<br><br><i>Think of the remarkable age in which we live. Think of the economic and educational, scientific and spiritual blessings we have that</i> no other <i>era or people in the history of the world have ever had, and then consider the responsibility we have to live worthily in our moment in time.</i><br><br><i>We are making our appearance on the stage of mortality in the greatest dispensation of the gospel ever given to mankind, and we need to make the most of it.</i> [Jeffrey R. Holland, "Terror, Triumph, and a Wedding Feast," fireside at BYU, 12 September 2004, 4; emphasis in original]<br><br>President Gordon B. Hinckley related how he was once asked:<br><br><i>"If you do not use the cross, what is the symbol of your religion?"</i><br><br><i>I replied that the lives of our people must become the most meaningful expression of our faith and, in fact, therefore, the symbol of our worship....</i><br><br><i>As</i> [Christ's<i>] followers, we cannot do a mean or shoddy or ungracious thing without tarnishing His image. Nor can we do a good and gracious and generous act without burnishing more brightly the symbol of Him whose name we have taken upon ourselves. And so our lives must become a meaningful expression, the symbol of our declaration of our testimony of the Living Christ, the Eternal Son of the Living God.</i> [Gordon B. Hinckley, "The Symbol of Our Faith," <i>Ensign,</i> April 2005, 3, 4]<br><br>Recognizing that we all serve as spokespersons, in one way or another, I would like to share with you six principles that guide me in my work. These basic and simple principles are a combination of public relations theory, sound professional advice from leaders in the industry, common sense, and answers to my own personal prayers.<br><br>Number one: <i>Do not be afraid.</i><br><br>I have a little ritual that I sometimes do before rather intimidating interviews: I snap my fingers and breathe into my hands. Before an interview with ESPN last August, I unconsciously started this ritual.<br><br>"What are you <i>doing?"</i> asked my co-worker.<br><br>"I'm proving that I'm not afraid," I said, knowing that if, as has been rumored, reporters can smell fear, they can certainly feel it in a cold handshake.<br><br>The truth is that fear is a natural reaction when we are called upon to leave our comfort zone. For many of us, standing up and speaking out is not easy. Look at Esther of the Old Testament, who was called upon to serve as a spokesperson for her people. Was she afraid? Most definitely. Did she not call upon her people to fast and pray for her in what was the most difficult assignment of her life? And yet, in that process, did she not glean the strength she needed to somehow say, "If I perish, I perish" (Esther 4:16)?<br><br>Few of us will ever face such a risk. However, we do face the possibility of ridicule, humiliation, dishonor, and even withdrawal of friendship. Yet, more often than not, when we act appropriately and put our faith in the Lord, our result is the same as Esther's.<br><br>A student, Dixie Kolditz, reinforced this lesson for me when she refused to back down during a very aggressive interview. A filmmaker had asked to interview BYU students about their beliefs in the gospel of Jesus Christ. The producer and his crew were charming, and I was looking forward to the interviews with the three students selected. Dixie, a young convert from South Africa, was to be their final interviewee.<br><br>As the camera started rolling, however, the reporter's charm quickly turned to hostility. Our two returned missionaries did just fine, fending off every question with solid answers. But Dixie had just come into the Church; she had no such experience with this manner of questioning. And I felt responsible for her vulnerability.<br><br>"Dixie," I said, "you don't have to do this. In fact, you shouldn't do this."<br><br>"No," she said. "I should."<br><br>With that she proved to be a powerful interviewee, basing her comments on the 13 Articles of Faith--principles she had not only memorized but understood on a deep and personal level.<br><br>Looking at Esther and Dixie during their individual moments in the spotlight, one would see them each as fearless and, without question, bold and confident. What gave these women--who I am quite sure also suffered from freezing hands--their self-assurance? As Esther entered the king's court, knowing she was breaking all protocol--even the law--what calmed her nerves? Esther herself gave us the answer. Her answer is my second principle: <i>Seek and recognize the Lord's support.</i><br><br><i>Go,</i> [Esther said,] <i>gather together all the Jews that are present in Shushan, and fast ye for me, and neither eat nor drink three days, night or day: I also and my maidens will fast likewise; and so will I go in unto the king, which is not according to the law: and if I perish, I perish.</i> [Esther 4:16]<br><br>Esther's mettle--or, some would say, her self-confidence--was far more than a strong personality: it was the direct result of putting her trust, faith, and reliance in the Lord.<br><br>A short time before his 24th birthday, President Heber J. Grant accepted a call from President John Taylor to preside over the Tooele Stake. He said the appointment came as a great surprise to him, and he had many feelings of inadequacy, particularly in the area of public speaking. About his first speaking assignment, he said:<br><br><i>I remember preaching and telling everything I could think of, and some of it over twice, and</i> [I] <i>ran out of ideas in seven minutes and a half by the watch....</i><br><br><i>The next Sunday I did not do any better. I ran out of ideas in six or seven minutes. The next Sunday I did the same.</i><br><br>This continued. There are no accounts to indicate whether the Saints in Tooele were really that disappointed, but obviously President Grant felt great distress. Then, in the little town of Vernon, he later recounted:<br><br><i>I got up to make my little speech of five, six or seven minutes, and I talked for forty-five minutes, with as much freedom and as much of the Spirit of the Lord as I have ever enjoyed in preaching the gospel, during the forty years that have passed since then. I could not restrain the tears of gratitude which I shed that night, as I knelt down and thanked God for the rich outpouring of his Holy Spirit.</i><br><br>Heber J. Grant's story, however, does not end there; you need to hear about the next Sunday. He explained:<br><br><i>I went to Grantsville, the largest ward in the Tooele stake of Zion, and I approached the Lord with much the same attitude as Oliver Cowdery when he told the Lord, "I want to translate." ... But, failing, he was later told, he did not study it out, and he did not pray about it, and he did not do his share. I told the Lord I would like to talk again to the Saints</i> [as I had done in Vernon]. <i>I got up and talked for five minutes, and I sweat as freely, I believe, as if I had been dipped in a creek, and I ran out of ideas completely. I made as complete a "fizzle," so to speak, of my talk, as a mortal could make.</i> [Heber J. Grant, "Significant Counsel to the Young People of the Church," <i>Improvement Era,</i> August 1921, 870–71; see also Preston Nibley, <i>The Presidents of the Church</i> (Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1974), 224–26]<br><br>President Grant later wrote of his humble prayers that followed that meeting. He wrote:<br><br><i>I asked God to forgive me for not remembering that men can not preach the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ with power, with force, and with inspiration only as they are blessed with power which comes from God.</i> [Grant, "Significant Counsel," 871–72; see also Nibley, <i>Presidents,</i> 226]<br><br>Looking back at this incident probably wasn't easy for President Grant. I think he shared his shame and pain over the "fizzle" of that talk for only one reason: to help us learn that even a young man who was worthy at 24 to serve as a stake president can fall victim to his own pride. We have been promised that the Lord will give us the strength we need if we humble ourselves before Him.<br><br>The Apostle James counseled:<br><br><i>God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace unto the humble....</i><br><br><i>Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord, and he shall lift you up.</i> [James 4:6, 10]<br><br>There is another lesson President Grant so vividly illustrates in his story, and this is my third principle: <i>Do your share; prepare yourself.</i><br><br>The number-one rule any spokesperson will give you is never walk into an interview unprepared. It is far better to admit your ignorance than to stumble around saying nothing or, worse yet, saying something incorrect. The problem, for me and for you, is that reporters--and people in general--rarely ask a question and then allow us a few days or even hours to prepare an answer. For this reason, our preparation must come before the questioning begins.<br><br>During the 2002 Winter Olympic Games in Salt Lake City, the lifetime of preparation our students had done paid off in immense proportions. In this small, three-week window of opportunity, BYU students interacted with journalists from around the world, sipping kiwi lemonade with them at family home evenings, sitting in advanced language classes, and training with them in our athletic facilities. Many of these journalists spoke little or no English and relied on the translation abilities of our students. Over and over again we watched the amazed faces of these international journalists as they interviewed students in their native tongues.<br><br>U.S. media outlets were also impressed by our students. On Presidents' Day 2002, a holiday for BYU, I got a call at home from David Lamb of the <i>Los Angeles Times.</i> He was at T.G.I. Fridays in Provo and asked if I would mind answering a few questions about BYU. It was his first day away from the hubbub of official Olympic activity, and his editor had given him permission to do two stories on cities outside of Salt Lake. He had chosen Wendover and Provo. He made it clear that his story was not about BYU and that he only wanted a paragraph about the university.<br><br>I tried to get him to go to our media hosting center, but he refused. As his questioning continued, I finally convinced him to make a trip to campus. There he could obtain a handy media kit that would answer all of his questions--thus, I pointed out, saving him time.<br><br>On duty that day were BYU students Chaliese Wouden and Julie Harris, both returned missionaries who between them spoke five languages. David spent two hours on campus: he took a campus tour, watched BYU's hosting video, and talked with students everywhere he went, particularly with Chaliese and Julie. In parting he told one of my co-workers, "This has to be one of the most cosmopolitan universities in the nation."<br><br>The story that resulted from that visit ran with three color pictures all featuring BYU students and lauded Provo for its friendliness--"which isn't by accident, darn it." In paragraph after paragraph David described BYU with its clean-cut enrollment that comes from all 50 states and 110 countries. He talked about how many students have lived abroad and how many are fluent in a second language. He applauded the large number of students serving as volunteers for the Olympic Games. He wrote of the Honor Code and quoted Julie as saying, "It's empowering, not restricting."<br><br>Although our office prepares for media visitors, it was not the press kits that made David's story so positive. It was the preparation of Julie and Chaliese and all the other students David interviewed who changed his thinking--preparation that could not have happened in the few minutes it took David to drive up the hill to BYU. This story reflects, more than anything else, the personal study and experience of our students who live the gospel of Jesus Christ on a daily basis. I have no doubt that David, as a seasoned journalist, quickly recognized that his interviewees were not just parroting answers prepared for them but were speaking from their souls.<br><br>This type of open communication was exactly what we had hoped to see taking place in our media center, knowing that if reporters could talk to "real live" students, they would be far more believing of what we had to say. Students like Julie and Chaliese were encouraged to share their experiences and insights. In so doing, we asked only that they be cautious not to overstep the bounds of their authority. All of us, in serving as spokespersons, have boundaries.<br><br><i>Do not go beyond the bounds of your own knowledge, understanding, and authority</i> is my fourth point. Neither Julie nor Chaliese pretended to be the president of BYU or the dean of a certain college; they didn't need to. They simply spoke as students at BYU.<br><br>When Aaron was asked to serve as Moses' spokesperson, he set an example for us all. Victor L. Ludlow has explained:<br><br><i>There is no evidence that he ever sought his brother's prophetic office; but neither was he weak and passive when given authority. When he was commanded to speak for Moses to the Pharaoh, he did. He assumed his own responsibility and acted within his own calling.</i> [Victor L. Ludlow, "Aaron," <i>Ensign,</i> February 1981, 38]<br><br>Aaron's example leads to my fifth point: <i>Be yourself.</i><br><br>While I was preparing this talk, an experience I had years ago outside my professional responsibilities returned again and again to my mind. This experience reminded me that I must accept who I am and recognize that, despite my limitations, I can be of service to the Lord.<br><br>Several years ago we visited the areas in which my husband served his mission in North Carolina. Our first Sunday was spent in Whiteville, North Carolina. As we approached the brand-new chapel of this branch and the doors of the church house opened, our car was surrounded by my husband's beloved friends. Yet even in the excitement I noticed that one lady did not approach us.<br><br>As I went into Relief Society, this woman sat down next to me. Then, when we started to sing the opening song, she leaned in very close. This would not have been a problem, except for the fact that I have a horrible singing voice. So the closer she leaned in, the further I leaned the opposite way and the softer I sang. Finally I was doing no more than mouthing the words. This whole scenario was repeated during the closing song. Then, when we entered the small chapel for sacrament meeting, this dear woman came and sat right next to me again. She was on one side and my daughter, Lynne, was on the other.<br><br>As we started to sing the opening song, Lynne and I carried out a routine we were doing every Sunday. Lynne was just learning to read, and so we would bend our heads low to the songbook and I would point at each word as we sang it. When we did this, my new friend also buried her head in our songbook. I could not imagine what was going on, but I decided to discontinue my lip-synching and to sing! As was typical, every time Lynne would get a word correct, she would beam with pride and I would pat her on the back. My new friend did the same thing, carefully studying the words as I pointed to them and listening to what I was singing. At times she would get a word correct and, just like my daughter, would smile up at me, and I would pat her on the hand. By this time I understood. My friend didn't care what my voice sounded like. All she needed was someone who could read and who cared enough to help her read the words as well. At that moment the Lord didn't need a member of the Tabernacle Choir to sit next to this new convert. I would do.<br><br>One of the great ironies in my life right now is that my ward calling, despite what I have just told you, is Primary chorister. Although the Primary children have not yet been able to teach me to sing, they have taught me over and over again what it means to be true to yourself. They are eager to talk about their answered prayers, to recount faith-building stories, to encourage us all to do better, and to share their testimonies. My testimony is strengthened each week by their pure and humble messages. As sons and daughters of God, each one of us has the ability and the obligation to testify and defend the work of the Lord. I beg you not to lean away or drop your voice in these situations. Rather, without pretense, stand in your own shoes, paying close attention to what is needed around you, and willingly respond. Remember the admonition of James: "But be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only" (James 1:22).<br><br>"Doing" is what I would like to address in my final principle. As spokespeople for this university, which all of us clearly are, we must recognize that <i>our actions speak louder than our words.</i> In urging us to be people of integrity, President Samuelson has asked us--faculty, staff, and students--to be familiar with and endorse "behaviorally and philosophically" BYU's guiding documents, including the Honor Code (Cecil O. Samuelson, "Integrity," BYU devotional, 14 September 2004, 2).<br><br>Each of us, in being here today, has agreed to follow President Samuelson's admonition. At this point, since we have <i>already</i> committed to live the Honor Code, it is now a matter of personal integrity. Because your integrity is valued and respected by those within and without our campus community, a violation of that integrity has the potential to become frontpage news.<br><br>People often ask me, "Don't you think it's unfair that BYU students live in such a fishbowl?"<br><br>No, I don't think it is unfair. I think it is a reality, and I think it is a reality that each of us will live with for the rest of our lives. Wherever you reside, work, and serve, you will be watched, simply because you are an alumnus of Brigham Young University. As a spokesperson for this university, you have tremendous opportunities before you. May you embrace the opportunities that await you as you represent the principles upon which BYU is built.<br><br>In the Sermon on the Mount, the Savior said:<br><br><i>Ye are the light of the world. A city that is set on an hill cannot be hid.</i><br><br><i>Neither do men light a candle, and put it under a bushel, but on a candlestick; and it giveth light unto all that are in the house.</i><br><br><i>Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.</i> [Matthew 5:14–16]<br><br>The light spoken of by our Savior shines from you this very moment. It is a light Naomi Schaefer Riley, who is now an editor for the <i>Wall Street Journal,</i> felt when she visited our campus the week of September 11, 2001. Naomi came to campus while writing a book on religious universities. BYU was the first she visited. Let me read to you just a few comments from her book, published this year, titled <i>God on the Quad:</i><br><br><i>I began the first formal interviews for this book on September 10, 2001. The next day, two thousand miles from home, I sat on the edge of my hotel bed, looking out over the strip malls to the treeless mountains beyond, wondering more than anything else about how to get home. Home for me is Blue America. I have lived in four states, all in the northeast. I attended two secular colleges and grew up with a sense that religion, while socially beneficial (in that it provided people with a moral compass they might not otherwise have), was not true. In other words, I had already expected to feel distinctly out of place on these campuses. And the events of that Tuesday morning only intensified the feeling.</i><br><br><i>Over the next week, the students at Brigham Young tried to welcome me into their lives. While national tragedies tend to bring out the best in many people, the first representatives of the "missionary generation" I encountered could not have made a greater impression upon me. Their kindness and compassion, their civic-mindedness, their understanding and interest in national and international affairs, the quiet comfort they were able to find in their faith, and their ability to relate to this stranger in their midst gave me cause for optimism.</i> [Naomi Schaefer Riley, <i>God on the Quad: How Religious Colleges and the Missionary Generation Are Changing America</i> (New York: St. Martin's Press, 2005), 12]<br><br>Since she visited us, Naomi has gone on to be a powerful defender of religious diversity in American higher education. In a <i>USA Today</i> article this summer, Naomi wrote:<br><br><i>Schools with strong faith identities with strict behavioral codes--such as the evangelical Wheaton College outside of Chicago, Brigham Young University and the Catholic Thomas Aquinas College near Los Angeles--are not succeeding despite their religious mission, but because of it.</i> [Naomi Schaefer Riley, "Higher, Higher Education," <i>USA Today,</i> 22 June 2005, A15]<br><br>Naomi's positive words are the direct result of her association with you.<br><br>Have I convinced you of the power you have as spokespeople for this university and for the Lord's work? Just as Moses, Aaron, and Esther spoke for their people, you serve as a spokesperson for the students and graduates of BYU and all those who believe in the work of this university. In so doing, do not be afraid; seek and recognize the Lord's support; prepare yourself; however, do not go beyond the bounds of your knowledge, understanding, and authority; be yourself; and never forget that actions speak louder than words.<br><br>President Hinckley has counseled us:<br><br><i>We of this generation are the end harvest of all that has gone before. It is not enough to simply be known as a member of this Church. A solemn obligation rests upon us. Let us face it and work at it.</i> [Gordon B. Hinckley, "The Dawning of a Brighter Day," <i>Ensign,</i> May 2004, 84]<br><br>It is my testimony that you will not be alone as you strive to fulfill President Hinckley's challenge. Our Father in Heaven will guide you, help you, and support you. He does not want you to put your light under a bushel; instead, He wants you to put it on a candlestick where it cannot be hid.<br><br>You are His spokesperson, and for that--knowing that my job is shared by 30,000 others--I am indeed grateful. May each of us live our lives in accordance with the assignment and the opportunities before us is my prayer in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Carri P.

<br>
It is a joy to be here at the Brigham Young University devotional. As you know, this is a very special place of learning. While you are at Brigham Young University, you are learning and preparing for your future--to support yourselves spiritually and temporally; to establish a means for providing for your families; and to use your time, talents, and other resources to serve the Lord and lift and strengthen His children.<br><br>I have pondered many subjects to teach during this devotional and have been impressed to talk about the importance of temple preparation and of having an eternal perspective during our mortal probation here on earth. The temple endowment blessings are as essential for each of us as was our baptism. For this reason we are to prepare ourselves that we may be clean to enter into the temple of God. Temple work is an opportunity to perform our personal endowments and covenants for the living and also perform these same ordinances for the redemption for the dead. It is for this reason we are instructed in the scriptures to build temples and prepare our lives to be worthy to partake of the sacred temple ordinances and covenants.<br><br>We have been taught in the scriptures that the personal worthiness required of us by the Lord to enter the temple and to take upon us the sacred covenants therein is one of the greatest blessings available to us in mortality. Then, after taking upon us the covenants in the temple, our obedience in living the covenants daily is a demonstration of our faith, love, devotion, and spiritual commitment to honor our Heavenly Father and His Son Jesus Christ and prepares us to live with Them in the eternities. The temple's saving ordinances are essential to--and even the central focus of--the eternal plan of happiness.<br><br>Today I want to discuss the doctrine of the temple, the effects of the temple doctrine in your life, and the ways that you can prepare yourselves--and, we hope, your eternal companions can prepare themselves--to partake of the full blessings of the holy temple in mortality and in eternal life.<br><h2><b>The Temple Doctrine</b></h2><br>We need to acquire a testimony and a reverent feeling of the temple being the house of the Lord. The temple is truly a place where you are "in the world and not of the world." When you are troubled and when you have crucial decisions that weigh heavily on your mind and soul, you can take your cares to the temple and receive spiritual guidance.<br><br>To preserve the sanctity of the temple so that the temple may be kept pure and to invite the Spirit to bless those who enter the holy temple for their ordinances and covenants, we are taught that no unclean thing should enter the temple. Reverence in the temple is a vital element in inviting the Spirit to reside within it every hour of every day.<br><br>When I was a boy my father brought me from Long Island, New York, to walk on the Salt Lake Temple grounds in Salt Lake City, to touch the temple, and to discuss the importance of the temple in my life. It was on that occasion that I made up my mind that someday I would return to enter the temple and receive the ordinances of the temple.<br><br>When your dating relationship is getting serious and you are contemplating marriage, going to the temple grounds is a great place for a date with your future eternal companion to discuss your plans together. It is very important to know the heart and mind of your future eternal companion's desire to be worthy to go to the temple and always keep their temple covenants--enduring to the end.<br><br>The temple is a sacred edifice, a holy place where essential saving ceremonies and ordinances are performed to prepare us for exaltation. It is important that we gain a sure knowledge that our preparation to enter the holy house and our participation in these ceremonies and covenants are some of the most significant events we will experience in our mortal lives.<br><br>Throughout history, in every dispensation of time, the Lord has commanded prophets that temples should be built so that His people could receive temple ordinances.<br><br>The Bible records that while Moses and the Israelite people wandered in the wilderness for 40 years, they were blessed with a portable temple or tabernacle where sacred ordinance work was performed--and, on occasion, the Lord came to converse with Moses. When Moses reached the promised land, a tabernacle was used to bring these blessings to the children of Israel. King David began preparations for building a temple, but because King David had been disobedient, he was told that he was not worthy and would not be permitted to build the temple. His son Solomon completed a beautiful temple in Jerusalem when he became the Israelite king. Then, during Christ's ministry, another temple in Jerusalem was being built.<br><br>We learn from the Book of Mormon about a temple built in the New World around 588 B.C.:<br><br><i>And I, Nephi, did build a temple; and I did construct it after the manner of the temple of Solomon save it were not built of so many precious things; for they were not to be found upon the land. ... But the manner of the construction was like unto the temple of Solomon; and the workmanship thereof was exceedingly fine.</i> [2 Nephi 5:16]<br><br>Jacob, in about 544 B.C., recorded:<br><br><i>Wherefore I, Jacob, gave unto them these words as I taught them in the temple, having first obtained mine errand from the Lord.</i> [Jacob 1:17]<br><br>More than 400 years later, in 124 B.C., Mosiah<br><br><i>proclaimed unto all the people who were in the land of Zarahemla that thereby they might gather themselves together, to go up to the temple to hear the words which his father </i>[King Benjamin]<i> should speak unto them.</i> [Mosiah 1:18]<br><br>In the second chapter of Mosiah, King Benjamin addressed his people, who had gathered at the temple. He gave his testimony in a mighty spiritual discourse that changed the hearts of the people to worship the Lord. About 150 years later, in A.D. 34, the resurrected Lord appeared at the temple as recorded in 3 Nephi 11:1–11:<br><br><i>A great multitude gathered together, of the people of Nephi, round about the temple which was in the land Bountiful....</i><br><br><i>... They heard a voice as if it came out of heaven....</i><br><br><i>... And it said unto them:</i><br><br><i>Behold my Beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased, in whom I have glorified my name--hear ye him.</i><br><br><i>And it came to pass, as they understood they cast their eyes up again towards heaven; and behold, they saw a Man descending out of heaven; and he was clothed in a white robe; and he came down and stood in the midst of them; and the eyes of the whole multitude were turned upon him, and they durst not open their mouths, even one to another, and wist not what it meant, for they thought it was an angel that had appeared unto them.</i><br><br><i>And it came to pass that he stretched forth his hand and spake unto the people, saying:</i><br><br><i>Behold, I am Jesus Christ, whom the prophets testified shall come into the world.</i><br><br><i>And behold, I am the light and the life of the world; and I have drunk out of that bitter cup which the Father hath given me, and have glorified the Father in taking upon me the sins of the world, in the which I have suffered the will of the Father in all things from the beginning.</i> [3 Nephi 11:1, 3, 6–11]<br><br>The Prophet Joseph Smith said:<br><br><i>The Church is not fully organized, in its proper order, and cannot be, until the Temple is completed, where places will be provided for the administration of the ordinances of the Priesthood.</i> [<i>HC</i> 4:603]<br><br>Joseph Smith also said:<br><br><i>If a man gets a fullness of the priesthood of God, he has to get it in the same way that Jesus Christ obtained it, and that was by keeping all the commandments and obeying all the ordinances of the house of the Lord.</i> [<i>HC</i> 5:424]<br><br>Joseph Smith, as a result of a prayer, was visited by Jesus in the Kirtland Temple on a very special date, April 3, 1836, as recorded in section 110 of the Doctrine and Covenants. The Kirtland Temple was the first temple in these latter days, and it played an important role in the restoration of priesthood keys. The Savior, introduced by His Father, our Father in Heaven, appeared in glory and accepted the Kirtland Temple as His house. On that occasion Moses, Elias, and Elijah each appeared to commit the keys held from their dispensations. Elijah restored the keys of his dispensation as promised by Malachi so that we could enjoy the blessings of the temple in our lives.<br><br>The Nauvoo Temple was the first temple in which endowments and sealings were performed, which proved a great strength to the pioneers as they endured the hardships crossing the plains to Zion in the Salt Lake Valley. Many of us have ancestors who made that crossing.<br><br>When Joseph Smith was taken to Carthage, it was clear why the completion of the temple had meant so much to him. He knew what was going to be required of the Saints and that to have the strength to endure what was ahead of them they had to be endowed with power--the power of the priesthood. He looked across the Mississippi River to the west and said he did not know if he wanted to tell the Saints what was ahead of them. He said, "Go to and finish the temple, and God will fill it with power, and you will then receive more knowledge concerning this priesthood" (<i>HC</i> 5:555).<br><br>Sarah Rich, the wife of Charles C. Rich, wrote in her journal how important the temple endowment was in helping them endure the hardships on the pioneer trek. "If it had not been for the faith and knowledge that was bestowed upon us in that temple ... , our journey would have been like ... taking a leap in the dark" (Sarah DeArmon Pea Rich, "Autobiography, 1885–1893," Family and Church History Department Archives, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 66).<br><br>Our pioneer ancestors were sealed together as families in Nauvoo. In 56 days, more than 100 endowments were performed each day--more than 5,600 endowments in all. Their covenants with the Lord in the Nauvoo Temple were a protection for them during their journey westward, as it is for each of us today and throughout our lives. The ordinances and covenants of the temple are the protection for us in our trials and tribulations in our day and for what we will face in the future. It is our heritage. It is who we are.<br><br>For these early Saints, their participation in the ordinances of the temple was essential to their testimonies as they faced the hardships, the angry mobs, being driven from comfortable homes in Nauvoo, and the long and difficult journey ahead. They had been endowed with power in the holy temple. Husband and wife were sealed to each other. Children were sealed to their parents. Many lost family members to death along the way, but they knew that wasn't the end for them. They had been sealed in the temple for all eternity.<br><br>Upon reaching the Salt Lake Valley, Brigham Young embarked on building the Lord's house. The construction took 40 years before the temple was dedicated in 1892. Today President Hinckley, our prophet, has been moved upon by the Lord to build temples throughout the world. There are now 122 functioning temples, allowing faithful members of the Church in many nations around the earth to go to the house of the Lord to receive their temple ordinances and covenant with the Lord in His house.<br><h2><b>The Temple Ordinances--Endowments and Sealings</b></h2><br>Temples are the greatest university of learning known to man, giving us knowledge and wisdom about the creation of the world. Washings and anointings tell us who we are. Endowment instructions give guidance as to how we should conduct our lives here in mortality.<br><br>We are taught in the scriptures that temples are<br><br><i>a place of instruction for all those who are called to the work of the ministry ... ;</i><br><br><i>That they may be perfected in</i> [their] <i>understanding ... in all things pertaining to the kingdom of God on the earth.</i> [D&amp;amp;C 97:13–14]<br><br>The primary purpose of the temple is to provide the ordinances necessary for our exaltation in the celestial kingdom. Temple ordinances guide us to our Savior and give us the blessings that come to us through the Atonement of Jesus Christ. The meaning of the word <i>endowment</i> is "gift." The ordinance consists of a series of instructions on how we should live and covenants we make to live righteously by following our Savior.<br><br>Another important ordinance is being sealed for eternity in celestial marriage. This covenant allows children to be sealed to their parents and children born in the covenant to become part of an eternal family.<br><br>The Doctrine and Covenants teaches us:<br><br><i>And verily, verily, I say unto you, that whatsoever you seal on earth shall be sealed in heaven; and whatsoever you bind on earth, in my name and by my word, saith the Lord, it shall be eternally bound in the heavens; and whosesoever sins you remit on earth shall be remitted eternally in the heavens; and whosesoever sins you retain on earth shall be retained in heaven.</i> [D&amp;amp;C 132:46]<br><br>When a couple is kneeling at the altar, as a sealer I am aware of my role as a representative of the Lord. I know that what is sealed on earth is literally sealed in heaven--never to be broken if those being sealed remain faithful and endure to the end.<br><br>The mirrors on opposite walls in the temple sealing room are canted to create the visual impression of endless images. Looking into these mirrors on one side of the room represents the eternities of time that we have traveled to come to earth. As we turn to the opposite side of the room, we look into the seemingly endless images symbolizing the eternities after we leave this frail existence on earth. The sealing room itself represents our mortal probation here on earth. The lesson to be learned from this temple experience is that we have made the right choices to come to earth and experience mortality and that how we live our life in this brief period will determine how we will live in all the eternities to come! Just think of it again: when you are kneeling at the altar to be sealed, on one side are all the images symbolizing our premortal life; on the other side are the representations of all the eternities before us.<br><h2><b>How Do We Make Sure We Never Break Eternal Covenants Made in the Temple?</b></h2><br>Knowing of the existence of temples in many dispensations--as recorded in the scriptures--and the necessity of temple ordinances and covenants required to enter into the celestial kingdom, I have often pondered why one who has taken upon them the sacred ordinances and covenants of the temple and has covenanted with their eternal companion as they were sealed for time and eternity in the temple--literally in the presence of God, angels, and witnesses--would ever allow themself to be unfaithful, thus breaking their covenants and in turn breaking the hearts of their companions and children, who were desirous of being an eternal family.<br><br>I have also observed over the years couples who have been able to maintain strong and vital marriages as they remain true to the covenants they take upon themselves in the temple. For those who are not now married, as you prepare for a temple marriage, there is great value in thinking about what makes a good marriage and the kind of person who will be able to make and keep temple covenants. Thinking ahead this way is why successful couples have been able to date and learn to know each other and come to know where the heart of that future companion will be for time and all eternity.<br><br><b>First,</b> these successful couples know individually who they are--a son or daughter of God. They set eternal goals to once again live with our Heavenly Father and His Son Jesus Christ. They strive to leave the ways of the natural man behind.<br><br><b>Second,</b> they know the doctrine and the importance of the saving temple ordinances and temple covenants and their necessity in achieving eternal goals.<br><br><b>Third,</b> they choose to obtain the eternal blessings of the kingdom of God rather than the temporal or temporary possessions of the world.<br><br><b>Fourth,</b> couples realize that when they are sealed for time and all eternity, they have chosen an eternal companion--their courting days are over! There is no need to look any further!<br><br><b>Fifth,</b> couples think of one another before self. Selfishness suffocates spiritual senses. Remember that. Communicating with the Lord in prayer, they grow together and not apart. They converse with each another, thereby never letting little things become big things. They talk early about the "little hurts" with little fear of offending. In this way, when the pressure in the tea kettle builds and the whistle goes off, there is no explosion of bitter feelings. It is so much better to let off a little steam before the top blows off the pressure cooker. They are willing to apologize and ask forgiveness if they have hurt the one they love. They express their love for each other and become closer. Remember, "There is no fear in love." They lift and strengthen one another.<br><h2><b>Closing Summary and Testimony</b></h2><br>If you will live by these observations we have just discussed, it will strengthen your relationship in marriage and allow you to be faithful to your covenants. Might I just share two things that describe a good friend:<br><br>1. A good friend is a good companion. A good friend will never have you choose between their way and the Lord's way.<br><br>2. With a true friend it will be easier to live the laws, ordinances, and covenants we have discussed this day. Such a person is truly a good friend and an eternal companion.<br><br>You are preparing to meet the tests of mortal life. We voluntarily came from the presence of God the Father to this mortal probation with agency, knowing we would have "opposition in all things" (2 Nephi 2:11). Our objective (see 1 Nephi 15:14) is to take upon us the whole armor of God and withstand "the fiery darts of the adversary" (D&amp;amp;C 3:8) with our sword of the Spirit and shield of faith (see D&amp;amp;C 27:15–18), to endure to the end, and to be worthy to stand and live in the presence of God the Father and His Son Jesus Christ for all eternity--to achieve what is called eternal life.<br><br>I give you my testimony that God lives; that Jesus is the Christ; and that Joseph Smith, the prophet of our dispensation, restored the priesthood blessings that allow us to partake of the temple blessings we have discussed. Let me remind you that you are living in the last dispensation of the fulness of times. It is an incredible time to be on the earth. May the Lord's blessings be with you that you may find that special, eternal companion, remaining worthy until that day may come because the promise has been given that in this life or the next, blessings will come to those who remain true and faithful to the laws, ordinances, and covenants we have discussed today. I ask the blessings of the Lord to be with you in all that you do, in all that you say, and in your interactions with those you love and care for. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Robert D.

<h1>ng Out of Heaven”: Joseph Smith and the Forging of Community - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Several weeks ago I received an e-mail from someone who identified himself as a BYU student doing a research paper on the Prophet Joseph Smith. He asked, "Would you be kind enough to share with me what you feel the impact of Joseph Smith and the Book of Mormon on the world has been?"<br><br>This was an important question, so I took time framing my reply. I wrote, "It was big."<br><br>However, upon reflection, I decided against sending that e-mail. I didn't want to do most of his work for him. I thought perhaps I would now revisit that question in a little more depth.<br><br>A few months back I was visiting with a foreign scholar of religion who had a related question for me: "To what do you attribute the remarkable growth of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints?"<br><br>Many people have been asking this question for a few years now. The bicentennial of the Prophet's birth has given many scholars an opportunity to ask these and similar questions in formal settings: at symposia hosted by the Library of Congress in Washington, D.C.; by the New South Wales Parliament in Sydney, Australia; and by the National University of Taiwan in Taipei.<br><br>When Joseph Smith was just a boy of 17, he said an angel appeared to him and declared "that [his] name should be had for good and evil among all nations, kindreds, and tongues, or that it should be both good and evil spoken of among all people."<sup>1</sup> This year in particular has seen that prediction borne out. Secular scholars and Christians, Hindus, Muslims, and presumed atheists--in many nations and in many tongues--speak good of Joseph's name.<br><br>In Sydney, Dr. Kazi Islam, a Muslim and chair of the Department of World Religions, Dhaka University, Bangladesh, explained that he introduced Mormonism as a compulsory part of the master's degree in his department "because of [his] profound love and respect for the ideals" of that tradition Joseph Smith founded.<sup>2</sup><br><br>Dr. Jason Lase, a director general in the Indonesian Department of Religious Affairs, affirmed his belief that Joseph Smith was "a modern religious genius" who created what he called "one of the most stable and well-organized religious organizations" he has ever known.<sup>3</sup><br><br>A few months later, Arun Joshi, a Hindu journalist from India, gave a remarkable talk at the Taipei conference in which he related the experience of the First Vision to the conflicts in Kashmir and the Middle East, concluding, "The message of Joseph Smith is more relevant ... today than ever before."<sup>4</sup><br><br>These are surely exciting developments, and it can be heady stuff for members of a previously marginalized religion of modest size to find their faith and founder the subject of symposia, celebration, and scholarly interest. Some have even predicted a new world religion will emerge out of these accelerating developments. As that researcher had asked me at a conference, "How do you account for this growth?"<br><br>I am, perhaps belatedly, coming to the recognition that the sustained growth of the Church, while impressive, is not itself the greatest legacy of Joseph--or the most significant issue we can investigate. Amway had a phenomenal growth rate.<br><br>There is something else Joseph accomplished--something that is obliquely suggested by the very difficulty of knowing whether to define the people who now revere him as a church, a religion, a culture, an ethnicity, a global tribe, or something else. Joseph succeeded in creating a community with no real parallel--and few precedents--in the history of the world. The Prophet's brother Hyrum tried to capture the unique quality of this society when, a few months before Joseph's death, he said: "Men's souls conform to the society in which they live, with very few exceptions, and when men come to live with the Mormons, their souls swell as if they were going to stride the planets."<sup>5</sup><br><br>It is the quality of this community, not its rate of increase, that is the more vital fact--and the more enduring mystery--of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. So I wish to explore some of the factors that I believe have contributed to the effect that Joseph's message has wrought on the world and on his followers in particular. My remarks are in essence an extended commentary on the truth pronounced by Thomas Carlyle before Joseph's own death. "The Great Man," Carlyle wrote, "was always as lightning out of Heaven; the rest of men waited for him like fuel, and then they too would flame."<sup>6</sup><br><br>What I want to understand, then, is what did Joseph teach, and what did he embody, that did not simply attract a faithful core of followers but that galvanized and welded them into a powerfully cohesive group and that continues to endow a multimillion-member movement with those same bonds and cohesion and vitality today? As Carlyle's quote intimates, there is a dimension to "the Great Man" and his influence that is to be understood historically. And there is a dimension that transcends history in its evocation of that which is universal. Both elements are present in Joseph Smith's case.<br><br>First, it is useful to see Joseph within a particular historical context. A scant dozen years before Joseph's birth, Louis XVI was guillotined by radicals. That may seem an odd counterpoint to a talk about the Mormon Prophet, but Albert Camus called that execution "the crux of our contemporary history."<sup>7</sup> Why? Because it represented a banishment of God from the subsequent history of that people and because it precipitated a steep decline in the fortunes of religion in the West generally. Louis was, after all, supposed to be God's representative by divine right. His premeditated execution represented a deliberate, willful repudiation of God and His role in civic society.<br><br>The revolutions that would occupy America and Europe from 1776 and throughout the next century were occasioned by many factors. But central elements were an irrepressible optimism about human potential, a growing embrace of human dignity and freedom as the birthright of every man, and, in many cases, doubts that such values and aspirations could be compatible with the institutions of the organized church. Lafayette called his violent passion for liberty a "holy madness."<sup>8</sup> Jefferson swore on the altar of God eternal enmity against every form of tyranny over the mind of man. William Wordsworth spoke for millions when he wrote, "Bliss was it in that dawn [of revolution] to be alive, / But to be young was very heaven!"<sup>9</sup> But as the <i>philosophes,</i> French revolutionaries, English radicals, and growing numbers of intellectuals and reflective individuals concluded, dignity and freedom alike were threatened by institutionalized systems of religion that almost universally emphasized human depravity, inherent guilt, and arbitrary omnipotence.<br><br>The result, when it wasn't outright atheism or revolution, was often despair about the irredeemably tragic nature of the human condition. One cannot peruse the poetry of the Romantics without being struck by the soul-agony of an entire generation--drawn more than any other to the possibilities of the sublime, of transcendence, of the beautiful in nature and in humankind, but thwarted and oppressed at every turn by stultifying systems, rigid hierarchies, and inflexible orthodoxies. Thus the common lament of the poets of the age: "Man is of dust," mused the great Wordsworth, but "ethereal hopes are his." "Too, too contracted are these walls of flesh," he mourned, "For any passion of the soul that leads / To ecstasy."<sup>10</sup> Lord Byron's Lucifer taunted the man Cain because Cain was a creature of "high thought [but he was] / Linked to a servile mass of matter."<sup>11</sup> The poet Robert Browning described the quintessentially tragic human plight more simply as the intersection of "infinite passion, and the pain / Of finite hearts that yearn."<sup>12</sup> So they all concluded, with Wordsworth, that "unless above himself he can / Erect himself, how poor a thing is Man!"<sup>13</sup><br><br>Alexis de Tocqueville, in these same years, recorded how he "had seen the spirit of religion and the spirit of freedom almost always move in contrary directions."<sup>14</sup> In Joseph Smith, religion and freedom found their first perfect, seamless synthesis. For it was into this environment that Joseph introduced a reinvented story of human origins, nature, and potential. And in the greatest intellectual fusion of his age, Joseph argued that the majesty of God does not exist at the expense of the dignity of man. He made religion the advocate, rather than the enemy, of all that is best in human yearning. But most important, Joseph promulgated a set of teachings that centered the restored gospel on a correct understanding of the divine nature, of human nature, and of their relationships to each other. That is the knowledge that imbued his followers with an uncommon degree of self-knowledge and shared purpose.<br><h2><b>A Weeping God</b></h2><br>He did this, first and foremost, by his radical reconceptualization of the nature of God. One of my favorite stories concerns a woman named Sarah Edwards, wife of the famous Puritan preacher Jonathan Edwards. He was best known perhaps for his sermon that every early American schoolchild had read: "Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God." He told his audience:<br><br><i>The wrath of God is like great waters that are dammed for the present....</i><br><br><i>The God that holds you over the pit of hell, much as one holds a spider, or some loathsome insect over the fire, abhors you.</i><br><br>And, for the unregenerate, he continued:<br><br><i>When God beholds the ineffable extremity of your case, and sees your torment to be so vastly disproportioned to your strength, and sees how your poor soul is crushed, and sinks down, as it were, into an infinite gloom; he will have no compassion upon you ... ; there shall be no moderation or mercy.</i><sup>15</sup><br><br>I cannot help but wonder how such excesses struck the hearts and minds of tender people everywhere and of Edwards' own devout and loving wife in particular. It so happened that on one occasion when Edwards was out of town, another local preacher came to visit Sarah and her children. He offered to have a prayer with the family, and she agreed. Afterward, she recorded in her journal that while the Reverend Peter Reynolds was offering his prayer, she found herself feeling "an earnest desire that, in calling on God, he should say, <i>Father.</i>" She asked herself, "Can I now at this time, with the confidence of a child, and without the least misgiving of heart, call God my Father?"<br><br>In consequence of this reflection, she recorded, "I felt a strong desire to be alone with God," and withdrew to her chamber. In the moments that followed, she continued:<br><br><i>The presence of God was so near, and so real, that I seemed scarcely conscious of any thing else. God the Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ, seemed as distinct persons, both manifesting their inconceivable loveliness, and mildness, and gentleness, and their great and immutable love to me....</i><br><br><i>The peace and happiness, which I hereupon felt, was altogether inexpressible.</i><sup>16</sup><br><br>Long before Joseph Smith offered his first prayer, thousands and millions of people must have yearned, as Sarah did, for the assurance that God is not the severe, distant, impersonal deity of Jonathan Edwards but the kind, loving, and very personal God that Joseph found in the Sacred Grove. That Joseph experienced this God, that the Book of Mormon testifies of and exemplifies His tender mercies, and that all and sundry are invited and given the means to experience God's presence in the world and in their own lives made belief in a living, personal God a potent and irresistible principle.<br><br>That God has a body of flesh and bones is not the revolutionary teaching. God's physical form is not the point. That God has a heart that beats in sympathy with ours is the truth that catalyzes millions--that He feels real sorrow, rejoices with real gladness, and weeps real tears. This, as Enoch learned, is an awful, terrible, yet infinitely comforting truth.<br><br>Growing organically out of this conception is a new human relationship to the divine that requires a new vocabulary. In 1844 Parley P. Pratt published a little story in the <i>New York Herald</i> entitled "Joe Smith and the Devil." In this story the devil happens upon Joseph, and they have a pleasant conversation. The devil is insisting to the Prophet that he, the devil, is happy to support "all creeds, systems, and forms of Christianity, of whatever name or nature; so long as they leave out that abominable doctrine, which caused me so much trouble in former times, and which, after slumbering for ages, you have again revived; I mean the doctrine of ... "<br><br>And guess what that doctrine was. What do you think Parley P. Pratt and (I think we can safely assume) Joseph Smith himself believed was the single most important doctrine he restored--one to make the devil himself quake in the knowledge that his kingdom was in jeopardy of total collapse? That principle, Pratt wrote, was this: "You have again revived [and this is the devil speaking here] the doctrine of direct communion with God, by new revelation."<sup>17</sup><br><br>Latter-day Saints frequently refer to this principle as personal revelation, but I think that term fails to sufficiently delineate the distinct contours--historically and theologically speaking--of the model Joseph reinstituted. A prominent historian recently wrote in a history of the century before Joseph Smith that the extremes of deists and dissenters alike were happy to accept "religion without its substance, faith without revelation."<sup>18</sup> Another prominent historian of religion wrote that by the modern age, "Revelation in the fully personal sense characteristic of personal agents has been abandoned."<sup>19</sup><br><br>Two characteristics distinguish the revelation Joseph modeled:<br><br><b>First,</b> from his initial inquiry in those New York woods to his last revelations, Joseph's prayers anticipated a personal response, a discernible moment of dialogue or communicated content. This model, which I call dialogic revelation, situates Joseph and the religion he founded well outside Christian understandings of revelation. Even the Christian model that seems closest in spirit to this one, called by Avery Dulles "revelation as inner experience,"<sup>20</sup> differs sharply. Within this model, theologian George Tyrrell wrote that there can be no revealed statements or doctrines.<sup>21</sup> Auguste Sabatier insisted that "the object of the revelation of God can only be God Himself,"<sup>22</sup> and John Baillie insisted that, "according to the Bible, what is revealed to us is not a body of information concerning various things of which we might otherwise be ignorant."<sup>23</sup> Against this backdrop Joseph insisted that prayer frequently and dramatically evokes an answer that is impossible to mistake as anything other than an individualized, dialogic response to a highly particularized question.<br><br><b>Second,</b> the Book of Mormon expands the notion of revelation far beyond the Old Testament model, according to which, as the <i>Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church</i> puts it, "[Prophecy] was pre-eminently the privilege of the prophets."<sup>24</sup> This rupture with Judaeo-Christian precedent occurs most forcefully in 1 Nephi, chapters 10 through 11. Lehi is the patriarch and prophet of his people. In the Old Testament we find that it is to the prophets and patriarchs that revelation comes. So it is only to be expected that when a vision of the tree of life is given, Lehi would be the recipient.<br><br>But Nephi was "desirous also that [he] might see, and hear, and know of these things" for himself (1 Nephi 10:17). When Nephi made his wish known to the Spirit of the Lord, he was asked if he believed the words of his father (see 1 Nephi 11:1–5).<br><br>I don't know this, but I can imagine that at this moment Nephi paused. Perhaps if he said no, the Spirit would rebuke him for disloyalty and faithlessness. But if he said yes, the Spirit might well ask, "Then why not be content to take the word of your prophet and patriarch?"<br><br>When Nephi indicated that he did indeed believe the words of his father, the Spirit broke forth into a virtual psalm of rejoicing, shouting, "Hosanna!" Then Nephi was rewarded, not rebuked, for seeking his own personal revelatory experience (see 1 Nephi 11:5–6). Here we find a dramatic and momentous break with the Old Testament pattern. Revelation, we here learn, is the province of Everyman.<br><br>The subject of that dialogue between the human and the divine finds substantial definition as well. The revelations that come from God to prophets, the great Abraham Heschel wrote, "may be described as <i>exegesis of existence from a divine perspective.</i>"<sup>25</sup> Well, that may be. But not many individuals are concerned, when they kneel in prayer, with "exegesis of existence from a divine perspective." In the Book of Mormon, worried parents, earnest missionaries, befuddled Church leaders, hungry hunters, and inquiring sons all learned the great truth that their concerns--their immediate, quotidian, personal concerns--were God's concerns. And solutions to those proximate concerns are the appropriate subject of divine communication from the heavens. That knowledge binds a people to their God more powerfully than the "exegesis of existence."<br><h2><b>Four Truths About Human Nature</b></h2><br>Joseph's conception of humankind was as radical--and as well timed--as his views on deity and revelation. I am not sure which answered the greater hunger of the seeking soul. Here are the four truths about human nature that Joseph taught that would reinvent man.<br><br>We are, he declared, <i>eternally</i> existent, inherently <i>innocent,</i> boundlessly <i>free,</i> and infinitely <i>perfectible.</i> These notions simply had to have resonated with special force in a time, as I mentioned earlier, when--even more forcefully than in the Renaissance--traditional strictures on man's self-understanding were bursting.<br><br><i>1. Man Is Eternally Existent</i><br><br>Joseph quoted the Savior as saying: "I was in the beginning with the Father. ... Ye were also in the beginning with the Father. ... Intelligence, or the light of truth, was not created or made, neither indeed can be" (D&amp;amp;C 93:21, 23, 29).<sup>26</sup><br><br>Philosophers since Plato had sensed this, poets like Wordsworth had believed this, but Joseph Smith was the first prophet to clearly teach this. But have you considered some of the logical implications of a premortal existence? First, that man lived forever through ages that recede back to an infinite past leads to a second powerful principle.<br><br><i>2. Man Is Inherently Innocent</i><br><br>If we lived as spirit children before the Fall of Adam, then we do not descend from corrupt or fallen parents. As Joseph taught, "Every spirit of man was innocent in the beginning; and God having redeemed man from the fall, men became again, in their infant state, innocent before God" (D&amp;amp;C 93:38).<br><br>A second implication of premortality is equally profound. A British philosopher only pointed out the obvious when he argued that if God created our souls, He "could have prevented all sin by creating us with better natures and in more favourable surroundings. ... Hence we should not be responsible for our sins to God."<sup>27</sup> Thomas Aquinas was one of the first theologians to recognize this problem when he admitted the logical difficulty of finding freedom in a universe where God is the first cause of everything--because, as Aristotle had reasoned, only that which is not created can be free.<sup>28</sup> But if the soul is coeternal with God, as Joseph proposed, then the Gordian knot is severed.<br><br><i>3. Man Is Inherently Free</i><br><br>If man is coeternal with God, agency--or moral freedom--can logically inhere in every human being. And so we find Joseph affirming that "all truth is independent in that sphere in which God has placed it, to act for itself, as all intelligence also; otherwise there is no existence" (D&amp;amp;C 93:30).<br><br><i>4. Man Is Infinitely Perfectible</i><br><br>And, finally, Joseph taught that this perfect moral freedom that God grants to us opens up possibilities that exceed anything the Christians of his day could imagine. He said:<br><br><i>You have got to learn how to make yourselves Gods ... by going from a small capacity to a great capacity, from a small degree to another, from grace to grace, until the resurrection</i> of the dead, <i>from exaltation to exaltation--till you are able to sit in everlasting burnings and everlasting power and glory.</i><sup>29</sup><br><br>In so literally embracing the divine potential in man, Joseph ennobled human nature to such a degree that even the most exuberant Renaissance humanists would have blanched. Parley P. Pratt suggested the profound implications of all this for our relationships to deity and to each other: "Gods, angels, and men are all of one species, one race, one great family, widely diffused among the planetary systems."<sup>30</sup><br><br>The audacity of such a view is the more striking when it is juxtaposed with the teaching of one of the most influential founders of the Christian tradition. Writing 1,500 years ago, Augustine asked, "What could be worse pride than the incredible folly in which I asserted that I was by nature what [God is]?"<sup>31</sup> How significant that Joseph's most potent teaching--the one with the greatest power to found true community by rooting it in a knowledge of relations among men and women and gods as they really are and really can be--should be condemned in the early Christian centuries as the greatest and most dangerous of blasphemies.<br><br>Eternal existence, inherent innocence, perfect freedom, and infinite potential--in the world before Joseph Smith, man was seen as created out of nothing, crippled from his birth with a depraved nature, often enjoying little or no freedom of the will, and limited in his potential by a jealous god. No wonder that by the 19th century some societies were rebelling against kings and church alike, believing that both were an enemy to man and his eternal soul. No wonder that when Joseph taught again these doctrines of human nature, his ideas were like fire on dry kindling.<br><h2><b>The Primacy and Durability of Personal Relationships</b></h2><br>Joseph emphasized the primacy and durability of personal relationships. On the eve of his martyrdom, the Prophet turned to Dr. Willard Richards and said:<br><br><i>"If we go into the cell, will you go in with us?" The doctor answered, "Brother Joseph you did not ask me to cross the river with you--you did not ask me to come to Carthage--you did not ask me to come to jail with you--and do you think I would forsake you now? But I will tell you what I will do; if you are condemned to be hung for treason, I will be hung in your stead, and you shall go free." Joseph said, "You cannot." The doctor replied, "I will."</i><sup>32</sup><br><br>How does one explain the depths of this love and loyalty? Joseph's friends loved him because they knew the extent of his love for them. Nothing in Joseph's life was more important than friendship. When he revealed that the "same sociality which exists among us here will exist among us there [in the eternal world],"<sup>33</sup> Joseph was affirming the fact that heaven is constructed out of a web of human relationships that extend in every direction. By the time his work was done, he had laid the groundwork for men to be sealed to their wives across the eternities; for parents to be sealed to their children and their children's children and to their parents and their parents' parents across infinite generations; and for friends to be bound to friends in a great assembly and Church of the Firstborn. Parley Pratt singled out this dimension to Joseph's teachings as a supreme contribution:<br><br><i>It was Joseph Smith who taught me how to prize the endearing relationships of father and mother, husband and wife; of brother and sister, son and daughter.</i><br><br><i>It was from him that I learned that the wife of my bosom might be secured to me for time and all eternity; and that the refined sympathies and affections which endeared us to each other emanated from the fountain of divine eternal love....</i><br><br><i>I had loved before, but I knew not why. But now I loved--with a pureness--an intensity of elevated, exalted feeling, which would lift my soul from the transitory things of this grovelling sphere and expand it as the ocean.</i><sup>34</sup><br><br>The privileged status of personal relationships was not just incidental to the Restoration; it was a primary focus. As Joseph wrote, "It was my endeavor to so organize the Church, that the brethren might eventually be independent of every incumbrance beneath the celestial kingdom, by bonds and covenants of mutual friendship, and mutual love."<sup>35</sup> When he later stated, with striking brevity, "Friendship is one of the grand fundamental principles of 'Mormonism,'"<sup>36</sup> he was saying something about the deepest underpinnings of Mormon theology. Joseph rejoiced in his relationships to God, family, and friends, and he articulated a system that both revealed their eternal dimension and--this is key--provided the principles, ordinances, and knowledge to render them eternal.<br><br>He wrote in his journal:<br><br><i>How good and glorious it has seemed unto me, to find pure and holy friends, who are faithful, just, and true....</i><br><br><i>In the name of the Lord, I feel in my heart to bless them....</i><br><br><i>... These love the God that I serve; they love the truths that I promulgate....</i><br><br><i>... I ... prayed for them with anxious and fervent desire. ... They shall not want a friend while I live.</i><sup>37</sup><br><br>No wonder he could say truthfully, "Let me be resurrected with the Saints, whether I ascend to heaven or descend to hell."<sup>38</sup><br><br>To others he insisted:<br><br><i>When you &amp;amp; I meet face to face, I anticipate, without the least doubt, that all matters between us will be fairly understood, and perfect love prevail; and [the] sacred covenant by which we are bound together, have the uppermost seat in our hearts.</i><sup>39</sup><br><br>Again, how significant it is that he actually made the affirmation of such bonds into a sacred ritual. Those who attended his School of the Prophets were greeted in this manner:<br><br><i>Art thou a brother or brethren? I salute you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, in token or remembrance of the everlasting covenant, in which covenant I receive you to fellowship, in a determination that is fixed, immovable, and unchangeable, to be your friend and brother through the grace of God in the bonds of love.</i> [D&amp;amp;C 88:133]<br><br>Seeing this project of a timeless and borderless web of human relationships as his objective, one can understand what sociologists and students of religion cannot: how to explain the great secret of how Mormonism became not just another church, not just a thriving institution, but a people for whom the words <i>brother</i> and <i>sister</i> carry more than metaphoric significance. The great appeal of first-generation Christianity, Elaine Pagels has recently written, was the feeling of entering into an extended family community.<sup>40</sup> It was no small feat and not without the highest significance that Joseph successfully replicated the most essential, the most authentically Christian aspect of the primitive Church. That is the true greatness of his legacy: he forged a genuine community.<br><h2><b>A Culture of Certainty</b></h2><br>There is, I think, another aspect of his legacy that shapes the special character of the people who call Joseph "Prophet" and that connects them in a particularly powerful way. That is the possibility of religious certainty that Joseph held out. A man inducted into his religious vocation with a literal visit by an embodied God and Christ is not likely to view his religious convictions in the same terms as a typical Christian believer. Translating scripture out of tangible metal plates weighing 40 or 50 pounds is not of the same order of prophetic utterance as expressing mere spiritual intimations. Feeling the weight of angelic hands belonging to resurrected Apostles on his head--conferring upon him the priesthood of God--produced a crystalline certainty about his authority (the lack of which would drive Roger Williams to abandon his own church). Joseph Smith, in other words, did not simply believe he was a prophet inspired to act in God's name; in his mind he was as certain as any man could be on any subject sacred or secular. "I knew it, and I knew that God knew it,"<sup>41</sup> he said of his initial encounter with deity. Joseph's formative experiences--as a 14-year-old seeker, as a prophet, and as a religion maker--were saturated in the physical, the tangible, the material, and the visible.<br><br><i>Certainty</i> is a term that frequently appears in the ministry of Joseph Smith--often in a doctrinally prominent position. In his <i>Lectures on Faith,</i> which he delivered to the elders in Kirtland, he claimed that from earliest times, faith has been a prelude to sure knowledge:<br><br><i>The inquiry and diligent search of the ancient saints to seek after and obtain a knowledge of the glory of God</i> [was rooted in] <i>the credence they gave to the testimony of their fathers. ... The inquiry frequently terminated, indeed always terminated when rightly pursued, in the most glorious discoveries and eternal certainty.</i><sup>42</sup><br><br>Of his own case he wrote to his wife, "For as much as I know for a certainty of Eternal things if the heveans linger it is nothing to me."<sup>43</sup> It is easy to see why his personal encounter with a conversing deity would ground his own sense of epistemological certainty. But he clearly saw his own experience as a prototype others could--and should--aspire to. An 1833 revelation had the Lord declaring, "Every soul who forsaketh his sins and cometh unto me, and calleth on my name, and obeyeth my voice, and keepeth my commandments, shall see my face and know that I am" (D&amp;amp;C 93:1). This possibility Joseph related to the doctrine of the Second Comforter, spoken of by Christ when He addressed His disciples before His crucifixion. On that occasion He promised that the Father would send them "another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever" (John 14:16).<br><br>Joseph wrote:<br><br><i>When any man obtains this last Comforter, ... the visions of the heavens will be opened unto him, and the Lord will teach him face to face, and he may have a perfect knowledge of the mysteries of the Kingdom of God.</i><sup>44</sup><br><br>Joseph apparently believed that the personal epiphany he experienced in his visitation by the Father and the Son--heralding full immersion in the divine light, with all its epistemological fullness and certainty--betokened an order of knowledge that was the right and destiny of all faithful Saints. That very real possibility informs Mormon life, worship, personal aspirations, and shared purpose. To attend any LDS testimony meeting, for example, is to enter into a rhetorical universe in which a language of calm assurance and confident conviction and even professions of certain knowledge overwhelm the more traditional Christian expressions of common belief. It may well be that this sense of shared knowledge--its possession or pursuit--is an even more potent community builder than shared faith. At the same time, of course, such rhetoric can have its drawbacks. It can convey a sense of smugness or superiority; it can create the tragic impression that with certainty there is no room or need for searching; and it can create discomfort and alienation on the part of those who do not or cannot share in expressions of serene, unconflicted conviction.<br><br>So it is at this point that I want to conclude with a few observations about what happens in the absence of such certainty. Whether faith is a way station on the way to certainty, as it seems to be in Alma's sermon, or the place one's spiritual journey takes one to, it is important that one understand the incalculable significance of faith--of this deliberate gesture of belief--as a defining moral gesture.<br><br>It is true that some people seem born with faith. And many people die with a full complement. My own grandmother spent her last months pining for death because she was the last of her generation; she "missed her people" to an excruciating degree; and she grew more and more disconnected from a world she saw as simply irrelevant, without the power to interest or lay hold upon her. It was striking to watch the world and persons beyond the grave assume, in her mind and in her conversation, a fully fleshed-out texture and presence that utterly displaced the inhabitants of the here and now. Faith did not seem a choice for her. It descended upon her as naturally, irresistibly, and encompassingly as the heavy snowfalls on her upstate New York farm.<br><br>But such a gift I have not found to be common. It would seem that among those who vigorously pursue the life of the mind in particular, who are committed to the scholarly pursuit of knowledge and rational inquiry, faith is as often a casualty as it is a product. The call to faith is a summons to engage the heart, to attune it to resonate in sympathy with principles and values and ideals that we devoutly hope are true, and to have reasonable but not certain grounds for believing them to be true. I am convinced that there must be grounds for doubt as well as belief in order to render the choice more truly a choice--and, therefore, the more deliberate and laden with personal vulnerability and investment. The option to believe must appear on our personal horizon like the fruit of paradise, perched precariously between sets of demands held in dynamic tension. One is, it would seem, always provided with sufficient materials out of which to fashion a life of credible conviction or dismissive denial. We are acted upon, in other words, by appeals to our personal values, our yearnings, our fears, our appetites, and our egos. What we choose to embrace, to be responsive to, is the purest reflection of who we are and what we love. That is why faith, the choice to believe, is, in the final analysis, an action that is positively laden with moral significance.<br><br>I believe that we are--as reflective, thinking, pondering seekers--much like the proverbial ass of Buridan. If you remember, the beast starved to death because he was faced with two equally desirable and equally accessible piles of hay. Having no determinative reason to choose one over the other, he perished in indecision. In the case of us mortals, men and women are confronted with a world in which there are appealing arguments for God as a childish projection, for modern prophets as scheming or deluded imposters, and for modern scriptures as so much fabulous fiction. But there is also compelling evidence that a glorious divinity presides over the cosmos, that God calls and anoints prophets, and that His word and will are made manifest through a sacred canon that is never definitively closed. There is, as with the ass of Buridan, nothing to compel an individual's preference for one over the other. But in the case of us mortals, there <i>is</i> something to tip the scale. There is something to predispose us to a life of faith or a life of unbelief. There is a heart that in these conditions of equilibrium and balance--and only in these conditions of equilibrium and balance, equally "enticed by the one or the other" (2 Nephi 2:16)--is truly free to choose belief or cynicism, faith or faithlessness.<br><br>Why, then, is there more merit--given this perfect balance--in believing in the Christ (and His gospel and prophets) than believing in a false deity or in nothing at all? Perhaps because there is nothing in the universe--or in any possible universe--more perfectly good, absolutely beautiful, and worthy of adoration and emulation than this Christ. A gesture of belief in <i>that</i> direction, a will manifesting itself as a desire to acknowledge <i>His</i> virtues as the paramount qualities of a divided universe, is a response to the best in us, the best and noblest of which the human soul is capable. For we do indeed create gods after our own image--or potential image. And that is an activity endowed with incalculable moral significance.<br><br>As Carlyle said, "The Great Man was always as lightning out of Heaven; the rest of men waited for him like fuel, and then they too would flame."<br><br>Joseph Smith ignited something in thousands of men and women that connects them to God and to each other in powerful ways. In part, this was because he was, like Esther, born to his hour in human history--an hour when the passion for human liberty never burned brighter. His message resonated because it was a stirring, compelling, and exciting synthesis that presented a spiritually hungry humankind with a god, like the god of Plato, who "was good, and the good can never have any jealousy of anything. And being free from jealousy, he desired that all things should be as like himself as they could be."<sup>45</sup> The god of Joseph Smith was not a threat to human potential but a being who gloried in that potential and whose work was to bring it to fruition. That was why Joseph's message resonated and caught hold like a burning fire.<br><br>But his message also flamed forth because millions of men and women have freely chosen to believe. They assayed the opinions of doubters, and they gave a hearing to the critics. Like Brigham Young, they knew Joseph was human and subject to err, but they sampled his words and agreed they tasted like honey. They weighed the beauty of a god and of human origins and a human future unlike anything before imagined. They found reason to doubt, and they found reason to believe. They chose to believe.<br><br><i>Terryl L.

<h1> a Kauri Tree–Like Testimony - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
My dear brothers and sisters and fellow students, I am grateful for the opportunity I have to share some of your time today. I realize that with final exams just around the corner you could have chosen to use this hour for other purposes. Yet you have come to the devotional to listen and continue your education in another way. Congratulations for being here and for balancing your college experience with other important activities.<br><br>As you prepare for finals and wade through the stress and tension that often accompany such preparation, I remind you that the hard work you are now doing will pay off some time in the future. Let me give you an example.<br><br>A story is told about a man who couldn't start his car:<br><br><i>The car simply would not run. The mechanic who was called in lifted the hood, reached inside, gave a twist of the wrist to a little mechanism--and all was well.</i><br><br><i>"What do I owe you?"</i><br><br><i>"One hundred and ten dollars," said the mechanic.</i><br><br><i>"Good heavens!" said the car owner. "That seems like an awful lot for just twisting a little gadget. How do you itemize it?"</i><br><br><i>"Well," said the mechanic, "ten dollars for twisting the little gadget. A hundred dollars for knowing which little gadget to twist."</i><sup>1</sup><br><br>I hope the career you finally choose will adequately compensate you for knowing which little gadget to twist, which chromosome to identify, which notes to play, or which financial model to apply. The list goes on and on. However, I also hope that the financial compensation you receive will not be the only focus you have in your chosen profession. At certain times opportunities will arise for you to give service to others. When those opportunities knock, I encourage you--metaphorically speaking--to open the hood, reach inside, fix the problem, start the car, smile at the owner, and extend your hand--not for money, but to give a warm handshake of fellowship and service to another.<br><br>I would like to share another short story that may also prompt you to think carefully about the secular and spiritual education you are receiving during these years at BYU:<br><br><i>When James A. Garfield, once president of the United States, was the president of Hiram College, a father brought his son for admittance as a student. The father wanted the boy to take a course </i>[of study] <i>shorter than the one offered and exclaimed: "He can never take all that in! He wants to get through quicker. Can you arrange it for him?"</i><br><br><i>"Oh, yes," replied President Garfield. "He can take a shorter course. It all depends on what you want to make of him. When God wants to make an oak, he takes one hundred years, but he only takes two months to make a squash."</i><sup>2</sup><br><br>My guess is that we are all about growing oak trees here at BYU, not squash. (No offense to the humble squash.) It is clear that constant effort and attention over an extended period of time is required to graduate from this institution. It is also clear that BYU has a personal interest in the development and graduation of good leaders who have strong testimonies and who will make meaningful contributions in the Church, in their homes, and in their local communities. This type of development will obviously take more time than is required to grow a squash.<br><br>Now, if we were in New Zealand, my home, we would exchange the type of tree under discussion from oak to kauri--the kauri being the largest tree in the forest there. When I think of an individual who embodies all of the characteristics of the kauri tree, I automatically think of Elder Matthew Cowley.<br><br>For many, the stories about Elder Cowley's work in New Zealand--first as a young missionary, then as a mission president, and finally as an apostle--are legendary. I wish we could spend all day laughing and crying about his experiences in the mission field, but time will not permit. However, I mention Elder Cowley here because he was much loved by the Maori people of New Zealand. They loved him because of his testimony and the tremendous spiritual power that his testimony gave him. Here is a short excerpt from Elder Cowley's patriarchal blessing that can help us better understand his prophetic calling:<br><br><i>Thou shalt become an ambassador of Christ to the uttermost bounds of the earth. ... You shall be sent as a delegate to the ten tribes and will become a leader and an interpreter in the midst of that people, and because of the power of God that shall be with you, and the blessings of the Almighty, you shall be greatly beloved by that people.</i><sup>3</sup><br><br>The love and adoration the local people had for Elder Cowley often caused them to draw analogies from nature about his great abilities. For example, the people would often refer to him as Matiu Kauri, rather than Matthew Cowley. The name <i>Kauri</i> was a direct reference to the mightiest and strongest tree in the forests of New Zealand. Because the kauri tree takes many hundreds of years to grow to maturity, many of the local people consider it to be wise and sacred because of all that it is able to observe while growing. Using the name <i>Kauri</i> instead of <i>Cowley,</i> therefore, was an intentional effort to identify Elder Cowley's great humility and wisdom while also describing his understanding of sacred matters and his ability to provide shade and protection through the gospel of Jesus Christ to all who sought shelter from the world. The name <i>Kauri</i> was also an expression of respect from the people, who knew that Matiu Kauri always stood tall, without fear, in defense of truth. They knew that Elder Cowley had an unshakable testimony, and they believed him, especially when he proclaimed his witness of Jesus Christ, living prophets, and the Book of Mormon.<br><br>In her autobiography Elder Cowley's wife, Elva, identified the source of her husband's strength and testimony when she wrote:<br><br><i>He had prophetic vision. He had a strong character and knew what was right. He didn't waver from the truth. ... He was morally clean and hated dishonesty and infidelity. He had ... faith that helped him perform miracles.</i><sup>4</sup><br><br>Today as I speak and encourage you in your academic efforts, I also remind you to give equal attention to your spiritual development during this time of great growth. Your spiritual development, particularly the development of a firm Matiu Kauri–like testimony, will be of great value to you in perilous times.<br><h2><b>Introduction</b></h2><br>Let me now speak specifically about testimony. On this subject Elder Richard G. Scott said:<br><br><i>As you fortify your own personal testimony, you will have power to make correct choices so that you can stand unwaveringly against the pressures of an increasingly vicious world. Your personal security and happiness depend upon the strength of your testimony, for it will guide your actions in times of trial or uncertainty.</i><sup>5</sup><br><br>What a wonderful blessing a testimony can be if we are willing to exercise the faith necessary to acquire one and then live accordingly to strengthen it. As we strive to strengthen our testimonies, we are promised additional power to withstand the temptations of the world--a world that has forgotten the commandments of their Creator and Savior. Because personal security and happiness are dependent upon the strength of our testimony, our view of troubling world events will then be tempered by the quiet assurance that comes from actually knowing that God is in charge of the program.<br><br>No wonder, then, that as the challenges of the world increase, the voice of a living prophet, President Gordon B. Hinckley, remains calm and steady in a time of great turmoil. In response to some of the challenges that have recently come upon us, he said:<br><br><i>There is still so much of conflict in the world. There is terrible poverty, disease, and hatred. Man is still brutal in his inhumanity to man. Yet there is this glorious dawn. The "Sun of righteousness" has come "with healing in his wings" (Malachi 4:2). God and His Beloved Son have revealed Themselves. We know Them ... "in spirit and in truth" (John 4:24). We love Them. We honor Them and seek to do Their will.</i><sup>6</sup><br><br>How different President Hinckley's message is compared to that the doomsdayers and alarmists who run around screaming that the sky is falling. Instead of being caught up in the motivated mass of indirection that these individuals create, we would be wise to carefully listen and obediently follow the counsel of a living prophet. In doing so, we can find peace, security, and happiness.<br><h2><b>Elements of a Living Testimony</b></h2><br>Now, if we are to gain and sustain a testimony that will "guide [our] actions in times of trial or uncertainty," what, then, are the basic elements of a living testimony? More than 40 years ago Elder Bruce R. McConkie wrote the following:<br><br><i>Three great truths must be included in every valid testimony: 1. That Jesus Christ is the Son of God and the Savior of the world (D. &amp;amp; C. 46:13); 2. That Joseph Smith is the Prophet of God through whom the gospel was restored in this dispensation; and 3. That The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is "the only true and living church upon the face of the whole earth." (D. &amp;amp; C. 1:30.)</i><sup>7</sup><br><br>More recently, in a general conference address entitled "Pure Testimony," Elder M. Russell Ballard also taught us about these important truths and further emphasized the need for us to develop a testimony of the Book of Mormon. He said we need to<br><br><i>testify God is our Father and Jesus is the Christ. The plan of salvation is centered on the Savior's Atonement. Joseph Smith restored the fulness of the everlasting gospel of Jesus Christ, and the Book of Mormon is evidence that our testimony is true.</i><sup>8</sup><br><h2><b>Example of a Testimony</b></h2><br>As an example of how these important elements of testimony can be organized, I now would like to bear my testimony to you. I realize that the format of a testimony is already familiar to most of you. Nevertheless, I hope that you will be patient with me. As you listen, ask yourself three questions:<br><br>1. How can I acquire or fortify my own testimony?<br><br>2. How can my testimony guide my actions and help me to make good decisions in times of trial or uncertainty?<br><br>3. How can my testimony help me to find true peace and happiness in this world?<br><h2><b>Jesus: The Son of God and Savior of the World</b></h2><br>My dear brothers and sisters, I know that Jesus Christ is the Son of God. He was born into this world as the Only Begotten of the Father. He died for us. He was resurrected. And He will soon come again to reign upon this earth. I know that through the Atonement and the Resurrection He provided a way for me to return home to the Father. I do not understand the depth or breadth of His great atoning sacrifice. Nor do I claim anything close to a complete understanding about the suffering that He endured in Gethsemane. But I do know that the Atonement has had influence upon me in a very personal way.<br><br>The metaphor of the olive press has been helpful to me in describing the great suffering that began in Gethsemane and ended on Calvary. Through this metaphor my finite mind is given "spiritual spectacles," which allow me to see and better understand the infinite and eternal nature of the Atonement.<br><br>From what I have learned, the process of extracting oil from olives begins with the picking, bruising, and crushing of the fruit. The crushed and broken fruit is then collected into baskets, which are stacked one upon the other. These are then placed under the press, where tremendous pressure is applied to them. This process slowly crushes the oil from the fruit. The pressure that is applied is firm and fierce, steadily increasing over time until the red-stained oil contained therein is extracted from the once unblemished fruit.<br><br>I cannot comprehend the absolute loneliness that accompanied our Elder Brother that night--a loneliness that by itself was terrible, a loneliness that increased from Gethsemane to Calvary as the sins of a dying world were heaped upon Him and ransomed one by one. In section 19 of the Doctrine and Covenants we read a very personal account of this sacred experience:<br><br><i>For behold, I, God, have suffered these things for all, that they might not suffer if they would repent....</i><br><br><i>Which suffering caused myself, even God, the greatest of all, to tremble because of pain, and to bleed at every pore, and to suffer both body and spirit--and would that I might not drink the bitter cup, and shrink.</i><sup>9</sup><br><br>I also know that three days following the death of Christ, in stark contrast to the physical and spiritual suffering of Gethsemane and Calvary, came the good news of the Savior's empty tomb. As reported in the book of Matthew, Mary Magdalene and Mary, the mother of Jesus, visited the sepulchre where the body of Christ had been laid:<br><br><i>And, behold, ... the angel of the Lord descended from heaven, and came and rolled back the stone from the door....</i><br><br><i>His countenance was like lightning, and his raiment white as snow:</i><br><br><i>And ... the keepers did shake, and became as dead men.</i><br><br><i>And the angel answered and said unto the women, Fear not ye: for I know that ye seek Jesus, which was crucified.</i><br><br><i>He is not here: for he is risen.</i><sup>10</sup><br><br>The declaration "He is not here: for he is risen" carried with it a new understanding of a physical resurrection and the hope of a spiritual redemption made possible by the Savior's personal triumph over both deaths. He will come again--in great glory and majesty--in a way that will cause our minds to open and reflect upon all that He has done for us. Elder Neal A. Maxwell said of that day:<br><br><i>No wonder, when Christ comes in power and glory, that He will come in reminding red attire ..., signifying not only the winepress of wrath, but also to bring to our remembrance how He suffered for each of us in Gethsemane and on Calvary!</i><sup>11</sup><br><br>My dear brothers and sisters, my testimony is that I know God lives and He will come again.<br><h2><b>Joseph Smith: A Prophet of God</b></h2><br>I also know Joseph Smith is a prophet of God. Heeding sacred promptings by the Spirit, this young boy responded to a seemingly obscure biblical passage in the book of James that reads:<br><br><i>If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.</i><sup>12</sup><br><br>This prompted a humble prayer and a mighty revelation that would change the world. Oh, how lovely was that morning when Joseph, "humbly kneeling, sweet appealing," prayed to a God the world had forgotten!<sup>13</sup> How appropriate that his humble prayer was answered with a splendid vision of God the Eternal Father and His Son, Jesus Christ.<br><br>This First Vision and the accompanying doctrinal significance of the actual appearance of a living, tangible God was no small matter, especially considering the variety of religious ideas--mixed with the philosophies of men--that were circulating through Joseph's community. Much like Paul and his experience among the idol worshippers of Athens, Joseph would soon be criticized and persecuted by modern-day philosophers for his beliefs. If you reflect back on Paul's experience in Athens and compare it to Brother Joseph's experience in New York, you'll see that things do not change much when you challenge the philosophies of men.<br><br>In Acts, chapter 17, Paul discussed the nature of God with some of the local philosophers referred to as Stoics and other prominent leaders of the time. Soon, frustrated with Paul, some of the Athenian elite began referring to him as a "babbler," saying:<br><br><i>He seemeth to be a setter forth of strange gods: because he preached unto them Jesus, and the resurrection.</i><sup>14</sup><br><br>Still others questioned, saying:<br><br><i>May we know what this new doctrine, whereof thou speakest, is?</i><br><br><i>For thou bringest certain strange things to our ears: we would know therefore what these things mean.</i><sup>15</sup><br><br>Paul, standing on Mars' hill, an area where the highest judicial authority of Athens met regularly in council, said to his dissenters:<br><br><i>Ye men of Athens, I perceive that in all things ye are too superstitious.</i><br><br><i>For as I passed by, and beheld your devotions, I found an altar with this inscription, TO THE UNKNOWN GOD. Whom therefore ye ignorantly worship, him declare I unto you.</i><sup>16</sup><br><br>Again, Joseph's experience with modern-day Stoics and unbelievers finds a number of interesting parallels with Paul's experience centuries ago. For example, after hearing about the First Vision, preachers in Palmyra soon claimed that the heavens were closed, that Joseph was a false prophet, and that he, too, like Paul, was "a setter forth of strange gods: because he preached unto them Jesus, and the resurrection." As Joseph described it, certain individuals<br><br><i>treated my communication not only lightly, but with great contempt, saying it was all of the devil, that there were no such things as visions or revelations in these days; that all such things had ceased with the apostles, and that there would never be any more of them.</i><sup>17</sup><br><br>Like Paul of Tarsus, Joseph also stood in the midst of a hill--not Mars' hill but a heavenly appointed place of council called the Hill Cumorah. From that position he proclaimed the religious teachings of his time to be, at the very least, superstitious, if not completely founded upon the philosophies of men. His report was rejected as heresy, but it remains as an undeniable testimony of the truth that has been restored in these latter days. Joseph said of this experience:<br><br><i>I saw two Personages, and they did in reality speak to me; and though I was hated and persecuted for saying that I had seen a vision, yet it was true. ... I had seen a vision; I knew it, and I knew that God knew it, and I could not deny it.</i><sup>18</sup><br><br>Having investigated a number of religious sects and having familiarized himself with their various devotions, altar inscriptions, and teachings about an unknown god, Brother Joseph and his vision burst upon the world and opened the minds of men long darkened by apostasy. His testimony, through the gift and power of God, declared to the religious leaders of his day and ours: "Whom therefore ye ignorantly worship, him declare I unto you."<br><br>Brother Joseph represents the fulfillment of prophecies made long ago by biblical and Book of Mormon prophets. I add my voice to the many who have sung, who are singing, and who will yet sing:<br><br><i>Praise to the man who communed with Jehovah!</i><br><br><i>Jesus anointed that Prophet and Seer.</i><br><br><i>Blessed to open the last dispensation,</i><br><br><i>Kings shall extol him, and nations revere.</i><br><br><i>Hail to the Prophet, ascended to heaven!</i><br><br><i>Traitors and tyrants now fight him in vain.</i><br><br><i>Mingling with Gods, he can plan for his brethren;</i><br><br><i>Death cannot conquer the hero again.</i><sup>19</sup><br><br>My testimony is that I know Joseph Smith is a prophet of God and he restored the fullness of the everlasting gospel in these latter days.<br><h2><b>The Book of Mormon: Another Testament of Jesus Christ</b></h2><br>My dear brothers and sisters, I know the Book of Mormon is true. I know through a series of heavenly manifestations, oft-repeated instruction, and a period of waiting and preparation that the angel Moroni delivered a book into Joseph's care that was<br><br><i>written upon gold plates, giving an account of the former inhabitants of this continent, and the source from whence they sprang. He also said that the fulness of the everlasting Gospel was contained in it, as delivered by the Savior to the ancient inhabitants</i> [of this land].<sup>20</sup><br><br>I know that through the gift and power of God the gold plates that Brother Joseph received were translated into what we know today as the Book of Mormon.<br><br>My dear brothers and sisters, the Book of Mormon is true! It is a record of my people--the children of Father Lehi--and of the Jaredite nation. Although I am from New Zealand, I claim Father Lehi, his hometown of Jerusalem, and the surrounding geographic areas in which he traversed and prophesied as part of my heritage. I also claim these Americas and the original peoples of this continent as part of my heritage. But that history and accompanying heritage is not the most important aspect of the Book of Mormon for me. Rather, it is the testimony of Christ contained within its pages that is most important. The Book of Mormon's role as another testament of Jesus Christ stands as its most important feature. As expressed by Elder Russell M. Nelson, "By comparison, all other issues are incidental."<sup>21</sup><br><br>No wonder then that the testimonies recorded in its pages about the visit of the resurrected Savior to the people of this continent are so precious. After reading about the wars, contentions, conflicts, turmoil, spiritual struggles, and disobedience of my ancestors, no better evidence can be given of the Savior's love for them than when, following His Resurrection and appearance to the people of our original homeland in the Eastern Hemisphere, He personally visited and ministered to the remnant of the house of Israel here in the Western Hemisphere. Listen again to the account Nephi made of that visit:<br><br><i>And it came to pass that he stretched forth his hand and spake unto the people, saying:</i><br><br><i>Behold, I am Jesus Christ, whom the prophets testified shall come into the world.</i><br><br><i>And behold, I am the light and the life of the world....</i><br><br><i>Arise and come forth unto me, that ye may thrust your hands into my side, and also that ye may feel the prints of the nails in my hands and in my feet, that ye may know that I am the God of Israel, and the God of the whole earth, and have been slain for the sins of the world.</i><br><br><i>And it came to pass that the multitude went forth, and thrust their hands into his side, and did feel the prints of the nails in his hands and in his feet; and this they did do, going forth one by one until they had all gone forth, and did see with their eyes and did feel with their hands, and did know of a surety and did bear record, that it was he, of whom it was written by the prophets, that should come.</i><sup>22</sup><br><br>Certainly Elder Nelson is correct: "By comparison, all other issues are incidental" to the multiple witnesses the Book of Mormon provides that Jesus Christ lives.<br><br>My testimony is that I know the Book of Mormon is true. It is another testament of Jesus Christ.<br><h2><b>Conclusion</b></h2><br>Now I have finished bearing my testimony and included each of the elements identified by Elders Ballard and McConkie. As you have been listening, I hope you have been thinking about your own testimony and the blessings promised by Elder Scott.<br><br>As I close, I pray the Lord's choicest blessings upon you as you strive to gain or strengthen your own testimony. I pray your testimony will become strong and firm like the mighty kauri tree and--because of your honesty, fidelity, and honorable living--that your testimony will develop within you a level of Matthew Cowley–like faith, humility, and love that will allow you to recognize and perform miracles in your own life and in the lives of others. I also pray that through your testimony you will have the power to make correct choices so that you will be able to "stand unwaveringly against the pressures of an increasingly vicious world." Finally, with the Christmas season that is now upon us, I pray you will, through a testimony of faith, find the same peace, security, and happiness the great Matiu Kauri found in the knowledge that God lives, is mindful of you, and loves you. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Vernon L. Heperi was dean of students at BYU when this devotional address was given on 6 December 2005.</i><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>1.
