<h1> Henry B. Eyring - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I am grateful to be with you. Those who speak to you sometimes ask for your prayers to sustain them in their efforts. I ask that of you tonight with a special urgency and for a specific purpose.<br><br>Years ago I served as the bishop of a ward composed of young people. Time has wiped away much of what I learned then of their sorrows and mistakes, but I can still see in my mind most of their faces. I meet some of them as I travel about the world. Their faces and their physiques have been changed enough by time that I sometimes stumble trying to remember names. Others I have followed more closely, with a chance to know what life has offered them. When I learn of their lives, I am amazed at the variety of their experiences. Each life seems to be unique. About all they have in common, as nearly as I can tell, is that they have been surprised by the pattern of the tests of their faith. The surprise has come because they could not know when the tests would come, what they would be, nor how long they would last.<br><br>For a few, the tests are over. For some of the members of that ward, the tests ended early. I was reminded of one young man the other day. For me his face will always be young and bright with hope. He left our ward for a mission in Japan. Decades later I mentioned his name in a talk I gave to a group of Latter-day Saints in Tokyo. After the meeting a number of members came to me, their faces shining with the brightness that I remember in his face when he returned from his mission. They told that he was "their" missionary. If I understood their English, they said that he was the greatest missionary they had ever known.<br><br>I was released as the bishop when our family was asked to move to another state. I kept track of that missionary enough to know that he had graduated from college, applied to medical school, and been accepted. I did not know his plans for the summer before he began medical school, but I am sure that he looked forward with great anticipation to the years ahead.<br><br>A phone rang where we then lived, and I learned that he had been killed. He and friends had gone to climb a peak in the Wind River Range in the western United States. I was invited to speak at his funeral. I asked some of the young men who had been climbing with him, friends from our old ward family, to meet me at the chapel where the service would begin in a few minutes. We went to a room to be alone. After we had renewed our acquaintance, I asked if they would tell me something about our friend's life. I think they knew why.<br><br>I wished to speak in the funeral about him and his life. They knew how much I had admired him. They also knew that I had not seen him nor spoken with him for a few years. They knew that I wanted to praise him but that the praise had to be true.<br><br>They told me this story: They had camped the night in preparation for the ascent to the peak. As they climbed, high on the face of the mountain, a storm came upon them. They could not see their way because of the clouds and the storm. Our friend had volunteered to go alone to find the path. He didn't come back. They found later that he had fallen to his death, trying to save his friends.<br><br>Then, without my prompting with a question, they told me of more than his courage. They told me of where he had been on the trail of faith. They said that the night before the climb, while others had talked quietly and prepared for sleep, he had been studying his scriptures and his missionary lessons, in Japanese.<br><br>I suppose that in the time after his mission he had the trials and the temptations that are common to returning missionaries. The fact that he had applied to medical school makes it clear to me that he thought the tests of life stretched far ahead of him. Yet when life ended, he was ready. I think of him often. A stake president, who was his friend in youth, met me the other day in Virginia. I heard the same sound of love and awe in his voice that I heard from the members in Tokyo and from the fellow mountain climbers.<br><br>When such a life touches ours, we are never the same again. We want somehow to be as constant in our faith as he was. We want to know the way to endure whatever surprises life may give us, always ready with the power to pass the tests that come, always faithful, whatever the tests--to the end, whenever that may come.<br><br>The Savior has used the word<i>always</i>in two settings that must have caused you to wonder. The first setting is in every sacrament meeting. The word<i>always</i>is used in a covenant, a sacred promise with God, that you are making. This is what you hear, read by authorized servants of God: "That they are willing to take upon them the name of thy Son, and<i>always</i>remember him and keep his commandments which he has given them; that they may always have his Spirit to be with them. Amen" (D&amp;amp;C 20:77; emphasis added).<br><br>Another setting in which the word<i>always</i>is used is in a commandment. The Lord repeats the command often with only slight variations. Here is one of them: "Behold, verily, verily, I say unto you, ye must watch and pray<i>always</i>lest ye enter into temptation; for Satan desireth to have you, that he may sift you as wheat" (3 Nephi 18:18; emphasis added).<br><br>You promise<i>always</i>to remember Him. And He warns you to pray<i>always</i>. You may have wondered, as have I, why He used the word<i>always,</i>given the nature of mortality as it weighs upon us. Just think of what will press upon you when this meeting is over and, to be realistic, may be pressing into the minds of some of you at this moment. You will have to get somewhere, you will likely have to do something, or at least you promised to do something, before the night is over. You may even be thinking about some people you will be with or that you might like to be with, if you could just arrange it. Thoughts like that, and many others, may be shuttling through your mind now and will as soon as you leave. You know from experience how hard it is to think of anything consciously all the time.<br><br>I asked you to pray for me as we began. Some of you took a few seconds, or even longer, to utter a silent prayer for me and for our time together, that we might have the Spirit and that we might be taught. And yet for your prayer to be answered it will be necessary for you to turn your attention to listening. Even in this meeting, or in any service to God, you will not be consciously praying--always. So, what does the Master mean when He warns us to "pray always"?<br><br>I am not wise enough to know all of His purposes in giving us a covenant to always remember Him and in His warning us to pray always lest we be overcome. But I know one. It is because He knows perfectly the powerful forces that influence us and also what it means to be human.<br><br>You and I can see evidence of the acceleration in the two great opposing forces around us. One is the force of righteousness. For instance, temples of God are being built at a rate across the earth that just a few years ago would have been unthinkable. Missionaries are being called in numbers and to new places which change so rapidly that I have learned not to try to give the numbers or the places because my knowledge of the changing facts will have fallen behind the reality. Leaders of nations and opinion makers in the media seem to see that which was prophesied in the infant days of the Church by the Lord, in these words given to the Prophet Joseph Smith:<br><br><i>And also those to whom these commandments were given, might have power to lay the foundation of this church, and to bring it forth out of obscurity and out of darkness, the only true and living church upon the face of the whole earth, with which I, the Lord, am well pleased, speaking unto the church collectively and not individually.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 1:30]<br><br>Even the world can see the emergence of a power beyond what might have been reasonably predicted. Yet few seem to recognize that the power stems not from organization or programs or wealth. Rather, it comes from individual hearts changed by the faith to keep the commandments of the gospel of Jesus Christ.<br><br><b>Opposing Forces</b><br><br>As has always been true, there is an opposing power. It is the power of sin, and it is visibly accelerating. I will not try to bring examples to your minds. The media and what you see in the lives of those around you present you with tragedy enough. And even in your experience, you surely must sense the ominous increase of toleration and even encouragement of the powers of sin to corrupt and torment. More and more we see the reality of this description:<br><br><i>Wherefore, men are free according to the flesh; and all things are given them which are expedient unto man. And they are free to choose liberty and eternal life, through the great Mediator of all men, or to choose captivity and death, according to the captivity and power of the devil; for he seeketh that all men might be miserable like unto himself.</i>[2 Nephi 2:27]<br><br>The Master not only foresees perfectly the growing power of those opposing forces but what it is like to be mortal. He knows what it is like to have the cares of life press in upon us. He knows that we are to eat bread by the sweat of our brows and what cares, concerns, and even sorrows come from the command to bring children into the earth. And He knows that both the trials we face and our human powers to deal with them ebb and flow. He knows what it is for a missionary to arrive in a strange country, perhaps try to speak a new language, eat unfamiliar food, work until fatigue almost overwhelms, be rejected often, savor the moments when the miracle of the gospel changing lives occurs, and then return home to face another set of challenges and changes. And He knows how our human powers to cope are not constant.<br><br>He knows the mistake we can so easily make. It is to underestimate the forces working on us and to rely too much on our human powers. And so He offers us the covenant to always remember Him and the warning to pray always so that we will place our reliance on Him, our only safety. It is not hard to know what to do. The very difficulty of remembering<i>always</i>and praying<i>always</i>is a needed spur to<i>try harder.</i>The danger lies in delay or drift.<br><br>Years ago, one of the things we taught the people we met as missionaries was that they must either progress or they would fall back spiritually. We told them it was dangerous to think that they could stand still. I remember feeling that it was true, and yet I wondered why it was so. Time has taught me. As the forces around us increase in intensity, whatever spiritual strength was once sufficient will not be enough. And whatever growth in spiritual strength we once thought was possible, greater growth will be made available to us. Both the need for spiritual strength and the opportunity to acquire it will increase at rates which we underestimate at our peril.<br><br>Time has also taught me something about the ebb and flow of our own powers and of how we may not notice that change. At Christmastime one of our married sons stayed with his wife and baby in our basement guest room. He found there a daily journal I had kept as a young father, not much older than many of you. I had forgotten it was there and what it contained. At dinner my son began to recount what he had read there of my experiences with him and his brothers and of my straining to live a little better, to have the Atonement work more fully in my life, and to become what I needed to be. He had read of my working intensely and praying earnestly into the early hours of the morning. As he spoke, I thought of some of you.<br><br>You may come upon your missionary journals put away in a closet in your home. You may read and feel a shock as you remember how hard you worked, how constantly you thought of the Savior and His sacrifice for you and for those you tried to meet and teach, and how fervently and often you prayed. The shock will come from realizing how much the cares of life have taken you from where you once were, so close to always remembering and always praying.<br><h2><b>Move Forward Spiritually</b></h2><br>My message is a plea, a warning, and a promise.<br><br>I plead with you to do the simple things with determination that will move you forward spiritually.<br><br>Start with remembering Him. You will remember what you know and what you love. The Savior gave us the scriptures, paid by prophets at a price we cannot measure, so that we could know Him. Lose yourself in them. Decide now to read more and more effectively than you have ever done before.<br><br>Just last month I learned again the power that comes from trying harder to have the scriptures opened to our hearts. It began when I noticed the scriptures of a man sitting next to me in a meeting. He opened them as the discussion progressed, and I could see that they were marked, as I had done, but with a difference. He had placed colored tags on the edges of pages, keyed to the colors in which he had marked the scriptures. I asked him after the meeting to tell me about it. He showed me the front of his scriptures where he had placed a typed page. On that page were topics about the gospel, each with a line under it. And he had placed the colored markers on the edge of the scriptures, one color for each topic, so that he could study all the scriptures that were helpful to him on that topic.<br><br>Within a day I had purchased an inexpensive set of scriptures. But it took more than a few days and more than a few prayers for me to know the topics that would open the scriptures anew for me. I chose the topics that would teach me of my call to be a witness of Jesus Christ. The first topic is the witness that Jesus Christ is the Son of God; the next is that He is risen; and the third is that He is the head of His Church. I would not urge you to buy a new set of scriptures, nor to get colored tags and colored pencils, nor to choose the topics that I chose. But I plead with you to return to the scriptures in some way that opens your mind and heart to be taught.<br><br>Many of the scriptures have become familiar to us. Yet in just a few weeks what I remember now about the Savior, and what I feel about Him, have been enriched.<br><br>I began to read with purpose. Perhaps it was because of the Christmas season. Perhaps it was because I wanted always to remember Him. But I found myself drawn to the accounts of His birth. I read again His words, spoken to a prophet named Nephi, recorded in the Book of Mormon, familiar to us all. And yet it seemed new to me:<br><br><i>Behold, I come unto my own, to fulfil all things which I have made known unto the children of men from the foundation of the world, and to do the will, both of the Father and of the Son--of the Father because of me, and of the Son because of my flesh. And behold, the time is at hand, and this night shall the sign be given.</i><br><br><i>And it came to pass that the words which came unto Nephi were fulfilled, according as they had been spoken; for behold, at the going down of the sun there was no darkness; and the people began to be astonished because there was no darkness when the night came.</i>[3 Nephi 1:14–15]<br><br>And then, because my mind was set to try to know more of Him, I noticed in my reading another scripture that had somehow never before caught my eye. It is in Zechariah, not a frequent stopping place unless you are on a search. Zechariah prophesied of the Second Coming of the Savior with these words: "But it shall be one day which shall be known to the Lord, not day, nor night: but it shall come to pass, that at evening time it shall be light" (Zechariah 14:7).<br><br>In our little family Christmas pageant one of the children has usually played the part of Samuel, the Lamanite prophet, foretelling the sign of the Savior's birth. This year was our most successful pageant, at least for Samuel, because at last we succeeded in persuading the people playing the part of the mob not to hit him with the tinfoil stones they threw at him. So this year we were scripturally accurate.<br><br>But something else was new for me this year. As I had never done before, I felt that I saw in my mind and felt in my heart the fulfillment of Samuel's prophecy that the sun would set without darkness. I saw it at His birth, as if I were somewhere among the people in these lands of promise. And I saw it as it will be when He comes to stand, in resurrected glory, on the Mount of Olives. The darkness is dispelled when the promised Messiah comes with healing in His wings. Knowing how much I need that healing, my heart nearly bursts with joy and love for Him at the thought of that light. I believe I will never see white lights at Christmas again or the dawning of a new day, as the sun banishes darkness, without the sight triggering love in my heart for Him.<br><br>I have learned from that journey again through the scriptures and my increase in love for Him something about always remembering. Fathers and mothers who love their children already know it. It is this: The child may be absent. The cares of the day may be great. Yet love for the child can be ever present in the heart of the parent, coloring and shaping every word, every act, and every choice. I don't know all that is meant by this passage of scripture, but at least part of it is about the possibility of a change in our hearts, that our love of the Savior might always be there and growing:<br><br><i>But charity is the pure love of Christ, and it endureth forever; and whoso is found possessed of it at the last day, it shall be well with him.</i><br><br><i>Wherefore, my beloved brethren, pray unto the Father with all the energy of heart, that ye may be filled with this love, which he hath bestowed upon all who are true followers of his Son, Jesus Christ; that ye may become the sons of God; that when he shall appear we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is; that we may have this hope; that we may be purified even as he is pure. Amen.</i>[Moroni 7:47–48]<br><h2><b>Always</b></h2><br>Now I also plead with you to be determined to pray with all the energy of your heart, that you might have every gift that a loving Heavenly Father knows you must have to serve His Son and to endure against the powers of darkness.<br><br>Just as you can have love in your heart always, your heart can be drawn out in prayer--always.<br><br>You remember that you were promised that very power, which can become greater in times of greater need. This is the Master's command through a prophet:<br><br><i>Yea, humble yourselves, and continue in prayer unto him.</i><br><br><i>Cry unto him when ye are in your fields, yea, over all your flocks.</i><br><br><i>Cry unto him in your houses, yea, over all your household, both morning, mid-day, and evening.</i><br><br><i>Yea, cry unto him against the power of your enemies.</i><br><br><i>Yea, cry unto him against the devil, who is an enemy to all righteousness.</i><br><br><i>Cry unto him over the crops of your fields, that ye may prosper in them.</i><br><br><i>Cry over the flocks of your fields, that they may increase.</i><br><br><i>But this is not all; ye must pour out your souls in your closets, and your secret places, and in your wilderness.</i><br><br><i>Yea, and when you do not cry unto the Lord, let your</i>hearts<i>be full, drawn out in prayer unto him continually for your welfare, and also for the welfare of those who are around you.</i>[Alma 34:19–27; emphasis added]<br><br>The Lord has given us touching evidence of the power of such prayers of the heart. You have read in the Book of Mormon of the people of Alma the Elder who would have been destroyed had they prayed openly:<br><br><i>And Alma and his people did not raise their voices to the Lord their God, but did pour out their hearts to him; and he did know the thoughts of their hearts.</i><br><br><i>And it came to pass that the voice of the Lord came to them in their afflictions, saying: Lift up your heads and be of good comfort, for I know of the covenant which ye have made unto me; and I will covenant with my people and deliver them out of bondage.</i><br><br><i>And I will also ease the burdens which are put upon your shoulders, that even you cannot feel them upon your backs, even while you are in bondage; and this will I do that ye may stand as witnesses for me hereafter, and that ye may know of a surety that I, the Lord God, do visit my people in their afflictions.</i><br><br><i>And now it came to pass that the burdens which were laid upon Alma and his brethren were made light; yea, the Lord did strengthen them that they could bear up their burdens with ease, and they did submit cheerfully and with patience to all the will of the Lord.</i>[Mosiah 24:12–15]<br><br>The Lord hears the prayers of your heart. The feelings of your heart, of love for our Heavenly Father and for His Beloved Son, can be so constant that your prayers will ascend always. Some of you have, perhaps without thinking of my request that you pray, brought down on us all the blessings of heaven tonight through the feelings of your hearts.<br><br>I must add to my pleading a warning. You have the right and the obligation to choose for yourselves. You can search the scriptures or not. You can choose to work hard enough, to ponder, and to obey His commandments, so that the Holy Ghost can be your companion. Then you will come to know the Savior better and better and your heart will swell with love for Him, or you can choose to delay. You can choose to drift, deciding past efforts will be enough.<br><br>My warning is a simple matter of cause and effect. Jesus Christ is the light and the life of the world. If we do not choose to move toward Him, we will find that we have moved away.<br><br><i>For I the Lord cannot look upon sin with the least degree of allowance;</i><br><br><i>Nevertheless, he that repents and does the commandments of the Lord shall be forgiven;</i><br><br><i>And he that repents not, from him shall be taken even the light which he has received; for my Spirit shall not always strive with man, saith the Lord of Hosts.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 1:31–33]<br><br>We are promised that if we always remember Him and keep His commandments we will have His Spirit to be with us. That light to our feet will grow dim if we choose to delay or to drift.<br><br>There is also a warning for us as we are faced with the choice whether or not to try harder to have our hearts drawn out in prayer continually to God. Perhaps the thought will come into your mind that tonight is not the time to begin an earnest effort to pray with more faith. Or the thought may come that prayer is not important to you. You may know with certainty the source of such thoughts:<br><br><i>And now, my beloved brethren, I perceive that ye ponder still in your hearts; and it grieveth me that I must speak concerning this thing. For if ye would hearken unto the Spirit which teacheth a man to pray ye would know that ye must pray; for the evil spirit teacheth not a man to pray, but teacheth him that he must not pray.</i><br><br><i>But behold, I say unto you that ye must pray always, and not faint; that ye must not perform any thing unto the Lord save in the first place ye shall pray unto the Father in the name of Christ, that he will consecrate thy performance unto thee, that thy performance may be for the welfare of thy soul.</i>[2 Nephi 32:8–9]<br><br>Now for the sure promises. First, if you will let your heart be drawn to the Savior, to always remember Him, and to our Heavenly Father in prayer, you will have put on spiritual armor. You will be protected against pride because you will know that any success comes not from your human powers. And you will be protected against the thoughts which come rushing in upon us that we are too weak, too inexperienced, too unworthy to do what we are called of God to do to serve and help save His children. We can have come into our hearts the reassurance recorded in Moroni: "And Christ truly said unto our fathers: If ye have faith ye can do all things which are expedient unto me" (Moroni 10:23).<br><br>There is another sure promise. It is this: Whether or not you choose to keep your covenant to always remember Him, He always remembers you.<br><br>I testify that Jesus Christ, born in Bethlehem, was and is the Only Begotten of the Father, the Lamb of God. He chose from before the foundations of the earth to be your Savior, my Savior, and the Savior of all we will ever know or meet. I testify that He was resurrected and that because of His Atonement we may be washed clean through our faith to obey the laws and accept the ordinances of the gospel.<br><br>I testify that through the Prophet Joseph Smith the keys to administer those ordinances were restored and that they are now held by President Gordon B. Hinckley and that the authority to offer them is here.<br><br>I promise you that this day you will feel the influence of the Holy Ghost touch your heart as you search the scriptures with new purpose and as you pray earnestly. From that, you will this day have the assurance that God lives, that He answers prayers, that Jesus is the living Christ, and that He loves you. And you will feel your love for Him increase. I say this in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Henry B.

<h1>eing One With Christ - Marilyn S. Bateman - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
My dear friends, there is no question that we live in the last days. We are witnessing the culmination of this last dispensation where the Lord is bringing his great latter-day work to its conclusion. From the beginning all the prophets from Adam to the present day have prophesied concerning the last days. They have done so because it is the time in which the families of the earth will be gathered in preparation for the Second Coming of Christ.<br><br>We are continually being tried and tested as individuals and as a church. We are engaged in a mighty conflict. We are at war. We are enlisted in the cause of Christ to fight against Lucifer and all that is carnal and evil in the world.<br><br>Our prophet, President Gordon B. Hinckley, has said:<br><br><i>We are engaged in a great eternal struggle that concerns the very souls of the sons and daughters of God. We are not losing. We are winning. We will continue to win if we will be faithful and true. We</i>can<i>do it. We</i>must<i>do it. We</i>will<i>do it. There is nothing the Lord has asked of us that in faith we cannot accomplish.</i>["The War We Are Winning,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 1986, p. 44; emphasis in original]<br><br>This is the time and season in the Lord's affairs that the greatest generation of young men and women have been placed on the earth. I have often heard President Hinckley refer to the young people of the Church today as being the best generation ever. As such, your work is at hand. It is a time to stand firm, to rally to the Savior's banner, to declare with unwavering allegiance our loyalty to his great cause. All of us united together<i>can</i>do it.<i>We will do it!</i><br><br>In Alma 26:5–6, the great missionary Ammon saw our day and explained the need to gather the sons and daughters of God. In verse 6, he said:<br><br><i>Yea, they shall not be beaten down by the storm at the last day; yea, neither shall they be harrowed up by the whirlwinds; but . . . they shall be gathered together in their place, that the storm cannot penetrate to them; yea, neither shall they be driven with fierce winds whithersoever the enemy listeth to carry them.</i><br><br>The way we are gathered is through the restored gospel and its priesthood and by fully living its precepts. Its purpose is to make us one with Christ and with each other.<br><br>Unity is and will be important because of the difficult times we face and will face as the storms come. Lewis Timberlake used an analogy in nature to illustrate this concept:<br><br><i>While on a tour of California's giant sequoias, the guide pointed out that the sequoia tree has roots just barely below the surface.</i><br><br><i>"That's impossible!" I exclaimed. "I'm a country boy, and I know that if the roots don't grow deep into the earth, strong winds will blow the trees over."</i><br><br><i>"Not sequoia trees," said the guide. "They grow only in groves and their roots intertwine under the surface of the earth. So, when the strong winds come, they hold each other up."</i><br><br><i>There's a lesson here. In a sense, people are like the giant sequoias. Family, friends, neighbors, the church body and other groups should be havens so that when the strong winds of life blow, these people can serve as reinforcement and can strive together to hold each other up.</i>[Lewis Timberlake, from<i>Timberlake Monthly,</i>in Points to Ponder,<i>Reader's Digest,</i>May 1989, p. 48]<br><br>If we become one with Christ and with each other, we will stand and not be wasted when the storms and whirlwinds and evil come down upon us. But we will achieve oneness with each other only as we seek to be one with Christ. The whole concept of becoming one with the Savior and the protection that follows is wonderfully presented in the scriptures through the story of Helaman's stripling warriors.<br><br>Some 60 years before the birth of Christ, the Nephites were faced with the evil storm of war. The Lamanites sought their destruction. The people of Ammon had joined the Nephites, but because of their oath not to take up weapons of war, they were not in a position to defend their country. Their young sons were exempt from this oath, however, and under the leadership of the prophet Helaman they came to the defense of the Nephite nation.<br><br>Listen to a description of these young warriors and their feelings. Alma 53 introduces them to us:<br><br><i>They were all young men</i>[who]<i>were exceedingly valiant for courage, and also for strength and activity; but behold, this was not all--they were men who were true at all times in whatsoever thing they were entrusted.</i><br><br><i>Yea, they were men of truth and soberness, for they had been taught to keep the commandments of God and to walk uprightly before him.</i>[Alma 53:20–21]<br><br>Helaman described them as "strict to remember the Lord their God from day to day; yea, they do observe to keep his statutes, and his judgments, and his commandments continually; and their faith is strong in the prophecies" (Alma 58:40).<br><br>Even more telling is what these valiant young people said to Helaman: "Father, behold our God is with us, and he will not suffer that we should fall" (Alma 56:46). They knew that God would protect and deliver them. They had been taught by their mothers to have such a faith in their Savior "that if they did not doubt, God would deliver them" (Alma 56:47). What were the effects of such great faith in Christ and the oneness they had with their Redeemer? Alma recorded:<br><br><i>Not one soul of them . . . did perish. . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . And we do justly ascribe it to the miraculous power of God, because of their exceeding faith in that which they had been taught to believe--that there was a just God, and whosoever did not doubt, that they should be preserved by his marvelous power.</i>[Alma 57:25–26]<br><br>In closing I would like to quote from President James E. Faust's First Presidency message for January 1999:<br><br><i>It is my testimony that we are facing difficult times. We must be courageously obedient. My witness is that we will be called upon to prove our spiritual stamina, for the days ahead will be filled with affliction and difficulty. But with the assuring comfort of a personal relationship with God, we will be given a calming courage. From the Divine so near we will receive the quiet assurance:</i><br><br><i>"My son, peace be unto thy soul; thine adversity and thine afflictions shall be but a small moment;</i><br><br><i>"And then, if thou endure it well, God shall exalt thee on high; thou shalt triumph over all thy foes" (D&amp;amp;C 121:7–8).</i>[James E. Faust, "That We Might Know Thee,"<i>Ensign,</i>January 1999, p. 5]<br><br>It is my prayer, my young, valiant brothers and sisters, that we will seek to be one with our Savior, Jesus Christ, by applying the principles of the gospel in our lives and living obediently to his commandments so that as we live through these last days our united front will not be penetrated and we will stand together as true followers of Christ; "that when he shall appear we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is" (Moroni 7:48). This is my hope in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Marilyn S. Bateman, the wife of Merrill J.

<h1>s of a Testimony - Meril J. Bateman - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
A few weeks ago I spoke with a recent Brigham Young University graduate in New York City. During the conversation I detected a slight accent. I asked the young man if he was from another country. He said his homeland was Brazil, where he had spent the first 23 years of his life. Since few foreign converts are financially able or academically prepared to attend the university, I asked if he was a second- or third-generation member.<br><br>"No!" he responded. "I was a convert at age 17."<br><br>I then asked, "How much education did you have at the time of your conversion?"<br><br>His answer, "I had completed the eighth grade."<br><br>I was even more surprised. "How did you make it to BYU?" I inquired. "What motivated you to move forward with your education?"<br><br>In essence he responded, "The truths of the gospel and a mission experience convinced me of the importance of further study. Before my mission I learned about the principles of eternal progress. During the mission I had the opportunity to teach these principles to others. As I rubbed shoulders with other missionaries who had high educational aspirations, I became convinced of my own potential. When I returned from the mission field, I was determined to complete high school and move on to college. I earned a high school diploma within two years while working and saving and then applied for admittance to Brigham Young University. I was accepted. I have finished a bachelor's degree and an MBA and now have excellent employment with a large multinational corporation that utilizes my talents in both the United States and Brazil."<br><br>Simple but profound truths that we often take for granted had an enormous impact on the young Brazilian's life. He took to heart the dictum to seek "out of the best books words of wisdom; seek learning, even by study and also by faith" (D&amp;amp;C 88:118). He believed the revelations that state: "It is impossible for a man [or woman] to be saved in ignorance (D&amp;amp;C 131:6); that "the glory of God is intelligence" (D&amp;amp;C 93:36); that<br><br><i>whatever principle of intelligence we attain unto in this life, it will rise with us in the resurrection.</i><br><br><i>And if a person gains more knowledge and intelligence in this life through his diligence and obedience than another, he will have so much the advantage in the world to come.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 130:18–19]<br><br>Since the conversation, I have reflected again and again on the blessings of a testimony, of receiving "truth in the inward parts" (Psalm 51:6). In general we are aware of the eternal consequences of having gospel principles burned in our souls by the power of the Holy Ghost. The redemption of the soul and the inseparable connection of body and spirit coupled with eternal glory come to mind. These are of ultimate importance. But there are also more immediate blessings that flow from a testimony like that enjoyed by the young Brazilian. Not only was his eternal path changed forever, but so was his life in mortality. The motivation to improve his personal circumstances was a direct consequence of his conversion and faith. This motivation caused him to obtain an education that then led to employment well beyond anything he had dreamed of as a teenager in Brazil.<br><br>The motivation to improve one's lot in life is not the only earthly consequence of conversion. There are many temporal blessings that flow from a testimony of the gospel of Jesus Christ. These include protection from the swirling winds of immorality, alcohol, tobacco, and drugs; a comfort and peace of mind that results from knowing one is not alone; a power to bless others and lighten their loads; the courage and strength to face adversity; an ability to cope with death, given a knowledge of its purpose and nature.<br><br>My list is not exhaustive. I suggest you ponder the blessings of a testimony with respect to your life. See if you can add to the list. In the time remaining I will discuss three blessings, in addition to education, that I believe are especially pertinent to members of the BYU community. The first is protection from the whirlwinds of the adversary; the second is the companionship of good friends; and the third concerns the courage and strength to face adversity.<br><h2><b>Protection from the Whirlwinds of the Adversary</b></h2><br>After many years of missionary work, Ammon spoke to his brothers about their successful labors and how their sheaves or converts needed to be gathered into garners in order for them not to be wasted. Looking forward to our time, he further stated that those gathered in the garner would<br><br><i>not be beaten down by the storm at the last day; yea, neither shall they be harrowed up by the whirlwinds; but when the storm cometh they shall be gathered together in their place, that the storm cannot penetrate to them; yea, neither shall they be driven with fierce winds whithersoever the enemy listeth to carry them.</i>[Alma 26:6]<br><br>My grandfather was a farmer. I remember the garner or granary on his farm. After the exhausting task of harvesting the grain, the grain was transported to the granary for winter storage. The purpose of the granary was to provide a safe haven for the harvest, to protect the wheat and corn from the coming storms, from the rain and snow that could destroy it. In addition, the garner provided protection from predators who desired the harvest for their own purposes. As the grain entered the garner, it was checked for contaminants. It was also fumigated or cleansed as a precaution and certified as to its cleanliness.<br><br>Elder Neal A. Maxwell has stated that the temple is a garner for Church members (see "Coordination of Full-Time and Stake Missionary Work," Regional Representative Seminar, 30 March 1990, p. 6). It is a place of refuge from the storms of life. He has pointed out how important it is for new converts to progress to the temple in order to be preserved. Through temple covenants members are endowed with power to protect themselves from the evil that swirls about them. Like the grain entering the garner, those entering the temple have been cleansed of contaminants through repentance, baptism, and the Holy Spirit. Moreover, they have been certified as being clean and worthy of entrance.<br><br>Brigham Young University is also one of the Lord's garners. So, too, are BYU--Hawaii, Ricks, the LDS Business College, and the seminaries and institutes spread across the earth. Each is an important gathering place for young members of the Church as a refuge from the storm. The protection provided is both temporal and spiritual. BYU is among the Lord's most important garners because the sheaves gathered into it are relatively young and tender. Students are at a critical stage in life. Many are on their own for the first time. Most students will make three or four of life's most important decisions while at the university. These include the quality and type of education, a mission, marriage, and employment. BYU often plays an important role in each decision.<br><br>A key temporal as well as eternal blessing provided by the university is a first-class education in a moral environment. In Elder Jeffrey R. Holland's terms, the "modern winds of immorality swirl luridly around" us ("Personal Purity,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 1998, p. 75). These winds blow through every level of society. BYU is an oasis from the storm because almost all who enter these halls of learning have a testimony of the sacredness of the human body, knowing that one's body and spirit have been purchased with a price and that life-giving processes are reserved for marriage. Individuals without testimonies, whether at other universities or in the world generally, often do not understand the severe temporal consequences of immoral acts. They do not understand that the lack of sexual discipline is one of the greatest causes of unhappiness on this earth. Families are destroyed by it or never formed because of it. Children are deprived as a result of it. How grateful we should be to associate with so many faculty, staff, and students who understand these fundamental truths and live accordingly.<br><br>Some universities are struggling with binge drinking. University officials in many parts of the nation are worried about alcohol-related deaths among students. A few administrators have taken steps to eliminate alcohol from their campuses. Not only does alcohol take lives but it interferes with the learning process. For those students with a testimony of the restored gospel, alcohol is not a problem. The BYU community largely escapes the destructive consequences associated with alcohol, tobacco, and drugs. Like a stake of Zion, the university is "a defense, and . . . a refuge from the storm" (D&amp;amp;C 115:6).<br><br>One of the more obvious temporal advantages associated with the Word of Wisdom is a healthier, longer life. A UCLA study has shown that LDS Church members live about 10 years longer than their U.S. counterparts. The UCLA report indicates that Mormon high priests who never smoked cigarettes and who engage in regular physical activity have "some of the lowest mortality rates ever reported from cancer and cardiovascular disease for any population group" (Vicki Beck, "UCLA School of Public Health Study Finds Mormon Health Practices Linked to Unusually Low Rate of Cancer and Cardiovascular Deaths,"<i>UCLA News,</i>5 December 1989; see also James E. Enstrom, "Health Practices and Cancer Mortality Among Active California Mormons,"<i>Journal of the National Cancer Institute</i>81, no. 23 [6 December 1989], pp. 1807–14). The Word of Wisdom must be a frustration to Lucifer, whose objective is to shorten life or, at a minimum, to make life miserable. The revelation, received in February 1833, is now 166 years old. It has stood the test of time and is a remarkable witness of the temporal and spiritual blessings offered to the Saints. The revelation promises health, wisdom, knowledge, and the ability to "run and not be weary, and . . . walk and not faint" (D&amp;amp;C 89:18–20). The UCLA study provides clear evidence of the fulfillment of the promise.<br><h2><b>The Companionship of Good Friends</b></h2><br>Another major benefit of a testimony is the companionship of good friends. This advantage exists for Church members in general but is especially applicable to membership in the BYU community. While serving as president of the Asia North Area a few years ago, I met a recent convert whose conversion story helped me understand how a testimony builds trust among the members and allows strong friendships to be formed.<br><br>The young Japanese man was not a Christian prior to meeting the missionaries. His interest in the message was modest, but he continued to study because he enjoyed the association with the missionaries. The major stumbling block for him was a feeling of self-sufficiency; he did not understand or feel the need for a Savior. After receiving the lessons, the seed did not swell within him because he had not paid the price to receive a personal witness. The missionaries were perplexed and wondered what they should do. One day they showed him a film called<i>The Bridge.</i>The film illustrates the power of Christ's atonement as a father is forced to choose between saving his son's life or the lives of passengers on a train. The film clearly underscored the dependence of the passengers on the father's decision. The young man's thoughts were provoked, and he could not sleep that night--but still there was no witness.<br><br>The next morning he went to the optician shop where he served customers needing eyeglasses. During the day an elderly woman entered. Her glasses were broken. He remembered her coming in before, but she had not had sufficient money to purchase new glasses. On this day she again showed him her broken spectacles and asked if the money she now had was sufficient. It was apparent that she was still short of funds. Then a thought came to him: "I have some money. I can make up the difference." He told her that her money was enough, took the broken spectacles, and made an appointment for her return.<br><br>When she returned a few days later, the glasses were ready. He handed them to her and she put them on.<br><br>"Miemasu! Miemasu!" [I see! I see!] Tears streamed down her cheeks in gratitude for her sight.<br><br>At that point a burning sensation was felt deep within Manabu's soul as he was encompassed by the Holy Spirit. As she left, he exclaimed, "Wakarimasu! Wakarimasu!" [I understand! I understand!]<br><br>His eyes and heart were opened as he felt the Savior's love and knew that there is Someone greater than himself.<br><br>This spiritually defining moment caused a paradigm shift in the young man's life. He knew the gospel was true. His trust in the missionaries and Church members soared. No longer was he just a receiver. Following his baptism he would stay after church meetings to meet with investigators and share his feelings and insights. He became a nurturer and a strong witness of the truth. Reaching out to others became a natural instinct. Never again would he be alone. Not only did he enjoy the companionship of the Holy Spirit, but his friendships with others in and out of the Church multiplied.<br><br>The same opportunity exists in the BYU community. The common gospel bond shared by the vast majority increases trust among students, faculty, and staff. Because we are "children of the covenant" (3 Nephi 20:26), we "bear one another's burdens, that they may be light; . . . mourn with those that mourn; . . . and comfort those that stand in need of comfort" (Mosiah 18:8–9). One of the great blessings emanating from Brigham Young University is the opportunity for enduring friendships to be established.<br><h2><b>The Courage and Strength to Face Adversity</b></h2><br>Another of the great blessings of a testimony is the hope that comes from a knowledge of and belief in the plan of salvation. The plan provides an eternal perspective that helps the believer cope with day-to-day trials. Job's expression of hope derived from his testimony is a classic:<br><br><i>For I know that my redeemer liveth, and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the earth:</i><br><br><i>And though after my skin worms destroy this body, yet in my flesh shall I see God:</i><br><br><i>Whom I shall see for myself, and mine eyes shall behold, and not another; though my reins be consumed within me.</i>[Job 19:25–27]<br><br>Job was able to withstand the adversity thrust upon him by Satan: poor health, loss of family and friends, and loss of wealth. In spite of the hardships that befell him, he was true to the end because of his personal witness that he was a son of God, that God had a plan for him, and that his faithfulness would result in salvation.<br><br>I knew a woman whose life paralleled Job's. Her name was Joan Kinder. She was a deeply religious woman with a quick wit, a bright mind, and an engaging personality. Children and adults loved her, and she loved them. She was one of the most cheerful persons I have known. I had the privilege of teaching her the gospel as a British missionary in the mid-1950s. A decade earlier, at age 20, she had fallen in love and was engaged to be married. It was the mid-1940s, and World War II was still raging in Europe. Her fiancé was drafted into the British army and sent to the front. She became employed in a munitions factory and waited for his return. Near the close of the war the young man's family received a letter telling of his death.<br><br>For a period of time Joan was at a loss. She joined the British equivalent of our Women's Army Corps and was sent to the Far East. In Hong Kong she met another British soldier. They fell in love and were married. Eventually they returned to England and found a home to rent in her native town. He was posted a few miles away. It was not long before they were blessed with a son.<br><br>Two years later the husband was assigned to another post some distance from their home. It was decided that she would wait for him to be established before moving to the new area. A few months went by with him returning each weekend. Each time he would suggest they wait just a little longer before making the move. Then one weekend he failed to return. She visited the base the next week. He told her that an assignment had kept him. She was uneasy, feeling that something was happening to their marriage. Within a few weeks he told her about another woman and that he wanted a divorce. She was devastated. Her son was now three years old and would grow up without a father.<br><br>It was during this time that the missionaries knocked on her door. She invited them in, took a Book of Mormon, and promised to read it. Within a few days she completed reading the book. A special spirit accompanied the reading and, while praying about the predicament and challenges that confronted her, a feeling of peace came along with a witness of the sacred nature of the book. The missionaries were surprised upon their return to find a convert. But she insisted on waiting a few months before joining the Church. She felt time was needed to see if her husband would change his mind. More than anything, she hoped to save her family. Time passed, and the divorce became final. She then joined the Church.<br><br>From the beginning of her membership, she was a full-tithe payer in spite of the meager income available to support her son and herself. She worked in a small shop where her boy could be with her until he entered school. Then she became a seamstress in a factory with better pay. Her leadership abilities eventually resulted in her becoming part of the management staff. When her son was grown, she emigrated to this country and found employment with the Family History Department of the Church. She was a specialist in reading old English and old German manuscripts.<br><br>One day she received a call from the British Embassy in Washington, D.C. They asked for a meeting and sent a representative to see her. She was told in the meeting that her son had been killed while on business in a foreign country. For a period of time there was a sadness in her eyes and a heaviness in her heart. Then the cheerfulness returned. The twinkle in her eyes, her quick wit, and her love for people were irrepressible. My children loved to be in her presence. There was something special about this deeply faithful woman.<br><br>Not many years after her son's death, Joan was crossing a street in Salt Lake City on her way to work. The morning sun had just topped the mountains in the east, and a woman driving east failed to see Joan in the crosswalk. Apparently Joan was not aware of the car coming at her. She may have been thinking about the wonderful blessings of the gospel of Jesus Christ that had come into her life. Suddenly there was an impact. The car hit her with tremendous force. Her time in mortality was over. A short time later I received a call from a common friend informing me of the accident and her death. I have thought often about this wonderful, interesting woman. Her life was filled with tragedy. Most of the things she wanted in life never materialized. One did--the greatest one! She found the hope that comes with a testimony of the gospel. In the end, that satisfied her. She knew she would see her son again. Parents and friends were eternal. She found joy in the gospel here and knew that unspeakable joy would be hers on the other side of the veil.<br><br>Brothers and sisters, may we appreciate the wonderful blessings available to us in this life through the gospel of Jesus Christ. May our testimonies motivate us to improve our lot in life, to withstand the temptations of the adversary, to enjoy good friends, and to face adversity with hope and courage, knowing that unspeakable joy awaits us in the eternities. This is my prayer in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Merrill J.

<h1>Insights from My Life - Neal A. Maxwell - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
It is a special time for you as students in terms of the calendar, brothers and sisters. A new semester has started. Obviously it is the end of one year and the beginning of another. Soon it will be the end of a century, and a whole new century will open up before you. And you really are, as we enter upon that new century, part of the hope of Israel. So I am grateful for President Bateman's invitation to be with you in this time of transition, and I will, with some encouragement from my wife and some others, wax a little bit autobiographical today, which I typically don't do.<br><br>My life has been, fortunately--for me at least--intertwined with Brigham Young University for nearly 28 years: either as Church commissioner of education, as a member of the board of trustees, as chairman of the executive committee, or off and on as the grandfather of several students here. No wonder, therefore, that I feel that President Bateman and the faculty and administration are truly colleagues.<br><br>Furthermore, you as students continue to be, at least to me, another royal generation being raised up for the purposes of the Lord in your individual lives. Yes, you have some personal imperfections of which you are aware, probably painfully at times. But you are also drenched in personal gifts, talents, and abilities of which you may be less aware. So though longevity is one reason for giving some advice today, the other reason for so doing is because of your immense possibilities carved out of this particular time in human history.<br><br>It surprises me that I have lived nearly three-fourths of the 20th century. Such a span is not comparatively a long time, considering the able and spritely septagenarians and octogenarians among whom I labor. Yet it is still a significant time span. Certainly at times in the spring of 1945, as an 18-year-old infantryman on Okinawa, it did not look very likely to me that my life would span three-quarters of this century. Nevertheless, experiences undergone and lessons learned have combined over the years to heighten my gratitude to God for the gift of life. I have lived through a depression, a world war, and a cold war, and have long since entered my anecdotage--and you will not be entirely spared from that latter symptom today.<br><br>In the passing years I have developed much appreciation for the institution of the family. Other institutions simply cannot compensate fully for failing families. If we will hold fast to the Church's proclamation on the family, we will see that we hold the jewels, as it were, that can enrich so many other things. Let the world go its own way on the family. It appears to be determined to do that. But we do not have that option. Our doctrines and teachings on the family are very, very powerful, and they are full of implications for all the people on this planet.<br><br>Though I murmured as a young man at times with chores, I have acquired in the space of this passage of time a hardened view of the spiritual necessity of work. Even if work were not an economic necessity, it is a spiritual necessity. If I have any concern about your generation, speaking collectively, it is that a few of our wonderful youth and young adults in the Church are unstretched--they have almost a free pass. Perks are provided, including cars complete with fuel and insurance--all paid for by parents who sometimes listen in vain for a few courteous and appreciative words. What is thus taken for granted, however innocently, tends to underwrite selfishness and a sense of entitlement. Selfishness and a sense of entitlement don't need any transfusions in our society today. I know that having said those things to you now, and having spoken plainly, there are some here who have worked exceedingly hard and need no comment from me on that score. As I look at the rising generation, the gospel of work, which is part of the fullness of the gospel, will need more attention, not less.<br><br>I am excited to report to you that I am enjoying the scriptures more than ever. I have read a lot in my life--thousands of books, I'm sure. But rarely do I encore reading except for the holy scriptures. Therefore, I am even more anxiously engaged in the restored gospel than ever because the restored gospel is so engaging. It really does get a grasp on our minds, and there is no end to the exploration that one can make of it. It is, as I said from this pulpit years ago, an "inexhaustible gospel." To be anxiously engaged really does mean that we are engaged intellectually as well as spiritually, and life in the kingdom, as you all know, is also very engaging. So although some people at my stage of life might say, in effect, "Been there. Done that," not I. I feel instead this sense of anxious engagement in something that I have yet to take the full measure of. As I look back across the sweep of this century, I feel that very strongly.<br><br>Now, as already indicated, I am going to be somewhat autobiographical today. I mention first of all a small episode involving a large principle. The principle is the need for us to avoid the rush to judgment. This episode occurred just after I returned home from World War II. During months overseas while in the service, I had saved money to go on a mission. This was part of keeping my promise to the Lord made back in May of 1945, to which I will refer later. Back then I naïvely and foolishly thought I could pay God back, and of course I am more and more in His debt with the passing of time.<br><br>In any event, when I was discharged, I wanted to go on a mission right away. But our bishop did not call me at once. Finally, somewhat audaciously, I went to his home one night and told him I wanted to go on a mission. I had the money, and I didn't want to wait. Only then did he proceed to process the call. I impatiently wondered back then why he seemed so slow. Only decades later did I learn from the good man who was then his ward clerk that my bishop had felt, since I had been overseas for quite a while, I shouldn't be rushed into the mission field.<br><br>Oh, how quick we are sometimes to judge with so little data! And these experiences are in each of our lives, and they are illustrative of large issues, if we will but learn from them. I am so grateful to that ward clerk who, at least 40 years later, sent me a note one day saying he'd heard I'd mentioned this tapping on the bishop's door at night, and he thought I ought to know the bishop's feelings. The rush to judgment continues to be the reflex of the natural man and the natural woman if we do not guard against it carefully.<br><br>Another insight that seems to recur again and again in confirmation is that the todays of life constitute the holy present. We can't fix the past. We may be able to repent of it, but we can't change past events. We<i>can</i>fashion the future, and we do that by using what someone has called the holy present, which indeed it is.<br><br>I share with you again a simple little insight that may help you at certain junctures in your lives. It is that you must not mistake passing local cloud cover for general darkness. They are very different things, and for us to distinguish local cloud cover, which will soon be blown away, for general darkness is a terrible thing, especially with the restored gospel, which is so full metaphorically of light. We must not be mistaken about this.<br><br>I have likewise learned that illness can be a tutoring and sanctifying experience as well as a debilitating thing. There await each of us clusters of circumstances and experiences, and if we see "things as they really are," to use Jacob's felicitous phrase (Jacob 4:13), we'll be able to understand that illnesses may be debilitating but are also very tutoring, and we will be open to what they can convey to us. Such is spiritually very, very important.<br><br>In modern revelation we are told very frankly, brothers and sisters, that "when we obtain any blessing from God, it is by obedience to that law upon which it is predicated" (D&amp;amp;C 130:21). I don't know how it is for you, but I have felt so often in my life so greatly blessed for what little obedience I have given. My conclusion with regard to that verse is that the Lord's ratio of blessings to our obedience is a very generous ratio indeed. He is so quick to reward us, so quick to reassure us, and so anxious to take delight when we serve Him. So if you puzzle over that verse, as I have in life, including in recent times, the only bottom line I can give you is that the ratio of blessings to our minuscule obedience is a very, very generous ratio indeed.<br><br>I have also watched enough of human history and tried to be something of a student of public affairs to recognize passing movements, fads, and things of that kind. There are political fashions over which people become so excited, and they feel so threatened by them. They tend to equate them with the scriptural phrase "the kingdom of the devil" (2 Nephi 28:19). The kingdom of the devil, brothers and sisters, must be regarded as a collective, generic designation. We must not confuse it with any of its subsets, as ominous and bad as they may be for their season in human history. We must not confuse the subsets with the whole of it.<br><br>Once again the Book of Mormon and modern revelation give us the guidance we need so that we are not taken out of our places by too much concern over what on the landscape of history may after all be a very temporary thing, real and menacing though it may be. In the Book of Mormon is a verse I wish I fully understood, but which I draw to your attention. It is 2 Nephi 28:19, which says "the kingdom of the devil must shake." It is a very intriguing verse. I do not presume to know what this redemptive turbulence will be like, but it will be such that a few people now caught up in that generic kingdom of the devil will be "stirred up" and find their way out and into the kingdom of God. I don't know how that will happen, but it will happen. I rather imagine, and this is sure speculation, that there will be in this redemptive turbulence some jarring inconsistencies brought to the fore--jarring enough that they will cause some people who are caught up in the subsets to leave and find the truth. As prophesied in the Book of Mormon, full of portent for Latter-day Saints, there will be real turbulence.<br><br>Then, in like manner, as I have watched a few personal friends over the years go through the ebb and flow of faith, I have wondered about the underlying causes. What happened? And again and again a verse in the Book of Mormon is the most satisfactory explanation. It is an interrogative in Mosiah 5:13: "For how knoweth a man the master whom he has not served, and who is a stranger unto him, and is far from the thoughts and intents of his heart?" This describes what usually happens: otherwise basically decent people simply get caught up with the cares of the world. If instead of drawing closer to the Master we become a stranger to Him, then we have lost our way. The decent people to whom this happens haven't engaged in major transgression, as a rule, but they have distanced themselves from the Savior and He has become a stranger to them. If, on the other hand, we really are drawing closer to Jesus and we are becoming however incrementally more like Him, then we are progressing. To use another Book of Mormon phrase, we must be "willing to submit to all things which the Lord seeth fit to inflict" (Mosiah 3:19). Whenever our wills are increasingly subsumed by His--the Book of Mormon calls it "swallowed up in the will of the Father" (Mosiah 15:7)--then we really are on the road to discipleship. But that can't happen with the sort of superficiality with which some approach discipleship.<br><br>I am going to preach a hard doctrine to you now. The submission of one's will is really the only uniquely personal thing we have to place on God's altar. It is a hard doctrine, but it is true. The many other things we give to God, however nice that may be of us, are actually things He has already given us, and He has loaned them to us. But when we begin to submit ourselves by letting our wills be swallowed up in God's will, then we are really giving something to Him. And that hard doctrine lies at the center of discipleship. There is a part of us that is ultimately sovereign, the mind and heart, where we really do decide which way to go and what to do. And when we submit to His will, then we've really given Him the one thing He asks of us. And the other things are not very, very important. It is the only possession we have that we can give, and there is no resulting shortage in our agency as a result. Instead, what we see is a flowering of our talents and more and more surges of joy. Submission to Him is the only form of submission that is completely safe.<br><br>This ought to be more obvious to us than it is sometimes, brothers and sisters, because developmentally, as well as doctrinally, all the other commandments hang, as Jesus said, on the two great interactive commandments. Let me read them to you now because they are so vital.<br><br><i>Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind.</i><br><br><i>This is the first and great commandment.</i><br><br><i>And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.</i><br><br><i>On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.</i>[Matthew 22:37–40]<br><br>Now we don't think about it enough in the Church, but the first commandment is first for a reason. And the second commandment is second for a reason. True, the second commandment is like unto the first, but it isn't the first commandment. We worship the perfect object of that first commandment, God, because of His spiritual supremacy. We do not worship our neighbors. We are to love them but not worship them. This recognition of God's supremacy on all counts is why that commandment is first and why it is completely safe for us to submit to Him. Besides, at a university it is not inappropriate to remind you that that first commandment includes all of our heart, soul, and mind. The mind must surrender to God, too. It is my impression, looking about the world, that there are comparatively more knees bent in reverence to God than there are minds bent in reverence to Him. That human stubbornness tends to show up in terms of our unwillingness to submit our minds to Him.<br><br>C. S. Lewis put it well when he said, "We are bidden to 'put on Christ,' to become like God. That is, whether we like it or not, God intends to give us what we need, not what we now think we want" (<i>The Problem of Pain,</i>chapter 3, paragraph 18). Hence it is so vital for us to be submissive because we'll be puzzled when He gives us what we need in order to become more like Him and the Son, unless we are submissive in mind.<br><br>Now that grand key, therefore, is why we will have missed the train if Jesus is a stranger and far from the thoughts and intents of our heart. Because of his intellectual submissiveness, Enoch learned about what Paul called "the deep things of God" (1 Corinthians 2:10). I love that phrase of Paul's. Enoch personally saw the tears of the Lord. He personally heard the Lord's lamentations about the human family. God recited how He has given us our agency, commanded us to love and to choose Him and likewise love one another. Here again are the two great commandments. Yet we mortals so often choose evil or let the cares of the world crowd out the important things.<br><br>Instead of choosing God and His ways, we get busy with the cares of the world, and that is when neighbors get excluded, too. So obeying that first great commandment permits us to acknowledge and love the Lord and to accept His love of us, brothers and sisters, including the timing and shaping of us. Remember Nephi's meek acceptance of God's will: "I know that [God] loveth his children; nevertheless, I do not know the meaning of all things" (1 Nephi 11:17). We don't know the meaning of all things, but we know that God loves us, and that is sufficient to get us by and through anything.<br><br>We have a lot of people who partially keep the second commandment more than they truly keep the first. The trouble with just focusing on the second commandment to the exclusion of the first is that we may momentarily do some good deed for a neighbor, but it may not mean that we have worshipped God with all our mind. The first commandment sets the high tone, the divine standard. If it were not so, then, as the scriptures say, "Every man walketh in his own way, and after the image of his own god, whose image is in the likeness of the world" (D&amp;amp;C 1:16). That first commandment is the linchpin for everything else. Even self-centered people find themselves doing good, keeping the second commandment at times, but it is almost a kind of sidebar thing, as though they really have other things to do but are going to do a modicum of service here and feel good about it. We must not, therefore, overlook how crucial that first commandment is.<br><br>Furthermore, regarding that commandment, mortal choices need not necessarily be wicked in order to do harm. Some choices are diversions more than they are transgressions. As a result of these diversions, the sins of omission mount up. And they constitute a real deprivation because of what we withhold from our fellow human beings. Perhaps it is unintentional, but without that first commandment, some things get omitted.<br><br>In contrast, the Lord's reach for us is so redemptive and constant. His arm, we are told in the Book of Mormon, extends all the day long (see 2 Nephi 28:32). And the prophet Mormon spoke in powerful lamentation of those who did not respond even so (see Mormon 6:16–22). Yet Jesus waits with open arms to receive you, and if we are fully faithful at a much later date, we can eventually know at the entrance to His kingdom that sublime moment the prophet Mormon described when we could be "clasped in the arms of Jesus" (Mormon 5:11). There, the Lord Himself, by choice, is the gatekeeper, "and he employeth no servants there" (2 Nephi 9:41). This is why King Lamoni's father surely had it right. In His halting initial faith he said to the Lord, "I will give away all my sins to know thee" (Alma 22:18). That sacred deep act of discipleship is so crucial. I love, therefore, this statement of the Prophet Joseph Smith. I find it encouraging, as you doubtless have in terms of your discipleship. The Prophet Joseph said:<br><br><i>We consider that God has created man with a mind capable of instruction, and a faculty which may be enlarged in proportion to the heed and diligence given to the light communicated from heaven to the intellect; and that the nearer man approaches perfection, the clearer are his views, and the greater his enjoyments, till he has overcome the evils of his life and lost every desire for sin; and like the ancients, arrives at that point of faith where he is wrapped in the power and glory of his Maker and is caught up to dwell with Him. But we consider that this is a station to which no man ever arrived in a moment.</i>[<i>Teachings,</i>p. 51]<br><br>King Benjamin said of that moment, that when we reach it, we will "have no more disposition to do evil" (Mosiah 5:2). And we can tell in our hearts and with the help of our conscience how we are doing on the basis of those two criteria. This means, frankly, that our sins of omission, at least speaking for myself, need more attention and appreciation and more repentance. They don't involve, as said earlier, transgression, but they are a matter of deflection.<br><br>Perhaps it is true in discipleship as it is in athletics that the legs go first. Good spiritual legs such as those of ancient Joseph, in the face of temptation from Potiphar's wife, are so crucial. In that terse verse we read of Joseph that he "fled" (Genesis 39:12). It takes courage to run away from evil, and good legs. And those same good legs are needed for us to lengthen our stride and to continue. That's why we sing the song "Do not weary by the way" ("If the Way Be Full of Trial, Weary Not,"<i>Deseret Sunday School Songs</i>[Salt Lake City: Deseret Sunday School Union, 1909], no. 148). And if we don't worry by the way, we will pass life's daily quizzes, not just the major exams. And that takes good legs.<br><br>We must keep things in proportion. Remember Thomas B. Marsh and the dispute over milk? He had let the issue grow out of proportion, and it caused him to focus jealously on the minor imperfections of the Prophet Joseph. This led to his excommunication. Happily, Thomas B. Marsh came back.<br><br>At that same time, Lorenzo Snow, a contemporary, said that he noticed the minor imperfections in the Prophet Joseph, but he was grateful that the Lord could use him even so to do such a significant work (see Neal A. Maxwell, "<i>But for a Small Moment"</i>[Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1986], p. 127). This made Lorenzo Snow grateful because there was then some hope for himself.<br><br>One of the realities of the kingdom is that we work with each other in the midst of our imperfections. We see those imperfections as well as the traits and talents that God has blessed us with. And during this process of life together in the community of Saints, we watch each other grow. It is not surprising when we see each other grow as a result of the opportunities in the kingdom. And it isn't usually just one muscle that is developed. On the other hand, we see people in the Church for whom adversity is an anesthetic and for whom suffering is a sedative. And in that soil the root of bitterness can spring up. I wish I could say to you that suffering teaches automatically, but it doesn't. To paraphrase Anne Morrow Lindbergh: If suffering inevitably taught us, the human family would be a very wise family indeed (see<i>Hour of Gold, Hour of Lead</i>[New York: Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, 1973], p. 214). It takes meekness to learn from suffering.<br><br>Some here know that for 25 years I have felt one of the precious verses in all scripture about discipleship was the one given to the Prophet Joseph in Liberty Jail: "All these things shall give thee experience, and shall be for thy good" (D&amp;amp;C 122:7). That premise is that experience is valuable, and the only way to have it is to have it. And whether it involves adversity or whatever, then we are blessed. Notice these lines from Paul: "Knowing that tribulation worketh patience; And patience, experience; and experience, hope" (Romans 5:3–4).<br><br>You may ask, "There is no other way?"<br><br>And I answer, "No, there is not. There is no other way." And thus, in this discipleship about which I am speaking, it is so essential that out of these experiences we form character. It is much easier in this life to be a character than to have character. And we see characters before us in the media all the time. To have character is a special and wonderful thing, but to develop it is not a pain-free process. The Prophet Joseph said:<br><br><i>I am like a huge, rough stone rolling down from a high mountain; and the only polishing I get is when some corner gets rubbed off by coming in contact with something else, striking with accelerated force . . . all hell knocking off a corner here and a corner there. Thus I will become a smooth and polished shaft in the quiver of the Almighty.</i>[<i>Teachings,</i>p. 304]<br><br>It doesn't happen in a day, and you and I see these collisions between members and challenges. Those who are meek handle them, and they become smooth and polished.<br><br>I love a line from the prophet Moroni and say it to my posterity, some of whom are here today. I can't express it any better. He said:<br><br><i>Condemn me not because of mine imperfection, neither my father, because of his imperfection, neither them who have written before him; but rather give thanks unto God that he hath made manifest unto you our imperfections, that ye may learn to be more wise than we have been.</i>[Mormon 9:31]<br><br>What a marvelous, meek way for one generation passing on to relate to the one that is rising. Thus I return again to the words<i>anxiously engaged.</i>They do not mean hectically engaged. They do not mean frantically engaged. Rather, they reflect a deep, quiet commitment--some anticipation of what lies ahead. We must be willing to let our gears of commitment be hammered and shaped so that they mesh with life's opportunities in ways that are crucial.<br><br>We are so blessed with a rich theology, so blessed with the Church that is full of ordinances and doctrines and all of those things that make it so engaging and so easy to be anxiously engaged.<br><br>Now there is a problem that we have to face. C. S. Lewis called it "the tether and pang of the particular" ("The Brook,"<i>The Pilgrim's Regress</i>[Grand Rapids, Michigan: Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Company, 1974], p. 198). He was describing life's local situations with which we must deal.<br><br>I was talking with a widow of just one month who is left with several children. Her young husband died of cancer. She was not whining. She was not complaining. She was just describing for me the tether and pang of the particular and what it is like to be a single parent and to have to do all things on her own. Such is the tether and pang of the particular. Again that marvelous Book of Mormon tells us that we have got to be content with the things allotted to us. Whatever the circumference of our tether is, we ought to be content with that and live within the tether and pang of the particular.<br><br>Now, as I prepare to close, you face a time in which there is a significant amount of social decay in our society. Some of its roots lie in the 1960s. You can easily see why the Book of Mormon described people as having "become weak, because of their transgression, in the space of not many years" (Helaman 4:26). It doesn't take very long. For you to be strong is absolutely crucial, brothers and sisters.<br><br>I hope you will forgive me if I say something your parents might like me to say, because I can do it better than they. I can remember three or four times when I was a little feisty and independent before marriage--not as to behavioral or doctrinal things, just more assertive--and while my parents saw that, they respected my agency. I knew how they felt, but they backed off a little bit. There was almost a sacred zone there where they could say, "You know how we feel."<br><br>I found myself loving and respecting them all the more. If some of you may be in that situation now or subsequently, and see in your wonderful parents a willingness to back off a little bit because they honor your agency, honor them. Back off a little bit, and out of that will come the kind of negotiation you'll come to expect a little more when you are on the other side of that equation. Lehi described himself as "a trembling parent" (2 Nephi 1:14). I think that is not too graphic. Even with good children there are times when you will know that trembling as a parent. Get some experience with this sacred zone, therefore, by honoring parents now who may be wise enough to back off a little bit, and you back off a little bit in such a way that there is an accord such as you would like to have.<br><br>Now I close with two experiences. As a teenage boy I watched my six-week-old sister, Carol, struggle with what seemed to me to be lethal whooping cough at a time when there were no antibiotics. I came home one night from having been a grease monkey at a Greyhound bus depot and saw the light was on. It was about four o'clock in the morning. I knew it meant trouble. As I came in, Carol was laid out on the round dining room table, and Dad was waiting for a neighbor to come to join in blessing her. I thought she was gone. It seemed to me she had quit breathing. Then I watched the power of the priesthood, and I watched her start breathing again. That experience let me know the reality of the priesthood at a very young age. Our prayers for her were answered.<br><br>Have I had some prayers that were not answered? Yes, and so have you. Sometimes the reason is that we may ask for something without enough faith, or we may in fact ask for something that isn't expedient or that isn't right. For us to get used to the fact that all prayers are not automatically answered is one of life's growing experiences.<br><br>Despite the constant turnover in the experiences and generations of students, let me try to make this second story relevant. It took place during the fighting on Okinawa in May of 1945. Enemy artillery had been searching for our little mortar squad for several days, and the shells had been going over us. We felt fairly secure. But they must have moved their artillery pieces because they dropped a shell right between my hole and the foxhole of my friend. I'm sure I was not the only one praying, but I did pray mighty hard, and I made some promises to the Lord about how I would seek to serve Him if indeed He chose to spare me. I'm still trying to keep that promise. Some prayers are answered dramatically, as with Carol and the prayer in the foxhole. With others we must importune and wait. But if we do that, there will come to us in those waiting moments special things.<br><br>Let me mention without naming anyone the experience last night of being with a wonderful matriarch. In the last three years this wonderful lady and good friend of Colleen's and mine has lost a husband, a daughter, a son, and two brothers. At 8:30 this morning, her remaining son had brain tumor surgery. As I watch that family, so settled, so established, I can see that they know what Nephi knew: "I know that [God] loveth his children; nevertheless, I do not know the meaning of all things" (1 Nephi 11:17). The feeling I felt watching that family circle and their many friends was that this family is okay. They will make it, whatever the results of the surgery may be.<br><br>If we are meek enough and we are willing to submit enough, then we can be like our friend's marvelous young son last night after his blessing. He was secure. This is a son who, when his first wife died a few years ago, was seated with the family in the first two rows at the funeral. When it was his turn to praise his wife, he passed the young baby to someone else on that row and then came to the pulpit and gave a wonderful sermon, as if speaking at his wife's funeral was something he did twice a month.<br><br>Such intrinsic spirituality has grown in him and in his family. This family could indeed have a conversation with Job and hold their own.<br><br>Thank you for letting me be autobiographical. Please, submit your will to God. It is the only gift you've got to give. And the sooner it is placed on the altar, the better it will be for all.<br><br>I love you. I have great hopes for your generation. Thank you for this chance to bear my witness to you today. This is the Lord's work. There is nothing else that even approaches it in significance. And you have been called to carry it forward today in a time of opportunity such as we have never seen before. God loves you that much, of which I gladly testify in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Neal A.

<h1>lenges of the International Growth of the Church - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I was listening to a Jerry Seinfeld CD recently, and in one of his sets he pointed out that he had recently read that speaking in front of a crowd is the number one fear of the average person. Number two was death. So, for the average person, that means that if you were at a funeral, you'd rather be in the casket than doing the eulogy. I thought it was funny when I heard it, but now that I have to give this talk, I actually believe it.<br><br>When the Savior was here on the earth, he made it clear to his disciples that his mortal ministry was with the house of Israel and not with other nations (Matthew 15:24). After his death and resurrection, however, he met with his disciples and expanded their mission as follows:<br><br><i>Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost:</i><br><br><i>Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you.</i>[Matthew 28:19–20]<br><br>However, it took them a while to grasp the full import of the Savior's charge. Many of the original journeys of the apostles were to pockets of Jews living in Asia Minor. They were of the opinion that only the Jews should be allowed to accept the gospel. But a revelation to Peter recorded in Acts 10 changed all that. As you may recall, Cornelius, a centurion who was described as a good man, was told in a vision to find Peter and seek his advice on matters of the Spirit. The next day he sent his servants to Joppa, where Peter was staying. Meanwhile, Peter, who was hungry and waiting for a meal to be prepared, went to the housetop to pray. As he prayed, he had a vision in which he saw descending from the heavens a vessel that looked like a sheet knit at the four corners. Within the sheet were different foods that the Jews had been commanded by the Lord not to eat. But a voice came to Peter commanding him to eat the things in the sheet. Peter's response was that he could not because he had never eaten anything that was common or unclean. The voice spoke to him a second time, saying, "What God hath cleansed, that call not thou common" (Acts 10:15).<br><br>When the vision ended, Peter had no idea what it meant, and this must have been frustrating. Dreams can be like that sometimes. As he was thinking about the vision and what it could have meant, the Spirit said to him, "Behold, three men seek thee. Arise therefore, and get thee down, and go with them, doubting nothing: for I have sent them" (Acts 10:19–20). So Peter met the three men and went with them to Caesarea the next day to meet with Cornelius. As Peter met Cornelius, he finally figured out what the vision meant. He said:<br><br><i>Ye know how that it is an unlawful thing for a man that is a Jew to keep company, or come unto one of another nation; but God hath shewed me that I should not call any man common or unclean.</i>[Acts 10:28]<br><br>Then, after meeting with Cornelius, learning of his desires, and feeling his spirit, Peter said:<br><br><i>Of a truth I perceive that God is no respecter of persons:</i><br><br><i>But in every nation he that feareth him, and worketh righteousness, is accepted with him.</i>[Acts 10:34–35]<br><br>The Church leadership, however, continued to struggle with how to deal with the Gentiles who wanted to join the Church. They came from different countries, backgrounds, cultures, and traditions. But they all loved the Lord and wanted to be obedient to his commandments. The challenge for the leaders from a Jewish background was to figure out how to separate the essentials of the gospel from the nonessential elements of Jewish tradition. The key was that all the converts, both Jew and Gentile, had to look inside themselves and their backgrounds, cultures, and traditions and determine what was really essential for them to return to the presence of God. And what is significant to me is that it took leaders like Peter and Paul, who had traveled outside of Judea, meeting with Jews and Gentiles alike to figure out what were really the essential aspects of the gospel of Jesus Christ.<br><br>The Church may face different challenges now than it did at the time of Peter and Paul, but it still has to deal with converts from different countries with different languages and cultures, all struggling to get closer to their Heavenly Father.<br><br>As you know, the Church is growing faster outside of the United States than it is inside. In order to help you understand the magnitude of the challenge facing the Church because of its international growth, I am going to run through a few numbers. You will see how much faster the international growth is. In 1970, 68.8 percent of the total Church population resided inside of the United States, but in early 1996, international membership caught up to U.S. membership. As we move into the 21st century at the end of this year, U.S. membership will be only 46.8 percent of the total. Using a very conservative linear forecast of Church membership, U.S. membership will fall to only 37.8 percent of the total by the year 2020. On average, the Church is growing by about 355,500 members a year, of which about 267,500 are from outside of the United States and a little less than 88,000 are from inside the United States. Church membership will probably have doubled twice between 1970 and 2002.<br><br>Total membership should rise to 11.2 million by the end of this year as we usher in the new millennium and should reach at least 18.4 million by 2020. If you assume a more aggressive exponential forecast of Church growth with U.S. growth averaging about 2 percent and non–U.S. growth averaging a little over 8 percent, total membership could rise to just over 25 million in 20 years, with less than one-third coming from the United States.<br><br>By the end of this year there will be 14 countries with a Church population over 100,000 members, which is roughly the size of the Church in Colorado. Of that group, the United States, Canada, England, and Japan are the only high-income countries, and their Church membership is growing significantly slower than the membership of the other 10 countries, which are from Latin America and the Philippines. Second-place Mexico will probably end up with about 834,000 members by the end of the year, followed by Brazil with about 743,000 members and Chile with about 536,000 members. Brazil and Chile are growing annually by 7.8 percent and 7.7 percent, respectively, on average, whereas Mexico is only growing at 3.2 percent per year.<br><br>This should not be meant to underestimate the importance of the heart of the Church in Utah. In a regional conference in the Marriott Center on January 16, President Faust noted that Utah is still the heart of the Church. Making up only 15.4 percent of the total Church population, Utah Saints still generate 39 percent of the tithing of the Church. It is not possible for me to get similar statistics on missionaries, but I would imagine that Utah also generates an inordinate percentage of the missionaries of the Church.<br><br>I have been interested in the international dimension of the Church since I served a mission in Brazil from January 1964 to January 1966. I gave a talk in the Kennedy Center in 1996 describing the events that led me to get a doctorate in international business at Indiana University, and I promise not to repeat much of what I said there. But my interest in the cultural, legal, political, and economic dimensions of the global economy fits very nicely with the forces that influence our success or failure in different countries and cultures. In addition, I have always been intrigued with the unique role that BYU as an institution and we as individuals can and will play in the internationalization process in the future.<br><br>As I prepared this talk, I had the opportunity to speak with many different individuals at home and abroad. One comment by Richard Turley, the managing director of the Family History Department of the Church, has really stuck with me. To paraphrase him, "As I look at the statistical reports coming in from around the world, I see the clear guiding hand of the Lord in this work." That is our challenge--to see the hand of the Lord in this work and to figure out where we fit in.<br><br>Cultural differences present significant challenges in doing the work. One of the best talks I have heard on this issue was given by Elder Spencer J. Condie of the First Quorum of the Seventy at the Sixth Annual Conference of the International Society in 1995 at BYU. In his talk he quoted Arthur Henry King, a convert to the Church and former BYU faculty member, who said, "Most of you American Mormons cannot distinguish between what is gospel and what is Yankee" (in Spencer J. Condie, "Christian Values and Ethnic Diversity: How Much of a Country's Culture Can a Christian Convert Keep?"<i>"For Ye Are All One in Christ Jesus": The Global Church in a World of Ethnic Diversity</i>[Provo, Utah: David M. Kennedy Center, Brigham Young University, 21 August 1995], p. 1). I had a Brazilian member of the Church tell me the same thing 32 years ago. This seems to be a timeless refrain.<br><br>Let me give you a few examples. Professor Gill, my very first academic advisor at BYU as a student in the early 1960s, served as a mission president in the India Bangalore Mission. He tells of the difficulty of dealing with the caste system in India, where the Brahman caste is identified as the clergy or highest caste in the Hindu faith. How can a Brahman convert subject himself to the leadership of a branch president who is from a lower caste? (See Gurcharan S. Gill, "The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in India,"<i>"For Ye Are All One,"</i>p. 76.)<br><br>In Mongolia, President Cook had to deal with the Mongolian practice of drinking fermented milk. The Church did not want to rewrite the Word of Wisdom to take care of every different health concern around the world, so President Cook had to teach the members to drink fresh milk instead of fermented milk. (See Richard E. and Mary N. Cook, "Mongolia,"<i>Religious Liberty and the Global Church: The Challenge of Sharing,</i>Seventh Annual Conference of the International Society [Provo, Utah: David M. Kennedy Center, Brigham Young University, 19 August 1996], pp. 71–76.) I could go on and on, but the point is that we have numerous challenges as we take the gospel to different countries and cultures. And it isn't going to get any easier. All of the countries where we have limited or no presence are very different from Western culture in general and Utah culture in particular. Given the celebration of Human Rights Day yesterday, how can we appreciate and take into account the diversity among us as we take abroad the message of the atoning sacrifice of the Savior and the restoration of the gospel in the latter days?<br><br>As we move around the world, we face three other challenges besides culture: continuing to grow, retaining new members, and creating an adequate leadership base. To illustrate these issues, I will use some examples from Brazil.<br><br>The first Church members in Brazil were German immigrants, and the first convert baptism took place in 1929. The first mission was created in 1935. If the Church had continued to grow at its pre-1970 growth rate, there would have only been about 180,000 members of the Church today. However, the revelation on the priesthood in 1978 and the dedication of the São Paulo Temple that same year created a huge kink in the growth curve, resulting in about 680,000 members today.<br><br>The first stake of the Church in São Paulo was created after I left my mission in Brazil in 1966. By 1993 there were 104 stakes. It took just under 30 years for the first 100 stakes to be created. At the end of 1997 there were 173 stakes in Brazil--more than in all of Europe and Asia combined, excluding the South Pacific. With the recent division of two missions, there are now 25 missions in Brazil.<br><br>The growth of the Church in Brazil is strong. During the decade of the nineties the Church has grown by an average of 38,900 members per year. Two years ago I interviewed Elder Archibald, then the Brazil Area president, about Church growth. He noted at that time that the Church was baptizing an average of 1,000 men per month, of which 200–300 were missionary age. If the Church could retain these 200 young men and send them on missions, they could create 37 missions in Brazil. If they could have two young men serving missions from each of the 1,500 wards and branches in Brazil (there are now over 1,700), they could create 48 missions, just from local males. Counting sisters and North American missionaries, they could create 90–100 missions in Brazil, which is roughly the same number of missions per capita that exist in Chile. Right now, roughly half of the missionaries in Brazil are Brazilians.<br><br>However, growth in the missionary force is a key issue. In North America, the major source of missionaries worldwide, the number of young men of missionary age is starting to decline, just due to normal demographics. We may see the curve swing back up again at some point in the future, but the numbers are very predictable in the near term, based on the number of individuals in current age groups. How are we going to be able to increase the missionary pool so that we can open new missions and continue to grow, let alone keep from closing existing missions? We need to get more of our missionary age youth in North America to be worthy to serve on missions, and we need to rely more on non–North American missionaries. Both will involve significant challenges in the future.<br><br>Thus one of the keys to growth in the missionary work is retention. President Hinckley did an excellent job of addressing that issue in the priesthood session of general conference in November 1997 when he encouraged us to focus on retention of converts. I think it is pretty standard in the Church today for missionaries to spend about 30 percent of their missionary time on retention and reactivation. I think this actually has a dual objective. By visiting inactive members, missionaries are brought into a whole new circle of investigators. That wouldn't be the case if they just worked with the same active members over and over again. In addition, working on retention builds up the activity base of the members and increases the pool of potential missionaries. My son, Ryan, who served in the Adelaide Australia Mission, told me that their focus on retention and reactivation increased retention of new members from 17 percent to 86 percent and increased the activity level by 4.5 percent in one year.<br><br>Activity and retention in Brazil varies from stake to stake and ward to ward. But one of our BYU MBA graduates who is currently in a stake presidency in São Paulo told me that the activity rate in the São Paulo stakes is averaging about 34 percent, and the retention of new members is about 60–65 percent. That's not bad.<br><br>Where are the leaders coming from? With such rapid growth and the division of wards and stakes in Brazil, there is an ever-increasing search for leaders. It is very common to see newly married young men only 25 or 26 years old being called as bishops. The challenge is that they are being saddled with a pretty significant responsibility just as they are starting their families and their careers. Even though they are relatively young and inexperienced, they are coming from the huge pool of newly returned missionaries. With the benefit of the mission experience, they are being trained for Church leadership in ways that would not be possible any other way. In addition, they are perpetuating the missionary force. Another of our graduates who is a stake president in São Paulo told me that a bishop who has served a mission is much more likely to prepare his Young Men to serve missions than is a bishop who has not served a mission. The bigger challenge for our Church membership in Brazil is helping to prepare individuals for successful careers. If they are not well employed, they have a difficult time being a husband, father, and Church leader.<br><br>Let me focus now on the role of temples in the international growth of the Church. I am convinced that a major part of the solution to retention and leadership building is temple attendance. When Tani and I were married in 1968, there were only 13 operating temples in the Church, and only the New Zealand, London, and Swiss temples were outside of the United States and Canada. After we were married, we moved first to Indiana for four years of graduate work and then to Penn State for my first university position. We remained there for eight years. There weren't very many temples close to Indiana and Pennsylvania. I think we may have been in the Manti Temple District during those years. As a result, we did not get to the temple very often. However, shortly after moving to Indiana, the Church announced that a temple would be built in Washington, D.C. We sold concessions at the Kentucky Derby and the Indianapolis 500, put on chicken barbecues, and did any number of other things to reach our assessment.<br><br>Finally the temple was dedicated in 1974, and we only had to drive three and a half hours from State College, Pennsylvania, to Washington, D.C., to attend the temple. What a glorious experience that was. It was wonderful for the State College Branch members to travel to the temple and have their families sealed for time and eternity. I am convinced that the testimonies and conviction of the converts and the rest of us increased as we attended the temple regularly. Two of the most spiritual experiences I have had in my life were the direct result of going to the Washington D.C. Temple--once to seek an answer to a question and the other to give me unsolicited direction for the members of the branch when I was serving as branch president. In both cases the inspiration of the Spirit came several days after a trip to the temple as the calm, peaceful feeling of the temple stayed with me. Many times in district council meetings we would discuss the principles of leadership that we learned in the temple as our district president would give us assignments and ask us to return to the next meeting and report on those assignments. We developed closeness as a branch family and as leaders.<br><br>About the time Tani and I were married, President Monson made his first trip to East Germany. Over the next several years a number of things happened to lift the spirits of the Saints. But one thing was being withheld from the members: the blessings of the temple. Entire families could not travel outside of East Germany to attend the Swiss Temple because of the government in East Germany. As President Monson said:<br><br><i>The work moved forward. Now the paramount blessing needed was the privilege of our worthy members to receive their endowments and their sealings. In a private meeting on an upper floor of the Salt Lake Temple, President Spencer W. Kimball and his counselors . . . addressed the subject and said, "We know and appreciate the need of our members in Eastern Europe to receive their temple blessings. We know you love them. Find a way." When the Prophet of the Lord says, "Find a way," you must find a way.</i><br><br><i>We explored every possibility. . . . Then, through the fasting and the prayers of many members, and in a most natural manner, government leaders proposed: Rather than having your people go to Switzerland to visit a temple, why don't you build a temple here in the German Democratic Republic?</i>[Thomas S. Monson,<i>The Church in a Changing World,</i>Fifth Annual BYU Management Society Dinner, Washington, D.C., 25 February 1989, p. 9]<br><br>This gave rise to the temple in Freiberg, which was dedicated in 1985.<br><br>I was also touched during the October 1994 general conference as Elder Claudio Costa told the following story:<br><br><i>During the time I presided over the Brazil Manaus Mission, I witnessed great examples of true success, stories which came from people truly devoted to the gospel and to their covenants with God.</i><br><br><i>One man I met lived simply in a tiny, little town in the middle of the Amazon. After being baptized with his family, he could hardly wait to complete a year's membership in the Church so he could take his wife and children to the temple. The São Paulo Brazil Temple is very far from the Amazon. It usually takes four days by boat and four days by bus to get to the temple--about a week's travel. This man was a cabinetmaker. How could he save enough money to pay for himself, his wife, and his children? Although he worked hard for many months, he made very little money.</i><br><br><i>When the time came to go to the temple, he sold all his furniture and appliances, even his electric saw and his only means of transportation, a motorcycle--everything he had--and went to the temple with his wife and children. It required eight days of travel to reach São Paulo. After spending four glorious days in the temple doing the work of the Lord, this family then had to travel seven more days to return to their home. But they went back home happy, feeling that their difficulties and struggles were nothing compared to the great happiness and blessings they had experienced in the house of the Lord.</i>[Claudio R. M. Costa, "Priceless Principles for Success,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 1994, p. 27]<br><br>The Lord has certainly heard the prayers of the faithful. There are now 54 temples in operation, including the recently dedicated Alaska Temple. However, that is not enough. So in October conference in 1997, President Hinckley announced the concept of smaller temples.<br><br>With 54 operating temples, the 20 under construction, and the 25 new ones announced as of today, there is a total of 99 temples. They will have a definite impact on the members of the Church in far-flung areas of the world. The number of total tithe payers will rise as members work to become and remain temple worthy, testimonies and commitment will deepen, and the Spirit of God will settle on the people like a warm, comfortable blanket--a metaphor that my daughter, Melanie, will certainly appreciate while she is in Russia. Now the challenge of the Family History Department will be to establish family history centers close to each of the temples so that members all around the world will be able to do work on their own ancestors.<br><br>There are lots of implications for us as students, faculty, and staff at BYU. At the Annual University Conference in August 1998, President Bateman gave an excellent talk on BYU in the new millennium. I would like to focus on different matters and issue a few challenges. First, students, prepare yourselves to preach the gospel around the world. When Melanie was a student at BYU--Hawaii, she got to know some South African surfers. She had always wanted to go on a mission, but when they started asking her questions about the Church, she wondered if she was really prepared to preach the gospel. So this fall she took a missionary prep class, and I believe that made a major difference in her attitude and gave her more confidence. It was truly an example of Alma 17:2–3.<br><br>Second, appreciate the international diversity of your classmates. There are currently 1,928 international students and scholars at BYU from 114 different countries--about 5.5 percent of our student body. They bring with them a wealth of different languages, cultures, values, and attitudes. Most but not all are LDS. Those who are not LDS have a particularly difficult time adjusting to U.S. culture, Utah culture, and LDS culture. Listen to them and learn from them. Appreciate their points of view and realize that they can teach you a great deal about the world. Your experiences as a missionary abroad are only the tip of the iceberg, and you still have a lot to learn. But you international students have a great deal to learn from your U.S. classmates as well. What a wonderful time to observe the workings of the Church right here in the heart of the Church. You will take back to your countries ideas that will help you as you rise to positions of leadership in your respective countries.<br><br>My wife's sister and brother-in-law just returned from Europe as public relations missionaries. They had a wonderful experience and had the opportunity to travel all around Europe. When I asked them where would be an ideal place to serve, they mentioned Estonia. When I pressed them for the reason for Estonia, they responded, "Because that is where they need couple missionaries." What a great response. What are we doing as faculty and staff to prepare ourselves to serve missions? Couple missionaries can provide such great leadership training to these 25-year-old returned missionaries who are being called as bishops. I told Tani that she should start studying Portuguese so that we can serve a mission in 10 years when we retire--maybe to Brazil or Portugal, or even to Angola or Mozambique. Have you talked about this in your family so that a mission call is not such a shock if it comes? The Lord needs teachers, temple workers, humanitarian service workers, etc. What is your niche? If you are one of the 50 exbishops in your high priests group, serve as an ordinance worker in the temple so that you can learn the ordinances and possibly serve as a temple worker somewhere in the world. Invite foreign students to your homes to share the love of your family when they are so far away from home and so lonely.<br><br>I am constantly amazed when I see the ways a BYU experience influences people, especially nonmembers who visit here. I recently corresponded with an MBA graduate from Brazil who is not LDS, and I asked him about his experience here. I want to share with you a few of his comments:<br><br><i>The fact that we were not members of the Church did not prevent us from understanding the Church principles a little bit more. With a close group of MBA friends, we visited Temple Square in Salt Lake City three or four times. We had some group discussions at our home, and we also received missionaries at home three or four times. It was our intent to get a better understanding of the principles that existed behind the culture that was predominant in Provo.</i><br><br>There are some great lessons to be learned from him about how to adjust in a new culture. He did not join the Church, but he left here with kind feelings and with friends for life.<br><br>A second example involved a graduation dinner I attended with several executives from LG Group of Korea who attended a special executive program at BYU in 1996. At the closing banquet, several of them stood and mentioned what an enjoyable time they had had. The head of human resources for LG Group addressed those present and said, "You learned a lot while you were here. You may not have learned a lot about America, because this place is not like America." He went on to explain the types of values they learned, values associated with the LDS culture. This man was not LDS, but he was very perceptive, and I was surprised that he was so open in telling his people that Utah is not like any other place in the United States.<br><br>A third example involved a visiting professor from a Korean university. He was not LDS when he came here, but he just wanted to come here to take some classes and interact with the faculty. We didn't recruit him; we didn't know why he came. One day the elders quorum presidency of the ward where he lived in Provo was walking around the neighborhood, and the elders quorum president felt impressed to knock on the family's door. The wife came to the door, and they introduced themselves. She told them that they were interested in learning more about the Church. Not long thereafter they were baptized into the Church, and they have since returned to Korea. What a wonderful place to be where we can interact with so many wonderful children of God: faculty and students who may not all share our faith but who share our love for the good in life.<br><br>We have supported a number of foreign students in our graduate business programs through the International Student Sponsor Program, with the precondition that they agree to return to their home country. It has been wonderful to see these young men and women return home to good jobs and positions of leadership in the Church. For example, Alfredo Salas is president of the Buenos Aires Argentina West Stake, Marcos Aidukaitis is president of the Osasco Brazil Stake, Adilson Parrella is a member of a stake presidency in São Paulo, Paulo Amorim was an area authority in Brazil and is now an area authority in Cincinnati, and Jorge Zeballos is an area authority in the Chile Area. Not only are they succeeding in professional pursuits, but they are also building the kingdom of God. What an inspired program.<br><br>Now let me close by personalizing this a little. On January 12, 1992, Jody Jorgensen Nichols, a neighbor of ours and one of the best friends of our daughter, Jani, left the Missionary Training Center in Provo, Utah, and flew to Helsinki, Finland, with two elders and two other sisters to serve in the Finland Helsinki East Mission. All had been studying Russian and were preparing to preach to the Russian people. At that point there was no mission in Russia, but Gary Browning, president of the Finland Helsinki East Mission, was responsible for the members and missionaries in the former Soviet Union. Our good friends Gerald and Peggy Jorgensen, Jody's parents, were a little apprehensive about sending Jody off to Russia. In fact, Peggy told me that she even wondered if she would ever see Jody again. Their understanding was that Jody would live in Helsinki but travel back and forth to different spots in Russia to teach the people.<br><br>When Jody arrived in Helsinki, she and her group were notified that they would all leave for Saint Petersburg the next day. However, one would continue on alone to Moscow. Little did they know what was going to be announced that weekend. The next morning, as they prepared to leave, Jody was told that she would be the lone missionary continuing on to Moscow. She sat down and wrote a short note to her parents explaining that she was the only missionary in her group of five who would travel on to Moscow. On Thursday, January 16, Jody arrived in Moscow, where she met up with her companion and began to work with a small group in the Church. At that time there was one main branch and three small groups in Moscow, all clustered around metro stops. On Saturday, Jody attended a zone conference where it was announced that two new missions were being created: the Russia Saint Petersburg and Russia Moscow Missions. So now she knew that she would be working in Russia for the remainder of her mission. Only a few days later, on Monday, her letter from Helsinki arrived in Orem, and the reality of the transfer began to set in for Gerald and Peggy. Would Peggy's premonition come true? Needless to say, Monday was a very difficult day. All they knew was that Jody was leaving her companions behind and traveling alone to Moscow to begin her work.<br><br>At the same time, not knowing that Jody had left the MTC, I was preparing for a trip to Moscow. I had been invited to present a paper at a conference being hosted by Moscow State University, and I was having a difficult time getting a visa. In fact, I nearly canceled my trip because I knew that I would miss the plenary session where I was to present my paper. But I had my tickets, and I didn't want to let down my host. So in the Dulles Airport I met a courier with my visa and then headed off to Moscow about the same time Jody was on the train leaving Helsinki. I knew I would be there on Sunday, so I asked my nonmember friend, Andrei Markov--then the vice dean of the College of Economics at Moscow State University--if he could find an LDS branch for me to attend. On Sunday, only a few days after Jody arrived in Moscow, I had a taxi take me to the building close to the university metro stop where the Church group was meeting. I was early--one of the few times that has happened in my life--so I sat in the cold foyer of the building and waited for the members to arrive. Who was one of the first people to walk through the door? Jody Jorgensen. We were both shocked. I told her to sit down during church and write a letter to her parents. And then it was so fun to listen to Jody bear her testimony in Russian, having only been in the country a few days. She had prepared herself well.<br><br>The next day I flew home. That happened to be the day that Gerald and Peggy received Jody's letter from Helsinki. When I arrived home about 10 p.m. or so, I called Gerald to tell him that I had just come from Moscow, where I had gone to church with Jody, and that I had a letter for them. Needless to say, he came right over. Peggy has since told me that when they got my call that Monday night, she was lying in bed clutching her scriptures, worried to death about Jody. Once she got the letter I brought, she felt a feeling of peace come over her that never left her for the rest of Jody's mission. She knew that everything would be all right.<br><br>Does the Lord care about these things? Of course he does. Was it a coincidence that I decided to go to Moscow, even though I missed part of the conference? Was it a coincidence that Jody and I ended up in the same building at the same time? Of course not. Sometimes, if we step back, we can see the Lord's hand in his work.<br><br>One more interesting thing happened. Leonid, a student at Moscow State University, was my guide at the meetings, so I gave his contact information to Jody. Since Jody and her companion were not allowed to teach a single male alone, they asked if he knew any women who would be interested in hearing about the gospel, too. So Leonid arranged for them to meet his sister, Dina, who subsequently joined the Church, even though he didn't. Isn't it interesting how we can be tools in the hands of the Lord?<br><br>What does this all have to do with me? Jody's future husband, Jim Nichols, was one of the missionaries who opened Samara to the work, and Jody served there for two months after Jim had been transferred back to Moscow. On February 10, our daughter, Melanie, will enter the MTC to learn Russian so that she can be sent to the Russia Samara Mission. Just as I was a comfort to Gerald and Peggy when Jody was on her mission in Russia, now Jim and Jody are a comfort to us as they help us understand what Melanie will be facing in Samara and how much she will love the people and the area. People ask me, "Aren't you worried about sending Melanie there, given all that has happened to missionaries in Russia recently?" The clear answer is, "No." When she opened her call, all I felt was excitement. I have grown to truly love the Russian people I have met, and I am excited for Melanie and for the opportunity she will have to preach the gospel to them. To go back to one of my initial statements, I see the clear guiding hand of the Lord in this work.<br><br>I want to bear you my testimony that I know that God lives and that Jesus is the Christ. I am grateful for his atoning sacrifice and all he means to me. I am grateful for President Hinckley and for the tremendous work he is doing to spread the gospel throughout the earth and to open up temples, which allows members to receive their endowments and sealings and see their own faith and commitment deepen in the Church. I leave this testimony with you in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Lee H.

<h1>Perspectives - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
In the riveting story depicted in Genesis and portrayed in Cecil B. DeMille's great film<i>The Ten Commandments,</i>Egypt's pharaoh, Ramses II, stood on an elevated vantage point and witnessed the parting of the Red Sea as the children of Israel crossed on dry land. Subsequently, he watched his prized soldiers and chariots follow in pursuit as the waters closed in upon them and washed them away to perish in the sea. In the movie version, he returned to his palace, where his queen taunted him about the lack of response from the Egyptian gods, and Ramses spoke this great line: "Moses' god is God."<br><br>Pharaoh's very trying experiences had finally led him to a previously denied perspective. Perspective is how we see things from where we are. But perspectives may change, depending upon our experiences and circumstances.<br><br>The God of the Old Testament was Jehovah, Jesus Christ, who came into the world to be our Savior. He is the literal Son of God the Father, whose plan he was chosen to fulfill.<br><br>From your vantage point today, what do you know and believe about God? Can you say, as did Ramses of old, that Moses' god is God? And what does that mean? Do you conduct your life differently because of what you believe? Do you know what God wants for you?<br><br>I believe that the time to act is now. There is some urgency for us to appraise our perspectives, just as when Joshua of old challenged us, "Choose you this day whom ye will serve" (Joshua 24:15). As the second coming of the Savior approaches, circumstances will try men's souls to the point that, "if possible," even the very elect shall be deceived (see Matthew 24:24, Joseph Smith--Matthew 1:22).<br><br>Recently we have been warned again. In the October 1998 general conference of the Church, President Gordon B. Hinckley said:<br><br><i>I am suggesting that the time has come to get our houses in order....</i><br><br><i>... There is a portent of stormy weather ahead to which we had better give heed....</i><br><br><i>... That's all I have to say about it, but I wish to say it with all the emphasis of which I am capable.</i>["To the Boys and to the Men,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 1998, pp. 53–54]<br><br>As all of us will be tried and tested, how can we find our true anchor, our iron rod, and our safe and holy place to stand?<br><br>What are your challenges? What are your perspectives on living each day? What are your<i>lived</i>value systems? To what do you look forward in your future? When I asked a group of my young friends this question, there were some wonderful and interesting answers: "I want to be successful; I want to have a good and loving family; I wish to have eternal life, but I can't do lots of the things I should do until I get out of school; I want to have lots of money; I want to have good friends." One answer stood out from the others: "I really haven't thought about it that much."<br><br>For some of us it is easy to spend our time drifting from day to day doing that which seems most pressing while giving little thought to that which is most important. We need to understand that what we do determines the direction we travel and the destination at which we will arrive. What we value will be what we spend our time and effort on. From a higher perspective, then, my question is, Is what we are spending our time on worth it?<br><br>A certain man, having lived a long and productive life, was getting ready to meet his Maker. One night he had a dream during which he was told that because he had been generous with his considerable worldly wealth he would be permitted to take his most valued possession with him when he passed on to the other world. The next morning, the old man set out to put his affairs in order. He liquidated his assets and gave half of all he had to charities and other good purposes. The other half he had converted into gold bars. Upon his death, so the story goes, Saint Peter met him and welcomed him to his new home. But when he noticed the large and heavy bag that the man was carrying, Saint Peter reminded him that no one could bring any earthly goods with them to this place. The old man described his dream and indicated that he had been given special permission to bring this treasure with him.<br><br>"Okay," said Saint Peter, "if you have permission. But may I see what you chose as your greatest treasure?" When Saint Peter looked into the bag, he stepped back in amazement and questioned, "For your treasure you brought<i>pavement?"</i><br><br>It is a matter of perspective. What we cling to here on the earth that seems so valuable to us may really be quite valueless in the true sense. If we really<i>believe</i>that God is a real and living God, then how can this knowledge alter, change, or determine our perspective?<br><br>As recorded in the Pearl of Great Price, Moses learned<i>his</i>true identity. The Lord spoke to Moses, saying, "And, behold, thou art my son" (Moses 1:4). But then,<br><br><i>behold, Satan came tempting him, saying: Moses, son of man, worship me.</i><br><br><i>And it came to pass that Moses looked upon Satan and said: Who art thou? For behold, I am a son of God, in the similitude of his Only Begotten; and where is thy glory, that I should worship thee?...</i><br><br><i>Get thee hence, Satan; deceive me not; for God said unto me: Thou art after the similitude of mine Only Begotten.</i>[Moses 1:12, 13, 16]<br><br>Like Moses, we are sons and daughters of a living God. This knowledge of our true identity can change our perspective when we realize how much the Lord loves and values each one of us. It is important to recognize that "the worth of souls is great in the sight of God" (D&amp;amp;C 18:10) and that we are literally his spirit children: "He created man, male and female, after his own image and in his own likeness" (D&amp;amp;C 20:18).<br><br>Just as Satan tried to deceive Moses, so also will he try to deceive us and influence our perspectives. However, we can say, as Moses did, "Get thee hence, Satan; deceive me not." He tries to deceive us by making the facade of sinful, worldly pleasures attractive enough to overshadow the values that the Lord would have us live.<br><br>Moses' knowledge of his identity as a son of God gave him the perspective to see Satan as the impostor he is.<br><br>If we have developed a personal testimony of our Savior, we will have strength to face our problems and challenges. As our friend, he will stand by us and protect us against the temptations of Satan. Although we will still have problems and trials, our capacity to handle them will increase. We will be able to say, as did the Apostle Paul:<br><br><i>We are troubled on every side, yet not distressed; we are perplexed, but not in despair;</i><br><br><i>Persecuted, but not forsaken; cast down, but not destroyed.</i>[2 Corinthians 4:8–9]<br><br>In some ways we live in a world of deceit. Satan is the master of deceit. He truly desires the fruits of this generation and sculpts wrong behaviors that are accepted and even flaunted in contemporary society and popularized in the media. Values and ideas that worldly perspectives define as acceptable almost always lead us to unhappiness and disappointment.<br><br>God knows you individually. He knows what you can be. He has the complete perspective of what you can become.<br><br>Some years ago a newspaper reporter was assigned to interview workers on a construction site to get a firsthand story about the project. He approached one man who was breaking great rocks and filing them down in order to have smooth and even surfaces and corners.<br><br>"What are you doing here with these huge rocks?" he asked.<br><br>Looking up, annoyed, the man said, "What do you think I'm doing? I hack away at these filthy rocks all day long. My back is bent and I'm tired. Day after day I do the same thing!"<br><br>"Well," said the reporter, "this certainly isn't a very pleasant job. I don't envy you."<br><br>He approached another man who appeared to be doing the same thing. The reporter was hesitant to interrupt him but finally asked, "Can you tell me what you're doing, sir?"<br><br>The man stood up, wiped his sweaty brow, and, pointing to a rough but very large foundation, said, "Can't you see? We are building a cathedral. Its spires will rise to the sky, and my children and grandchildren will remember that I had a great part in it."<br><br>"Oh," said the reporter, "this is a very important thing you are doing."<br><br>"Yes," said the man. "How lucky I am."<br><br>Two people can be doing the same thing but with quite different perspectives. Our perspective becomes the lens through which we view life.<br><br>Our continuous mission in this life is to search for God and, in finding him, receive him completely in our lives. Christ said:<br><br><i>But if ye receive me in the world, then shall ye know me, and shall receive your exaltation; that where I am ye shall be also.</i><br><br><i>This is eternal lives--to know the only wise and true God, and Jesus Christ, whom he hath sent. I am he. Receive ye, therefore, my law.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 132:23–24]<br><br>"But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name" (John 1:12).<br><br>On the evening prior to his crucifixion, the Savior met with his apostles at what has come to be called the Last Supper. In the scriptural account of that evening's events, Christ told of the qualification for gaining eternal life: "And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent" (John 17:3). Commenting on this scripture, Elder Bruce R. McConkie wrote:<br><br><i>It is one thing to know about God and another to know him. We know</i>about<i>him when we learn that he is a personal being in whose image man is created; when we learn that the Son is in the express image of his Father's person; when we learn that both the Father and the Son possess certain specified attributes and powers. But we</i>know<i>them, in the sense of gaining eternal life, when we enjoy and experience the same things they do.</i>[McConkie,<i>Doctrinal New Testament Commentary</i>(Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1971), 1:762; emphasis added]<br><br>Now, here, I believe, is the key to changing an earthly perspective to an eternal one. Continuing, Elder McConkie said:<br><br><i>To know God is to think what he thinks, to feel what he feels, to have the power he possesses, to comprehend the truths he understands, and to do what he does. Those who know God become like him, and have his kind of life, which is eternal life.</i>[Ibid.]<br><br>Here is the point I want to make: Our perspective must be God's perspective or, in the end, it will be worthless. Elder Neal A. Maxwell likes to quote William Law, an English clergyman of the 18th century, who said it this way: "If you have not chosen the Kingdom of God, it will make in the end no difference what you have chosen instead" (quoted in Maxwell,<i>The Smallest Part</i>[Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Company, 1973], p. 1). What we value must be what God values, or in the end it will be worthless. It is all a matter of perspective. We are living in an environment of earthly viewpoints or vistas or vantage points, and we must step back and see things as they really are. But it takes more than distance for us to see from the eyes of an eternal perspective.<br><br>I have chosen four possible aspects of earthly perspectives that keep us from seeking and finding an eternal perspective:<br><br><b>Number one:</b>There are some folks who are simply<i>disinterested</i>in spiritual concerns and future consequences. When times are good, it is easy to forget our dependence on the Lord. We drift in our comfort zone without making clear commitments on which perspectives we will focus our lives. Being disinterested is possibly the most difficult to correct. It is too easy to take spiritual things lightly and casually.<br><br>Like my young friend who just hadn't given his future much thought, we need to be reminded that our time is short. It is easy to drift along in relatively smooth waters until we reach the rapids. A prudent perspective would be to prepare before it is too late. As the five foolish virgins found at midnight, it was too late to buy the needed oil for the lamps. They were not permitted to enter the wedding party with the bridegroom. How tragic it will be if we have chosen to avoid the responsibility of aligning our perspectives with God's until it is too late. Alma teaches us a significant principle: "For behold,<i>this life</i>is the<i>time</i>for men to prepare to meet God; yea, behold the day of<i>this life</i>is the day for men to perform their labors" (Alma 34:32; emphasis added).<br><br>We cannot know when it will be our time to be called home. "For behold, if ye have procrastinated the day of your repentance even until death, behold, ye have become subjected to the spirit of the devil, and he doth seal you his" (Alma 34:35).<br><br>A very wonderful man who suffered serious health problems and was on a course of temporary recovery shared his sacred feelings. The late Rex E. Lee, president of this university, spoke from this pulpit and shared how his perspective had changed as his life had been in a precarious balance and then spared for a time. In essence he said that each day was a precious gift from God and that he would never again take one day for granted. We must not waste the time we have here to work out our salvation. Let's remember that each day is precious, and opportunities abound to focus our perspective on the paths that the Lord would have us take.<br><br><b>Number two:</b>Being<i>deceived</i>can keep us from receiving eternal blessings. We have already acknowledged that Satan tempts us by deceit. Things are not always what they seem to be.<br><br>A young wife may feel much pain as she longs to have a child but is unable to, and another may have children easily but find raising them inconvenient and disruptive to her personal plans.<br><br>From the perspective of a six-year-old child, it seems like Christmas will never come. But for an adult it seems like the time before Christmas gets shorter and shorter. Young people think they will never get old. But time does not stand still, and older people wonder how it happens so quickly. There are endless examples of distortion of reality and false premises.<br><br>A measure of air quality in Japan is the ability to see Mount Fuji from a certain observatory in Tokyo. A Japanese newspaper reported that from this observatory, Mount Fuji had been sighted only something like 27 times in 1997, although in 1998 it had been sighted something like 43 times. The article went on to explain that it was not so much a change in the pollution levels as the fact that the observatory had been moved from the eighth floor to the 23rd floor. Perspectives change as we go higher.<br><br>Claudius Ptolemaeus, or Ptolemy, an Alexandrian astronomer who lived between A.D. 100 and 170, tried to explain celestial motion by using the theory that the earth was the center of the universe and that the sun and other planets revolved around the earth. His principal scientific efforts were documented in a compendious work of 13 volumes. They described in meticulous detail an explanation of celestial patterns and motions. For 14 centuries this was the universally accepted and authoritative system of astronomy. Now we know that the premise that the universe revolves around the earth was a false premise. Making an earthly perspective the center of our universe will result in the same discovery: that it is a false premise. (See<i>Encyclopedia Americana,</i>s.v. "Ptolemy.")<br><br><b>Number three:</b><i>Compromise</i>is one of the adversary's operative words. Those who do not have an eternal perspective will always challenge integrity.<br><br>There are many examples that can help us develop the strength to make righteous choices. Mohandas K. Gandhi is one such example:<br><br><i>His mother taught him that to eat meat was wrong, inasmuch as it necessitated the destruction of life, so Gandhi pledged to his mother that he would remain a strict vegetarian throughout his life....</i><br><br><i>Then Gandhi was taken very ill and his life was despaired of. His physicians tried to persuade him that if he would drink a little beef broth, his life might be saved, but Gandhi said, "Even for life itself we may not do certain things. There is only one course open to me--to die, but never to break my pledge."</i><br><br><i>... As a result of this trait of integrity, Gandhi's followers renamed him the Mahatma, or the Great Soul.</i>[Sterling W. Sill,<i>The Laws of Success</i>(Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Company, 1975), pp. 186–87]<br><br>Although we may not agree with the tenets of his beliefs, we admire his honor. To him the pledge he made to his mother was sacred.<br><br>Do we fear man more than God? For some there is a fear that it is neither cool nor popular to defend righteous living. It is too easy to be consumed with how we look, how we are connected socially, what kind of clothes we wear, or how we can acquire wonderful possessions. Of course it is important to have friends, to look well, and to have a comfortable and beautiful living environment, but from ancient times the Lord has told his people not to be idol worshipers. The Lord's perspective was abundantly clear when he gave the commandments to Moses:<br><br><i>Thou shalt have no other gods before me.</i><br><br><i>Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image....</i><br><br><i>Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them.</i>[Exodus 20:3–5]<br><br>There are enticing idols lurking in all places to tempt us to compromise our gospel-centered perspectives.<br><br>What perspectives do you have about gaining your education? We must not compromise knowledge with expediency. One student may look at a general education course as something to "get over with," and another will find the same course life-changing as doors not yet dreamed of are opened. The Lord has admonished us to learn all things of the world--under the world, in, and above. We must understand the perspective that all knowledge is important, as are the individual gifts and talents given to the Lord's children.<br><br>Talents and interests are gifts from God and should not be compromised:<br><br><i>For all have not every gift given unto them; for there are many gifts, and to every man is given a gift by the Spirit of God.</i><br><br><i>To some is given one, and to some is given another, that all may be profited thereby.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 46:11–12]<br><br>In his parable of the talents, Christ taught that our gifts should be multiplied and cherished, that our lives here can be rich, and that we can bless the lives of others.<i>There are no unimportant gifts.</i>All components of truth and knowledge must be valued.<br><br><i>Human existence cannot be understood in its totality through any one mode of inquiry. For example, science, history, and art all reveal different truths about any one subject or event. These three fundamental forms of inquiry and the languages needed to use them form the core of a basic curriculum that teaches the knowledges and skills of civilization.</i>[From the pamphlet "Teacher Education in the Arts Disciplines: A Statement of the Working Group on the Arts in Higher Education," p. 8]<br><br>Any education would not be complete that does not address things of a spiritual nature and the three great branches of learning: the arts, letters, and sciences. We are missing important perspectives in our pursuit of knowledge if we do not experience all three.<br><br>Often, less emphasis is placed on the arts. The appropriate study and practice of the arts reveal them to be a medium by which our spirits are touched and moved to higher levels of receptivity and understanding. When appropriately magnified, these gifts can help us realize truths that may not be perceptible in any other way. Latter-day Saints have always valued the arts and all that is "of good report or praiseworthy" (Articles of Faith 1:13). It may be of interest to you to know that Utah was the first in the nation to have an arts council that fostered the arts and culture in the lives of its citizens. This year is the centennial of that organization.<br><br>Brigham Young was a particular supporter of the arts. Always keeping the gospel perspective, he advocated and actively participated in music and dance and theatre and was a skilled craftsman and fine furniture maker. He believed in the refining and edifying influence of the arts. He stated:<br><br><i>There is no music in hell, for all good music belongs to heaven. Sweet harmonious sounds give exquisite joy to human beings capable of appreciating music.</i>[<i>JD</i>9:244]<br><br><i>Those who cannot serve God with a pure heart in the dance should not dance....</i><br><br><i>If you wish to dance, dance; and you are just as much prepared for a prayer meeting after dancing as ever you were, if you are Saints. If you desire to ask God for anything, you are as well prepared to do so in the dance as in any other place, if you are Saints.</i>[<i>JD</i>6:148]<br><br>"The spirit and the body are the soul of man" (D&amp;amp;C 88:15). Neither is complete without the other. And the absence of the spirit from the body is looked upon as a bondage (see D&amp;amp;C 45:17, 138:50). We came to the earth to gain a body. We look upon this as a great and precious gift. The study of the human body with an aesthetic perspective is also desirable and necessary.<br><br>Creativity must be important to our great creator. Creativity is not limited to the creative and performing arts. Opportunities for problem solving and creativity must be evident in any complete education. We must not be<i>deceived</i>into believing that God gave us talents and gifts that were not to be magnified for the benefit of his children.<br><br><b>Number four:</b>The fourth challenge is<i>distraction.</i>One of my students answered my query "To what do you look forward in the future?" by stating that he really wanted an eternal family and the blessing of having them all go back to live with Heavenly Father and his son Jesus Christ. The problem was that he had so many things to do that he didn't have time to worry about it very much--much less to set one more goal. He was willing but very distracted.<br><br>What does it take to get our attention? This good brother who had righteous desires but felt that he could not fulfill them because he was too busy in school will probably find that his life will fill up just as much when he is out of school. We are often caught up in the busy demands and choices of life. Soon we look back and realize that a year or five years or 10 years have gone by and we are still saying that someday we will get to the things that we wish and need to do. How sad it will be if we spend our lives climbing ladders only to find that they are against the wrong walls.<br><br>"No man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon" (Matthew 6:24).<br><br>Christ said, "He that is not with me is against me; and he that gathereth not with me scattereth abroad" (Matthew 12:30).<br><br>We only have so much time in a day, in a year, in a lifetime. We have to decide what it is that is important to us. What do we value and care deeply about? Then and only then will we be able to keep our sights on eternal perspectives and avoid distraction.<br><br>Some of us may need to speed up, and others need to slow down. From the perspective of being too casual, we need to determine to take action. From the perspective of being too busy, the action may be to pause and regroup. In all cases we could benefit from taking the time to ponder and pray.<br><br>The Prophet Joseph Smith received much of the restored gospel through pondering and praying for the Lord's perspective on his questions. The heavens opened and are still open to us if we will inquire.<br><br>Christ counseled the people of Nephi: "Go ye unto your homes, and ponder upon the things which I have said, and ask of the Father, in my name, that ye may understand" (3 Nephi 17:3). Take time to consider the perspectives that are important in your life.<br><br>It is important for us to be cautious that we do not become<i>disinterested, deceived, compromised, or distracted.</i>We have all the blessings of the earth given to us to be used with prudence and thanksgiving. We must keep our perspective focused on our God.<i>It is the gospel of Jesus Christ that gives us the true perspective, one that we can know and trust--an eternal perspective through which we will not be deceived.</i><br><br>The Lord, speaking of you and our day through the prophet Isaiah, declared:<br><br><i>And they shall bring thy sons in their arms, and thy daughters shall be carried upon their shoulders.</i><br><br><i>And kings shall be thy nursing fathers, and their queens thy nursing mothers: ... and thou shalt know that I am the Lord:</i>for they shall not be ashamed that wait for me. [Isaiah 49:22–23; emphasis added]<br><br>Waiting upon the Lord means having hope in the Lord and trusting in him. My young brothers and sisters, please, be not ashamed of the gospel of Christ. Remember the bold testimony and example of the Apostle Paul in his letter to the Romans: "I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth" (Romans 1:16).<br><br>It takes some courage to live the gospel with an eternal perspective. Courage is faith put into action, acting on what we believe.<br><br>"But be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only" (James 1:22). This advice is only magnified by President Spencer W. Kimball's well-known directive: "Do it."<br><br>I have been moved over and over again by the devotion of the early Saints of the Church and of the pioneers. They left or lost most of their earthly possessions. They suffered sickness and hardship. Some buried fathers, mothers, sons, daughters, husbands, wives, or babies along the way--many knowing from the beginning that they might not complete the journey. Still they went on and thanked God for the blessings of being a part of building Zion. They lived their lives in faith and sacrifice because they had an eternal perspective.<br><br>An eternal perspective helps us to fulfill our purposes in this life. God has given each of us important things to do during our time here on earth.<br><br>As we develop ourselves spiritually, we can learn to see "things as they are, and as they were, and as they are to come" (D&amp;amp;C 93:24). By viewing our lives from the perspective of eternity, we realize that the difficulties we face in mortality are transitory. The Lord told the suffering Joseph Smith:<br><br><i>My son, peace be unto thy soul; thine adversity and thine afflictions shall be but a small moment;</i><br><br><i>And then, if thou endure it well, God shall exalt thee on high; thou shalt triumph over all thy foes.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 121:7–8]<br><br>An eternal perspective helps us understand that adversity can be a springboard to growth. Elder Dallin H. Oaks declared:<br><br><i>Seen with the perspective of eternity, a temporal setback can be an opportunity to develop</i>soul power<i>of eternal significance. Strength is forged in adversity. Faith is developed in a setting where we cannot see what lies ahead.</i>["Spirituality,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 1985, p. 63; emphasis added]<br><br>Here is another wonderful perspective from President Brigham Young, always clear and direct:<br><br><i>I say to the brethren who are leaving home. ...</i><br><br>...<i>pray for your families. ... You must feel--If they live, all right; if they die, all right; if I die, all right; if I live, all right; for we are the Lord's, and we shall soon meet again.</i>[<i>JD</i>6:276]<br><br>We have a remarkable, inspired, living prophet to give us the Lord's perspective. President Gordon B. Hinckley has stated:<br><br><i>The Lord has shown you what is good, and he has given you a commandment and a mandate to do justly, and I emphasize that; to love mercy, and I emphasize that; and to walk humbly with thy God, which needs constant emphasis in this world where there is much of egotism, conceit, and arrogance. I do not hesitate to promise that if you will live up to these standards as believers and performers, your lives will be fulfilling and your efforts fruitful of great good.</i>[BYU commencement address, 15 August 1991, pp. 3–4]<br><br>I believe that the Lord wishes us to be happy and to have joy. The greatest joy is in the peace of knowing that we are following the path that leads us to eternal life, that our house is in order, and that we are preparing to meet our Savior. The greatest gift is eternal life (see D&amp;amp;C 14:7).<br><br>A loving Heavenly Father has made provision for our human weaknesses. He knows our quest for exaltation is a gradual, lifelong process. All he asks is, "Seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all ... things shall be added unto you" (3 Nephi 13:33).<br><br>Jesus Christ has marked the path and led the way: "Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me. ... For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light" (Matthew 11:29–30).<br><br><i>I plead with you to return to the scriptures in some way that opens your mind and heart to be taught. ...</i><br><br><i>... I also plead with you to be determined to pray with all the energy of your heart, that you might have every gift that a loving Heavenly Father knows you must have to serve His Son and to endure against the powers of darkness.</i>[Henry B. Eyring, "Always," CES fireside at BYU, 3 January 1999, pp. 5–6]<br><br>Primary songs teach us simple and beautiful truths. One such song is "A Child's Prayer," by Janice Kapp Perry:<br><br><i>Heavenly Father, are you really there?</i><br><i>And do you hear and answer ev'ry child's prayer?</i><br><i>Some say that heaven is far away,</i><br><i>But I feel it close around me as I pray.</i><br><br><i>Heavenly Father, I remember now</i><br><i>Something that Jesus told disciples long ago:</i><br><i>"Suffer the children to come to me."</i><br><i>Father, in prayer I'm coming now to thee.</i><br><br><i>Pray, he is there; Speak, he is list'ning.</i><br><i>You are his child; His love now surrounds you.</i><br><i>He hears your prayer; He loves the children.</i><br><i>Of such is the kingdom, the kingdom of heav'n.</i><br>["A Child's Prayer,"<i>Songbook,</i>pp. 12–13]<br><br>Again, Christ promises us with his tender love:<br><br><i>Verily, verily, I say unto you, ye are little children, and ye have not as yet understood how great blessings the Father hath in his own hands and prepared for you;</i><br><br><i>And ye cannot bear all things now; nevertheless, be of good cheer, for I will lead you along. The kingdom is yours and the blessings thereof are yours, and the riches of eternity are yours.</i><br><br><i>And he who receiveth all things with thankfulness shall be made glorious; and the things of this earth shall be added unto him, even an hundred fold, yea, more.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 78:17–19]<br><br>Mormon tells those who do not believe in Christ:<br><br><i>And now, I speak also concerning those who do not believe in Christ.</i><br><br><i>Behold, will ye believe in the day of your visitation--behold, when the Lord shall come, yea, even that great day when the earth shall be rolled together as a scroll, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat, yea, in that great day when ye shall be brought to stand before the Lamb of God--then will ye say that there is no God?</i>[Mormon 9:1–2]<br><br>Paul answers<br><br><i>that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow...;</i><br><br><i>And that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.</i>[Philippians 2:10–11]<br><br>Keeping commandments and making and honoring covenants brings a true perspective.<br><br>From my own perspective, "I stand all amazed at the love Jesus offers me." That wonderful hymn echoes my feelings: "Oh, it is wonderful that he should care for me / Enough to die for me!" ("I Stand All Amazed,"<i>Hymns,</i>1985, no. 193).<br><br>I know that our Heavenly Father is real, that he hears and answers our prayers, and that he cares deeply and tenderly for each one of us. I love the Savior for his gift of salvation for each of us. I cannot express in words the complete gratitude I feel for his blessings to me.<br><br>It is my prayer that your perspectives will be eternal perspectives; that you can wait upon the Lord with hope and joy; and that you will not be ashamed of the gospel of Christ. May we be able to come to his altar with our sacrifice of a broken heart and a contrite spirit, for meekness does not resist counsel. May we choose to be engaged in service that helps us to know the meaning of charity. May we use our gifts to bless others and resist the temptations of Satan.<br><br>And, finally, may we know that God is God and make our ways his ways is my prayer in the holy name of Jesus Christ.

<h1>r Matters - Dallin H. Oaks - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
My title and subject today is taken from the Savior's denunciation of the scribes and Pharisees: "Ye pay tithe of mint and anise and cummin, and have omitted the<i>weightier matters</i>of the law, judgment, mercy, and faith: these ought ye to have done, and not to leave the other undone" (Matthew 23:23; emphasis added).<br><br>I wish to speak about some "weightier matters" we might overlook if we allow ourselves to focus exclusively on lesser matters. The weightier matters to which I refer are the qualities like faith and the love of God and his work that will move us strongly toward our eternal goals.<br><br>In speaking of weightier matters, I seek to contrast our ultimate goals in eternity with the mortal methods or short-term objectives we use to pursue them. I read in the<i>Universe</i>about Professor Sara Lee Gibb's message from this pulpit last week. She discussed the difference between earthly perspectives and eternal ones. Then, on Sunday, President Thomas S. Monson reminded you that eternal life is our goal. My message concerns that same contrast, which the Apostle Paul described in these words: "We look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen: for the things which are seen are temporal; but the things which are not seen are eternal" (2 Corinthians 4:18).<br><br>If we concentrate too intently on our obvious earthly methods or objectives, we can lose sight of our eternal goals, which the apostle called "things . . . not seen." If we do this, we can forget where we should be headed and in eternal terms go nowhere. We do not improve our position in eternity just by flying farther and faster in mortality, but only by moving knowledgeably in the right direction. As the Lord told us in modern revelation, "That which the Spirit testifies unto you . . . ye should do in all holiness of heart, walking uprightly before me,<i>considering the end of your salvation"</i>(D&amp;amp;C 46:7; emphasis added).<br><br>We must not confuse means and ends. The vehicle is not the destination. If we lose sight of our eternal goals, we might think the most important thing is how fast we are moving and that any road will get us to our destination. The Apostle Paul described this attitude as "hav[ing] a zeal of God, but not according to knowledge" (Romans 10:2). Zeal is a method, not a goal. Zeal--even a zeal toward God--needs to be "according to knowledge" of God's commandments and his plan for his children. In other words, the weightier matter of the eternal goal must not be displaced by the mortal method, however excellent in itself.<br><br>Thus far I have spoken in generalities. Now I will give three examples.<br><h2><b>Family</b></h2><br>All Latter-day Saints understand that having an eternal family is an eternal goal. Exaltation is a family matter, not possible outside the everlasting covenant of marriage, which makes possible the perpetuation of glorious family relationships. But this does not mean that everything related to mortal families is an eternal goal. There are many short-term objectives associated with families--such as family togetherness or family solidarity or love--that are methods, not the eternal goals we pursue in priority above all others. For example, family solidarity to conduct an evil enterprise is obviously no virtue. Neither is family solidarity to conceal and perpetuate some evil practice like abuse.<br><br>The purpose of mortal families is to bring children into the world, to teach them what is right, and to prepare all family members for exaltation in eternal family relationships. The gospel plan contemplates the kind of family government, discipline, solidarity, and love that serve those ultimate goals. But even the love of family members is subject to the overriding first commandment, which is love of God (see Matthew 22:37–38) and "if ye love me, keep my commandments" (John 14:15). As Jesus taught, "He that loveth father or mother more than me is not worthy of me: and he that loveth son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me" (Matthew 10:37).<br><h2><b>Choice or Agency</b></h2><br>My next example in this message on weightier matters is the role of choice or agency.<br><br>Few concepts have more potential to mislead us than the idea that choice or agency is an ultimate goal. For Latter-day Saints, this potential confusion is partly a product of the fact that moral agency--the right to choose--is a fundamental condition of mortal life. Without this precious gift of God, the purpose of mortal life could not be realized. To secure our agency in mortality we fought a mighty contest the book of Revelation calls a "war in heaven." This premortal contest ended with the devil and his angels being cast out of heaven and being denied the opportunity of having a body in mortal life (see Revelation 12:7–9).<br><br>But our war to secure agency was won. The test in this postwar mortal estate is not to secure choice but to use it--to choose good instead of evil so that we can achieve our eternal goals. In mortality, choice is a method, not a goal.<br><br>Of course, mortals must still resolve many questions concerning what restrictions or consequences should be placed upon choices. But those questions come under the heading of freedom, not agency. Many do not understand that important fact. For example, when I was serving here at BYU, I heard many arguments on BYU's Honor Code or dress and grooming standards that went like this: "It is wrong for BYU to take away my free agency by forcing me to keep certain rules in order to be admitted or permitted to continue as a student." If that silly reasoning were valid, then the Lord, who gave us our agency, took it away when he gave the Ten Commandments. We are responsible to use our agency in a world of choices. It will not do to pretend that our agency has been taken away when we are not free to exercise it without unwelcome consequences.<br><br>Because choice is a method, choices can be exercised either way on any matter, and our choices can serve any goal. Therefore, those who consider freedom of choice as a goal can easily slip into the position of trying to justify any choice that is made. "Choice" can even become a slogan to justify one particular choice. For example, in the 1990s, one who says "I am pro-choice" is clearly understood as opposing any legal restrictions upon a woman's choice to abort a fetus at any point in her pregnancy.<br><br>More than 30 years ago, as a young law professor, I published one of the earliest articles on the legal consequences of abortion. Since that time I have been a knowledgeable observer of the national debate and the unfortunate Supreme Court decisions on the so-called "right to abortion." I have been fascinated with how cleverly those who sought and now defend legalized abortion on demand have moved the issue away from a debate on the moral, ethical, and medical pros and cons of legal restrictions on abortion and focused the debate on the slogan or issue of choice. The slogan or sound bite "pro-choice" has had an almost magical effect in justifying abortion and in neutralizing opposition to it.<br><br>Pro-choice slogans have been particularly seductive to Latter-day Saints because we know that moral agency, which can be described as the power of choice, is a fundamental necessity in the gospel plan. All Latter-day Saints are pro-choice according to that theological definition. But being pro-choice on the need for moral agency does not end the matter for us. Choice is a method, not the ultimate goal. We are accountable for our choices, and only righteous choices will move us toward our eternal goals.<br><br>In this effort, Latter-day Saints follow the teachings of the prophets. On this subject our prophetic guidance is clear. The Lord commanded, "Thou shalt not . . . kill, nor do anything like unto it" (D&amp;amp;C 59:6). The Church opposes elective abortion for personal or social convenience. Our members are taught that, subject only to some very rare exceptions, they must not submit to, perform, encourage, pay for, or arrange for an abortion. That direction tells us what we need to do on the weightier matters of the law, the choices that will move us toward eternal life.<br><br>My young brothers and sisters, in today's world we are not true to our teachings if we are merely pro-choice. We must stand up for the<i>right</i>choice. Those who persist in refusing to think beyond slogans and sound bites like pro-choice wander from the goals they pretend to espouse and wind up giving their support to results they might not support if those results were presented without disguise.<br><br>For example, consider the uses some have made of the possible exceptions to our firm teachings against abortion. Our leaders have taught that the only possible exceptions are when the pregnancy resulted from rape or incest, or a competent physician has determined that the life or health of the mother is in serious jeopardy, or the fetus has severe defects that will not allow the baby to survive beyond birth. But even these exceptions do not justify abortion automatically. Because abortion is a most serious matter, we are counseled that it should be considered only after the persons responsible have consulted with their bishops and received divine confirmation through prayer.<br><br>Some Latter-day Saints say they deplore abortion, but they give these exceptional circumstances as a basis for their pro-choice position that the law should allow abortion on demand in all circumstances. Such persons should face the reality that the circumstances described in these three exceptions are extremely rare. For example, conception by incest or rape--the circumstance most commonly cited by those who use exceptions to argue for abortion on demand--are involved in only a tiny minority of abortions. More than 95 percent of the millions of abortions performed each year extinguish the life of a fetus conceived by consensual relations. Thus the effect in over 95 percent of abortions is not to vindicate choice but to avoid its consequences (see Russell M. Nelson, "Reverence for Life,"<i>Ensign,</i>May 1985, pp. 11–14). Using arguments of "choice" to try to justify altering the consequences of choice is a classic case of omitting what the Savior called "the weightier matters of the law."<br><br>A prominent basis for the secular or philosophical arguments for abortion on demand is the argument that a woman should have control over her own body. Just last week I received a letter from a thoughtful Latter-day Saint outside the United States who analyzed that argument in secular terms. Since his analysis reaches the same conclusion I have urged on religious grounds, I quote it here for the benefit of those most subject to persuasion on this basis:<br><br><i>Every woman has, within the limits of nature, the right to choose what will or will not happen to her body. Every woman has, at the same time, the responsibility for the way she uses her body. If by her choice she behaves in such a way that a human fetus is conceived, she has not only the right</i>to,<i>but also the responsibility</i>for<i>that fetus. If it is an unwanted pregnancy, she is not justified in ending it with the claim that it interferes with her right to choose. She herself chose what would happen to her body by risking pregnancy. She had her choice. If she has no better reason, her conscience should tell her that abortion would be a highly irresponsible choice.</i><br><br><i>What constitutes a good reason? Since a human fetus has intrinsic and infinite human value, the only good reason for an abortion would be the violation or deprivation of, or the threat to the woman's right to choose what will or will not happen to her body. Social, educational, financial, and personal considerations alone do not outweigh the value of the life that is in the fetus. These considerations by themselves may properly lead to the decision to place the baby for adoption after its birth, but not to end its existence in utero.</i><br><br><i>The woman's right to choose what will or will not happen to her body is obviously violated by rape or incest. When conception results in such a case, the woman has the moral as well as the legal right to an abortion because the condition of pregnancy is the result of someone else's irresponsibility, not hers. She does not have to take responsibility for it. To force her by law to carry the fetus to term would be a further violation of her right. She also has the right to refuse an abortion. This would give her the right to the fetus and also the responsibility for it. She could later relinquish this right and this responsibility through the process of placing the baby for adoption after it is born. Whichever way is a responsible choice.</i><br><br>The man who wrote those words also applied the same reasoning to the other exceptions allowed by our doctrine--life of the mother and a baby that will not survive birth.<br><br>I conclude this discussion of choice with two more short points.<br><br>If we say we are anti-abortion in our personal life but pro-choice in public policy, we are saying that we will not use our influence to establish public policies that encourage righteous choices on matters God's servants have defined as serious sins. I urge Latter-day Saints who have taken that position to ask themselves which other grievous sins should be decriminalized or smiled on by the law on this theory that persons should not be hampered in their choices. Should we decriminalize or lighten the legal consequences of child abuse? of cruelty to animals? of pollution? of fraud? of fathers who choose to abandon their families for greater freedom or convenience?<br><br>Similarly, some reach the pro-choice position by saying we should not legislate morality. Those who take this position should realize that the law of crimes legislates nothing but morality. Should we repeal all laws with a moral basis so our government will not punish any choices some persons consider immoral? Such an action would wipe out virtually all of the laws against crimes.<br><h2><b>Diversity</b></h2><br>My last illustration of the bad effects of confusing means and ends, methods and goals, concerns the word<i>diversity.</i>Not many labels have been productive of more confused thinking in our time than this one. A respected federal judge recently commented on current changes in culture and values by observing that "a new credo in celebration of diversity seems to be emerging which proclaims, 'Divided We Stand!'" (J. Thomas Greene, "Activist Judicial Philosophies on Trial,"<i>Federal Rules Decisions</i>178 [1997]: 200). Even in religious terms, we sometimes hear "celebrations of diversity," as if diversity were an ultimate goal.<br><br>The word<i>diversity</i>has legitimate uses to describe a<i>condition,</i>such as when President Bateman referred in last summer's Annual University Conference to the "racial and cultural diversity" of BYU (Merrill J. Bateman, "Brigham Young University in the New Millennium,"<i>BYU 1997–98 Speeches</i>[Provo: BYU, 1998], p. 366). Similarly, what we now call "diversity" appears in the scriptures as a condition. This is evident wherever differences among the children of God are described, such as in the numerous scriptural references to nations, kindreds, tongues, and peoples.<br><br>In the scriptures, the objectives we are taught to pursue on the way to our eternal goals are ideals like love and obedience. These ideals do not accept us as we are but require each of us to make changes. Jesus did not pray that his followers would be "diverse." He prayed that they would be "one" (John 17:21–22). Modern revelation does not say, "Be diverse; and if ye are not diverse, ye are not mine." It says, "Be one; and if ye are not one ye are not mine" (D&amp;amp;C 38:27).<br><br>Since diversity is a condition, a method, or a short-term objective--not an ultimate goal--whenever diversity is urged it is appropriate to ask, "What kind of diversity?" or "Diversity in what circumstance or condition?" or "Diversity in furtherance of what goal?" This is especially important in our policy debates, which should be conducted not in terms of slogans but in terms of the goals we seek and the methods or shorter-term objectives that will achieve them. Diversity for its own sake is meaningless and can clearly be shown to lead to unacceptable results. For example, if diversity is the underlying goal for a neighborhood, does this mean we should take affirmative action to assure that the neighborhood includes thieves and pedophiles, slaughterhouses and water hazards? Diversity can be a good method to achieve some long-term goal, but public policy discussions need to get beyond the slogan to identify the goal, to specify the proposed diversity, and to explain how this kind of diversity will help to achieve the agreed goal.<br><br>Our Church has an approach to the obvious cultural and ethnic diversities among our members. We teach that what unites us is far more important than what differentiates us. Consequently, our members are asked to concentrate their efforts to strengthen our unity--not to glorify our diversity. For example, our objective is not to organize local wards and branches according to differences in culture or in ethnic or national origins, although that effect is sometimes produced on a temporary basis when required because of language barriers. Instead, we teach that members of majority groupings (whatever their nature) are responsible to accept Church members of other groupings, providing full fellowship and full opportunities in Church participation. We seek to establish a community of Saints--"one body" the Apostle Paul called it (1 Corinthians 12:13)--where everyone feels needed and wanted and where all can pursue the eternal goals we share.<br><br>Consistent with the Savior's command to "be one," we seek unity. On this subject President Gordon B. Hinckley has taught:<br><br><i>I remember when President J. Reuben Clark, Jr., as a counselor in the First Presidency, would stand at this pulpit and plead for unity among the priesthood. I think he was not asking that we give up our individual personalities and become as robots cast from a single mold. I am confident he was not asking that we cease to think, to meditate, to ponder as individuals. I think he was telling us that if we are to assist in moving forward the work of God, we must carry in our hearts a united conviction concerning the great basic foundation stones of our faith. . . . If we are to assist in moving forward the work of God, we must carry in our hearts a united conviction that the ordinances and covenants of this work are eternal and everlasting in their consequences.</i>[<i>TGBH,</i>p. 672]<br><br>Anyone who preaches unity risks misunderstanding. The same is true of anyone who questions the goal of diversity. Such a one risks being thought intolerant. But tolerance is not jeopardized by promoting unity or by challenging diversity. Again, I quote President Hinckley:<br><br><i>Each of us is an individual. Each of us is different. There must be respect for those differences. . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . We must work harder to build mutual respect, an attitude of forbearance, with tolerance one for another regardless of the doctrines and philosophies which we may espouse. Concerning these you and I may disagree. But we can do so with respect and civility.</i>[<i>TGBH,</i>pp. 661, 665]<br><br>President Hinckley continues:<br><br><i>An article of the faith to which I subscribe states: "We claim the privilege of worshipping Almighty God according to the dictates of our own conscience, and allow all men the same privilege, let them worship how, where, or what they may" (Article of Faith 11). I hope to find myself always on the side of those defending this position. Our strength lies in our freedom to choose. There is strength even in our very diversity. But there is greater strength in the God-given mandate to each of us to work for the uplift and blessing of all His sons and daughters, regardless of their ethnic or national origin or other differences.</i>[<i>TGBH,</i>p. 664]<br><br>In short, we preach unity among the community of Saints and tolerance toward the personal differences that are inevitable in the beliefs and conduct of a diverse population. Tolerance obviously requires a non-contentious manner of relating toward one another's differences. But tolerance does not require abandoning one's standards or one's opinions on political or public policy choices. Tolerance is a way of reacting to diversity, not a command to insulate it from examination.<br><br>Strong calls for diversity in the public sector sometimes have the effect of pressuring those holding majority opinions to abandon fundamental values to accommodate the diverse positions of those in the minority. Usually this does not substitute a minority value for a majority one. Rather, it seeks to achieve "diversity" by abandoning the official value position altogether, so that no one's value will be contradicted by an official or semiofficial position. The result of this abandonment is not a diversity of values but an official anarchy of values. I believe this is an example of BYU visiting professor Louis Pojman's observation in a recent<i>Universe</i>Viewpoint (October 13, 1998, p. 4) that diversity can be used "as a euphemism for moral relativism."<br><br>There are hundreds of examples of this, where achieving the goal of diversity results in the anarchy of values we call moral relativism. These examples include such varied proposals as forbidding the public schools to teach the wrongfulness of certain behavior or the rightfulness of patriotism and includes attempting to banish a representation of the Ten Commandments from any public buildings.<br><br>In a day when prominent thinkers like James Billington and Allan Bloom have decried the fact that our universities have stopped teaching right and wrong, we are grateful for the countercultural position we enjoy at BYU. Moral relativism, which is said to be the dominant force in American universities, has no legitimate place at Brigham Young University. Our faculty teach values--the right and wrong taught in the gospel of Jesus Christ--and students come to BYU for that teaching.<br><br>In conclusion, diversity and choice are not the weightier matters of the law. The weightier matters that move us toward our goals of eternal life are love of God, obedience to his commandments, and unity in accomplishing the work of his Church. In this belief and practice we move against the powerful modern tides running toward individualism and tolerance rather than toward obedience and cooperative action. Though our belief and practice is unpopular, it is right, and it does not require the blind obedience or the stifling uniformity its critics charge. If we are united on our eternal goal and united on the inspired principles that will get us there, we can be diverse on individual efforts in support of our goals and consistent with those principles.<br><br>We know that the work of God cannot be done without unity and cooperative action. We also know that the children of God cannot be exalted as single individuals. Neither a man nor a woman can be exalted in the celestial kingdom unless both unite in the unselfishness of the everlasting covenant of marriage and unless both choose to keep the commandments and honor the covenants of that united state.<br><br>I testify of Jesus Christ, our Savior. As the One whose atonement paid the incomprehensible price for our sins, he is the One who can prescribe the conditions for our salvation. He has commanded us to keep his commandments (see John 14:15) and to "be one" (D&amp;amp;C 38:27). I pray that we will make the wise choices to keep the commandments and to seek the unity that will move us toward our ultimate goal, "eternal life, which gift is the greatest of all the gifts of God" (D&amp;amp;C 14:7). I say this in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Dallin H.

<h1>st Not Away Therefore Your Confidence&quot; - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
There is a lesson in the Prophet Joseph Smith's account of the First Vision that virtually everyone in this audience has had occasion to experience, or one day soon will. It is the plain and very sobering truth that before great moments, certainly before great spiritual moments, there can come adversity, opposition, and darkness. Life has some of those moments for us, and occasionally they come just as we are approaching an important decision or a significant step in our life.<br><br>In the marvelous account that we read too seldom, Joseph said he had scarcely begun his prayer when he felt a power of astonishing influence come over him. Thick darkness, as he described it, gathered around him and seemed bent on his utter destruction. But he exerted all his powers to call upon God to deliver him out of the power of this enemy, and as he did so a pillar of light brighter than the noonday sun descended gradually until it rested upon him. At the very moment of the light's appearance, he found himself delivered from the destructive power that had held him bound. What then followed is the greatest epiphany since the events surrounding the crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension of Christ in the meridian of time. The Father and the Son appeared to Joseph Smith, and the dispensation of the fulness of times had begun. (<span style="color: #33cccc;"><a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/pgp/js-h/1.15-20?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">See JS--H 1:15–20</a></span>.)<br><br>Most of us do not need any more reminders than we have already had that there is one who personifies "opposition in all things," that "an angel of God" fell "from heaven" and in so doing became "miserable forever." What a chilling destiny. Lehi teaches us that because this is Lucifer's fate, "he sought also the misery of all mankind" (<span style="color: #33cccc;"><a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/2.11,17-18?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2 Nephi 2:11, 17–18</a></span>). Surely this must be the original ecclesiastical source for the homely little adage that misery loves company.<br><br>A morning's devotional could be devoted to this subject of the adversary's strong,<i>preliminary, anticipatory</i>opposition to many of the good things that God has in store for us. But today I want to move past that observation to another truth we may not recognize so readily. This is a lesson in the parlance of the athletic contest that reminds us "it isn't over until it's over." It is the reminder that the fight goes on. Unfortunately we must not think that Satan is defeated with that first, strong breakthrough that so dramatically brings the light and moves us forward.<br><br>To make my point a little more vividly, may I go to another passage of scripture, indeed to another vision. You will recall that the book of Moses begins with him being taken up to "an exceedingly high mountain" where, the scripture says, "he saw God face to face, and he talked with him, and the glory of God was upon Moses" (<span style="color: #33cccc;"><a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/pgp/moses/1.1-2?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Moses 1:1–2</a></span>). What then followed was what happens to prophets who are taken to high mountains. The Lord said to Moses,<br><br><i>Look, and I will show thee the workmanship of mine hands....</i><br><br><i>And ... Moses ... beheld the earth, yea, even all of it; and there was not a particle of it which he did not behold, discerning it by the spirit of God.</i><br><br><i>And he beheld also the inhabitants thereof, and there was not a soul which he beheld not.</i>[<span style="color: #33cccc;"><a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/pgp/moses/1.4,27-28?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Moses 1:4, 27–28</a></span>]<br><br>This experience is remarkable by every standard. It is one of the great revelations given in human history. It stands with the greatest accounts we have of any prophet's experience with divinity.<br><br>But Moses' message to you today is, "Don't let your guard down." Don't assume that a great revelation, some marvelous illuminating moment, or the opening of an inspired path is the end of it. Remember, it isn't over until it's over. What happened to Moses next,<i>after</i>his revelatory moment, would be ludicrous if it were not so dangerous and so absolutely true to form. In an effort to continue his opposition, in his unfailing effort to get his licks in later if not sooner, Lucifer appeared and shouted in equal portions of anger and petulance<i>after</i>God had revealed himself to the prophet, saying, "Moses, worship<i>me."</i>But Moses was not having it. He had just seen the real thing, and by comparison this sort of performance was pretty dismal.<br><br><i>Moses looked upon Satan and said: Who art thou? ... where is thy glory, that I should worship thee?</i><br><br><i>For behold, I could not look upon God, except his glory should come upon me. ... But I can look upon thee in the natural man....</i><br><br><i>... Where is thy glory, for it is darkness unto me? And I can judge between thee and God....</i><br><br><i>Get thee hence, Satan; deceive me not.</i>[<span style="color: #33cccc;"><a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/pgp/moses/1.13-16?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Moses 1:13–16</a></span>]<br><br>The record then depicts a reaction that is both pathetic and frightening.<br><br><i>And now, when Moses had said these words, Satan cried with a loud voice, and ranted upon the earth, and commanded, saying: I am the Only Begotten, worship me.</i><br><br><i>And it came to pass that Moses began to fear exceedingly; and as he began to fear, he saw the bitterness of hell. Nevertheless, calling upon God</i>[the very phrase used by Joseph Smith],<i>he received strength, and he commanded, saying: Depart from me, Satan, for this one God only will I worship, which is the God of glory.</i><br><br><i>And now Satan began to tremble, and the earth shook....</i><br><br><i>And it came to pass that Satan cried with a loud voice, with weeping, and wailing, and gnashing of teeth; and he departed hence.</i>[<span style="color: #33cccc;"><a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/pgp/moses/1.19-22?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Moses 1:19–22</a></span>]<br><br>So Satan left, always to come again, we can be sure, but always to be defeated by the God of Glory--always.<br><br>I wish to encourage every one of you today regarding opposition that so often comes<i>after</i>enlightened decisions have been made,<i>after</i>moments of revelation and conviction have given us a peace and an assurance we thought we would never lose. In his letter to the Hebrews, the Apostle Paul was trying to encourage new members who had just joined the Church, who undoubtedly had had spiritual experiences and had received the pure light of testimony, only to discover that not only had their troubles not ended, but that some of them had only begun.<br><br>It reminds me of President Hugh B. Brown's statement about marriage. He said he had always been told that when he got married he would come to the end of his troubles. So he got married, only to discover they were speaking about the front end. Now, you returned missionaries who are still sitting around single, don't chuckle too loudly at that. I am not through with you this morning!<br><br>Paul pled with those new members about the way President Hinckley is pleading with new members today. The reminder is that we cannot sign on for a moment of such eternal significance and everlasting consequence without knowing it will be a fight--a good fight and a winning fight, but a fight nevertheless. Paul said to those who thought a new testimony, a personal conversion, or a spiritual baptismal experience would put them beyond trouble, "Call to remembrance the former days, in which,<i>after ye were illuminated,</i>ye endured a great fight of afflictions" (<span style="color: #33cccc;"><a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/heb/10.32?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hebrews 10:32</a></span>; emphasis added).<br><br>Then came this tremendous counsel, which is at the heart of my counsel to you and the title of my remarks this morning:<br><br>Cast not away therefore your confidence,<i>which hath great recompence of reward.</i><br><br><i>For ye have need of patience, that, after ye have done the will of God, ye might receive the promise....</i><br><br><i>... If any man draw back, my soul shall have no pleasure in him....</i><br><br><i>... We are not of them who draw back unto perdition.</i>[<span style="color: #33cccc;"><a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/heb/10.35-36,38-39?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hebrews 10:35–36, 38–39</a></span>; emphasis added]<br><br>In LDS talk that is to say, "Sure it is tough--before you join the Church, while you are trying to join, and after you have joined." That is the way it has always been, Paul said, but don't "draw back," he warned. Don't panic and retreat. Don't lose your confidence. Don't forget how you once felt. Don't distrust the experience you had. That tenacity is what saved Moses when the adversary confronted him, and it is what will save you.<br><br>I suppose every returned missionary and probably every convert within the sound of my voice knows exactly what I am talking about: appointments for discussions canceled, the Book of Mormon in a plastic bag hanging from a front-door knob, baptismal dates not met. And so it goes through the teaching period, through the commitments, through the baptism, through the first weeks and months in the Church, and more or less forever. At least the adversary would pursue it forever, if he thought he could see any weakening of your resolve or any chink in your armor--even if it is after the fact.<br><br>This opposition turns up almost anyplace something good has happened. It can happen when you are trying to get an education. It can hit you after your first month in your new mission field. It certainly happens in matters of love and marriage. (Now I am back to those returned missionaries.) I would like to have a dollar for every person in a courtship who knew he or she had felt the guidance of the Lord in that relationship, had prayed about the experience enough to know it was the will of the Lord, knew they loved each other and enjoyed each other's company, and saw a lifetime of wonderful compatibility ahead--only to panic, to get a brain cramp, to have total catatonic fear sweep over them. They "draw back," as Paul said, if not into perdition at least into marital paralysis.<br><br>I am not saying you shouldn't be very careful about something as significant and serious as marriage. And I certainly am not saying that a young man can get a revelation that he is to marry a certain person without that young woman getting the same confirmation. I have seen a lot of those one-way revelations in young people's lives. Yes, there are cautions and considerations to make, but once there has been genuine illumination, beware the temptation to retreat from a good thing. If it was right when you prayed about it and trusted it and lived for it, it is right now. Don't give up when the pressure mounts. You can find an apartment. You can win over your mother-in-law. You can sell your harmonica and therein fund one more meal. It's been done before. Don't give in.<i>Certainly don't give in to that being who is bent on the destruction of your happiness.</i>He wants everyone to be miserable like unto himself. Face your doubts. Master your fears. "Cast not away therefore your confidence." Stay the course and see the beauty of life unfold for you.<br><br>To help us make our way through these experiences, these important junctures in our lives, let me draw from another scriptural reference to Moses. It was given in the early days of this dispensation when revelation was needed, when a true course was being set and had to be continued.<br><br>Virtually everyone in the room knows the formula for revelation given in <span style="color: #33cccc;"><a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/9?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">section 9</a></span> of the Doctrine and Covenants--you know, the verses about studying it out in your mind and the Lord promising to confirm or deny. What most of us don't read in conjunction with this is the section that precedes it--<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/8?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="color: #33cccc;">section 8</span></a>. In that revelation the Lord defined<i>revelation:</i><br><br><i>I will tell you in your mind and in your heart, by the Holy Ghost, which shall come upon you and which shall dwell in your heart.</i>[I love the combination there of both mind and heart. God will teach us in a reasonable way and in a revelatory way--mind and heart combined, by the Holy Ghost.]<br><br><i>Now, behold,</i>this is the spirit of revelation; behold, this is the spirit by which Moses brought the children of Israel through the Red Sea on dry ground. [<span style="color: #33cccc;"><a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/8.2-3?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">D&amp;amp;C 8:2–3</a></span>; emphasis added]<br><br>Question: Why would the Lord use the example of crossing the Red Sea as the classic example of "the spirit of revelation"? Why didn't he use the First Vision? Or the example from the book of Moses we just used? Or the vision of the brother of Jared? Well, he could have used any of these, but he didn't. Here he had another purpose in mind.<br><br>Usually we think of revelation as information. Just open the books to us, Lord, like: What was the political significance of the Louisiana Purchase or the essence of the second law of thermodynamics? It is obvious that when you see those kinds of questions on a test paper, you need revelation. Someone said prayer will never be eliminated from the schools so long as there are final examinations. But aside from the fact that you probably aren't going to get<i>that</i>kind of revelation--because in this Church we do not believe in ex nihilo creation, especially in exams--this is too narrow a concept of<i>revelation.</i>May I suggest how section 8 broadens our understanding of section 9, particularly in light of these "fights of affliction" that Paul spoke of and that I have been discussing.<br><br>First of all, revelation almost always comes in response to a question, usually an urgent question--not always, but usually. In that sense it does provide information, but it is urgently needed information, special information. Moses' challenge was how to get himself and the children of Israel out of this horrible predicament they were in. There were chariots behind them, sand dunes on every side, and just a lot of water immediately ahead. He needed information all right--what to do--but it wasn't a casual thing he was asking. In this case it was literally a matter of life and death.<br><br>You will need information, too, but in matters of great consequence it is not likely to come unless you want it urgently, faithfully, humbly. Moroni calls it seeking "with real intent" (<span style="color: #33cccc;"><a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/moro/10.4?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Moroni 10:4</a></span>). If you can seek that way, and stay in that mode, not much that the adversary can counter with will dissuade you from a righteous path. You can hang on, whatever the assault and affliction, because you have paid the price to--figuratively, at least--see the face of God and live.<br><br>Like Moses in his vision, there may come after the fact some competing doubts and some confusion, but they will pale when you measure them against the real thing.<i>Remember the real thing.</i>Remember how urgently you have needed help in earlier times and that you got it. The Red Sea will open to the honest seeker of revelation. The adversary does have power to hedge up the way, to marshal Pharaoh's forces and dog our escape right to the water's edge, but he can't produce the real thing.<i>He cannot conquer if we will it otherwise.</i>"Exerting all [our] powers to call upon God," the light will again come, the darkness will again retreat, the safety will again be sure. That is lesson number one about crossing the Red Sea, your Red Seas, by the spirit of revelation.<br><br>Lesson number two is closely related to it. It is that in the process of revelation and in making important decisions, fear almost always plays a destructive, sometimes paralyzing role. To Oliver Cowdery, who missed the opportunity of a lifetime because he didn't seize it in the lifetime of the opportunity, the Lord said, "You did not continue as you commenced." Does that sound familiar to those who have been illuminated and then knuckled under to second thoughts and returning doubts? "It is not expedient that you should translate now," the Lord said in language that must have been very hard for Oliver to hear. "Behold, it was expedient when you commenced;<i>but you feared,</i>and the time is past, and it is not expedient now" (<span style="color: #33cccc;"><a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/9.5,10-11?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">D&amp;amp;C 9:5, 10–11</a></span>; emphasis added).<br><br>Every one of us runs the risk of fear. You do, and I do. Did you catch the line I tried to emphasize as I read the account from the Pearl of Great Price? For a moment in that confrontation, "Moses began to fear exceedingly; and as he began to fear, he saw the bitterness of hell" (<span style="color: #33cccc;"><a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/pgp/moses/1.20?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Moses 1:20</a></span>). That's when you see it--when you are afraid.<br><br>That is exactly the problem that beset the children of Israel at the edge of the Red Sea. That is lesson number two. It has everything to do with holding fast to earlier illumination. The record says, "And when Pharaoh drew nigh, the children of Israel lifted up their eyes, and, behold, the Egyptians marched after them; and they were sore afraid."<br><br>Some, just like those Paul had described earlier, said, "Let's go back. This isn't worth it. We must have been wrong. That probably wasn't the right spirit telling us to leave Egypt." What they actually said to Moses was, "Wherefore hast thou dealt thus with us, to carry us forth out of Egypt? ... It had been better for us to serve the Egyptians, than that we should die in the wilderness" (<span style="color: #33cccc;"><a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/ex/14.10-12?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Exodus 14:10–12</a></span>).<br><br>And I have to say, "What about that which has already happened? What about the miracles that got you here? What about the frogs and the lice? What about the rod and the serpent, the river and the blood? What about the hail, the locusts, the fire, and the firstborn sons?"<br><br>How soon we forget. It would<i>not</i>have been better to stay and serve the Egyptians, and it is<i>not</i>better to remain outside the Church nor to reject a mission call nor to put off marriage and so on and so on forever. Of course our faith will be tested as we fight through these self-doubts and second thoughts. Some days we will be miraculously led out of Egypt--seemingly free, seemingly on our way--only to come to yet another confrontation, like all that water lying before us.<i>At those times we must resist the temptation to panic and to give up.</i>At those times fear will be the strongest of the adversary's weapons against us.<br><br>"And Moses said unto the people,<i>Fear ye not,</i>stand still, and see the salvation of the Lord. ... The Lord shall fight for you."<br><br>In confirmation the great Jehovah said to Moses, "Speak unto the children of Israel, that they go forward" (<span style="color: #33cccc;"><a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/ex/14.13-15?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Exodus 14:13–15</a></span>; emphasis added).<br><br>That is the second lesson of the spirit of revelation. After you have gotten the message, after you have paid the price to feel his love and hear the word of the Lord, "go forward." Don't fear, don't vacillate, don't quibble, don't whine. You may, like Alma going to Ammonihah, have to find a route that leads an unusual way, but that is exactly what the Lord was doing here for the children of Israel. Nobody had ever crossed the Red Sea this way, but so what? There's always a first time. With the spirit of revelation, dismiss your fears and wade in with both feet. In the words of Joseph Smith, "Brethren [and, I would add, sisters], shall we not go on in so great a cause? Go forward and not backward. Courage, brethren; and on, on to the victory!" (<span style="color: #33cccc;"><a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/128.22?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">D&amp;amp;C 128:22</a></span>).<br><br>The third lesson from the Lord's spirit of revelation in the miracle of the crossing of the Red Sea is that,<i>along with the illuminating revelation that points us toward a righteous purpose or duty, God will also provide the means and power to achieve that purpose.</i>Trust in that eternal truth. If God has told you something is right, if something is indeed true for you,<i>he will provide the way for you to accomplish it.</i>That is true of joining the Church. It is true of getting an education, of going on a mission or of getting married or of any of a hundred worthy tasks in your young lives. Remember what the Savior said to the Prophet Joseph in the Sacred Grove. What was the problem in 1820? Why was Joseph not to join any other Church? It was at least in part because "they teach for doctrines the commandments of men, having a form of godliness,<i>but they deny the power thereof"</i>(<span style="color: #33cccc;"><a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/pgp/js-h/1.19?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">JS--H 1:19</a></span>; emphasis added).<br><br>God's grace is sufficient! The Lord would tell Joseph again and again through those early difficult days that, just as in the days of old, these modern children of Israel would<br><br><i>be led out of bondage by power, and with a stretched-out arm....</i><br><br><i>Therefore, let not your hearts faint ... : Mine angel shall go up before you....</i><br><br><i>... and also my presence, and in time ye shall possess the goodly land.</i>[<span style="color: #33cccc;"><a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/103.17-20?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">D&amp;amp;C 103:17–20</a></span>]<br><br>What goodly land? Your goodly land. Your promised land. Your New Jerusalem. Your own little acre flowing with milk and honey. Your future. Your dreams. Your destiny. I believe that in our own individual ways, God takes us to the grove or the mountain or the temple and there shows us the wonder of what his plan is for us. We may not see it as fully as Moses or Nephi or the brother of Jared did, but we see as much as we need to see in order to know the Lord's will for us and to know that he loves us beyond mortal comprehension. I also believe that the adversary and his pinched, calculating little minions try to oppose such experiences and then try to darken them after the fact. But that is not the way of the gospel. That is not the way of a Latter-day Saint who claims as the fundamental fact of the Restoration the spirit of revelation.<br><br>Fighting through darkness and despair and pleading for the light is what opened this dispensation. It is what keeps it going, and it is what will keep you going. With Paul, I say to all of you:<br><br><i>Cast not away therefore your confidence, which hath great recompence of reward.</i><br><br><i>For ye have need of patience, that, after ye have done the will of God, ye might receive the promise.</i>[<span style="color: #33cccc;"><a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/heb/10.35-36?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hebrews 10:35–36</a></span>]<br><br>I acknowledge the reality of opposition and adversity, but I bear witness of the God of Glory, of the redeeming Son of God, of light and hope and a bright future. I promise you that God lives and loves you, each one of you, and that he has set bounds and limits to the opposing powers of darkness. I testify that Jesus is the Christ, the victor over death and hell and the fallen one who schemes there. The gospel of Jesus Christ is true, and it has been restored, just as we have sung and testified this morning.<br><br>"Fear ye not." And when the second and the third and the fourth blows come, "fear ye not. ... The Lord shall fight for you." "Cast not away therefore your confidence." I say this in the sacred and holy name of our Protector and Redeemer, even the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Jeffrey R.

<h1> Up the Kingdom of God - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I am honored to be with you tonight. Because I am a mother and grandmother of young people your age, I feel qualified to bring you a message from your mothers and grandmothers. I want you to know how much you are loved. We love you more than life itself, more than you will understand until you have children of your own. And, oh my, do we worry about you and want you to be happy! You've probably noticed that it is usually very difficult for us to refrain from telling you exactly what you need to do to be happy. But that's only because we love you and have been around a little longer than you have. This is a crazy world, and we have had some experience with the pitfalls and don't want you to be hurt.<br><br>Mothers are also quite visionary and can sense your potential. Sometimes you may think we get a little pushy in helping you reach that potential. Tonight, if I get a little pushy, just smile and think, "She's just like my mother--that means she loves me, she cares."<br><br>You are an incredible group of Saints! a fantastic army of goodness. You have so much going for you. You are youthful, strong, and filled with energy. You have good minds; you can actually remember things! Dr. Seuss describes some of your assets in his book<i>Oh, the Places You'll Go!</i><br><br><i>Congratulations!</i><br><i>Today is your day.</i><br><i>You're off to Great Places!</i><br><i>You're off and away!</i><br><br><i>You have brains in your head.</i><br><i>You have feet in your shoes.</i><br><i>You can steer yourself</i><br><i>any direction you choose.</i><br>[<i>Oh, the Places You'll Go!</i>(New York: Random House, 1990), pp. 1–2]<br><br>He's talking about agency--the ability and freedom to choose your direction. Agency is an incredible gift from Heavenly Father. To help you with your choices, He has given you so much more than brains and feet. He has given you the truth through the Holy Ghost. You know who you are, where you came from, and where you are going. That knowledge should help you make wise choices.<br><br>In<i>The Miracle of Forgiveness,</i>President Spencer W. Kimball wrote more seriously about your choices:<br><br><i>Life gives to all the choice. You can satisfy yourself with mediocrity if you wish. You can be common, ordinary, dull, colorless; or you can channel your life so that it will be clean, vibrant, progressive, useful, colorful, rich. You can soil your record, defile your soul, trample underfoot virtue, honor, and goodness, and thus forfeit an exaltation in the kingdom of God. Or you can be righteous, commanding the respect and admiration of your associates in all walks of life, and enjoying the love of the Lord. Your destiny is in your hands and your all-important decisions are your own to make.</i>[<i>The Miracle of Forgiveness</i>(Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1969), p. 235]<br><br>Tonight I would like to put an idea in your mind and in your heart--a direction you might consider, a choice you might make. I really do want to push you toward your potential. This idea is not something I thought about when I was your age, but you are so much better than I was, and the Church needs you so desperately.<br><br>In Matthew 6:33 we read: "But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you."<br><br>Footnote<i>a</i>to that verse in the LDS scriptures takes us to the Joseph Smith Translation of Matthew 6:38, where the Lord, through the Prophet Joseph Smith, expands our vision: "But seek ye first<i>to build up</i>the kingdom of God,<i>and to establish</i>his righteousness" (italics in original).<br><br>Tonight I would ask you to consider what you can do to build up the kingdom of God, to be disciples of Christ, to be of service, to be helpful in the kingdom, right now! I want to share some thoughts and ideas about the wondrous opportunity and sacred responsibility of being kingdom builders, and then suggest some specific ways you can build the kingdom of God.<br><br>What exactly is the kingdom of God on earth? It is His Church, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. It is you and me, an organized group of people who have been baptized and have taken upon ourselves the name of Jesus Christ and who are led by a living prophet who speaks for God. We're talking about building up His Church. We're talking about building up each other.<br><br>What type of person does the Lord need to help build His kingdom on earth? President Spencer W. Kimball taught us the nature of kingdom builders:<br><br><i>The Savior could have taken highly trained minds from the temple porches for the chief builders of his kingdom, but he went to the seashore to get humble fishermen. He wanted men who . . . were trusting and sincere and willing to serve.</i>[<i>TSWK,</i>p. 65]<br><br>You are that kind of men and women. The Lord does not require that you have exceptional gifts or abilities. He asks that you be humble, trusting, sincere, and willing to serve. Then He can guide you to do important work in His kingdom. He is depending on you.<br><br>At times, when we are asked or expected to do something new or difficult, we feel inadequate. We say things such as, "I can't do that. That's too difficult. They've called the wrong person. I'm not qualified." Those negative feelings can become overwhelming and actually hinder our ability to serve. But those feelings of inadequacy can also humble us and turn us to the Lord. With His help we can accomplish many good things. To those who are willing but feel inadequate, President Spencer W. Kimball would say:<br><br><i>We are glad you feel inadequate. That means you will be humble and do all in your power to make yourself able. You will call upon the Lord, the source of power and strength.</i>[<i>TSWK,</i>p. 477]<br><br>Early one evening a little over four years ago, we were having dinner when the phone rang. When I answered it, I heard, "This is President Monson's secretary. May I speak to Sister Pinegar?" Oh, my heart! She asked if we could set up an appointment when Brother Pinegar and I could meet with President Thomas S. Monson. The days preceding the appointment were spent in the agony of anticipation, in retrospection, and in feeling totally inadequate regardless of what I was going to be called to do. When the day finally arrived, President Monson was kind and gracious. He called me to serve as the Primary general president. He instructed me in my new responsibility and calmed my soul when he reminded me that "whom God calls, God qualifies."<br><br>Being involved in building the kingdom will require us to move out of our comfort zone. One of the great purposes of earth life is to help us change and become more Christlike. That requires us to stretch and grow. The scriptures remind us that our weaknesses can become strengths when we humble ourselves and have faith:<br><br><i>And if men come unto me I will show unto them their weakness. I give unto men weakness that they may be humble; and my grace is sufficient for all men that humble themselves before me; for if they humble themselves before me, and have faith in me, then will I make weak things become strong unto them.</i>[Ether 12:27]<br><br>Why should you be a kingdom builder? Is it really your responsibility? Why is it important to do right now, when you are so involved in getting an education, earning enough to make ends meet, trying to make it on your own, starting your family, building up your own kingdom? You should be a builder of the kingdom right now because you are desperately needed. And did you know you have promised to help?<br><br>When I was a little girl my mother told me, "Whenever you make a promise, consider well its importance; then when made, engrave it upon your heart." You have covenanted to help. Your baptism is a testimony of your covenant to serve Him, to help build up the kingdom of God. In Mosiah 18:13 we read Alma's words to Helam as he baptized him at the Waters of Mormon:<br><br><i>And when he had said these words, the Spirit of the Lord was upon him, and he said: Helam, I baptize thee, having authority from the Almighty God, as a testimony that ye have entered into a covenant to serve him until you are dead as to the mortal body.</i><br><br>Do you remember the day you entered into that covenant to serve Him? I was a conscientious eight-year-old. I wanted to keep the commandments. I wanted to feel my Savior's approval. I remember that after I was baptized my father took me to a store, gave me a dollar, and told me to pick out something that would remind me of my baptism. I found five small pictures of the Savior and hung them in my room. I looked at them often and felt that He really did care about me. I wanted to please Him, but I wasn't sure that I knew what all of the commandments were, and I worried that maybe I was not keeping all of them. Though my understanding of the covenant I made at baptism has increased over the years, as I partake of the sacrament each week and renew my covenants, I continue to feel His love for me, and I still want to please Him and feel His approval. One thing I know for certain: I am happy when I'm involved in His work.<br><br>Why should you be a kingdom builder? Because you need to feel that happiness and joy. Brigham Young said:<br><br><i>For there is no real peace, there is no real happiness in anything in heaven or on the earth, except to those who serve the Lord. In His service there is joy, there is happiness; but they are not to be found anywhere else.</i>[<i>JD</i>5:1]<br><br>That joy and happiness is worth working for.<br><br>Why should you be a kingdom builder? Because being a kingdom builder is a wondrous opportunity. Is it not wondrous to think that He needs you, that He, who is the Creator, the Exemplar, the Redeemer, asks for your help? I believe, because we are the spirit children of God the Father, because we have taken upon ourselves the name of Jesus Christ, because we have received the gift of the Holy Ghost, within our souls there is a yearning to serve, to be kingdom builders. Have you ever felt a despondency, a boredom, a depression, a feeling of worthlessness when you are not meaningfully involved in helping with the work of the kingdom? Missionaries returning from full-time service often have those feelings. Those feelings are a call to get more involved in building the kingdom. We are His children; we need to help.<br><br>How should we help build the kingdom? The scriptures remind us that we will not be commanded in all things, but that we<br><br><i>should be anxiously engaged in a good cause, and do many things of</i>[our]<i>own free will, and bring to pass much righteousness;</i><br><br><i>For the power is in</i>[us],<i>wherein</i>[we]<i>are agents unto</i>[ourselves]. [D&amp;amp;C 58:27–28]<br><br>That power within us is the Holy Ghost, and He can lead us to do good even as Nephi was led, "not knowing beforehand the things which [we] should do" (1 Nephi 4:6).<br><br>The Holy Ghost will prompt us as we learn to open our ears and hearts to hear and understand the word of the Lord through the scriptures and the living prophets. King Benjamin encouraged his people to not trifle with the words he would speak to them. He said, "Hearken unto me, and open your ears that ye may hear, and your hearts that ye may understand" (Mosiah 2:9). After we have heard the word of the Lord we must be able to move forward, to make a plan, organize, and be committed. In the Doctrine and Covenants, we are reminded to "organize [ourselves]; prepare every needful thing" (D&amp;amp;C 88:119).<br><br>Let me share with you some simple ideas that can help direct your efforts to build the kingdom and "bring to pass much righteousness" (D&amp;amp;C 58:27). Start by recognizing your divine potential. You are an integral part of God's kingdom. You are a son or daughter of God with great things to do here on earth. The scriptures teach:<br><br><i>The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the children of God:</i><br><br><i>And if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ.</i>[Romans 8:16–17]<br><br>What a glorious revelation! Be pleased with who you are. You are good in so many ways.<br><br>As a child of God, you have the ability to improve and progress throughout your life. Open your heart and feel the desire to become even a little better than you now are. Make a plan. Choose one thing you need to improve in. Maybe it's communicating with Heavenly Father more frequently in heartfelt prayer. Maybe it's being more honest with yourself and others. Maybe it's going to your bishop and beginning the process of repentance. Next, talk to Heavenly Father in pleading prayer; ask Him to help you be strong and have the integrity and commitment to carry out your plan.<br><br>So many of you are great examples of standing up for what you believe. You have made plans, you know where you are going, and you are great examples of commitment and integrity. A young woman, while attending her first year at BYU, didn't date a great deal. The second year, she met a young man. She liked him a lot; they had so much fun together. Then she discovered he was not living some of the standards of the Church. She was so disappointed. She felt deceived. The scriptures caution, "Little children, let no man deceive you: he that doeth righteousness is righteous" (1 John 3:7).<br><br>After denial and many heart-wrenching discussions with this young man, she said good-bye. It was so difficult to do. That young woman was filled with integrity. She knew who she was and what she wanted in her life, her eternal life. She had a plan and was committed, and she was guided by the Holy Ghost. Hopefully, those tender discussions helped that young man turn his life around.<br><br>Building and strengthening each other is another important way you can be involved in building the kingdom. That is something you can do so well. What does the word of God say about strengthening each other? Listen:<br><br><i>A new commandment I give unto you, That ye love one another; as I have loved you, that ye also love one another.</i>[John 13:34]<br><br><i>He that loveth his brother abideth in the light, and there is none occasion of stumbling in him.</i><br><br><i>But he that hateth his brother is in darkness, and walketh in darkness, and knoweth not whither he goeth, because that darkness hath blinded his eyes.</i>[1 John 2:10–11]<br><br><i>When thou art converted, strengthen thy brethren.</i>[Luke 22:32]<br><br><i>Strengthen your brethren in all your conversation, in all your prayers, in all your exhortations, and in all your doings.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 108:7]<br><br>Open your hearts and let the Holy Ghost fill you with the desire to bless each other, your family, your roommates, your friends. Do something each day that will bring them joy; maybe just a smile would do it.<br><br>The giant redwood trees in northern California give us a powerful image of how we can strengthen each other. These gigantic trees have very shallow root systems. But when they are surrounded by other redwood trees, the strongest, fiercest wind cannot blow them over. The roots of the giant redwood trees intertwine and strengthen each other, and when a storm comes, they actually hold each other up.<br><br>There are many ways we can hold each other up. First and foremost, we must always be an example by being true to the faith. We heard this wonderful choir sing:<br><br><i>Shall the youth of Zion falter</i><br><i>In defending truth and right?</i><br><i>While the enemy assaileth,</i><br><i>Shall we shrink or shun the fight? No!</i><br><br>Why? Because:<br><br><i>To God's command,</i><br><i>Soul, heart, and hand,</i><br><i>Faithful and true we will ever stand.</i><br>["True to the Faith,"<i>Hymns,</i>1985, no. 254]<br><br>I believe in you. The youth of the Church are stronger and more faithful than they have ever been. Our prophet believes in you. In a letter from the First Presidency that is to be delivered by home teachers to every home in the Church, it says:<br><br><i>We compliment most warmly those of our young people who choose to follow the way of the Lord and the program of the Church. We are pleased to note that faith is increasing among our youth, for which we are deeply grateful.</i>["A Letter to Church Members,"<i>Church News,</i>27 February 1999, p. 3]<br><br>Your faithful example is a powerful way to build the kingdom; but at times, you must do even more than be an example. You must be as the watchmen on the tower and lovingly, but firmly, stand for the truth by warning your friends.<br><br>I grew up in Hawaii. I loved to swim in the ocean, to catch the waves, to bodysurf. Lest you think I was a pro, I was only about ten years old. Sometimes, as I looked out at an incoming wave, I would catch a glimpse of a beautiful bubble floating on top of the water. I would do anything in my power to move away from that bubble. The bubble was beautiful, alluring, and very deceptive. It was a Portuguese man-of-war, a small jellyfish. I knew the consequences of coming in contact with that bubble, with its long, almost invisible threads stretching out into the water below. The sting was terrible. It felt like dozens of bee stings as the strands brushed against your skin or wrapped around you.<br><br>At times, when we arrived at the beach, there would be a caring adult or another child who would warn us of the danger: "Don't go in the water. There are a lot of Portuguese man-of-wars today." If we were wise, we would listen and not go in the water. If we were not so wise, we would at least be alert and watchful. I was always very grateful to have someone warn me and prepare me for the danger.<br><br>I pray that you will build the kingdom by caring for the souls of your friends. I hope that not one of them would have to say, "I looked on my right hand, and beheld, but there was no man that would know me: refuge failed me; no man cared for my soul" (Psalm 142:4). Make a plan to stand for truth and righteousness by warning your friends of danger and then showing<br><br><i>an increase of love . . . , lest he esteem thee to be his enemy;</i><br><br><i>That he may know that thy faithfulness is stronger than the cords of death.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 121:43–44]<br><br>The faithful people at the Waters of Mormon clapped their hands for joy as Alma taught them that when they were baptized, they must be<br><br><i>willing to bear one another's burdens, that they may be light;</i><br><br><i>Yea, and . . . willing to mourn with those that mourn; yea, and comfort those that stand in need of comfort, and to stand as witnesses of God at all times and in all things, and in all places that ye may be in, even until death, that ye may be redeemed of God, and be numbered with those of the first resurrection, that ye may have eternal life.</i>[Mosiah 18:8–9]<br><br>You also have those sacred responsibilities to help and bless other people. And the same blessings can be yours--and that is worth clapping your hands for.<br><br>The Savior is our perfect example of building and strengthening others. In a message to us, the First Presidency talked about Jesus' service:<br><br><i>Out of the abundance of His heart, He spoke to the poor, the downtrodden, the widows, the little children. He blessed the lame, the blind, the deaf. He taught lessons of love and repeatedly demonstrated unselfish service to others.</i><br><br><i>In like manner, members of the Church are called upon to change our hearts, to make our outward actions conform to what we say we believe. We are asked to be kinder with one another, more gentle and forgiving. We are asked to be slower to anger and more prompt to help. We are asked to extend the hand of friendship and resist the hand of retribution. We are called upon to be true disciples of Christ, to love one another with genuine compassion, for that is the way Christ loved us.</i>["An Easter Greeting from the First Presidency,"<i>Church News,</i>15 April 1995, p. 1]<br><br>As baptized members of the kingdom of God, we are to stand as witnesses of God, even until death. Missionary work is another way you are needed as a kingdom builder. Our prophet, who speaks for God, pleads for our help in building the kingdom. President Gordon B. Hinckley has asked all able young men to be worthy, to prepare, and to serve as missionaries. Young men, listen, can you hear the word of the Lord through our prophet?<br><br><i>You have missions to perform. Each of you should plan for missionary service. You may have some doubts. You may have some fears. Face your doubts and your fears with faith. Prepare yourselves to go. You have not only the opportunity; you have the responsibility. The Lord has blessed and favored you in a remarkable and wonderful way. Is it too much to ask that you give two years totally immersed in His service?</i>["Some Thoughts on Temples, Retention of Converts, and Missionary Service,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 1997, p. 52]<br><br>Open your heart so the Spirit can help you have a desire to serve. Brother Pinegar and I are looking forward to serving another mission. But it takes courage to serve. Here is a scripture that helps me: "That the fulness of my gospel might be proclaimed by the weak and the simple unto the ends of the world, and before kings and rulers" (D&amp;amp;C 1:23).<br><br>You and I can do this because God will help us. Don't be afraid. Remember, "God hath not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind" (2 Timothy 1:7).<br><br>Young women, you can choose whether to serve a full-time mission. Our granddaughter Brooke, who is serving in the Washington Tacoma Mission, writes:<br><br><i>I love to serve the Lord. I love this work. I am so grateful for the strength of our Heavenly Father. I couldn't do any of this without Him. I love the Lord. I am so grateful for this time in my life. I will reflect back on it forever.</i><br><br>Make a plan to be a missionary throughout your life. Our grandson Ed has a plan. He is preparing for his mission by taking several institute classes. He is studying the scriptures and is so excited about the things he is learning. When he opened his missionary call, he was visibly touched as he read:<br><br><i>Dear Elder Pinegar:</i><br><br><i>You are hereby called to serve as a missionary of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. You are assigned to labor in the Philippines Cebu Mission.</i><br><br>Those of you who have returned from missions: continue to build the kingdom, continue to maintain the standards that helped you qualify for the constant companionship of the Holy Ghost.<br><br>Now, may I tell you that the most hallowed, sacred service you can ever give as a kingdom builder is the work you will do to strengthen your family and your future family? Open your ears to hear the pleadings of our living prophet, President Gordon B. Hinckley:<br><br><i>Perhaps our greatest concern is with families. The family is falling apart all over the world. . . .</i><br><br><i>I lift a warning voice to our people. We have moved too far toward the mainstream of society in this matter. Now, of course there are good families. There are good families everywhere. But there are too many who are in trouble. This is a malady with a cure. The prescription is simple and wonderfully effective. It is love. It is plain, simple, everyday love and respect. It is a tender plant that needs nurturing. But it is worth all of the effort we can put into it.</i>["Look to the Future,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 1997, p. 69]<br><br>Open your heart and let the Spirit work a desire in you to help in strengthening families. If you are single and away from home or still living at home, there is much you can do as an adult child to love, respect, and strengthen your parents and siblings.<br><br>A young woman's heart was touched as her institute teacher taught about Lehi giving blessings to his children. He encouraged the students to ask for a father's blessing. After the class, she asked the teacher if he would give her a blessing because she was sure her father was not prepared to do so. The teacher encouraged her to write to her father and ask him if he would give her a blessing when she was home for the holidays. When she returned to school, she reported with joy that her father had made a mighty change. He was reading the scriptures and attending church again. The blessing he gave her was beautiful. The entire family was blessed and strengthened.<br><br>Make a plan to strengthen your family. Remember, President Hinckley said love and respect are the keys. What about your future family? I believe we can again hear the word of the Lord as we listen to our prophet:<br><br><i>No other generation in all of history has offered women so many opportunities. Your first objective should be a happy marriage, sealed in the temple of the Lord, and followed by the rearing of a good family.</i>["Stand True and Faithful,"<i>Ensign,</i>May 1996, p. 92]<br><br>And to the young men of the Church:<br><br><i>You have a tremendous obligation toward the girl you marry. Perhaps you are not thinking much of that now. But the time isn't far away when you will think of it, and now is the time to prepare for that most important day of your lives when you take unto yourself a wife and companion equal with you before the Lord.</i><br><br><i>That obligation begins with absolute loyalty. . . . She will be yours and yours alone, regardless of the circumstances of your lives. You will be hers and hers alone. There can be eyes for none other. There must be absolute loyalty, undeviating loyalty one to another.</i>["Living Worthy of the Girl You Will Someday Marry,"<i>Ensign,</i>May 1998, p. 49]<br><br>I hope marriage is the desire of your hearts. It is the noblest of desires. Many of you young men and women are in the perfect season for marriage. Don't be afraid, and don't linger too long on decisions to do good things, to do what Father in Heaven wants and needs you to do. Move forward with joy and confidence. Don't be afraid of sacrifice and struggle. Make a plan and prepare. Living worthy to be sealed in the temple should be number one on the plan. Dating should probably be number two--get busy young men! And when the Spirit lets both of you know that marriage is right, then begin planning together. Study "The Family: A Proclamation to the World" together. You might want to discuss any questions with your bishop. That inspired document will open your ears and heart to important truths regarding the sacred nature of your future eternal family and specific guidelines to help you have a happy family. Talk about your future children.<br><br>President Hinckley said, "How precious a thing is a baby. How wonderful a thing is a child. What a marvelous thing is a family" ("Living Worthy,"<i>Ensign,</i>May 1998, p. 51).<br><br>I bear my witness that his words are true. There is nothing on this earth that equals the wonder and awe that you will feel as you hold each of your newborn children. Stay pure and clean for them. I talked to a young woman and asked her what she did when she faced a difficult choice or was tempted to do something wrong. She said, "I think of my future children. They are my cheerleaders."<br><br>I recently was able to do one of my most favorite things: hold a new grandchild. I love it because that is something I know how to do, and I do it so well. I visited our youngest child, Tricia, her husband, Jeff, and their first child, Emily. It was so exciting to see this new mother and father discover the wonder of their creation. It never ceases to amaze me that it takes four years of schooling to be able to teach children in elementary school, eight years to put your fingers in someone's mouth to fill a tooth, but to be a mother or a father--the most important responsibility you will ever have in this earth life and in the eternities--it takes nine months, with no classes. Make a plan for your future family.<br><br>I made a plan. I decided that when I had children and put them to bed at night, my children would stay in their beds and not continually get up; and that is exactly what happened. What a pathetic plan. I hope you will make a better plan than I did. Decide what you will teach your children and how you will love them. Then commit to your plan with all of your heart, might, mind, and soul.<br><br>There are many ways for you to be a kingdom builder. Is it necessary to have a calling to build the kingdom? No. Is it necessary to accept callings and do your best? Yes. Is it necessary to be anxiously engaged in a good cause and bring about righteousness? Yes. You truly are needed; what an army of goodness you are. It is a wondrous opportunity and a sacred responsibility to build up the kingdom of God on earth, to be kingdom builders--right now.<br><br>You will not be commanded in all things, but the Holy Ghost will direct your paths if you listen to His promptings. He will help you discover what you can do to build the kingdom as you open your ears to hear the word of God and open your heart to understand and feel the desire to help. Tonight before you go to bed, decide on something you can do to build the kingdom. Make a plan and do it.<br><br>I pray Father in Heaven will bless you with confidence in His love, that your heart will be filled with gratitude for His great plan of happiness, and that you will move forward making choices that will please Him. I pray you will consider what you can do to build the kingdom of God on earth, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Patricia P.

<h1>e - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
As I have thought about this welcome opportunity, I have concluded that although aging brings some all too obvious changes, there are certain values that are constant, and gratefully so. It was 10 years ago, almost to the day, that I occupied this space as a newly called stake president. Elder Maxwell and Elder Holland, just called to the First Quorum of the Seventy, were on the stand. Although I felt overwhelmed by the call and particularly inadequate in light of the company, I nevertheless spoke of what was in my heart. I spoke of the importance of unity and community; the obligations that the gospel imposes and clarifies for each of us; the personal importance of loving, sharing, giving, and forgiving; and, finally, paraphrasing, the brilliance of a life plan that teaches that only as we lose ourselves in each other can we find the true joy and peace the Savior has promised to each of us.<br><br>I illustrated these rather well-understood principles with an experience or two that I hoped would provide a context for what I wanted to accomplish in the years that followed. I note that there are some here today who attended that meeting, and I extend my thanks to you for your love and support, then and now.<br><br>I will use some of these same themes today but dress them a little differently. I will speak of love of God and love of man. I hope to illustrate that we can love God<i>only</i>as we learn to love ourselves and each other, and then I will draw two or three examples from history to demonstrate the importance of developing the capacity of true, unselfish love that reflects the best of who we are and what Heavenly Father would have us be. In this process, I pray that I can offer an idea or two that will meet a need, satisfy a question, or offer hope. It is my prayer that I will be able to meet your expectations, and I invite your faith and prayers.<br><br>I begin by describing a powerful moment in my life that was centered in this building but that actually began in Greece. About 18 months ago, Sister Bramhall and I were in Ephesus. Once a thriving city of tens of thousands and a center of Christianity at the crossroads between Africa, Asia, the eastern Mediterranean, and what is now southern Europe, Ephesus is now only a magnificent ruin. Still, as one walks through its streets, it is easy to recreate with imagination what this wonderful city must have looked like when the Apostle Paul visited there. The dominant structure, still beautifully maintained, is a huge Greek theater, actually an amphitheater, that held 25,000 or so people. Without adding anything to this address, I will digress only long enough to tell you that one tourist, having seen Ephesus for the first time, asked her guide this interesting question: "Why is it that the Greeks built all these ruins?" In any event, it was here that the Apostle Paul spoke to the Ephesians and later wrote to them: "Ye are no more strangers and foreigners, but fellowcitizens with the saints, and of the household of God" (Ephesians 2:19).<br><br>As I sat in that magnificent theater, reflecting on that history and the early beginnings of Christianity, I felt a renewal of spirit that was almost tangible. I was transported back in time to that very moment when an apostle of the Lord Jesus Christ poured his heart out to those who would listen, enjoining them to become a part of the movement that would ultimately sweep the world. Paul's mission was to testify of the Lord Jesus Christ. He spent and ultimately gave his life doing exactly that.<br><br>Some six weeks after my visit to Ephesus, I attended a devotional given by Elder Eyring here in the Marriott Center. As I listened and watched all of you at the same time, it occurred to me that this center, which seats approximately 22,000 persons, is no different from that theater in remote Ephesus. I was overwhelmed by the truth that this modern-day apostle held and holds the same priesthood as Paul and has the same mission. Each prophet, ancient and modern, testifies of Jesus Christ as a special witness and serves out of a love of God and of man.<br><br>Only two weeks ago Elder Holland, in his first devotional address here since being called as a General Authority in 1989, bore his testimony this way:<br><br><i>I bear witness of the God of Glory, of the redeeming Son of God, of light and hope and a bright future. I promise you that God lives and loves you, each one of you, and that he has set bounds and limits to the opposing powers of darkness. I testify that Jesus is the Christ, the victor over death and hell and the fallen one who schemes there. The gospel of Jesus Christ is true, and it has been restored, just as we have sung and testified this morning.</i>[Jeffrey R. Holland, "Cast Not Away Therefore Your Confidence," BYU devotional, 2 March 1999, pp. 6–7]<br><br>The power of that fundamental and basic truth has never been more clear to me than now. I bear my own witness as I begin these remarks that we stand in the midst of giants who by their lives, words, and works carry the Savior's message throughout the world. We call them apostles and prophets, just as they were called in the days of Jesus and Paul. I also remind you that we at this university, which bears the name of just such a giant, are blessed beyond measure. President Hinckley has remarked that you are a royal generation. I believe that he would include all of us in that term--not only students but also staff and faculty and even administrators. I believe that you and we have been preserved for this day and time to do much in the world that is good and important.<br><br>But I also know that each of us stands on the sturdy and steady shoulders of those who have gone before. This morning I will remind you of several bits and pieces of history--some of it relating to the university--that I think you will find interesting as instructive anecdotes. Jeffrey Holland, as president of BYU, once addressed this subject. Speaking of those who have preceded us here, he said:<br><br>We owe them something.<i>We who are the beneficiaries of their sacrifice and their faith--we owe them the best effort we can put forward in obtaining a truly edifying and liberating and spirit-soaring education. ... Take this university forward in the same way your ancestors took it forward--often with nothing more tangible to sustain them than their dreams and their traditions.</i>[Jeffrey R. Holland, "Who We Are and What God Expects Us to Do,"<i>Brigham Young University 1987–88 Devotional and Fireside Speeches</i>(Provo: BYU, 1988), p. 20; emphasis in original]<br><br>I am convinced that in order for us to know where we are going and to appreciate what we have, it is important for us to know where we, collectively, have been and to appreciate the sacrifices that have been made for us. Jeffrey Holland, who remarked just two weeks ago of his own unspeakable love for BYU, recounted in a 1987 address something that happened in the early years of the Brigham Young Academy. This remarkable event teaches us about the faith of a young student who was willing to speak of what was surely a prophetic vision and also about the love of the larger Provo community for BYU. As I read this long account, I want you to think of this upper campus as one consisting of the Maeser Building, nearly complete, and several large fruit orchards extending to the mouth of Rock Canyon. Hold that thought. Now, in his talk President Holland had just spoken of Karl Maeser's last visit to his beloved campus. He then told this story:<br><br><i>Several years after Brother Maeser's death a proposal was made to construct a memorial building in his name, not downtown on University Avenue but high atop Temple Hill, where a new campus might be built consisting of as many as three or perhaps four buildings someday. The cost would be an astronomical $100,000, but the Maeser Building would be a symbol of the past, a statement of aspiring tradition, an anchor to the university's future.</i><br><br><i>In spite of a staggering financial crisis clouding the very future of the university at the time, the faculty and student body took heart that in 1912 the Maeser Building was at least partially complete and the university would give diplomas to its first four-year graduating class. But even as graduation plans were being made, equally urgent plans were underway to sell the remainder of Temple Hill for the development of a new Provo suburb. The university simply had to have the money to survive. Eighteen members were graduating in this first four-year class, but even if the student body tripled in the years ahead, surely there would be more than enough room to accommodate them on the space now occupied by the Maeser, Brimhall, and Grant buildings on our present campus. Yes, the rest of the space on the hill should be sold. The graduation services would conclude with a sales pitch to the community leaders in attendance.</i><br><br><i>When Alfred Kelly was introduced that morning as the student graduation speaker, he rose and stood absolutely silent for several moments. Some in the audience thought he had lost the power of speech. Slowly he began to speak, explaining that he had been much concerned over his remarks, that he had written several versions and discarded every one of them.</i><br><br><i>Then, early one morning, he said, with a feeling of desperation regarding his approaching assignment, he walked north from his downtown apartment to where the partially completed Maeser Building stood (as Horace Cummings would later describe it) as an "air castle" come to earth on Temple Hill. He wanted to gain inspiration from this hope of a new campus, but he felt only grim disappointment. The sky was starting to glow from the morning light, but the darkly silhouetted Maeser Building seemed only a symbol of gloom.</i><br><br><i>Kelly then turned his eyes to view the valley below that was also still in shadow. The light from the rising sun was just beginning to illuminate the western hills back of Utah Lake with an unusual golden glow. As morning came, the light gradually worked down from the hilltops, moved across the valley floor, and slowly advanced to the spot where Kelly stood.</i><br><br><i>He said he partially closed his eyes as the light approached and was startled by what he could still see. He stood as if transfixed. In the advancing sunlight everything he saw took on the appearance of people, young people about his age moving toward Temple Hill. He saw hundreds of them, thousands of young people coming into view. He knew they were students, he said, because they carried books in their arms as they came.</i><br><br><i>Then Temple Hill was bathed in sunlight, and the whole of the present campus was illuminated not with one partially completed building, nor with homes in a modern subdivision, but rather with what Kelly described to that graduating class as "temples of learning," large buildings, beautiful buildings, hundreds of buildings covering the top of that hill and stretching clear to the mouth of Rock Canyon.</i><br><br><i>The students then entered these temples of learning with their books in hand. As they came out of them, Kelly said their countenances bore smiles of hope and of faith. He observed that they seemed cheerful and very confident. Their walk was light but firm as they again became a part of the sunlight as it moved to the top of Y Mountain, and then they gradually disappeared from view.</i><br><br><i>Kelly sat down to what was absolutely stone-deaf silence. Not a word was spoken. What about the sales pitch? No one moved or whispered. Then longtime BYU benefactor Jesse Knight jumped to his feet and shouted, "We won't sell an acre. We won't sell a single lot." And he turned to President George Brimhall and pledged several thousand dollars to the future of the university. Soon others stood up and joined in, some offering only a widow's mite, but all believing in the dream of a Provo schoolboy, all believing in the destiny of a</i>great<i>university which that day had scarcely begun. (See B. F. Larsen, "Fifty Years Ago," speech given at a BYU Alumni meeting, 25 May 1962, B. F. Larsen biographical file, BYU Archives, pp. 4–5.)</i>[In Holland, "Who We Are," pp. 24–26]<br><br>Although this is only one example of many, the history of this place reflects the love of the Jesse Knights of this world and also of those like Karl Maeser, who lived nearly in poverty as its president. Because they loved BYU, countless faculty and others were willing to<i>sacrifice</i>(there is that word again) comfort, prestige, and security for a dream. That dream, of course, is the same dream, in one form or another, that Alfred Kelly had as he thought of a diminished BYU. In one way or another, all of us who have attended this university, who have walked its halls, who have taught here, or who have maintained its grounds or cooked its meals have had the same vision.<br><br>King Benjamin says something of this in a different context. Speaking of our youth, he said:<br><br><i>And ye will not suffer your children that they go hungry, or naked; neither will ye suffer that they transgress the laws of God. ...</i><br><br><i>But ye will teach them to walk in the ways of truth and soberness; ye will teach them to love one another, and to serve one another.</i>[Mosiah 4:14–15]<br><br>King Benjamin also said, "When ye are in the service of your fellow beings ye are only in the service of your God" (Mosiah 2:17). The point is that pure love--the love for one another--can and should be a moving, powerful force for good. It is scriptural at its roots, and when it matures it can change us so that we become worthy to enter again into our Father's presence. If we accept the first and second commandments at face value, it is likely that we will not be worthy to enter into our Father's presence a second time until we have learned to love one another and to forgive one another--only then will we have also learned to love God.<br><br>Paul taught us that there are no strangers among us. And Robert Frost expressed this same idea in his poem<i>The Death of the Hired Man,</i>in which the hired man, having nowhere else to go, returned to the home of his former employer to die, even though he was not welcome there. In an important exchange between Mary and her husband, Warren, about love and duty, we are finally instructed about love, rather simply, by Mary, who tells her husband, "Home is the place where, when you have to go there, / They have to take you in." Implied in this is the duty of all of us to love, forgive, and care for those who are less fortunate and more dependent than we are. Again, quoting King Benjamin:<br><br><i>And also, ye yourselves will succor those that stand in need of your succor; ye will administer of your substance unto him that standeth in need; and ye will not suffer that the beggar putteth up his petition to you in vain, and turn him out to perish.</i>[Mosiah 4:16]<br><br>These few verses, of course, of themselves can and perhaps should be the substance of another talk, but their import was reemphasized in 1852 by the First Presidency of the Church (consisting of Brigham Young, Heber C. Kimball, and Willard Richards), who enjoined us in part that we should<br><br><i>seek after knowledge, all knowledge, and especially that which is from above ..., and if you find any thing that God does not know, you need not learn that thing; but strive to know what God knows, and use that knowledge as God uses it, and then you will be like him;</i>[you]<i>will ... have charity, love one another, and do each other good continually, and forever.</i>[In James R. Clark, comp.,<i>Messages of the First Presidency of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints,</i>6 vols. (Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1965–75), 2:86]<br><br>Let me tell you of another contemporary giant who, having learned the lessons of this world in an absolutely brilliant way, also loved this university with every fiber of his being and gave his life in service and sacrifice at Brigham Young University.<br><br>In the last weeks of his presidency at BYU, it was decided that Rex Lee would argue a complicated case brought by the ACLU involving BYU's Off-Campus Housing Program to the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals in January 1996. Several of us accompanied Rex and Janet, his wife, to Denver on January 24. The weather was cold and very wintry. Janet was worried about whether Rex was strong enough to make the trip, but earlier that week he had successfully convinced one of his doctors that it was very important that he go to Denver to make the argument. Any other outcome would have been absolutely unacceptable to him. And so it was that on January 24, this small entourage with Rex in his wheelchair, oxygen bottle on his lap, boarded a flight to Denver. The weather in Denver was bad, we were late getting into the hotel, and Rex was visibly tired by the trip.<br><br>The next morning we all left for the courthouse from the hotel in the teeth of a blizzard. It was very cold, and Rex, his little frame bundled up in a magnificent blue overcoat--a gift from his good and special friend, Jon Huntsman--looked terribly frail. But he was full of good cheer, optimistic, and cracking jokes about the handcart company on its way to the Tenth Circuit Court.<br><br>We made our way to the second floor of the courthouse to wait for our case to be called. Rex remained in his wheelchair, and the rest of us stood around discussing last-minute questions and generally passing the time. Rex's good humor had returned, and it was obvious that he was "up" for the argument. And it is here where the true story begins. Rex Lee, a very successful lawyer, university president, law school dean, and solicitor general of the United States (often called the Tenth Justice of the Supreme Court) was in the courthouse, and most of the lawyers who walked by paid their respects either with a nod, a hello, or, in the case of several Salt Lake attorneys, with a warm personal greeting--all with an air of great respect and deference, which Rex clearly appreciated.<br><br>Finally our turn came, and Rex wheeled himself into the courtroom and to a spot adjoining one of the counsel tables. When the other lawyers finished their argument, the attorney for the ACLU took the stand to argue the appellant's side of the case. The courtroom was full of lawyers and some clients, and during the ACLU argument there was the usual bustle and inattention on the part of everyone except those directly involved in the argument. It seemed, at that point, like simply another case--one of perhaps eight or so that morning, one involving a remote issue of law without any far-reaching consequences for anyone except the litigants involved.<br><br>At the conclusion of the appellant's argument, Rex wheeled himself to the center of the courtroom, carefully adjusted his oxygen bottle on the floor alongside the wheel of his chair, and reached up to the microphone on the podium, bringing it down close to his mouth so that he might be heard: "Good morning, your Honors. I am Rex Lee, counsel for Brigham Young University." Suddenly there was an air of anticipation. One of the great lawyers of this century was addressing the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals. One or two of the lawyers who were working on their own cases set their notebooks down and began to listen. The argument followed, and Rex drew obvious strength from the exchange he had with the judges. His voice was stronger; he was animated; there was a chuckle here and a wise observation there. Soon everyone in that courtroom was watching and listening to the master at work. The place was quiet, like a church. Rex argued. The court responded. Rex, the ultimate advocate, and this fine panel of judges were completely engaged. It was his last argument--clear, lucid, direct, thoughtful, evidencing a magnificent grasp of the cases. He was in his element. It was almost a final sermon. His text was the law, his congregation the court, and his subject was Brigham Young University, his beloved alma mater--its history, its traditions, its values, and its very purpose. It was a place that had touched his very soul, and his love for the university was absolutely clear.<br><br>All too soon the argument was over, but Rex had left an absolutely indelible impression, one never to be forgotten, on everyone in that courtroom. From where I sat, it appeared to me that Janet had tears in her eyes, and maybe she, too, recognized that there would be few moments like this left for her dear husband, whom she had so fiercely protected for so long. It was a magnificent moment for us all.<br><br>The trip home was hard though, and we arrived in Provo at about midnight. The next day, a Friday, Rex was still full of good cheer, but by the day after that he was back in the hospital, worn and spent. The price Rex paid to make that argument was greater than perhaps any of us realized at the time. I think Janet knew. Rex had given everything he had to the university for a period of nearly 30 years. This was his last gift of love to BYU.<br><br>Two men--one a student, the other a university president; one at the beginning of a career, the other concluding his: Each of these accounts, in its own way, reflects their love and devotion to the truth, virtue, and goodness that I believe this great university represents. I had thought earlier about spending more time discussing the abstraction of love as it is embodied in the first and second commandments. It seems to me, however, that these accounts and one or two others demonstrate the essential point that our obligation to love ourselves and our neighbors is second only to our obligation to love God and that learning to love each other, to care for each other, is a learning process--the outcome of which is that we learn better to love God. It seems to me that, in its ideal form, true love represents a perfecting process by which we learn to love well and truly and we develop the virtues of humility, charity, patience, judgment, selflessness, and a hundred other virtues that are recognized, polished, merged, and developed into a character able to withstand the refiner's fire.<br><br>We start this process by loving God and then develop that love through service, sacrifice, gratitude, and giving. And when we have learned to love best, we can be like Mary in Frost's poem; or like General Robert E. Lee, who said, "I pray each day for my enemy"; or like a father whose love for a daughter swells as she announces her intention to serve a mission; or like a new mother who is overwhelmed by powerful emotion when she sees her newborn for the first time; or like the husband who, facing death on the battlefield, writes to his wife:<br><br><i>My very dear Sarah:</i><br><br><i>The indications are very strong that we shall move in a few days--perhaps tomorrow. Lest I should not be able to write again, I feel impelled to write a few lines that may fall under your eye when I shall be no more. ...</i><br><br><i>Sarah my love for you is deathless, it seems to bind me with mighty cables that nothing but Omnipotence could break; and yet my love of Country comes over me like a strong wind and bears me unresistibly on with all these chains to the battle field.</i><br><br><i>. . . I have, I know, but few and small claims upon Divine Providence, but something whispers to me--perhaps it is the wafted prayer of my little Edgar, that I shall return to my loved ones unharmed. If I do not my dear Sarah, never forget how much I love you, and when my last breath escapes me on the battle field, it will whisper your name. Forgive my many faults, and the many pains I have caused you. How thoughtless and foolish I have often times been! How gladly would I wash out with my tears every little spot upon your happiness. ...</i><br><br><i>But, O Sarah! if the dead can come back to this earth and flit unseen around those they loved, I shall always be near you; in the gladdest days and in the darkest nights ...</i>always, always,<i>and if there be a soft breeze upon your cheek, it shall be my breath, as the cool air fans your throbbing temple, it shall be my spirit passing by. Sarah do not mourn me dead; think I am gone and wait for thee, for we shall meet again.</i>[In Geoffrey C. Ward, Ric Burns, and Ken Burns,<i>The Civil War: An Illustrated History</i>(New York: Knopf, 1990), pp. 82–83; emphasis in original]<br><br>Major Sullivan Ballou was killed at the first battle of Bull Run.<br><br>Thus it seems to me that our Father in Heaven has given us the first and great commandment to love him with all of our heart, might, mind, and strength, and then he told us how to do that: by learning to love one another.<br><br>I will close these remarks with two more simple examples, one contemporary and the other drawn from an experience of about 50 years ago.<br><br>One morning as I met with the bishops of the BYU 13th Stake, over which I presided as president at the time, I was moved to talk of the lost sheep as described in the teachings of the Savior. I reminded this group of bishops that Jesus had spoken often of sheep as a metaphor for all of his children. At various times the Savior had told his apostles that "my sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me" (John 10:27), and he enjoined his apostles always to "feed my sheep" (John 21:16, 17; D&amp;amp;C 112:14). I told these men that in the Savior's wonderful and moving sermon about the good Samaritan, he made it absolutely clear that we are all his sheep, even those who are despised and disregarded by others. I told them that in the Old Testament we are instructed in the clearest way possible that we are in fact our brother's keeper, and I reminded them that Peter, following the Savior's death and resurrection, had perceived "that God is no respecter of persons" (Acts 10:34).<br><br>Thus I think the reference to "foreigners" in Paul's letter to the Ephesians is particularly important. In any event, on that particular Sunday morning, these bishops accepted my challenge to seek out those within their wards who needed special help and encouragement--to find, in effect, the lost sheep among them.<br><br>Later that day, Christopher Germann, one of the younger bishops in the 13th Stake, was sitting in a regional conference next to a young woman who was sitting alone and who appeared unusually quiet and pensive. She looked just like you in your quiet moments. But there was something about her that drew his attention. She was not in his ward, and as he described the event to me later, he had hesitated to speak to her. He felt that he might be intruding on a particularly private moment. But the Spirit was powerful, and I still remember exactly his question to her: "How has your day been?"<br><br>She was surprised, but he introduced himself as a bishop, and she gratefully thanked him for asking, pouring her heart out to him in a way that reinforced the teachings of that morning.<br><br>Now I will ask you whether you have someone to whom you might address the same question: "How has your day been?" And if someone asks you that question, are you ready to respond and to be moved by their spirit to another place in your life? I will tell you that<i>right now</i>there are many here who feel alone, frightened, and inadequate and who need the love and support that one or more of you can and should give. They need that special, careful, driven-by-the-Spirit attention that will bless both you as the giver and your new friend as well. Please reflect upon the experience of Bishop Germann as you remember this hour.<br><br>Finally, I will close by telling you of another young man whom I knew well, one whose spiritual life may well have been saved by three college students just like you. At the time they were strangers, but because they were willing to extend themselves, they became critical to the spiritual life of this young student. Here is the story:<br><br>A young LDS student attended a large university in the western part of the United States. It was not his choice to do so, and he was very lonesome and very far from home, friends, and lifelong associations. Indeed, he did not know a soul, either at his university or, for that matter, in the entire state. Miserable, lonesome, and feeling lost, he invested himself in his schoolwork, ignoring his mother's constant requests that he attend a local student ward. Weeks went by, and then even a couple of months without any effort on his part at contacting the local LDS student group. His misery deepened, but he was no more inclined to attend church than he had been on that first Sunday. He was not doing anything wrong; it's just that he was not doing anything really right, either. Today, if asked, he would tell you that his actions were unexplainable, though at the time they seemed absolutely natural. He was slowly dissolving in self-pity, and he would not let anyone or any influence change his life.<br><br>And so it was late one Friday afternoon that Leo, Dean, and Skip knocked on his apartment door. Each was attending the same university, and each was involved in the local ward. They had come to invite this young miserable student to a ward outing. In the face of their unrelenting encouragement and remembering the gentle proddings of his mother, this young student finally consented to attend the ward outing, where, to his surprise, he had a good time in spite of himself.<br><br>He continued his activity in the ward, met the girl he would later marry, quickly found his spiritual roots again, formed lifetime friendships with Leo, Dean, and Skip, and went on to a lifetime of service in the Church.<br><br>The year was 1950, the university was the University of California at Berkeley, and I was the miserable freshman student. The girl I met, who then had very pretty blonde hair, became my wife. The debt I owe her and others can never be sufficiently repaid. The spirit of love and caring that I felt at that initial meeting with my dear friends has been the spirit that has carried me from that day to this. I cannot deny it, nor should you. It is the spirit that makes all of us one, the spirit that brings us all together--not as strangers, not as foreigners, but as brothers and sisters in this ever-broadening kingdom of God.<br><br>In closing, perhaps I should apologize for this very personal anecdote. However, I have recited it here because I believe it illustrates, as much as anything, the importance and timeless relevance of our Savior's teachings. Whatever the circumstances, remember always his admonition: "If ye are not one ye are not mine" (D&amp;amp;C 38:27).<br><br>That we may always have this vision, I pray, in Jesus' name. Amen.<br><br><i>Eugene H.

<h1>mate Restoration - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
If you ever visit Segovia in Spain, turn left as you approach the 2,000-year-old Roman aqueduct, climb the hill that rises through a centuries-old neighborhood, and call at the Church of San Justo. A friendly caretaker will welcome you to his church, now in its ninth century. With reverent enthusiasm he will show you the frescoes that adorn the walls of the building's single Romanesque apse. The church narrates with a moving symbolic vocabulary the story of the redemption and the Resurrection.<br><br>The paintings first invite us to the Garden of Eden. We see the tree and the serpent, and standing on the back of an elephant are Adam and Eve--fig leaves in place. The artist portrays the elephant as meek, as a bearer of burdens, and as the creation best equipped to crush the serpent's head. It is, in other words, a symbol of Christ, and by having the first parents stand on its back in the moments following their transgression, the painter reflects his understanding of the relationship between the Fall and the promised redemption. Behind the Eden scenes we discover murals of Christ's passion: the Last Supper, Gethsemane, the betrayal, and the Crucifixion.<br><br>When I visit this church, I am moved by the sincerity of this painted witness. Until recently, however, this testimony had been lost. Centuries earlier, changing fashions resulted in a tasteless plastering over of the walls and the construction of a gilded altar that hid the simple story of the redemption. Thirty years ago a benefactor of the church discovered some painting fragments and put into motion a process of restoration. In some places that process involved applying mild cleansers that removed centuries of accumulated grime. In other cases the restoration demanded more radical measures: pounding, chiseling, and scraping away hardened plaster and wood. For me, this modest church's history is an allegory of the changing tastes and philosophies that threaten to cover my testimony. I remember my own restorations--the painful scraping away of the remnants of my more serious mistakes--and reflect gratefully on the gentle solvent of the sacrament that rinses away the weekly accumulations of my worldliness. San Justo's murals quietly remind me of my need to return daily to the image of Christ and to submit to his restoring hand.<br><br>Today, April 6, marks the 169th anniversary of a meeting set in another humble building, a log farmhouse in Fayette, New York. During that gathering the Prophet Joseph formalized the restoration of the gospel, beginning the process of redrawing, repairing, and finishing the mural of Christianity. Although this grand restoration frames what I want to say today, my emphasis will be on the "intimate restoration"--private and personal transformations that help us recover our purity, our godly identity, and our faith. I love Paul's counsel: "Be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed." His play on the words<i>conform</i>and<i>transform</i>tells us to resist the pressures brought on by the world of contingency and to experience an intimate restoration that involves more than returning to a better past. It is a restoration, a "renewing of . . . mind," as Paul calls it, that nudges us gently toward our potential (Romans 12:2).<br><br>At about the same time that San Justo was built and consecrated, the psuedoscience known as alchemy became popular throughout Europe. It searched for its own restorations: to transform base metals into gold, to discover a universal cure for disease, and to prolong life indefinitely. Its practitioners attempted to heal, to make what is common precious, and to find eternal life. Today we see their error--not in their objective, but in their impatience; in their attempt to coerce the bestowal of gifts that are real but uniquely divine; in their unwillingness to wait patiently on the Lord for the endowment of his grace. These processes are part of the intimate restoration, a process that exalts what is low; that binds the wounds of disappointment and discouragement; and that extends unbreakable, eternal promises. I bear testimony of these intimate restorations.<br><br>I have been thinking about the varied transformations of memory. King Benjamin concludes his sermon by asking us to "remember, and perish not" (Mosiah 4:30). In contrast to his reminder, we have Lot's wife, who paused and longingly turned back to her past. Her transformation into a pillar of salt is emblematic of the paralysis that overcomes us when we live too much in memories. Often we resist letting go of the sin or the sadness or the offenses that are an inevitable consequence of life outside Eden. Sometimes we idealize our past in such a way that the present cannot compete with it: we make icons of the "good old days," of the former sweetheart, or of a favorite ward and shut out contemporaries who might otherwise bless us. Conversely, when we properly submit our memories to the transformations of grace, we begin to experience intimate restorations.<br><br>One way to ensure spiritually vital memory is through writing. President Kimball suggested that writing helps us "keep the Lord in remembrance" (<i>TSWK,</i>p. 349), and the scriptures both teach about the power of writing and themselves function as the mnemonic device for all things eternal. Job contemplated the durability of written memory when he wished that his words might be "graven with an iron pen and lead in the rock for ever!" (Job 19:23–24). In Exodus we find the law written with Jehovah's finger. These images of indelible writing cause me to wonder at the incident recorded in John 8. Christ's enemies, in this case scribes, presented a woman caught in the act of adultery. They demanded justice, based on the premises of that law written by Christ's premortal finger into Sinai's stone. John recorded the Lord's response:<br><br><i>But Jesus stooped down, and with his finger wrote on the ground, as though he heard them not.</i><br><br><i>So when they continued asking him, he lifted up himself, and said unto them, He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her.</i><br><br><i>And again he stooped down, and wrote on the ground.</i>[John 8:6–8]<br><br>The scribes filed away, and the Savior, left alone with the woman, asked:<br><br><i>Where are those thine accusers? hath no man condemned thee?</i><br><br><i>She said, No</i>man,<i>Lord. And Jesus said unto her, Neither do</i>I<i>condemn thee: go, and sin no more.</i>[John 8:10–11; emphasis added]<br><br>John did not describe the details of the woman's repentance, and we know something of the destructive consequences that result from the violation of the marriage covenant. John chose instead to emphasize the Lord's grace. We are not told what he wrote in the sand, but the<i>image</i>of him writing is both eloquent and instructive. Was he recording her sin in the first instance and the scribes' sin in the second? What became of that record? Footsteps blurred it, and the afternoon winds erased it forever. This erasure is a hopeful metaphor for the Savior's merciful memory and for the potential transformation of our sinfulness into acceptability. The Lord has told us that sincere repentance produces messianic forgetfulness: "For I will be merciful to their unrighteousness, and their sins and their iniquities will I remember no more" (Hebrews 8:12). Could any transformation be more miraculous than this, that he, for whom all things are present, could forget our lapses?<br><br>When I was a bishop I experienced a portion of this forgetfulness. Nearly every day for four years I heard stories of transgression. As I listened to each confession, the Lord shared with me a portion of his love for the confessant; after the process of repentance was complete, the only residue of that experience was what Mormon calls "charity." I found that my memory was cleansed simultaneously with the cleansing of their life.<br><br>Although Christ's mercy produces transforming forgetfulness, his justice endows him with perfect remembrance. He told his followers gathered at Bountiful that even though their land had been torn apart by earthquakes, he would remain constant: "For the mountains shall depart and the hills be removed, but my kindness shall not depart from thee, neither shall the covenant of my peace be removed" (3 Nephi 22:10; see also Isaiah 40:4). Elsewhere, the Lord used a metaphor of writing to emphasize this constancy: "Behold, I have graven thee upon the palms of my hands" (Isaiah 49:16). In the ancient world one of the most common writing technologies was engraving. The engraver pressed the sharp point of a stylus into the soft surface of clay or metal sheets. Christ metaphorically transforms these implements of writing into the Roman nails and his tender hands. When we think of these two images of a writing Savior, once in sand and once in his own flesh, we begin to understand Paul's description of Christ as "the<i>author</i>of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him" (Hebrews 5:9; emphasis added).<br><br>A few years ago I saw how these images of constancy and forgetfulness had come together in the life of a BYU student. He had grown up in Southeast Asia during years of unspeakable violence and cruelty. When he was a young boy, soldiers entered his town one day and carried away his father. He never saw him again. His playgrounds were not soccer fields but the killing fields and the squalid conditions of refugee camps. Eventually his mother managed to relocate the family in the United States, and here they accepted the gospel. I asked him how he coped with this burden of memories. Did he suffer from nightmares? Was he haunted by post-traumatic stress? His response was simple, yet powerful: the Atonement had cleansed his memory. The testimony he bore of the cleansing power of the Atonement remains perhaps the most moving witness of spiritual transformation I have ever heard. And his story reinforced the truth that the Atonement must restore both the sinner and those who suffer from the sinner's actions. Christ's perfect fairness requires that victims receive a share of his grace at least as bounteous as that offered to the fully repentant sinner. The Savior's promise that he will remember us allows us to start the process of this intimate restoration of forgetting.<br><br>A wise friend shared with me another image of intimate restoration. More than nineteen hundred years ago, darkness covered the land inhabited by Lehi's descendants: "And there was not any light seen, neither fire, nor glimmer, neither the sun, nor the moon, nor the stars, for so great were the mists of darkness." As a result, "there was great mourning and howling and weeping among all the people continually; yea, great were the groanings of the people, because of the darkness" (3 Nephi 8:22–23). Divine alchemy began to work an intimate restoration:<br><br><i>And it was in the morning</i>[literally and figuratively a new day],<i>and the darkness dispersed from off the face of the land, and the earth did cease to tremble, and the rocks did cease to rend, and the dreadful groanings did cease, and all the tumultuous noises did pass away.</i><br><br><i>And the earth did cleave together again, that it stood</i>[I love that simple expression of stability and strength: that it stood];<i>and the mourning, and the weeping, and the wailing of the people who were spared alive did cease; and their mourning</i>was turned<i>into joy, and their lamentations</i>[were turned]<i>into . . . praise.</i>[3 Nephi 10:9–10; emphasis added]<br><br>This public event becomes a model for an intimate restoration. How common this most singular scene! How often have we fought with darkness? How many have felt their heart rend, like Bountiful's rocks, because of losing something or someone? What power less than that of Jesus Christ can transform the lead of mourning into a gold morning? The scriptures bear testimony of his ability to change us and our experiences. Could the magical transmutation of lead to gold be half as wondrous as these restorations described by Isaiah, "to give unto them beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness; that they might be called trees of righteousness, the planting of the Lord" (Isaiah 61:3). Could any universal cure of disease be as healing as that transformation that takes place when our scarlet sins become white as snow? I see a miraculous circle of grace in Christ's condescension that makes possible our ascension. He humbled himself to become like us, suffering "temptations, and pain of body, hunger, thirst, and fatigue" (Mosiah 3:7) so that we might become like him: exalted, whole, perfectly at one with him and with ourselves--the amazing alchemy of grace.<br><br>This circle of grace marks off my testimony and in my life has been the symmetry that makes the crooked straight and the rough places smooth (see Luke 3:5). Nowhere is that process more apparent than in the transformations that led to the creation of my family. It is a common story; to me it is a miraculous story. I share it with you as a private parable.<br><br>Like most of you, early in my life I had designed a calendar of events. I believed that I with my agency was in control of what would happen and had no reason to believe that the chronology of high school, mission, marriage, degrees, children, and profession should be disrupted. But finding a wife proved to be somewhat problematic. I remember reading stories of Old Testament patriarchs who found wives at wells, and I used to hang around campus drinking fountains hoping a maiden would offer me a drink. And the years passed. Most of us have experienced, or will experience, what it feels like to be unable to bridge our dreams and our daily experience or to find that our best effort is insufficient. During what surely was the low point of these years, I had my own experience in that mist described in 3 Nephi. It seemed that the heavens were indifferent, that prayers went unanswered, that promises were not kept. If there is a circle of grace, I thought, then most certainly I am outside it.<br><br>Out of this darkness came an epiphany, a revelation so personal and poignant it seemed to me that the Savior himself had uttered it directly to me:<br><br>[My friend],<i>fear not, let your</i>[heart]<i>be comforted; yea, rejoice evermore, and in everything give thanks;</i><br><br><i>Waiting patiently on the Lord, for your prayers have entered into the ears of the Lord of Sabaoth, and are recorded with this seal and testament--the Lord hath sworn and decreed that they shall be granted.</i><br><br><i>Therefore, he giveth this promise unto you, with an immutable covenant that they shall be fulfilled; and all things wherewith you have been afflicted shall work together for your good, and to my name's glory.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 98:1–3]<br><br>I had never felt language as emphatic as this. The words were given originally to the Prophet Joseph in 1833; this experience taught me how the scriptures are sources of personal and personalized revelation. God had heard my prayers. He not only heard them, but they were recorded with a seal and testament. All the Lord expected of me was to wait patiently on him. Reassured, I learned that for me, "waiting" was both quiet submission to God's calendar<i>and</i>an active service: I was required to be God's waiter. And I was expected to do all that I could to bring about the fulfillment of the promise, filling the empty spaces with faithful service when immediate results were not forthcoming. Three more years passed before the day--seven years ago this month--when I knelt with my wife at the temple's altar. In her features I see grace. I suspect that waiting patiently is a lesson the Lord teaches all of us. What we wait for, and the duration of the waiting, varies for each of us. I can witness however, that the Promised Messiah fulfills his promises.<br><br>Because my marriage came through grace, it also has been my tutor about grace. If atonement is about the process of becoming one--with ourselves and with our Redeemer--then those same processes are at work as we become "one flesh" with our spouse. Some of our difficulties in relationships come because we forget the "Genesis Principle" of marriage. God intends for us to be creators. Our experience with godlike creation begins with our eternal marriage. Just as the creation of our earth home required seven stages, so our marriages must pass through periods of work, transformation, and restoration before they are finished. Yet we expect our relationships on day one to exhibit the security and surety that only come on restful day seven. We forget that the only way we can successfully pass through the stages of creation is by employing the principles of the Atonement. No two gospel subjects are more closely linked than these. When Jehovah wanted to describe his sacred relationship with Israel, he compared discipleship to the marriage covenant. John repeats that same imagery in his Revelation. In what way does marriage operate according to the principles of atonement?<br><br>The answer is another intimate restoration. Like Charles H. Gabriel,<br><br><i>I marvel that he would descend from his throne divine</i><i></i><br><i>To rescue a soul so rebellious and proud as mine,</i><br><i>That he should extend his great love unto such as I,</i><br><i>Sufficient to own, to redeem, and to justify.</i><br>["I Stand All Amazed,"<i>Hymns,</i>1985, no. 193]<br><br>I am amazed that even though Christ understands perfectly my imperfections, he also loves me perfectly. Divine charity is the most fundamental intimate restoration. It gives me hope to work through my weaknesses. I have found the same pattern at work in my marriage. Next to the Savior, no one knows my weaknesses better than my wife. She sees the flaws I am able to conceal from others. She senses the rift between my behaviors and my understanding. Likewise, I know her imperfections better than any other--better than her parents, her siblings, her friends. Equipped with this knowledge, each of us has two choices. We can follow Satan's pattern and use it to bury our spouse's self-esteem--adding layers of disapproval like the plaster that covered San Justo's frescoes. Or we can follow Christ's model, loving perfectly through our shared imperfections, using our unconditional acceptance to cleanse away the accumulations of life. By forgiving each other, we lift each other from our sins, thereby receiving<i>and</i>imitating the intimate restoration of the Atonement. When we hold hands "gracefully," we sense, sacredly, engravings on our own palms, reminding us that the Atonement is the binding power of our marriage.<br><br>No longer single, Gaylamarie and I waited, certain that children would come. One year. Two. A third. Waiting. We did our best to wait patiently. Our pleading became more intense, but still no child.<br><br>In another place a young, single daughter of our Heavenly Father experienced her own journey through Bountiful's mists. Forgetting for a time who she was, she conceived a child. Her prayers began a long process of remembering. She determined that<i>for her,</i>the fullest expression of her love for the child would be not only the gift of life but a life with a father and a mother, united in grace and the sealing power. Like Christ, she made a sacrifice. An intimate restoration was set in motion by Providence that transformed her heartache into the answer to our prayers. This circle of grace made two rotations, bringing both our daughters into our home. Karen Marie and Eliza tutor me about atoning transformations. The Atonement is the only force I know that can make straight what is spiritually crooked. Of course Christ does not want us to err, and when we do, we suffer consequences--consequences I have found to be in proportion to the seriousness of the mistake. But the Atonement assures us of two things: that those consequences need not be eternal, and that Christ's gentle alchemy can turn our transgression into something that works both to our good and to his name's glory. Six months after each daughter's birth, we knelt together at an altar. There the priesthood performed another restoration: through its power we and they were changed; we were declared to be bound together, sealed,<i>"as if"</i>Karen Marie and Eliza had been born to us. I have spent many hours reflecting on that "as if" and find in that simple conjunction the power that potentially binds us forever to the Lord.<br><br>"For unto us a child is born" (Isaiah 9:6). Isaiah's phrase predicts and celebrates the birth of the Savior: the key event of universal restoration. Gaylamarie and I repeat the same phrase, intimately. These births that resulted in our rebirth are part of the same story, conceived by the same author. When our girls look at us, we see in their countenance the outline of grace; and when we feel their arms around us, we understand Amulek's description of the Atonement, which "encircles [us] in the arms of safety" (Alma 34:16). Often as I leave for work, three-year-old Karen Marie reminds me, "Be obedient today, Daddy." My daughters find physical safety in my arms; I find spiritual safety in theirs.<br><br>Of course, our arms are full, although for the time being the birth mothers' arms are empty. How shall they embrace--and be embraced--in safety? The answer to that question requires more time than I have available. A partial response comes in the pleas of a three-year-old whom we have taught to pray for her and her sister's birth mothers. A few months ago she told us: "Mommy loves me. Daddy loves me. Lizzy loves me. Everyone loves me." Pressing her cheek next to her mother's, she promised, "I will not break your heart." Then, with an eye to eternity that sobered us, speaking of her birth mother, she said, "I will not break her heart either."<br><br>I believe in the power of a child's prayer. I believe in a loving Father's equity that promises that all arms will be full, if we will wait patiently on the Lord. I know that sometime in eternity our daughters will<i>finish</i>the process of their birth mothers' healing. These finishings will be intimate restorations.<br><br>I conclude by returning to the little Church of San Justo. If you walk past the altar and approach the eastern wall, you will notice that all the images are complete, except for one--that of the descent from the cross. Nearly a thousand years ago the painter scribbled in Latin above his unfinished sketch the words, loosely translated, "I cannot finish the painting." I have wondered at his statement. Did his patrons in the church run out of funds to pay his wages? Did he become ill in the freezing humidity of Segovia's winters? Did arthritis in his hands and back prevent any more hours working on top of the scaffolding? Whatever the explanation, I relate to this incompleteness, to this imperfection--finding often that my efforts as a father, a husband, a teacher, and a colleague fall short. I suspect that at this time of year you have your own concerns about finishing--papers, projects, exams, degrees--and that those anxieties are layered on top of more compelling questions about the completeness of relationships, of families, of health, of promises, and of promise.<br><br>A few years ago I had another experience with finishing in another Spanish church. I was admiring a display of medieval Bibles at the cathedral in Burgos. One copy--as old as San Justo--stood out. Like most of the other artifacts on display, this Bible was a stunning example of artful calligraphy and brilliant illustrations. What caught my eye was the Bible's final leaf, on which the copyist and the illustrator had drawn self-portraits. Their backs were curved and their hands withered from arthritis. The drawings told us that finishing this volume of scripture literally cost them their lives. Their "waiting" transformed imperfect bodies into this perfect book--their flesh made Word. They had lived out Paul's promise: "<i>Ye</i>are manifestly declared to be the epistle of Christ . . . , written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tables of stone, but in fleshy tables of the heart" (2 Corinthians 3:3; emphasis added). I think often of my medieval brothers. Their devotion inspires me. The perfection of their offering stands in contrast to the unfinished panel at San Justo--a reminder that, left alone, even my best efforts will always be incomplete.<br><br>I bear witness that our life's painting, in any of its panels or dimensions, need not remain unfinished. I recall that Christ has written my sins in sand and engraved my image in his palms. I testify of the truth of Paul's words that the Lord Jesus Christ is both "the author and<i>finisher</i>of our faith" (Hebrews 12:2, also Moroni 6:4; emphasis added). When from the cross he promised, "It is finished" (John 19:30), he invited us to become perfected<i>in</i>him and to submit to and hope for the finishing touches of grace.<br><br>On this day when we commemorate the restoration of the gospel, I bear witness of and express my gratitude for the intimate restoration. I testify that he who will bring about the universal restoration of all things also brings to pass those intimate restorations that heal our wounds, cleanse our sins, and fulfill divine promises. I say this in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>John R.

<h1>ons of His Mercy - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I would like to congratulate you on attending spring term. May is one of the best months at Brigham Young University, and I do not think any of us should feel guilty that we are sharing it with only one-third of the entire student body. Have you noticed how much easier it is to get around? The seasons are important because we can be taught by them and because our own lives parallel the seasons of the year. Recently I read section 46 of the Doctrine and Covenants, and my heart and mind were struck by a phrase from verse 15, which states that Heavenly Father suits "his mercies according to the conditions of the children of men." After some pondering on this verse, I wrote a poem:<br><br><b>The Seasons of His Mercy</b><br>D&amp;amp;C 46:15<br><br><i>How many times in eighty years</i><br><i>Will He suit his mercies to my condition?</i><br><i>And are they mine to save or spend</i><br><i>To prevent separation?</i><br><br><i>For I sought Him in spring</i><br><i>When the sap was rising</i><br><i>In fits and starts</i><br><i>All uncontrollable.</i><br><br><i>And I knew Him in summer</i><br><i>When all was right</i><br><i>Except the thunderstorms</i><br><i>Which shook with temporary violence.</i><br><br><i>And I await Him in autumn</i><br><i>With its first chill</i><br><i>Begging reassurance that</i><br><i>The end is not the end.</i><br><br><i>But in winter,</i><br><i>Presage of death,</i><br><i>Will I find myself spendthrift,</i><br><i>A squanderer of mercies needed most?</i><br><br><i>Shortsighted,</i><br><i>I will but bond my heart to His,</i><br><i>Not saving or spending--just accepting</i><br><i>The seasons of His mercy.</i><br><br><i>Knowing His love is constant, kind,</i><br><i>Well-suited to my need;</i><br><i>In patience I await the day</i><br><i>When vision is restored</i><br><br><i>And those mercies which seemed five or ten</i><br><i>Are seen in their infinitude</i><br><i>Each day, each hour, each breath</i><br><i>A whole life long.</i><br><br>I believe that it is important to see God's mercies each day, each hour, each breath, a whole life long. If we can learn to see them more clearly, it will surely make spring term better, and--we hope--it will affect eternity.<br><br>In the final chapter of the Book of Mormon, Moroni instructed us on how to discover truth through the guidance of the Holy Ghost. In verse 3 he stated:<br><br><i>Behold, I would exhort you that when ye shall read these things, if it be wisdom in God that ye should read them, that ye would</i>remember<i>how</i>merciful<i>the Lord hath been unto the children of men, from the creation of Adam even down until the time that ye shall receive these things, and ponder it in your hearts.</i>[Moroni 10:3; emphasis added]<br><br>Moroni suggested that a knowledge of God's merciful dealings with all of his children is prerequisite to asking for assistance:<br><br>First, we are instructed to ponder his mercy.<br><br>Second, we are encouraged to<br><br><i>ask God, the Eternal Father, in the name of Christ, if these things</i>[in the Book of Mormon]<i>are not true; and if ye shall ask with a sincere heart, with real intent, having faith in Christ, he will manifest the truth of it unto you, by the power of the Holy Ghost.</i>[Moroni 10:4]<br><br>Third, we are told that it is "by the power of the Holy Ghost ye may know the truth of all things" (Moroni 10:5).<br><br>I believe that Moroni gave us a key to discovering truth. Prior to asking, we must first recognize God's tender mercies to his children and ponder them in our hearts and minds. Then we will be ready to correctly frame the questions we are to ask, and our hearts will be ready to receive the answers. Once we do this, the truth will be revealed to us through the power of the Holy Ghost.<br><br>An example of his children not remembering and the consequences of their not remembering is recorded in the Joseph Smith Translation of Psalm 106:7. David said the children of Israel "understood not [God's] wonders in Egypt; they remembered not the multitude of [his] mercies; but provoked him at the sea, at the Red sea." His children's inability to remember the multitude of his mercies saddened the One whom we as children most want to please.<br><br>In retrospect, it seems almost inconceivable that the children of Israel could forget what God had done for them after he had protected them from the plagues that had devastated Egypt. But I believe that you and I are more like the children of Israel than we would care to admit. When we get into a trying situation, we have trouble remembering our prior blessings because we are so focused on our present need. In our anxiety, don't we say something like, "Well, what are you going to do for me now?"<br><br>Jehovah instituted the celebration of the Passover among the children of Israel lest they forget what he had done for their fathers. The incidents surrounding the Exodus are part of the collective history of people of faith, and we must not forget them. We also need to remember what God has done in our individual lives.<br><br>The Jaredites provide a good example. After 344 days upon the water, they reached the promised land:<br><br><i>And when they had set their feet upon the shores of the promised land they bowed themselves down upon the face of the land, and did humble themselves before the Lord, and did shed tears of joy before the Lord, because of the multitude of his tender mercies over them.</i>[Ether 6:12]<br><br>Recently you may have driven from your family home to Provo for spring term. Prior to your departure, did you petition the Lord for safety while driving on the highway? I am quite certain that you did. When you arrived safely, did you immediately thank the Lord for protecting you? If you are like me, you probably remembered that night when you knelt down for prayer, if at all. Our prayers for safety need to be more fervent before we leave and our prayers of thanksgiving more sincere upon arrival. In light of recent happenings in this country, a prayer for safety before school in the morning and a prayer of thanksgiving after returning home safely seem particularly appropriate.<br><br>If we know that as mortals our feelings of gratitude have a short "half-life," and if we understand that recognizing and remembering God's mercy is an appropriate prerequisite to gaining truth through the power of the Holy Ghost, how do we deepen our feelings of gratitude daily? How do we remember the Lord, not only in times of great trial and times of great rejoicing but also on ordinary days like today?<br><br>These ordinary days are aptly described as "the most trying time of all" in W. H. Auden's poem<i>For the Time Being, a Christmas Oratorio:</i><br><br><i>In the meantime</i><br><i>There are bills to be paid, machines to keep in repair,</i><br><i>Irregular verbs to learn, the Time Being to redeem</i><br><i>From insignificance. The happy morning is over,</i><br><i>The night of agony still to come; the time is noon:</i><br><i>When the Spirit must practise his scales of rejoicing</i><br><i>Without even a hostile audience.</i><br>[<i>For the Time Being, a Christmas Oratorio,</i>"The Flight into Egypt" (1945)]<br><br>So how do we practice our "scales of rejoicing" during spring term? I offer nine ways to assist us. Why nine? Well, the number seven has already been preempted, and top-ten lists have been given a bad name. Nine may seem like a shotgun approach. It is. However, if I use enough examples, perhaps each of you will find at least one suggestion that fits.<br><h2><b>1. Discover the Early Morning</b></h2><br>Now, I know that many of you wish that verse 124 of section 88 of the Doctrine and Covenants did not say this, but it does: "Cease to sleep longer than is needful; retire to thy bed early, that ye may not be weary; arise early, that your bodies and your minds may be invigorated."<br><br>This is probably not the norm in the dorm, but it is a gracious suggestion, perhaps even a commandment. When I quote this to my children, they claim that section 88 was written before electricity was invented. They are convinced that it had something to do with candlelight straining 19th-century eyes. I hope to convince them and I hope to convince you that morning is a sacred time of day.<br><br>We need to get up and get moving. Physical exercise can be one of the best things to help us feel alive, and early in the morning, when the campus is virtually deserted, we will see beautiful sights that will gladden our hearts. You may also decide to walk around the Provo Temple, where you may be greeted by Professor Reed Benson, who walks there most mornings. Best of all, while you are walking, you can remember the blessings you have received from a loving Heavenly Father and count them.<br><br>Morning is also the time for sacred conversations. Although thanksgiving may play a larger role in evening prayers, planning may play a larger role in morning prayers. In your prayers, in addition to remembering your loved ones, you may wish to pray about your schoolwork. For a student, his or her studies are equivalent to the "crops" and "flocks" over which Amulek advised the Zoramites to pray in Alma 34:24–25. As you pray about your studies, you may wish to pray for your professors individually and by name, asking that they will be blessed to present ideas and concepts clearly and that you and their other students will be given the gift of understanding.<br><h2><b>2. Review the Promises That Have Been Made to You</b></h2><br>In his autobiography, Parley P. Pratt related the following conversation with his brother William. In 1830 Parley decided to leave his prosperous farm in Ohio in search of the true gospel. William thought this unwise and questioned Parley about his decision. He specifically wanted to know how Parley intended to support himself and his family. To William's inquiry, Parley replied:<br><br><i>"Why, sir, I have bank bills enough, on the very best institutions in the world, to sustain myself and family while we live."</i><br><br><i>"Indeed," said he, "well, I should like to see some of them; I hope they are genuine." "Certainly," I replied, "there is no doubt of that. They are true bills and founded on capital that will never fail, though heaven and earth should pass away. ..."</i><br><br>[Parley then explained:]<i>I then unlocked my treasury and drew from thence a large pocket book, full of promissory notes like the following: ...</i>"If ye abide in me, and my words abide in you, you shall ask what you will in my name and I will give it you." "All things are possible to him that believeth."<br><br><i>"Now, William," said I, "are these the words of Jesus Christ, or are they not?" "They certainly are," said he. ...</i><br><br><i>"Then you admit they are genuine bills?"</i><br><br><i>"I do."</i><br><br><i>"Is the signer able to meet his engagements?"</i><br><br><i>"He certainly is."</i><br><br><i>"Is he willing?"</i><br><br><i>"He is."</i><br><br><i>"Well, then, I am going to fulfil the conditions to the letter on my part. ... And I will do it, placing both feet firm on these promises with nothing else to rely upon."</i>[<i>PPP,</i>1985, p. 17; emphasis in original]<br><br>That very year Parley P. Pratt found the Book of Mormon and was baptized.<br><br>I like Elder Pratt's image of unlocking his treasury and drawing from it a large pocketbook full of promissory notes. I like the thought that scriptural promises are made by the most reliable source in the universe. It makes those promises not just words on a page but something tangible to be trusted and relied upon. "All things are possible to him that believeth"; "If ye abide in me, and my words abide in you, you shall ask what you will in my name and I will give it you." These are powerful promissory notes for which we should be most grateful.<br><br>Our patriarchal blessings are also promissory notes to be relied upon. A patriarch whom I admire called them "iffy" blessings. They<i>will</i>be granted<i>if</i>we are faithful and obedient. What a great thing to be able to join with Elder Pratt in saying: "I am going to fulfil the conditions to the letter on my part."<br><h2><b>3. Look at Your Surroundings</b></h2><br>Allow your senses to be alive to the beauties Heavenly Father has showered upon all of his children--"on the just and on the unjust" (Matthew 5:45). The rhythms of nature and its attractions can be sources of peace and hope. In a 1991 BYU Women's Conference address, Sister Elaine Jack, former general president of the Relief Society, recounted a story about a friend who had gone through a difficult divorce. Sister Jack related that the friend told her that<br><br><i>it was the smallest things that kept her going during those first weeks when all her world looked black. A bunch of crocuses burst through the snow, then announced their victory with purple blooms. The robins whistled from their nest in her front yard tree. The sun broke over the horizon every morning. People in her office lived their quiet routines. A person spoke kindly to her at the grocery store. ... Each small, loving, daily detail confirmed her hope. Little details and small events showed that life still was good.</i>[Elaine L. Jack, "A Perfect Brightness of Hope,"<i>Ensign,</i>March 1992, p. 15]<br><br>If you are in need of a boost spiritually, look around. You may be inspired by the amazing trees on the BYU campus. Look up at Y Mountain and watch the interplay of light and shadow on its face as the day progresses. Walk in the gentle spring rain without an umbrella. As an expression of God's love, nature can be a significant source of strength.<br><h2><b>4. Search for the Sacred in the Mundane</b></h2><br>Each of us can hope for flashes of inspiration--those experiences when pure knowledge is communicated. I call them "aha" experiences, others call them epiphanies. Sometimes they come when you do not expect them. For nine months I commuted each day between Provo and Salt Lake City. Some days I would arrive home after more than an hour's drive with no independent memory of the journey--just an unsettled, worried feeling. On other occasions I used the time to meditate and to pray and to even sing hymns that I would make up spontaneously. From my journal I share the following:<br><br><i>Yesterday morning I had a profound experience. Driving to Provo, I thought about Adam-ondi-Ahman and the Savior's return. I spontaneously sang a hymn of praise looking forward to that day. It was as if I could see that sacred place and feel the Spirit. I pictured a spring morning, mature trees in the valley, dew on the grass, all nature shouting praise at the triumphal return of the King. I imagined all of the dispensational prophets from Adam down to Joseph. The words of my hymn flowed, and the Spirit bore witness to my spirit that His appearance at Adam-ondi-Ahman would occur. ... What a cherished hope--when the earth, which I love, is renewed and receives its paradisiacal glory--when war and death and hunger and hatred are no more.</i><br><h2><b>5. Expect Profound Insights in the Classroom</b></h2><br>I believe that the classroom can be a place for "aha" experiences as well. I further believe that we should expect them. When they occur, I believe they should be remembered with reverence. One such experience for me was a Renaissance literature class at Stanford during autumn quarter in 1969. Three days a week I would wake up with a smile, knowing I would have Professor Ron Rebholz's class. I remember walking across the quad and looking at the Romanesque architecture, entering the old amphitheater with the uncomfortable chairs, lifting up the desk attached to the side of the chair, and waiting. Professor Rebholz read with power. He talked about the 16th-century English poets as if they were trusted friends. If I concentrate, stretching the bonds of memory, I can almost hear the cadence of his voice, its rise and fall as he read Ben Jonson's poem "On My First Son." A contemporary of Shakespeare's, Jonson was one of my favorites. I sensed I knew this man who wrote honestly about his grief at his son's passing. As Professor Rebholz read, I was struck by the truth that being a father would be one of the most important things in mortality. Although I do not presume for a moment that this was the response Professor Rebholz expected, it may have been the one Ben Jonson expected:<br><br><i>Farewell, thou child of my right hand, and joy;</i><br><i>My sin was too much hope of thee, loved boy:</i><br><i>Seven years thou wert lent to me, and I thee pay,</i><br><i>Exacted by thy fate, on the just day.</i><br><i>O could I lose all father now! for why</i><br><i>Will man lament the state he should envy,</i><br><i>To have so soon 'scaped world's and flesh's rage,</i><br><i>And, if no other misery, yet age?</i><br><i>Rest in soft peace, and asked, say, "Here doth lie</i><br><i>Ben Jonson his best piece of poetry."</i><br><i>For whose sake henceforth all his vows be such</i><br><i>As what he loves may never like too much.</i><br>[Ben Jonson, "On My First Son" (1616)]<br><br>Being granted the privilege to be a husband and a father has indeed been perhaps the most important blessing in my life.<br><h2><b>6. Trust That Professors Who Have Chosen to Teach at BYU See the Sacred in You</b></h2><br>During my son's freshman year in a humanities class taught by Eloise Bell, he discovered he loved to write. Although Scott had always been a dedicated student, Professor Bell, a master teacher, called forth more than dedication. She assigned an open essay on Romanticism. As he wrote his paper, Scott became involved in the subject. I will read a section because it is superior to my own work and because it reveals something about true teaching. It is entitled "Dreams of Sled Dogs, Poets, Mountain Men, and Heading North":<br><br><i>I run behind the sled in a translucent state hovering between warmth and cold. ... It is the fourth night of the Iditarod, and the dogs are finally moving. They have run nearly this whole race, but they have finally found their rhythm; they are unafraid to run. Surging forward in unison, every paw lifts and falls, every sinuous muscle contracts and ripples, and we are one. The dogs, the sled, the snow, the wind, and I are all one--all part of the primordial dream. ... A frigid wind blows in from the Bering Sea and jumps over snow-corniced hills, showering us with a thousand particles of stinging, burning hail. The dogs recognize the wind, and they are glad. They echo its haunting refrain, and the running song has begun.</i><br><br><i>Something about the snow and ice has crept into my soul and grabbed my heart. I am sitting in my grandma's synthetic leather recliner reading</i>National Geographic,<i>but the truth is, I could have sworn I felt an arctic wind chill the marrow of my bones. I have never raced sled dogs; in fact, I have never even seen a sled. But whether an Eskimo shaman has enchanted me or</i>[not],<i>part of me yearns to run with dogs until my lungs burn. ... I listen to the clarion tune that is carried on the wind, and I am kin to the mountain peaks. I have clung to the few people who share my dreams, but only recently did I learn that we were not a small band ... but a strange breed called romantics. You see, I am a hopeless romantic, but I have not only read Rousseau--I am Rousseau; I am Whitman and Wordsworth and Tennyson. I am not suggesting that to dream is better than to experience, but to live through dreams is better than to never experience at all.</i><br><br>Thirty-five years ago, in my freshman classes, if I had written such an essay, my PhD writing fellow may have written in the margin: "So what." Consequently, even if I had had the talent, I would not have taken the risk. At BYU, my son<i>could</i>and<i>did</i>risk. Professor Bell encouraged Scott by asking him to read his essay to the class. To a rather shy freshman in a class of upperclassmen, she extended the hand of friendship. It is in this type of personal, caring environment that true learning becomes possible.<br><h2><b>7. Cherish Your Religion Classes and the Scriptures You Study in Them</b></h2><br>Last month I attended a fast and testimony meeting in a freshman ward at BYU. In bearing her testimony, a young woman said that she had come to BYU because her parents had forced her. She said that she was angry that her brother had gone on a mission because she knew she needed him far more than did the people in Thailand. She had listened to the testimonies of others in her ward at the beginning of the year with a degree of disdain. She had asked herself, "How do they know what they say they do? Why are they always so cheerful?" She, by contrast, did not know. She said she had slept through early morning seminary, and she didn't even want to know. Then, because of her BYU religion class, she started to read the Book of Mormon. She concluded her testimony by indicating that her feelings had changed. She said that she knew it was possible to have faith and hope because she now had it.<br><br>I smiled as I listened to this young woman bear her testimony. It reminded me of the Palo Alto Institute of Religion and George Pace and Eugene England. Both Brother Pace and Brother England have taught at BYU for years. I would like to pay tribute to them for helping me. As a freshman I thought institute would be like my seminary class. I started attending it with the same chip on my shoulder--trying to think of challenging questions. Brother Pace and Brother England were always upbeat. They never lost their patience. I started listening to their stories and thinking about the gospel and, for the first time, reading the Book of Mormon. Did it help that I was intensely homesick and worried that I would fail? Yes, it did. Homesickness is often fertile soil in which the seeds of testimony may grow. Nonetheless, I am grateful for their steadiness, their knowledge, and their friendship while I progressed from unpleasant disregard to pleasant regard to complete attention. Were it not for them, I might not have chosen to go on a mission, which turned out to be the most important experience of my young life.<br><br>Sometimes we are unaware that the Spirit is creeping into the tiniest crevices in our stonelike hearts--crevices lovingly created by our Father--and slowly we are given a new heart. As Ezekiel stated so beautifully: "I will take the stony heart out of their flesh, and will give them an heart of flesh" (Ezekiel 11:19).<br><br>May I say that the study of sacred texts is effective in making crevices for the Spirit to enter--not only on first reading, but even on the tenth reading. During a previous spring term at BYU, I attended a training class for would-be Book of Mormon teachers. It was a spring as beautiful as this one, and we were expected to reread the entire Book of Mormon. During the middle of the term I had to leave for several days to attend a law school conference in Florida. I thought I would see a beautiful new place, but monsoon-like rain kept me in for three days. After my meetings adjourned each day, I spent my time alone in the hotel room reading Ether, Mormon, and Moroni. I walked the floor reading to stay awake, as beds mean sleep to me. After completing the Book of Mormon this time, I wrote the following in my journal:<br><br><i>I feel to sing a song of thanksgiving for the Book of Mormon. I have spent hours reading and thrilled at the message of the brother of Jared, the prophet Ether, and the prophets Mormon and Moroni. I have thought deeply about faith, hope, and charity and how they interrelate. I have hope in Christ's appearing and in my resurrection. That hope gives birth to faith and is likewise fed by the same--that he is my Redeemer and the Redeemer of all mankind. And through that faith and hope, I will continue to pray to be filled with His pure love--even charity. I want to be a participant in the covenant of God with his children that a Savior would be provided to redeem them from their sins. I want to be a part of the proclamation of that message.</i><br><h2><b>8. Find Sacred Places</b></h2><br>In addition to sacred texts being a way to remember the mercy of the Father and the Son, it may be wise to find your own sacred places, where you can meditate and commune with God. In an article entitled "A Promised Land," Elder Jeffrey R. Holland, then chair of the Religion Department at BYU, spoke about sacred places and the need to remember what occurs there:<br><br><i>Some otherwise plain and rather ordinary places can become very special to us. Our homes, a hillside, the hospitals where our children were born, ... these and many more have special meaning not so much for the soil or brick itself but because of what has happened ... there. ...</i><br><br><i>"The place of Mormon, the waters of Mormon, the forest of Mormon, how beautiful are they to the eyes of them who there came to the knowledge of their Redeemer." (Mosiah 18:30.)</i><br><br><i>So sang the prophet who knew that a pool of water is no longer merely a pool of water once you have been baptized there.</i>[Jeffrey R. Holland, "A Promised Land,"<i>Ensign,</i>June 1976, p. 23]<br><br>Each of us needs to find a sacred place, as did Enos, where we can contemplate the words of "eternal life, and the joy of the saints, [that they may sink] deep into [our] heart[s]" (Enos 1:3). We each need to find a place that we will associate with God's tender mercies.<br><br>Your sacred place may be located on the BYU campus, perhaps at the base of the Carillon Tower. It may be up Rock Canyon or near Aspen Grove. As stated by John Muir: "In our best times everything turns into religion, all the world seems a church and the mountains altars" (<i>Mountaineering Essays</i>[Salt Lake City: Peregrine Books, 1984], p. 19).<br><br>Or your sacred place may be the house of the Lord, where you can perform ordinances vicariously for others. Perhaps you will retreat to your bedroom in your apartment or at home in order to be alone. As Elder Holland says, it is what occurs in the ordinary, sacred place that makes the difference.<br><h2><b>9. Find and Hold to Beloved Relationships</b></h2><br>Another help in remembering God's tender mercies is a friend, a brother, or a sister upon whom you can rely. One of the great examples of friendship in this dispensation is the relationship between the Prophet Joseph and his brother Hyrum. They supported one another and counseled with one another. Joseph attempted to protect Hyrum from harm, and Hyrum refused to leave Joseph in times of danger. Listen to this beautiful blessing the Prophet Joseph Smith gave to his brother Hyrum in 1833:<br><br><i>He shall be as a cooling spring that breaketh forth at the foot of the mountain, overshadowed with choice trees bowed down with ripe fruit, that yieldeth both nourishment to the appetite and quencheth the thirst, thereby yielding refreshment to the weary traveller: and the goings of his feet shall ever be by streams of living water.</i>[<i>Teachings,</i>p. 40]<br><br>Think of having a brother, a sister, or a friend who would be in your life "as a cooling spring that breaketh forth at the foot of the mountain, overshadowed with choice trees bowed down with ripe fruit." A brother, a sister, or a friend can literally be an oasis in the desert of mortality--the mere sight of them can refresh and renew. This type of friendship is an example of God's tender mercy. If you have such a person in your life, thank them. If you do not, pray that you will make one. Friendships need to be nurtured, and they will grow up to shade you when you most need it.<br><br>Perhaps even better than finding such a friend would be to become such a friend. We know from the book of Alma that the willingness "to bear one another's burdens, that they may be light" is associated with the covenant of baptism (Mosiah 18:8). It is within sacred friendships that we begin to learn how to live this covenant.<br><br>I hope that these nine suggestions for remembering God's tender mercies will be helpful during spring term. I also hope, after having fulfilled the prerequisite of remembering God's mercies suggested by the prophet Moroni, that each of us will present ourselves before God with a pure heart and knowing the right questions to ask. Then we will have the courage to ask for the truths that we need, and we will have confidence that he will reveal them to us through the power of the Holy Ghost.<br><br>It is my prayer that we will discern the seasons of his mercy in our lives and bond our hearts to his, "knowing his love is constant, kind, well-suited" to our need; and that in patience we will "await the day when vision is restored and those mercies which seemed five or ten are seen in their infinitude each day, each hour, each breath" our whole life long. I offer this hope for you and for myself in the name of Jesus Christ, who is the most tangible expression of his Father's tender mercy. Amen.<br><br><i>Scott W. Cameron was associate dean of the J.

<br>
<br>
It is a humbling experience for me to be here once again on the beautiful campus of Brigham Young University and to be with President and Sister Bateman, the administrators, faculty, and you wonderful members of the student body.<br><br>Most of you are still a little too young to appreciate how fast time passes. You know the older I get, the quicker it seems to pass. I am not sure if that's a sign of old age or just the pace of my lifestyle.<br><br>The story is told of two very elderly ladies who were enjoying the sunshine on a park bench in Miami. They had been meeting at the same park every sunny day for more than 12 years, chatting and enjoying each other's company.<br><br>One day, the younger of the two ladies turned to the other and said, "Please don't be angry with me, dear. It's so embarrassing after all these years. What is your name? I am trying to remember, but I just can't."<br><br>The older friend stared at her, looking very distressed, and said nothing for two full minutes. Finally, with tearful eyes, she said, "How soon do you have to know?"<br><br>Well, I haven't reached that stage yet, but I must confess that when I received this assignment I thought, "I've just had that opportunity." But when I checked my journal, I found that two years had passed since I was last here speaking on this great campus.<br><br>Yes, how quickly time passes.<br><br>Ten years ago this October, while speaking in the priesthood meeting of general conference, I shared the following experience. One day<br><br><i>my son Ben came to me and said, "Dad, we are going to hold our family reunion this summer at Flaming Gorge recreation area" (a distance of 220 miles east of Salt Lake City). "Why don't you, myself, and any of the boys in our family that would like to leave a few days early, ride our bikes to Flaming Gorge, and meet the rest of the family there?"</i><br><br><i>I said, "That sounds great, but we only have one motorcycle!"</i><br><br><i>Ben said, "No, Dad, you</i>[don't understand.]<i>I mean pedal bicycles." I thought he was kidding. He said, "I will outline and prepare a training schedule for us. We'll get up early Saturday mornings and for three hours we'll go out and ride over the courses I will outline, so that when the time comes we will be prepared to go."</i><br><br><i>I said, "Okay," not really knowing what I was in for. I didn't own a bicycle and knew I would have to use my daughter's old, heavy, ten-speed bicycle with what seemed like bent wheels and a seat that was terribly hard. I also knew that getting up early on Saturday mornings was not one of my favorite things. But knowing that some of my sons wanted me to go with them, I said, "Okay."</i><br><br><i>As the time for training and preparation came, I found all kinds of excuses</i>[not to]<i>go on the training rides. However, one Saturday I rode with them to the top of Parleys Canyon and back. It was hard, but I thought I would be okay. Little did I know!</i><br><br><i>The time for the trip came. I joined my boys the second day of the trip, as I had meetings the first day. The journey that second day took us from Heber City to Roosevelt (approximately one hundred miles).</i><br><br><i>As we checked into the motel that evening, I called my wife at home and told her I had never hurt so bad in my life. Every muscle, bone, and fiber in my body hurt from my head to my feet. I implored her, "When you come tomorrow with the rest of the family, please bring all the ointment and lotion you can find."</i><br><br><i>She said, "Honey, you sound terrible."</i><br><br><i>I told her, "I look and feel worse than I sound."</i><br><br><i>The next day I hated to see the dawn come, knowing what it would be like to sit on that hard seat and pedal all day once again</i>[in order]<i>to reach our destination--especially the stretch from Vernal to Flaming Gorge, which would include approximately thirty-six-plus miles with grades up to 9 percent and ninety-degree-plus temperatures. Needless to say, for me the whole trip was a very trying and arduous task. But for my sons, who spent a lot of time waiting at the top of the hills for their slow, unprepared dad, it was exciting, fun, and rewarding.</i><br><br><i>That evening as we arrived at our destination, I came to an easy, yet profound recognition of how poorly prepared I was for what should have been a great experience with my sons, but was not because I did not take the time to properly prepare. I resolved that night that I would never again be that unprepared. I went home and bought bicycles for myself and my two youngest sons, and started training and preparing so that by the time the next summer came, my sons and I could ride our bikes to Lake Powell, a distance of three hundred miles, which we did. The next year we cycled to St. George, and every year thereafter, we rode our bikes to Lake Powell until our mission</i>[assignment some years later]. [Ben B. Banks, "The Value of Preparation,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 1989, pp. 40–41]<br><br>With the call to serve as a mission president 12 years ago and this subsequent call that took my wife and me to several international assignments, the long bike rides had to be put on hold for a period of time. I did, however, take my bicycle with me wherever my assignments were in hopes that I would be able to find time to ride occasionally. I wanted to be prepared so if the opportunity for a long ride ever came again I would be able to do it. That opportunity came once again this past fall when I was given permission to take a few days away from the office. At the invitation of that same son who years ago suggested we ride to Flaming Gorge, and now joined by another son and our only daughter, we flew with our bikes to Bozeman, Montana, where we then proceeded to ride to Jackson Hole, Wyoming. At my age, preparation continues to be very, very important in order to survive such a ride.<br><br>The prophet Amulek testified, "This life is the time for men to prepare to meet God; yea, behold the day of this life is the day for men to perform their labors" (Alma 34:32).<br><br>If it is important to prepare for a bike ride, it is much more important for you to prepare for your future--both for this life and for the eternities.<br><br>As I contemplate the significance of what you are doing in this great institution of learning, I think of the words of President Thomas S. Monson:<br><br><i>Preparation for life's opportunities and responsibilities has never been more vital. We live in a changing society. Intense competition is a part of life. The role of husband, father, grandfather, provider, and protector is vastly different from what it was a generation ago. Preparation is not a matter of</i>perhaps<i>or</i>maybe.<i>It is a mandate. The old phrase "Ignorance is bliss" is forever gone. Preparation precedes performance</i>. [Thomas S. Monson, "Duty Calls,"<i>Ensign,</i>May 1996, p. 43; emphasis in original]<br><br>Did you catch the phrase "It is a mandate"? The dictionary defines the word<i>mandate</i>as "an official or authoritative instruction or command" (<i>Collins Dictionary and Thesaurus,</i>1991 edition, p. 608). Let me repeat that: "an official or authoritative instruction or command." An interesting choice of words then, from a prophet, seer, and revelator.<br><br>As we consider our preparation for life, remember the Lord counsels us as we read in Hosea 4:6, "My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge." And then in the Doctrine and Covenants we are told, "Seek ye out of the best books words of wisdom; seek learning, even by study and also by faith" (D&amp;amp;C 88:118). But remember, the more knowledge and learning we obtain and the more success we gain, the more humility we need.<br><br>Recognizing that "the glory of God is intelligence, or, in other words, light and truth" and that "light and truth forsake that evil one" (D&amp;amp;C 93:36–37), we can immediately see that there are many benefits. One such benefit is that of having light and truth in our lives.<br><br>You young people face an exciting and yet daunting future of ever-changing career opportunities as job markets come and go within the pressures of a global economy. Whereas once a career decision meant a job for life in a given vocation, nowadays you may have to make up to three or four major career changes during your working life.<br><br>How do you begin to prepare for making such monumental decisions? How can we recognize that we are making the right career move? Suddenly the need for spiritual light in making our decisions becomes very real.<br><br>Do you see the value of having the Spirit help as you plot your course through this life's challenges and decisions?<br><br>The Latter-day Saint hymn "The Iron Rod" (<i>Hymns,</i>1985, no. 274) illustrates beautifully the vision of Lehi as found in 1 Nephi 8. Its message for us is to hold to the rod, the iron rod--or, as we know, the word of God--and it will safely guide us on life's journey. You will recall that in the vision Lehi saw many people in a great and spacious building mocking and pointing their fingers at those who had arrived to partake of the fruit. Some recipients of this mocking even fell away and became lost.<br><br>Many in the world today would have you believe that God's word plays no part in your educational process. They scoff at your religious standards and beliefs. Some would even have you believe that you cannot reconcile your faith with your educational knowledge--that they are somehow incompatible and inappropriate and that "no right thinking man or women could believe that sort of thing anymore."<br><br>We know that this is foolishness. The history of this world is replete with stories of man's disregard for his Creator, which disregard leads to man's subsequent demise.<br><br>By obtaining<i>now</i>both spiritual and educational preparation, you are acquiring for yourself and your family, or future family, the knowledge you will need to provide both spiritual and temporal pillars during mortal probation here on earth.<br><br>In general conference of October 1995, Elder Richard G. Scott said, "The Lord's plan is to exalt you to live with Him and be greatly blessed. The rate at which you qualify is generally set by your capacity to mature, to grow, to love, and to give of yourself" (Richard G. Scott, "Trust in the Lord,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 1995, p. 18).<br><br>The prophet Alma taught his son Helaman a great principle. He said, "O, remember, my son, and learn wisdom in thy youth; yea, learn in thy youth to keep the commandments of God" (Alma 37:35).<br><br>By keeping the commandments of God you will have greater understanding and enjoy many blessings, which include:<br><br>1. Gaining the necessary secular knowledge needed to win employment that will provide for the temporal needs of your family.<br><br>2. Enjoying a greater understanding of your potential.<br><br>3. Having the companionship of the Holy Ghost to influence your decisions.<br><br>4. Obtaining a promise of protection from the influences of the evil one.<br><br>5. And, of course, gaining the wisdom and knowledge needed to prepare you for the eternities.<br><br>In 1971 Elder Dallin H. Oaks said that at Brigham Young University<br><br><i>we are concerned with teaching the fundamentals of spiritual and secular knowledge and with bringing those teachings into harmony in the lives of men and women in order to prepare them for a balanced and full life of service to God and fellowman.</i>[Dallin H. Oaks,<i>CR,</i>October 1971, p. 124]<br><br>He added some thoughts and goals that we need to pay special attention to in our preparation:<br><br><i>1. Rigorous standards and high achievement in any field of learning are not at odds with faith and devotion to the gospel of Jesus Christ. Strive for excellence, use the talents that the Lord has given you, meet and master the learning of men.</i><br><br><i>2. In approaching any field of learning, remember the Lord's direction to "seek learning, even by study and also by faith." (D&amp;amp;C 88:118.) . . .</i><br><br><i>3. Cherish and nourish your spiritual life. Seek spiritual growth at the same time that you are seeking to enlarge your learning in other areas. Nourish your spirit just as regularly as you nourish your body or mind. Don't neglect study of the gospel and activity in the Church during the period of your schooling.</i>[Oaks,<i>CR,</i>October 1971, p. 124]<br><br>Sometimes we can be so caught up with worldly distractions, a current situation, or a difficulty that we fail to realize that answers to many of life's problems are already within our reach.<br><br>President David O. McKay referred to William George Jordan, who<br><br><i>tells the story of some men in a ship, which, during a terrific storm, was driven far out of its course, and, helpless and disabled, was carried into a strange bay. The water supply gave out and the crew suffered the agony of thirst yet dared not drink of the salt water in which that vessel floated. In the last extremity they lowered a bucket over the ship's side, and in desperation quaffed the beverage they thought was sea water, but to their joy and amazement the water was fresh, cool and life-giving! They were in a fresh-water arm of the sea and they did not know it! They had simply to reach down and accept the new life and strength for which they craved.</i><br><br>President McKay then added:<br><br><i>The illustration is applicable to a large part of mankind today. Men and nations are drifting. They have lost their bearings; their wisdom is baffled. Tried and true methods of the past have been discarded, and vague and indefinite theories offered as panaceas for social and economic ills. There is an inescapable necessity for a safe and experienced pilot at the wheel.</i>[David O. McKay, comp. Llewelyn R. McKay,<i>Pathways to Happiness</i>(Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1957), pp. 138–39]<br><br>As Latter-day Saints we should realize that just gaining a college education is not enough to guarantee our success in a changing world. Our preparation for the future must be founded upon principles of the gospel and not on those of the world.<br><br>Never in the history of this earth has a group of students had to face the turmoil and wickedness that is so pervasive today. The Apostle Paul, when he was incarcerated in the dungeons in Rome, prior to being martyred as a Christian and follower of Christ, wrote a letter to his good friend and protégé Timothy, wherein he described the last days, or the permissive society in which we live today:<br><br><i>This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come.</i><br><br><i>For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,</i><br><br><i>Without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good,</i><br><br><i>Traitors, heady, highminded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God.</i>[2 Timothy 3:1–4]<br><br>As you continue your education, it is very important that you do not become one of those who Paul described as "ever learning, [but] never able to come to the knowledge of the truth" (2 Timothy 3:7).<br><br>Isn't that a most accurate description of life on earth for many people today?<br><br>President Dwight D. Eisenhower had interesting insight into the importance of spiritual and moral strength.<br><br><i>One evening</i>[he]<i>had a few close friends at the White House in Washington, D.C. They were discussing world problems. For a long while, the President listened; then he said:</i><br><br><i>"My friends, the biggest, most powerful weapon in the world is not the atomic bomb, or even the fighting ability of men. It is their moral and spiritual strength. Nothing can ever conquer that strength. Remember this, gentlemen, because that is the weapon our enemies really fear."</i>[John Longden,<i>CR,</i>April 1968, p. 138]<br><br>We must never lose sight of the fact that this life is a probationary period and that by combining our knowledge, both spiritual and secular, with holding to the rod, we can be the recipients of many great and wonderful blessings.<br><br>The Apostle Paul taught the Corinthians that "eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him" (1 Corinthians 2:9).<br><br>How do we show the Lord that we love him? He taught us this: "If ye love me, keep my commandments" (John 14:15).<br><br>Just as we need to prepare for our life, so also do we need to live our lives in such a way that we will be prepared for the next life.<br><br>As Elder Sterling W. Sill said in general conference in October 1965:<br><br><i>We can imagine some wonderful things, but we cannot even conceive of that magnificent experience that lies beyond the borders of this life. Certainly the greatest wonders of the future will not be in the improvement of our television,</i>[our computers,]<i>or our airplanes; they will be primarily in ourselves. The greater the understanding of our own future, the more effectively we will be able to prepare for it.</i>[Sterling W. Sill,<i>CR,</i>October 1965, p. 57]<br><br>The prophet Brigham Young said:<br><br><i>Prepare to die, is not the exhortation in this church and kingdom; but prepare to live is the word with us, and improve all we can</i>[for the life]<i>hereafter, wherein we may enjoy a more exalted condition of intelligence, wisdom, light, knowledge, power, glory, and exaltation.</i>[<i>JD</i>11:132]<br><br>When asked the question "What shall I do to inherit eternal life?" the Savior responded by saying, "Love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy strength, and with all thy mind; and thy neighbour as thyself" (Luke 10:25, 27). We show our Heavenly Father and our neighbors how much we love them by the way we serve them.<br><br>The prophet Alma explained that baptism requires that we<br><br><i>bear one another's burdens, that they may be light;</i><br><br><i>Yea, and are willing to mourn with those that mourn; yea, and comfort those that stand in need of comfort, and to stand as witnesses of God at all times.</i>[Mosiah 18:8–9]<br><br>If we learn and remember that "charity is the pure love of Christ" (Moroni 7:47), we will be able to bless the lives of all those with whom we associate, for<br><br><i>charity suffereth long, and is kind, and envieth not, and is not puffed up, seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked, thinketh no evil, and rejoiceth not in iniquity but rejoiceth in the truth, beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things.</i>[Moroni 7:45]<br><br>As we prepare for our future, we need to make sure that our secular interests don't distract us from or take priority over the spiritual ones. The Lord has taught us:<br><br><i>Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal:</i><br><br><i>But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor steal:</i><br><br><i>For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.</i>[Matthew 6:19–21]<br><br>So many people have their hearts set upon the things of this world. It is as if wealth and material possessions have become gods whom they worship. Man's never-ending quest for ever more possessions and affluence has, in many cases, squeezed out feelings of kindness and benevolence toward the poor and needy.<br><br>In general conference in October 1967, Elder Delbert L. Stapley quoted President Heber J. Grant, who offered this counsel:<br><br><i>"He whose every act has fitted him for the enjoyment of eternity will be far in advance of the man whose all has been centered on the things of this life." (</i>Millenial Star,<i>Vol. 66, March 31, 1904, p. 201.)</i>[Quoted in Stapley,<i>CR,</i>October 1967, p. 71]<br><br>Latter-day Saints preparing for a successful future need to remember that selfishness must always be recognized and immediately replaced by selflessness.<br><br>Elder Dallin H. Oaks tells<br><br><i>the apocryphal story of two men standing before the casket of a wealthy friend. Asked one, "How much property did he leave?" Replied the other, "He left all of it."</i>["Tithing,"<i>Ensign,</i>May 1994, p. 35]<br><br>Now, in closing, I want to share with you the story of a man who lost his sense of priorities at an early age.<br><br>President Hugh B. Brown, as a young soldier in World War I, was visiting an elderly friend in the hospital. This friend was a millionaire several times over who, at the age of 80, was lying at death's door. President Brown related:<br><br><i>As I stood by his bedside and thought over various parts of his life . . . , as I thought of his divorced wife, of his five children, all of whom were estranged, and none of whom cared enough to come to the hospital to see him, as I thought of the things he had lost which money could not buy and noted his tragic situation and the depth of his misery, I asked him what he would do if he had the privilege of living his life over again and could start it with the wisdom which had come through the years, what he considered the real values in life as he stood near the end of it. . . .</i><br><br><i>This old gentleman, who died a few days later, said to me, "As I think back over life, the most important and valuable asset which I might have had but which I lost in the process of accumulating millions, was the simple faith my mother had in God and in the immortality of the soul."</i><br><br><i>The old gentleman asked me to get a little book out of his briefcase and gave me the page on which he had marked a poem, and then he said, "You asked me what is the most valuable thing in life. I cannot answer you in better words than those used by the poet. Will you read them to me?" And as I read the following lines I thought it was he, not the poet, that was speaking, and I read:</i><br><br><i>I'm an Alien</i><br><br><i>I'm an alien, to the faith my mother taught me.</i><br><i>I'm a stranger to the God that heard my mother when she cried.</i><br><i>I'm an alien to the comfort that, 'Now I lay me,' brought me.</i><br><i>To the everlasting arms that held my father when he died.</i><br><i>When the great world came and called me, I deserted all to follow.</i><br><i>Never noting in my blindness I had slipped my hand from His,</i><br><i>Never dreaming in my dazedness that the bubble fame is hollow.</i><br><i>That the wealth of gold is tinsel, as I since have learned it is.</i><br><i>I have spent a lifetime seeking things I spurned when I found them,</i><br><i>I have fought and been rewarded in many a winning cause,</i><br><i>But I'd give it all, fame and fortune and the pleasures that surround them,</i><br><i>If I only had the faith that made my mother what she was.</i><br><br><i>That was the dying testimony of a man who was born in the Church but had drifted far from it. That was the brokenhearted cry of a lonely man who could have anything that money could buy, but who had lost the most important things of life in order to accumulate this world's goods.</i>[Hugh B. Brown,<i>Continuing the Quest</i>(Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Company, 1961), pp. 33–34]<br><br>May we not follow this example.<br><br>We are led by a prophet of God who gives us the direction we need in order to focus our preparation. We understand that as we strive for excellence in our secular lives we can balance our efforts with our own spiritual quest to be more like the Master, even Jesus Christ.<br><br>President Thomas S. Monson taught:<br><br><i>Before we can successfully undertake a personal search for Jesus, we must first prepare time for him in our lives and room for him in our hearts. In these busy days there are many who have time for golf, time for shopping, time for work, time for play, but</i>no time for Christ.<br><br><i>Lovely homes dot the land and provide rooms for eating, rooms for sleeping, playrooms, sewing rooms, television rooms, but</i>no room for Christ. [Thomas S. Monson,<i>CR,</i>October 1965, p. 143; emphasis in original]<br><br>Remember to<br><br><i>cry unto God for all thy support; yea, let all thy doings be unto the Lord, and whithersoever thou goest let it be in the Lord; yea, let all thy thoughts be directed unto the Lord; yea, let the affections of thy heart be placed upon the Lord forever.</i><br><br><i>Counsel with the Lord in all thy doings, and he will direct thee for good; yea, when thou liest down at night lie down unto the Lord, that he may watch over you in your sleep; and when thou risest in the morning let thy heart be full of thanks unto God.</i>[Alma 37:36–37]<br><br>As we meet today in this marvelous center of learning and study, let us realize the necessity of harnessing our secular preparation to a firm spiritual base. Let us now press forward with listening ears ready to show charity and kindness to those we meet.<br><br>As many of our Church leaders like to caution, avoid being in "the thick of thin things" (Edith Wharton; see Marion D. Hanks,<i>Freedom and Responsibility,</i>Brigham Young University Speeches of the Year, BYU baccalaureate address, 28 May 1964, p. 9). We should make sure we achieve the very best in our academic life but recognize that our spiritual preparation will contribute to those achievements and give us peace throughout life and the eternities.<br><br>And as we do these things, we "shall be lifted up at the last day" (Alma 37:37).<br><br>In conclusion, as I look at you outstanding young men and women here at Brigham Young University today, the future seems very positive and bright for young people who love the Lord. You radiate a wonderful spirit, which I feel from you. Yes, I believe that Latter-day Saints everywhere can reap the blessings of being well prepared.<br><br>I bear my witness and testimony to each of you who are here in this assembly today that the church to which you and I belong is the true and living church upon the face of the earth--even The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.<br><br>My wife and I recently had the occasion to spend a couple of hours alone walking hand in hand through the Sacred Grove. I testify to you the Prophet Joseph saw what he said he saw as the Father and the Son appeared to him in that sacred ground of the holy Sacred Grove. As the Father addressed his Son, our Savior Jesus Christ, with those seven words--"This is my Beloved Son, hear Him"--the gospel was reintroduced to the earth through the Prophet Joseph, never to be taken from the earth again in its fullness. I testify that the Prophet Joseph was the prophet of this dispensation and that today you and I have the opportunity of sitting and listening to a living prophet--even President Gordon B. Hinckley, who holds all the keys of the kingdom. I promise that if we will listen to his counsel, he will help us to prepare one day to be worthy to return to the presence of the Father and the Son.<br><br>I testify that God lives and Jesus is the Christ. I try to comprehend the great love that our Father in Heaven must have had for us that he allowed his Only Begotten Son in the flesh and the Firstborn of the Spirit to come to this earth and be offered as a sacrifice for you and for me and for all mankind. I try to comprehend the great love that our Lord and Savior--even Jesus Christ--has for us that he was willing to take upon himself the sins of all mankind and suffer the persecutions, the torment, and the ridicule that no mere mortal man could endure. Because of his great love for us as our Savior and Redeemer, he fulfilled the Atonement and the Resurrection that make it possible for all of us to live again.<br><br>May we so prepare our lives, my young friends, that one day we will have that glorious opportunity of sitting in the presence of the Father and his Son, our Savior Jesus Christ, of which I testify and pray his blessings upon you in his holy name, even Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Ben B.

<h1>ce: A Mighty Change of Heart - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Several years ago I had lunch with a young man who was a student in my department here on campus--one whom I had taught in a graduate-level class. With his permission I would like to share with you his remarkable story.<br><br>John was born healthy but developed bone cancer in his leg when he was only 11 years old. He underwent some of the early chemotherapy and radiation treatments. The cancer in his leg was successfully treated, but the medication used in the chemotherapy attacked his heart and resulted in a disease called cardiomyopathy. Such chemotherapy procedures today avoid the onset of this disease with frequent heart biopsies during the treatment. Unfortunately, these were not performed routinely when John was treated.<br><br>In this condition the muscles in his heart slowly deteriorated. Despite his weakened heart, John lived an active life, even becoming an Eagle Scout. By age 19 his heart had weakened seriously; nonetheless, against the recommendation of his doctors, John submitted his application to serve a full-time mission. His cardiologist advised against a mission, but, on seeing John's determination to serve, suggested that he request a mission close to home. The doctor candidly warned him and his parents that his last years of life might be spent there. John accepted a call to the California Oakland Mission. At the time, being among those who were called to serve for 18 months, he prayerfully extended his mission service to 24 months when given the opportunity.<br><br>After his honorable mission teaching Cambodian refugees, John returned to BYU to study mechanical engineering. When he was 25 the muscle decay in his heart became so severe that his doctor indicated a heart transplant was the only option. After careful screening, John was placed on the eligible organ transplant recipient list at the University of Utah, and he waited for word of organ availability with an electronic pager at his side 24 hours a day. His family moved temporarily from California to Bountiful to be near the hospital. After nearly two months John was notified that a donor heart had become available, and he went immediately to the hospital for the transplant. In a surgical procedure that lasted only 87 minutes, John's diseased heart was taken from his body and replaced by the healthy heart of a young automobile accident victim whose family's unselfishness made critical transplants of several body organs possible all across the country. Incidentally, the heart transplant donor was female, and John used to joke that his transplant might be the only way he could "capture the heart of a woman." After two weeks of hospital recuperation and nearly six months of required recuperation near the hospital, he returned to BYU to complete his studies.<br><br>I was then and still am amazed at the miracle of John's story. Sitting beside him in the cafeteria, I was astonished to realize that I was talking to a young man whose heart had been taken from his body, and the heart of another was beating in its place. After his transplant John resumed a full, active life with participation in Men's Chorus, an election as president of the student section of the national professional society to which he belonged, and Church service. He completed a master's degree and was married in the temple in August 1992.<br><br>I'm quite sure John appreciates mortality more than perhaps most do. And he recognizes that his routine will never be the same. For the rest of his life he will face frequent visits to the doctor, careful oversight of his physical activity, and a daily regimen of medication to prevent his body from rejecting his borrowed heart. His heart transplant, however, has made it possible for him to escape what the doctors promised would be certain early death.<br><br>John's heart transplant was critical to his continued life here on earth. I use his story to illustrate a principle of the gospel vital to our spiritual lives, relying on a powerful scriptural image from the Book of Mormon. Alma the Younger had traveled around Zarahemla persecuting the Saints despite fervent prayers offered in his behalf by his father. His persecution must have been rather aggressive, because we are told that the people of Zarahemla were praying in earnest for him as well. As you recall, Alma and his wicked friends were visited by an angel who called them to repentance. Later, after his conversion, Alma the Younger preached to the very people he had persecuted. Speaking from personal experience, he asked his people, "Have ye spiritually been born of God? Have ye received his image in your countenances?<i>Have ye experienced this mighty change in your hearts?"</i>(Alma 5:14; emphasis added). In the same sermon he reminded his people of the goodness of God toward their fathers, saying, "Behold,<i>he changed their hearts;</i>yea, he awakened them out of a deep sleep, and they awoke unto God" (Alma 5:7; emphasis added).<br><br>The parallels between the young man in my department and Alma's conversion and teachings are evident. John underwent a<i>physical</i>change of heart and was spared from premature death. Alma preached of our need for a<i>symbolic</i>change of heart, with the certain safety from<i>spiritual</i>death. The Book of Mormon refers to the heart 162 times--nearly every third page. Most of these references are in the context of the heart's need for the healing and strengthening power of repentance.<br><br>The spiritual cardiomyopathy I have described exists in various degrees among us. Although all of us suffer from day to day, some are affected in such a way that it seriously limits their spiritual quality of life. And as was the case with John's diseased heart, if treatment is not sought, the effects are fatal. Sadly, those suffering from physical heart disease are not always treated effectively, but the Lord has provided a treatment against spiritual heart disease--a treatment that is always effective, if followed.<br><br>Please don't confuse the emphasis placed on being cleansed and healed through the process of repentance with a tolerance for the transgressions that prompted the need. It is always better to make the choice<i>not</i>to sin. Prospective missionaries were warned in conference priesthood session several years ago that adopting the attitude of "sowing one's wild oats" with the intention of repenting prior to leaving for the mission field was not sincere repentance. To use the heart transplant analogy, adopting such an attitude would be similar to repeatedly exposing ourselves to physical harm, all the while counting on the availability of an organ replacement when finally our careless living caused life-threatening damage. The Lord has warned against procrastinating the day of our repentance. Although true repentance heals us completely of the disease caused by sin, we cannot replace the time spent without the Spirit of the Lord, its accompanying joy, and the good we might have accomplished during that time.<br><br>We recognize, then, that to avoid sin is always the correct route. However, we are human and sometimes succumb to temptation. We must then submit ourselves to the repentance treatment to which I have alluded. One of the classic seminary scripture mastery verses underlines this:<br><br><i>For the natural man is an enemy to God, and has been from the fall of Adam, and will be, forever and ever, unless he yields to the enticings of the Holy Spirit, and putteth off the natural man and becometh a saint through the atonement of Christ the Lord,</i>and becometh as a child,<i>submissive, meek, humble, patient, full of love, willing to submit to all things which the Lord seeth fit to inflict upon him, even as a child doth submit to his father.</i>[Mosiah 3:19; emphasis added]<br><br>Just as John prepared during the months preceding his life-changing transplant surgery, this scripture illustrates the preparation for spiritual surgery that brings about a change of heart. Repentance is therapeutic and restores one's heart to its youthful purity and childlike vigor.<br><br>The story of Alma the Younger's change of heart illustrates well both the<i>process</i>and the<i>product</i>of repentance. Recall that the sons of Mosiah were involved in the persecution of the members of the Church with Alma the Younger, and they, too, were visited by the angel. (Incidentally, their names were Ammon, Aaron, Omner, and Himni. So deep was their change of heart that when the people needed a new king, they chose Aaron--previously one of their fierce persecutors. Further, after the decision was made to elect judges rather than to be ruled by a king, the people elected Alma the Younger--again, formerly one of their persecutors.)<br><br>After the sons of Mosiah's conversion, they sought and were granted permission to go on missions to the Lamanites, where they labored for 14 years. (I wonder: How many of them had girlfriends who waited?)<br><br>It was during this mission that Ammon requested of the Lamanite king Lamoni that he serve in his stables. After valiantly protecting the king's flocks, Ammon had the opportunity to teach the king the gospel and to witness his miraculous conversion, as well as the conversion of his entire court. The king decreed that Ammon and his missionary brethren be allowed to preach in all the land. In Alma 23 we are told that, as a result of the missionary efforts of Ammon and his brethren, thousands of the Lamanites were brought to the truth, had their hearts healed by the Lord's redemptive power, and gave up their indolent lifestyles. Wanting to distinguish themselves from the Lamanites, the converted king and his subjects took upon themselves the name Anti-Nephi-Lehies.<br><br>In contrast to Ammon's missionary success, the other sons of Mosiah met with resistance in neighboring cities with the Amalekites and Amulonites, who, the scriptures say, hardened their hearts and refused to believe they had need to repent. Clearly they had need for spiritual surgery but chose not to add their names to the heart-transplant waiting list. Instead, these wicked Lamanites marshaled the help of the remaining unconverted Lamanites in the land to wage war against the Anti-Nephi-Lehies. In Alma 24 the king related their conversion story and described the steps of their repentance. King Lamoni spoke of being convinced of their sins, signifying recognition of their wrongdoing; of having the guilt taken from their hearts, indicating the feeling of godly sorrow and remorse; and of covenanting never to take up their swords again, suggesting a resolve to never sin again (see Alma 24:7–17). (My son Brandon is serving a mission in France. In his departing talk given in sacrament meeting, he described the will to completely turn from sin. Quoting a great man--well, Yoda--he said, "Try not. Do or do not. There is no try.")<br><br>What were the fruits of the converted Lamanites' repentance? Those who had undergone this change of heart made a covenant with the Lord that they would never shed blood again, and they buried their weapons of war (as opposed to hiding them under the bed or on a shelf in the closet, "just in case"). So great was their commitment to forsake their sins that they prostrated themselves before the wicked Lamanites as they came upon them with weapons in hand. One thousand and five of them were slain without offering resistance. Now perhaps we would have the faith to sacrifice our<i>own</i>lives in testimony of the conversion we have experienced, but can you imagine the pain of watching your parents, brothers, and sisters being slain at your side? I think of the ultimate faith in the Savior that would require of me if this were to happen to my wife and children.<br><br>The image of the Anti-Nephi-Lehies kneeling and prepared to die brings to mind a recent, powerful example of similar spiritual resolve: the young woman in Littleton, Colorado, who was killed because she would not deny her belief in God. Such bold expressions of faith require a vision into eternity that I'm afraid I don't yet possess.<br><br>King Benjamin described this radical change of heart in his classic discourse to the people of Zarahemla. Before his death he assembled his people near the temple for his final counsel. His subjects were people like you and me--"ancient-day Saints" who had been baptized, who were making a living, who were raising their families, etc. So powerful was the effect of his preaching that all of the people signed their names as a covenant to keep the commandments.<br><br>Mosiah 5:2 indicates that the Spirit of the Lord had wrought a mighty change in them--or in their hearts. They had "no more disposition to do evil, but to do good continually." If I were to ask what a synonym might be for the word<i>disposition</i>in these verses, you would probably respond with the word<i>desire.</i>But that response would only be partially correct. Synonyms for<i>disposition</i>include<i>temperament, character,</i>and<i>personality.</i>Our desires come and go, often in relation to our environment, but character and personality are more permanent, more fundamental to the makeup of our soul. The change of heart we seek that accompanies true repentance actually brings a change of appetite for sin. Our likes and dislikes relative to good and evil are shaped by the Atonement. We learn not only to avoid the sin but the temptation to sin as well. There is no earthly entity that has this power to change our temperament. Wars are fought trying to bend people's wills and loyalties, but only the Savior can transform within us something so fundamental as our character and our appetites.<br><br>There are other traits shared by those who have experienced a change of heart. Let me illustrate several that I have observed.<br><br>Those who have undergone a change of heart exhibit also a change of life and of lifestyle. My friend John's life and lifestyle has been permanently changed because of his heart transplant. Some activities must be part of his daily routine, and others are to be forever avoided. The same is true of spiritual heart-transplant recipients. The Book of Mormon illustrates this beautifully with a "before" and "after" picture of the Lamanites. Enos described the Lamanites<i>before</i>their spiritual transplant in this way:<br><br><i>And I bear record that the people of Nephi did seek diligently to restore the Lamanites unto the true faith in God. But our labors were vain; their hatred was fixed, and they were led by their evil nature that they became wild, and ferocious, and a blood-thirsty people, full of idolatry and filthiness; feeding upon beasts of prey; dwelling in tents, and wandering about in the wilderness with a short skin girdle about their loins and their heads shaven; and their skill was in the bow, and in the cimeter, and the ax. And many of them did eat nothing save it was raw meat; and they were continually seeking to destroy us.</i>[Enos 1:20]<br><br>Can you imagine being called to a mission full of a people with such characteristics?<i>After</i>their conversion, the Lamanites (or Anti-Nephi-Lehies) were quite different, as described in Alma 24. The Anti-Nephi-Lehies were<br><br><i>distinguished for their zeal towards God, and also towards men; for they were perfectly honest and upright in all things; and they were firm in the faith of Christ, even unto the end.</i><br><br><i>And they did look upon shedding the blood of their brethren with the greatest abhorrence.</i>[Alma 27:27–28]<br><br><i>They took their swords, and all the weapons which were used for the shedding of man's blood, and they did bury them up deep in the earth.</i><br><br><i>And this they did, it being in their view a testimony to God, and also to men, that they never would use weapons again for the shedding of man's blood . . . ; and rather than spend their days in idleness they would labor abundantly with their hands.</i>[Alma 24:17–18]<br><br>The change of life and lifestyle that accompanies conversion is seen in our preparation for temple worship. There are 15 questions by which we certify our eligibility to attend the temple. The first four questions relate to our testimony of the Godhead, Jesus Christ as our Redeemer, the restoration of the gospel through the Prophet Joseph Smith, and the existence of a living prophet who holds priesthood keys and pronounces the Lord's will today. If our witness of these four key truths is strong enough, we will modify our lives such that we can respond affirmatively to the remaining questions, which test our commitment to chaste living, the law of tithing, the Word of Wisdom, honesty, the keeping of covenants, and the principle of continued repentance. Again, a change of heart brings a change of both life<i>and</i>lifestyle.<br><br>To remain healthy, those who submit to a spiritual heart transplant need the surgeon's watchful care forever after. John will undergo regular, frequent visits to the doctor to check the condition of his transplanted heart. He recognizes this as a necessary part of the "package," one to which he willingly submits to enjoy the simple blessing of life itself. Similarly, we who seek a spiritual change of heart must rely forever after on the Savior, who alone performs the sacred surgery in our change of heart. Only he can keep the changed heart beating strongly, can prevent further disease from creeping in, and can provide the guidance for the proper diet and exercise for the soul. We must rely on Christ's continued care to enjoy a healthy spiritual lifestyle.<br><br>Our outward being changes as we undergo this change inside. While serving in a campus bishopric several years ago, I became acquainted with a young woman who had become mired in serious sin. When she first reported to us, her appearance was disheveled and grubby, and she was wearing tattered jeans and a flannel shirt. Her posture was poor, her shoulders were curved, and her head was bent in shame. Her face, which rarely wore a smile, was veiled by uncombed hair. But the impression she radiated even more vividly was that she<i>felt</i>"vile," which was obviously manifest in her person and demeanor. As described in Isaiah and repeated in 2 Nephi, in the lives of the unrighteous, "the show of their countenance doth witness against them" (2 Nephi 13:9).<br><br>This young woman was suffering from a severe form of the kind of heart disease I have discussed today. After nearly a year of her working closely with the bishop, I was struck by her transformation. Her repentance had borne fruit, and her heart had been purged of the painful sin she had carried at our first meeting. Wearing a beautiful, modest dress and with her shoulders and head erect and her hair drawn back from her smiling face, she spoke with humble confidence. Her purity showed in her eyes as she took on a brilliance she didn't have before her "transplant surgery and recovery." The changes in a person's life who has undergone sincere repentance are often so dramatic that they are noticeable on the outside.<br><br>Perhaps this is what Alma was referring to, in part, when he asked if we had been spiritually reborn and if we had received the image of God in our countenances (see Alma 5:14). Two years ago a neighbor of mine, Val Hale, who is the associate athletic director at BYU, was in Albuquerque, New Mexico, with the basketball team for the WAC championship tournament. Other WAC teams were playing there, and while the New Mexico team was competing, Brother Hale noticed their cheerleaders. Two of them were, as he described, "different" from the others. After the game, these two New Mexico cheerleaders lingered near the BYU team players. Besides the obvious reasons for doing so, Brother Hale discovered that the cheerleaders were members of the Church.<br><br>Several nights later, in El Paso, Texas, the New Mexico team was playing again, and their cheerleaders were there as well. Brother Hale, seated next to another LDS man, said to him, "Two of those New Mexico cheerleaders are LDS. Can you tell which two they are?" The man looked briefly at the cheer squad and said confidently, "That one, and that one," pointing correctly to the two LDS young women. A healthy heart gives light to our countenances.<br><br>Those undergoing spiritual cleansing are softened in their interactions with others. They make better home and visiting teachers. They are less apt to be critical of those around them, looking for the good instead of the faults. They see and seize opportunities to serve more readily. They are more patient and less quick to anger. (I have noticed that when I am truly seeking spiritual health, I am able to be more restrained in what can be for me most un-Christian behavior--such as when I'm behind the wheel of my car in heavy traffic.) In short, the change of heart brings the Savior's hand into every facet of our lives "at all times and in all things, and in all places that ye may be in, even until death" (Mosiah 18:9).<br><br>I hasten to clarify that, unlike John's heart transplant surgery that required only 87 minutes, a spiritual change of heart is a lifelong process. When I was young I wondered why I couldn't be converted so quickly and have my unrighteous desires swept from me in the blink of an eye. Although Alma the Younger's experience with the angel brought a dramatic change in him in the space of just two days and nights, his conversion was a process requiring patience and perseverance. Somewhere between nine and 17 years after the angel appeared to him, Alma was preaching the gospel to the people of Zarahemla. As he bore his testimony he indicated that he knew the doctrine he preached to be true. And how did he know? Not even mentioning the appearance of the angel, Alma explained:<br><br><i>Behold, I testify unto you that I do know that these things whereof I have spoken are true. And how do ye suppose that I know of their surety?</i><br><br><i>Behold, I say unto you they are made known unto me by the Holy Spirit of God. Behold, I have fasted and prayed many days that I might know these things of myself. And now</i>[as opposed to the time immediately following the angel's appearance]<i>I do know of myself that they are true; for the Lord God hath made them manifest unto me by his Holy Spirit</i>[not necessarily by the voice of the angel];<i>and this is the spirit of revelation which is in me.</i>[Alma 5:45–46]<br><br>We must not become discouraged if we do not receive the witness and the associated change of heart overnight. A friend and colleague recently shared with me an experience illustrating this. His father was born in the Church and was influential in his mother's conversion to the gospel. He was faithful as his children were born and grew up, and he participated in Church service, home teaching, and his sons' Aaronic Priesthood ordinations. He fully supported his sons' goals to go on missions. Nevertheless, while his oldest son--my colleague--was serving a mission, this good man somehow drifted into inactivity. Because some aspects of his life were out of harmony with the commandments, he felt unworthy and unwelcome at Church. His alienation from the Church continued after my friend returned from his mission, and, sadly, he was not present when my friend and his wife were sealed in the temple. Several years into their marriage, my colleague was facing decisions regarding professional direction and financial concerns and was struggling somewhat spiritually himself. He summoned the courage to ask his inactive father for a priesthood blessing. After a long pause his father responded, "I'd like to give you a blessing, but I need to get right first."<br><br>Life went on for both father and son, and the priesthood blessing was not mentioned again. The son's request for a blessing was perhaps the first in a series of events over a considerable period of time that eventually brought his father back into full activity. Among others, experiences that touched this man's heart included the wake-up call of a life-threatening health problem and a risky corrective surgery, the attention of loving and responsive priesthood leaders, and frequent visits from home teachers who challenged him. Slowly, surely, this man returned to the principles of the gospel and to Church. Some 10 years after that request for a priesthood blessing, with the request long since forgotten by my colleague, his father humbly approached him and said, "I'm ready to give you that blessing now, if you're still interested." The ensuing blessing was worth the work and the wait. Barely two years later my friend's father passed away. The transforming power offered in the Atonement is time-tested and is often time-intensive.<br><br>Is this difficult process of repentance worth the anguish and pain, as Alma described it? If one were to ask my friend John if his heart transplant was worth the trouble, how do you think he would respond? He is delighted to be alive and enjoying a full measure of happiness. When I spoke to him recently, he was not preoccupied by the careful avoidance of dangerous activities, the daily round of medication, or the invisible tether between him and his doctor. Instead, his greatest worry right now is the challenge he and his wife are facing potty-training their three-year-old.<br><br>Alma, in describing his repentance to his son Helaman, declared, "Yea, I say unto you, my son, that there could be nothing so exquisite and so bitter as were my pains." A description then followed of the emotion of his forgiveness: "Yea, and again I say unto you, my son, that on the other hand, there can be nothing so exquisite and sweet as was my joy" (Alma 36:21). The difficult road of repentance not only cleanses us and prepares us to live with God in the hereafter but also offers us hearts swollen with joy beyond description in this life.<br><br>Starting or "jump-starting" the process toward a change of heart can be motivated by a variety of experiences. Alma's transformation began with something as magnificent as the visit of an angel. While I was serving as a bishop on campus, a young man sought help after years of enslaving sin because, in his words to me, "you knew my name." Friends, parents, even casual acquaintances sometimes ignite our desire to seek a change of heart. We never know how we might influence others in this lifelong and life-changing process. However the Lord chooses to help us get started, our change of heart is granted as we demonstrate our hunger for it in a sustained way. Samuel the Lamanite described how the transformation continues. In speaking to the wicked Nephites, he stated succinctly:<br><br><i>As many . . . as are brought to the knowledge of the truth . . . and are led to believe . . . the prophecies of the holy prophets . . . , which leadeth them to faith on the Lord, and unto repentance,</i>which faith and repentance bringeth a change of heart unto them--<br><br><i>Therefore, as many as have come to this . . . are firm and steadfast in the faith.</i>[Helaman 15:7; emphasis added]<br><br>May we study the words of the prophets. Truly studying and living their teachings cultivates faith in Jesus Christ. Faith always leads to repentance, and a change of heart follows. The depth of the Savior's atoning power in our hearts is governed by the degree to which we study and follow the words of his prophets, ancient and modern. The formula as outlined is simple and is guaranteed.<br><br>In conclusion, I cite the case of a young man who had undergone a long and difficult repentance process. I asked him to describe how the Atonement had affected him. He thoughtfully characterized his change of heart this way: "This is not religion anymore; it's life." That same realization has filled me as I have sincerely repented of wrongdoing and sought a change of heart. Christ promises to those who repent that "though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow" (Isaiah 1:18). We will experience the exquisite joy spoken of by Alma as we receive the Lord's forgiveness.<br><br>I witness that God lives and answers our prayers; that his Son, Jesus Christ, is the Savior and Redeemer of the world; that his Church with authority and truth has been restored to the earth; and that President Gordon B. Hinckley stands as the prophet today. I testify that a change of heart brings real changes to heart and life--for I have witnessed it in others and experienced in myself that miracle--in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Brent W.

<h1>ibles of Eternal Identity - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
A foundation of self-knowledge about our divine identity is critical to us. And it appears to be critical to God, since he wants us back: "For behold, this is my work and my glory--to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man" (Moses 1:39). God spends a great deal of time talking about our divine identity through his prophets in the scriptures. In fact, he communicates his love of our individual differences in a number of ways. Witness the canon of scripture in the synoptic Gospels of Matthew, Mark, and Luke. They tell essentially the same story of the divinity of Jesus Christ. But, oh, how important these disciples' individual testimonies are! How uniquely different each is from the other in emphasizing certain aspects of the Savior's life. How wonderfully suited they are to different audiences--whether Gentile or Jew, male or female, rich or poor. This is just one small testament that God values us individually. Our identity--individual and unique and universally inspiring--is no accident of nature. We have been organized by God to fulfill his plan and, if we are faithful, to fill the very measure of our creation (see D&amp;amp;C 88:19).<br><br>There is a rich source of data from a number of disciplines about who we are as humans. From literature, Walt Whitman's "A Song of Joys" begins: "O to make the most jubilant song! / Full of music--full of manhood, womanhood, infancy! / Full of common employments--full of grain and trees." William Shakespeare's Hamlet recites, "What a piece of work is man, how noble in reason, how infinite in faculties, in form and moving how express and admirable, in action how like an angel, in apprehension how like a God" (<i>Hamlet,</i>act 2, scene 2). We find our human majesty reflected in the inspiring works of Michelangelo or our own Minerva Teichert, in the symphonies of Aaron Copland or Beethoven, and in the sonatas of Clara Schumann. An impressive body of research and theory from the sciences informs us in a different way from the arts about the particularities of mortals. Sociologists, psychologists, philosophers, biologists, physicists, chemists, and others educate us about this enormously complex species: humans.<br><br>Each discipline's contribution to our understanding of our true identity, though impressive, is still puny in comparison to God's perspective. Those man-made sources of our identity that are most reliable are those that testify to us of our true natures, our divine selves. This knowledge of selfhood must be guided by the precepts of God, not of man. As a psychologist, I am hopelessly narrow in my scope about what to attend to when it comes to the study of individuals. But as a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, I am broadened by Heavenly Father's expansive vision of us, and I am filled with joy about the possibility that I could possess "the peace of God, which passeth all understanding" (Philippians 4:7). If I am obedient, I can count myself as one of his disciples--a most amazing premise for identity.<br><br>We are individually unique. Can you even imagine an intellect so large that it can keep track of the sands on the seashore or the very hairs of our head, which "are all numbered," according to Luke 12:7. After all, there are a lot of beaches on the planet, and there have been a lot of us humans born since the beginning of earthly time. But the scriptures testify of our uniqueness, and even though I cannot conceptualize God's capacity to have created this, I have faith it is true. God reminded us through the words he spoke to the Prophet Joseph:<br><br><i>Behold, ye are little children and ye cannot bear all things now; ye must grow in grace and in the knowledge of the truth.</i><br><br><i>Fear not, little children, for you are mine, and I have overcome the world, and you are of them that my Father hath given me;</i><br><br><i>And none of them that my Father hath given me shall be lost.</i><br><br><i>And the Father and I are one.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 50:40–43]<br><br>That our identities are indeed eternal and unique means that godhood really can be our goal. God doesn't want fawning minions; he wants clearly identified individuals who of their own accord have come to him. My colleague Allen Bergin and I are working on a chapter on this very topic of identity. It is a tall order, but I have been enormously enriched by working alongside him as we subsume what we have learned from years of being psychologists within the expansive and beautiful gospel framework. Allen has spent a great deal of his career forwarding the cause of spirituality in the discipline of psychology and promoting religion as healthy rather than harmful. There are many who believe that being religious means you are neurotic! Dr. Bergin has an international presence because of his humble persistence in this matter.<br><br>In our chapter we identify the elements of the eternal identity and make distinctions between what Allen has labeled the "mortal overlay" and the "preexistent character." I like this characterization because it reminds me of a poster we used to refer to in Young Women: "You are not a human being having a spiritual experience; you are a spiritual being having a mortal experience." As Allen states:<br><br><i>Although we inherit or acquire weaknesses through the mortal overlay, our eternal spirits carry with them into mortality characteristics from the preexistence. These inclinations may be obvious or subtle, just as talents may be manifest or latent. . . . It is a continuing task in the development of self-knowledge to determine whether a given disposition comes from premortality or from mortality, and it is our responsibility to change it, if negative, or magnify it if positive. In this quest it is equally important to remember that regardless of past spiritual history, "Every spirit of man was innocent in the beginning" (D&amp;amp;C 93:38).</i>[Allen E. Bergin and Sally H. Barlow, manuscript in preparation, "Identity," in Allen E. Bergin, ed.,<i>LDS Perspectives and Psychology</i>]<br><br>We carry the spark of divinity within us. Peter taught that we may become "partakers of the divine nature" (2 Peter 1:4). Alma, speaking of being born of God, asked, "Have ye received his image in your countenances?" (Alma 5:14). And Jeremiah's words remind us powerfully of how God wishes to be part of us: "I will put my law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts; and will be their God, and they shall be my people" (Jeremiah 31:33).<br><br>Our identity as his people encourages us to be individually strong, communally expansive. As a sociologist, Rodney Stark concluded one of his articles saying, "After a hiatus of fourteen hundred years, in our time a new world faith seems to be stirring" ("Modernization and Mormon Growth," in Marie Cornwall, Tim B. Heaton, and Lawrence A. Young, eds.,<i>Contemporary Mormonism: Social Science Perspectives</i>[Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 1994], p. 22). The power of just who we were to become as a people apparently stretched out in a vision toward a priest in Switzerland in 1739. One of my wonderful Laurels introduced me to this interesting quote. It goes something like this:<br><br><i>The old and true gospel and gifts thereof are lost. False doctrine prevails in all the churches on the face of the earth. All we can do is to exhort the people to be just, fear God, shun evil, and pray. Prayer and purity may cause an angel to visit a deep and distressed soul. But I tell you that God in one hundred years will have again spoken. He will restore the old church again. I see a little band of people led by a prophet and faithful leader. They are persecuted, burned out, and murdered. But in a valley that lies on the shore of a great lake they will build a great city and make a beautiful land, have a temple of magnificent splendor, and also possess the old priesthood with apostles, prophets, deacons, and teachers. From every nation shall the true believers be gathered by speedy messengers. And then shall the Almighty God speak to the disobedient nations with thunder, lightning, and destruction such as men have never known before.</i>[Attributed to Samuel Lutz, alias Christophilus Gratianus or Lutius Grationa, in<i>Hope of Zion</i>in the university library in Basel, Switzerland. There are several versions of this quote of disputed origins; see http://www.geocities.com/heartland/Valley/3599/gratius.html; also see www.restorationhistory.com/rh/bom.html under The 1739 "Prediction"]<br><br>Our group identity is strong (1) because of God's identity--he has stamped himself on our very souls--(2) because of Joseph Smith's courage as a young man, and (3) because of the love and service of our prophets and leaders from the days of Brigham Young and Eliza R. Snow to the present day. The pure in heart are being drawn to this religion by the thousands. The recent Women's Conference on campus attested to this. Gladys Knight's testimony in word and song is an example of just one voice among many that is singing praises to our God. Our group identity is more than just an aggregate though--it is the enormous personal power of your individual identities.<br><h2><b>The Crucibles of Identity</b></h2><br>Our prophets have reminded us that this mortal estate is a school to learn how to be gods and goddesses, having increase and creating worlds while giving all glory to the Father. I would like to suggest that crucibles are one way in which we move toward eternity--connecting our premortal, mortal, and postmortal identities. One of the definitions of a crucible is "a severe test or trial, esp. one that causes a lasting change or influence" (<i>Random House Webster's</i>[1995], s.v. "crucible"). There is clearly some type of critical transformation that occurs. Metallurgy uses the term to refer to a process of extreme heat. Since God is the greatest catalyst of our transformation--perhaps the divine metallurgist of men and women--his plan represents the greatest of crucibles. If we are to become like him, we must go through this sometimes excruciating refiner's fire.<br><br>How do we survive this fire? First, with faith--faith in God the Father and in his Son Jesus Christ and in the Holy Ghost. We must have faith that we are known. Paul said, "For now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face: now I know in part; but then shall I know even as also I am known" (1 Corinthians 13:12). Truman G. Madsen said in his recent Women's Conference talk, "We are most blessed when we see ourselves as we are seen by Him" ("The Savior, the Sacrament, and Self-Worth," BYU Women's Conference, 29 April 1999). Because he knows us, he knows the best way for us to proceed. This is why obedience is the next important skill with which to successfully emerge from the potential crush of crucibles.<br><br>God is easier to obey because he has the proper authority. The philosopher Hans-Georg Gadamer said that the one with authority is understood to have superior judgment and insight to oneself. "Authority in this sense, properly understood, has nothing to do with blind obedience to commands" (<i>Truth and Method,</i>translation revised by Joel C. Weinsheimer and Donald G. Marshall [New York: Continuum, 1998], p. 279). And the Prophet Joseph told us:<br><br><i>As God has designed our happiness--and the happiness of all His creatures, he never has--He never will institute an ordinance or give a commandment to His people that is not calculated in its nature to promote that happiness which He has designed, and which will not end in the greatest amount of good and glory to those who become the recipients of his law and ordinances.</i>[<i>HC</i>5:135]<br><br>So we need faith, obedience, and the next important skill--repentance--for those times we are unable or unwilling to be obedient. All of these skills increase our capacity to love, which, according to Paul, is the final goal.<br><br>For some of us obedience is not difficult. For others it is the bane of their existence! When I feel a disobedient attitude swelling up inside of me, I am reminded of George MacDonald's words: "The one principle of Hell is 'I am my own'" (in Tony Castle, ed.,<i>The New Book of Christian Quotations</i>[New York: Crossroad, 1983], p. 112). Our general response to authority can truly test us, especially when authorities are fallible. But God is not fallible. Although for others obedience to authority is not troublesome, repentance might be because it is hard to humble ourselves and admit mistakes. For others of us, relationships and love might be the struggle. We must remember that one of the clear underlying principles of the notion of a crucible is that it is our own test. What is a test for me may not be a test for you. If we consider some of the more common crucibles that many of us encounter, they could be categorized within crucibles of context and crucibles of character.<br><h2><b>Crucibles of Context: Influences of Culture and Environment</b></h2><br>There are many definitions for<i>culture,</i>including but not limited to intellectual and aesthetic pursuits and molds that grow in laboratories. But I am particularly interested in the following definitions: "the sum total of ways of living built up by a group of human beings and transmitted from one generation to another" and "the behaviors and beliefs characteristic of a particular social, ethnic, or age group" (<i>Random House Webster's,</i>1995, s.v. "culture").<br><br>We start out in these cultures with them being stepping-stones of safety. Cultural groups are comfortable and familiar--and bounded. The kingdom of God is not. How do I become aware of individual cultures and their collective influences? Since God could have organized our mortal estate in any way he wished, we must assume that each step of development is for a divine purpose. We crawl generally before we walk. We babble before we talk. We learn basic concepts--from language grammar to mathematical addition to musical scales--before we learn the more advanced skills of essay writing, figuring differential equations, and composition. Yet each skill, predicated on the last, is incomplete still. There is more. While I learn loyalty to my family, I also learn how to leave my family to make my own family. I attempt to manage the elements of being female first by accepting this gender assignment and believing that God, in fact, organized our spirits into male and female from the very beginning. Then I work on the refinements of being a woman--not to celebrate it above the other gender but to potentially create a perfect union. Each incomplete skill pushes us by its very incompleteness toward perfection: "When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child: but when I became a man, I put away childish things" (1 Corinthians 13:11).<br><br>In this same vein I learn to let love of country exist as a basis not for extreme nationalism but as a foundation from which to prepare for the kingdom of God. For those of us who are from the American culture, there are wonderful, in fact, inspired facets of being a United States citizen. It is interesting that the French statesman de Tocqueville coined the term<i>individualism</i>to denote this unique quality of Americans. But those of us who have the privilege of being United States citizens must make sure this individualism does not turn to self-centered provincialism. My graduate student Dianne Nielsen shared with me the following statement called<i>A Summary of the World,</i>found in various versions on the Internet:<br><br><i>If we could at this time shrink the earth's population to a village of precisely 100 people, with all existing human ratios remaining the same, it would look like this:</i><br><br><i>There would be 57 Asians, 21 Europeans, 14 from the Western Hemisphere (north and south), and 8 Africans;</i><br><br><i>51 would be female, 49 male;</i><br><br><i>70 would be non-white, 30 white;</i><br><br><i>70 would be non-Christian, 30 Christian;</i><br><br><i>50 percent of the entire world wealth would be in the hands of only 6 people, and all 6 would be citizens of the United States;</i><br><br><i>70 would be unable to read;</i><br><br><i>50 would suffer from malnutrition;</i><br><br><i>80 would live in substandard housing;</i><br><br><i>1 would be near death, 1 would be near birth;</i><br><br><i>Only 1 would have a college education;</i><br><br><i>When one considers our world from such a compressed perspective,</i>[those of you sitting here are part of that one person].<br><br>The Church started out in the United States for divine reasons. This is good, but now we are a worldwide church! If you thought for one second your behavior was keeping someone from embracing the gospel, you would change it. There are cultural things some of us do as American Mormons that unwittingly have this impact on others. In the clinical psychology graduate program we have the opportunity to train "foreign" and "domestic," LDS and non-LDS students representing a number of nations, races, and both genders. I asked a number of those who had not come from this culture to comment on it. We can often learn much about ourselves with these kinds of exercises. Research on majority/minority group behavior corroborates this, suggesting that the minority group knows more about the majority group than the majority knows about itself. For instance, in corporate America, black or African-American workers can accurately portray patterns of behavior and attitude about their white coworkers that the white or Caucasian workers are somewhat oblivious to. My colleague Dr. Kate Kirkham, an international consultant to business on the issue of diversity, has spent a career corroborating this notion and has created an excellent paradigm to elucidate it.<br><br>When I invited these graduate student "outsiders" to comment on good and not-so-good things about Americans as well as about the Mormon culture, here is what they said: Good things about North American culture include lightheartedness, a sense of justice, and the fact that anything can be accomplished by anyone with will and determination. Less attractive things include wastefulness of natural resources, selfishness, and not valuing older people.<br><br>What about the Mormon culture? Good things include an admirable history of perseverance, commitment to its own faith, and industriousness. Not-so-good things are an apparent mistrusting of human nature and exclusiveness. As "insiders," we might consider how it is that we possibly contribute to these perceptions. Cultural behavior often clouds doctrinal truths and can keep others from coming to Christ.<br><br>The clinical students attempt to learn about their own cultures by keeping journals. My students tell me the ways they have changed as they have engaged in journal keeping and other exercises that make them aware of their "-isms" (racism, materialism, sexism, etc.).<br><br>Normally we move along the continuum of identity formation from identification to imitation to empathy, but we are often halted at the level of identification because something about the "other group" annoys, frightens, or even disgusts us. We are unwilling to consider how the other gender, another race, a different ethnicity, or someone in simply another set of circumstances might feel because it seems so out of our experience or comfort zone. This stops us from knowing them and eventually from knowing all of the parts of ourselves. And it keeps us from being as potent with each other as we could be.<br><br>For instance, our clinical psychology students work with male sex offenders at the prison. It takes them a long time to learn how to be effective therapists--not simply because the culture of the prison is sometimes built on punishment rather than rehabilitation, but also because the students are understandably appalled at the nature of these crimes. But after a while they begin to see what motivated some of these people to do the things they did. Notice I am not saying they agree with the behavior. They begin to understand it, and part of this understanding is based upon accepting the "natural man" instincts inside themselves--recognizing that all of us house the potential for inappropriate aggression and sexual expression. This acceptance often comes by way of dreams that inform them about what it must be like to be these incarcerated men. Although they are shocked at first, they learn to use this knowledge to make a difference with these inmates so they are less likely to reoffend. If the Lord himself "descended below all things" to atone for us (D&amp;amp;C 88:6), if he understood the needs of all of us--including all manner of evil and every failing we would ever be capable of--might we, too, need to consider that such empathy is required of all of us eventually?<br><br>God has told us that we must all overcome the natural man in us. Perhaps along with appetites and lusts, this also includes forms of subtle hatred and the smugness of superiority. These are uncomfortable to notice. Here is an excerpt from one white Mormon student's journal when she volunteered in Zimbabwe. I quote with her permission: "Most of all I fear my own racist attitude. . . . The test here is for whites not to abuse their perceived authority. I say perceived because God is the true authority. We must have righteous treatment of all people."<br><br>We all possess at some level various forms of discrimination toward the other gender, other races, and even other IQ categories. You in this audience are at the high end of the normal curve when it comes to IQ. Rather than pretend this isn't so because of discomfort, we need to let it be what it is and use it for good. Because it is so uncomfortable for some of us to notice many of these cultural influences, we sometimes project unwanted parts of ourselves onto other groups, who then "bear" the burden of these traits for us. Paul stated:<br><br><i>Charity envieth not; charity vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up.</i><br><br><i>Doth not behave itself unseemly, seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked, thinketh no evil;</i><br><br><i>Rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in the truth.</i>[1 Corinthians 13:4–6]<br><br>Luke wrote, "Why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye, but perceivest not the beam that is in thine own eye?" (6:41).<br><br>Joseph Smith had a great way of doing this difficult work. Jesse W. Crosby related this story:<br><br><i>I went one day to the Prophet with a sister. She had a charge to make against one of the brethren for scandal. When her complaint had been heard the Prophet asked her if she was quite sure that what the brother had said of her was utterly untrue.</i><br><br><i>She was quite sure that it was.</i><br><br><i>He then told her to think no more about it, for it could not harm her. If untrue it could not live, but the truth will survive. Still she felt that she should have some redress.</i><br><br><i>Then he offered her his method of dealing with such cases for himself. When an enemy had told a scandalous story about him, which had often been done, before he rendered judgment he paused and let his mind run back to the time and place and setting of the story to see if he had not by some unguarded word or act laid the block on which the story was built. If he found that he had done so, he said that in his heart he then forgave his enemy, and felt thankful that he had received warning of a weakness that he had not known he possessed.</i><br><br><i>Then he said to the sister that he would have her to do the same: search her memory thoroughly and see if she had not herself unconsciously laid the foundation for the scandal that annoyed her.</i><br><br><i>The sister thought deeply for a few moments and then confessed that she believed that she had.</i><br><br><i>Then the Prophet told her that in her heart she could forgive that brother who had risked his own good name and her friendship to give her this clearer view of herself.</i><br><br><i>The sister thanked her advisor and went away in peace.</i>[In Hyrum L. and Helen Mae Andrus, comps.,<i>They Knew the Prophet</i>(Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Company, 1999), pp. 162–63]<br><br>As a culture, we want to be able to reduce those traits that turn people away from us. Perhaps we could use the Prophet Joseph's model so that we don't become a provincial people, isolated geographically and intellectually. We want the hope that we possess to shine so brightly that others cannot help but be drawn to it. We can be comforted to know, however, that the truth will prevail no matter if, as individuals, we act as clear corridors to the truth or as confusing mazes.<br><h2><b>The Crucibles of Character</b></h2><br>The next set of crucibles are crucibles of character that influence us from within. These are stated in terms of dilemmas or essential tensions and sometimes have to be tolerated while we search for resolution or transcendence.<br><br><i>1. To know thyself versus "no" thyself.</i>On the one hand, we are admonished to know ourselves--to sharpen our countenances upon each other, to become so sure of our inner attitudes and outward behaviors that we are knowable and known. Possessing a sure identity does not mean vain selfishness. But what does it mean? We have been told that to lose ourselves is to find ourselves. We know from scripture it was important that the prodigal son "came to himself" (Luke 15:17). When Moses saw God's universe, he realized man was pretty small, "which thing I never had supposed" (Moses 1:10). These scriptures suggest that it is wise to know ourselves but that we should avoid focusing all energy in this pursuit by also focusing on others.<br><br><i>2. The pursuit of perfection versus competition.</i>Competition is a tough concept to consider--especially in college. Let's start with a good lesson from D&amp;amp;C 7. The Lord responded to a request from Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery to confirm if the disciple John tarried in the flesh. In the Lord's inimitable way, he gave an entirely different lesson to them by revealing the interaction that took place between Peter and John. The Lord had told the two disciples that he would grant the wish of their heart. Peter asked to come speedily to Christ. John asked to stay in mortality and bring souls to Christ. Peter apparently worried that he had asked for the wrong thing, and Christ said to him, "If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee?" (D&amp;amp;C 7:4). The message is clear: This was not a time to compete.<br><br>There are even more dire consequences regarding certain sins that are often based on competition. Cain's intense jealousy of and competition with Abel is just one such example. What if in<i>The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</i>that mental health professionals use in diagnosis there was a personality disorder called "The remains of Cain in me"--a description of debilitating competitiveness or murderous rage? Competition is part and parcel of being in college, but perhaps we would all be better off if we spent more energy on cooperation and had "an eye single to the glory of God" (D&amp;amp;C 4:5). As Søren Kierkegaard entitled one of his books:<i>The Purity of Heart Is to Will One Thing</i>(New York: Harper and Row, 1938).<br><br>A particular kind of competitiveness or ill-fated search for a distorted form of perfection involves eating disorders. It is a current, critical health crisis for American college-age students--women in particular--despite a vigorous campaign at education. My colleague Dr. Spangler is an expert in this area. Early Celtics used to throw humans into peat bogs to appease their gods. These were apparently human sacrifices made at times of crisis--maybe of famine, war, or weather. We know this because the recently discovered mummified remains were unintentionally preserved by the peat. Perhaps eating disorders are our culture's sacrifices on the altars of the vain gods of beauty and distorted notions of control. We are tossing far too many young women and some young men into this bog. We are not facing the crisis we are having as a society. These are really problems of identity. We must strive not to compete but to be "complete"--the Greek translation of<i>perfect.</i><br><br><i>3. The real self versus the true self.</i>The "real self" is a popular psychological term used in the last several decades based on the body of literature that supports an authentic self. Authenticity is a good thing. But the literature of authenticity is still embedded in the language of mortality. My authentic here and now emotions are to run screaming from this room. I am really nervous. But I have an overriding message coming somewhere from my prefrontal cortex to hang in there. I said I would do this, my parents taught me to be responsible, and my teachers taught me to take risks. I tolerate the tension of these because I know that obligation is more important than mere authenticity.<br><br>The psychologist William James wrote to his wife in 1878:<br><br><i>I have often thought that the best way to define a man's character would be to seek out the particular mental or moral attitude in which, when it came upon him, he felt himself most deeply and intensely active and alive. At such moments there is a voice inside which speaks and says:</i>"This<i>is the real me!"</i>[<i>The Letters of William James,</i>ed. Henry James (Boston: Atlantic Monthly Press, 1920), 1:199; emphasis in original]<br><br>God wants us to be alive in him. If we do not choose him first, whatever we have chosen will keep us from him. Struggling with being real and authentic requires a willingness to be true to God first in order to come to our most true identity as sons and daughters of heavenly parents.<br><br><i>4. The ordinary versus extraordinary.</i>Our context often alters our perception of what is normal or average. For instance, in this audience, how many of you are returned missionaries? Given this number, those of you who are or will be missionaries might think, "Well, it's pretty ordinary that I have been or am going on a mission." But if we set you down in almost any other culture, the fact that so many of you go to the far ends of the earth is quite extraordinary. Fifteen sets of parents from my home ward alone have sent or are about to send their children on missions. My son is one of them. But if just because of the numbers we incorrectly surmised that what we do is always ordinary, we would be making a mistake.<br><br>At the 1998 BYU Women's Conference, Sister Sheri Dew said:<br><br>[Satan]<i>wants us to feel insignificant--that no matter how hard we try, we'll never make much of a difference. Oh, sure, our work is necessary but not very important.</i>That is a big fat lie.<i>It is a diversion designed to keep us so focused on any perceived injustices that we completely overlook the opportunities and privileges that are ours, that we underestimate the vital nature of our contribution, and that we never come to understand the power we have to change lives.</i>[Sheri L. Dew, "This Is a Test. It Is Only a Test," in<i>May Christ Lift Thee Up</i>[Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Company, 1999], p. 195; emphasis in original]<br><br>Keeping in mind our potential divinity but at the same time not becoming over-entitled is a tough balancing act. We have to have the willingness to be at times ordinary and at other times to be extraordinary. This teaches us lessons of humility, of being followers and leaders. One challenge for you individually wonderful students in this huge institution called a university is to emerge unique despite the message large institutions can unwittingly give us that we are only a number. While standing in line to change a class, cash a check, or buy a sandwich, we often get the feeling that we are not unique. Tolerate the essential tension of this extraordinary/ordinary dilemma and remember: You are known by the Father.<br><br>Getting through these various character crucibles further refines our identity. Identity formation is initially enhanced by an outer organization, such as a cultural group, certain clear physical characteristics, etc. But for a deeper identity to emerge, an inner integration must take precedence eventually so that regardless of our exterior, our cultural group, or circumstances, our character or identity comes through. Lorenzo Snow said, "We are the offspring of God, born with the same faculties and powers as He possesses, capable of enlargement through the experience that we are now passing through in our second estate" (<i>Millennial Star</i>56 [December 3, 1894]: 772). Successfully emerging from these crucibles will allow us to be more than mere labels, since as Erin Eldridge reminds us:<br><br><i>Labeling someone as anything other than a disciple of Christ can be damaging. . . .</i><br><br><i>During these last days, the adversary has been trying to convince people that all kinds of trials and weaknesses are permanent. "I am anorexic." "I'm an alcoholic." "I am weak." "I am gay." And all the while stands before us and within us the Great I Am--calling us to something beyond our mortal condition. He reminds us that we were with Him long before we were with the world.</i>[<i>Born That Way?: A True Story of Overcoming Same-Sex Attraction, with Insights for Friends, Families, and Leaders</i>(Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Company, 1994), pp. 42, 53]<br><h2><b>When Crucibles Collide</b></h2><br>Many times these two crucibles of context and character collide in the dark night of the soul. In the scriptures we have accounts of those who were prepared when they came to their crucibles. The most compelling, of course, is that of Christ in Gethsemane. The stories of Moroni, Abish, Anna, Daniel, Esther, and Job also help us. We can become more aware of our own vulnerabilities if we will listen to our colleagues and friends.<br><br>If we foster competition, greed, lust, or hate, our souls may not be able to rise to the challenge of a crucible. Along with the dark night of the human soul, there have been many dark nights of society's soul when individuals' hearts have failed them and they have bent to the will of a group. In these troubled times, who do we follow so that we can have courage?<br><h2><b>Jesus Christ Is the True Example of Perfect Identity</b></h2><br>I am stunned by the personhood of Jesus Christ, the distinctness of him. Regardless of his context or culture (his gender: he was male; his religion: he was a Jew; his region of origin: he was Galilean; or any of the other particularities--his height, color, age), he reached beyond all of these to all of us. He is astonishing. He must have appeared so to the woman in Luke 7 who was so overcome by gratitude to Christ that she overcame custom to show him. She knew the difference between provincialism--or narrow-minded culturalism--and the glory of God's truth that evokes such gratitude in us. Jesus entices us to what I would like to call acts of "theotropism," bending our individual wills toward the light.<br><h2><b>Summary</b></h2><br>As the Christian apologist C. S. Lewis stated:<br><br><i>It is a serious thing to live in a society of possible gods and goddesses, to remember that the dullest and most uninteresting person you talk to may one day be a creature which, if you saw it now, you would be strongly tempted to worship, or else a horror and a corruption such as you now meet, if at all, only in a nightmare. All day long we are, in some degree, helping each other to one or other of these destinations. It is in the light of these overwhelming possibilities, it is with the awe and the circumspection proper to them, that we should conduct all our dealings with one another, all friendships, all loves, all play, all politics. There are no</i>ordinary<i>people. You have never talked to a mere mortal. Nations, cultures, arts, civilization--these are mortal, and their life is to ours as the life of a gnat. But it is immortals whom we joke with, work with, marry, snub, and exploit--immortal horrors or everlasting splendours.</i>[C. S. Lewis,<i>The Weight of Glory and Other Addresses</i>(Grand Rapids, Michigan: Eerdmans, 1965), pp. 14–15; emphasis in original]<br><br>Here we are, an incredible kaleidoscope of humans, gathered in His name at BYU, where faith, obedience, repentance, and love allow us to join in shared discipleship to our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. Crucibles help create these opportunities.<br><br>Recall the words of the song that Charlotte Smurthwaite sang at the beginning of this devotional:<br><br><i>Are there anybody here like Mary a'weepin'? . . .</i><br><i>Are there anybody here like Peter a'sinkin'? . . .</i><br><i>Are there anybody here like jailors a'tremblin'?</i><br>["Weepin' Mary," music composed and traditional text adapted by David Fletcher]<br><br>I submit to you that we have all wept, sunk, and trembled--maybe under the weight of our own sins, from the unwitting problems brought on by misfortune, from inherited struggles that through no fault of our own have wrought havoc in our lives such as bipolar disorder, or from the exercise of someone else's agency against our innocence that has deeply wounded us, such as incest. The answer to all of these as it states in that same song is, "Call to my Jesus and he'll draw nigh." I know this to be true, and I say these things in his holy name. Amen.<br><br><i>Sally H. Barlow was a BYU professor of psychology when this devotional address was given on 8 June 1999.</i><br><br><i>© Brigham Young University. All rights reserved.</i>

<br>
<p>As I was thinking about what I would like to share with you today, I thought that perhaps we could learn from the scriptures and from the prophets and leaders of the Lord&amp;rsquo;s church about the family. This topic came to mind because I realized that I would be speaking to people who are starting, or soon will be starting, that great journey of initiating their own families. Sometimes young people who are beginning this great adventure remind me of the anxious traveler who runs to catch a bus and only when inside and seated thinks to ask, &amp;ldquo;Where is this bus going?&amp;rdquo;<br><p>Perhaps if we can learn a little better the marvelous origin and great destination of the family, we can also learn the manner in which we should come back to our Father in Heaven as a family. As individuals we all travel the same path to the Father, but the roles we assume in our family have different ways of conveying us down that path. And most of the time we have more than one role to fulfill: husband, father, son, wife, mother, or daughter. Each role has different duties&amp;mdash;if you will, a different &amp;ldquo;method of transportation&amp;rdquo; in our journey. We shall speak of these in due time.<br><p>Now let us speak of the origin of the individual and of the family. We believe that the individual bears a special relationship to deity. Each individual born into this world has been the actual spiritual son or daughter of God the Father in the premortal world of spirits.<br><p>The first major step upward made by the uncreated entities was entrance into what we call the first estate. Here the intelligences were tabernacled in bodies of spirit matter by birth through heavenly parents. In November 1909 the First Presidency declared in &amp;ldquo;The Origin of Man&amp;rdquo;: &amp;ldquo;All men and women are in the similitude of the universal Father and Mother, and are literally the sons and daughters of Deity&amp;rdquo; (in James R. Clark, comp., <i>Messages of the First Presidency of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints</i> [Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1965&amp;ndash;75], 4:203).<br><p>God is the actual father of the spiritual bodies possessed at that time. This is not a case of creation but of procreation. Brother B. H. Roberts explained:<br><p><i>I call attention to this distinction that when in our literature we say &amp;ldquo;God created the spirits of men,&amp;rdquo; it is understood that they were &amp;ldquo;begotten.&amp;rdquo; We mean &amp;ldquo;generation,&amp;rdquo;</i> not <i>&amp;ldquo;creation.&amp;rdquo; Intelligences, which are eternal, uncreated, self-existent beings, are begotten spirits and these afterwards begotten men. When intelligences are &amp;ldquo;begotten&amp;rdquo; spirits they are of the nature of him who begets them&amp;mdash;sons of God, and con-substantial with their Father.</i> [<i>The Mormon Doctrine of Deity</i> (Bountiful, Utah: Horizon Publishers, 1975), p. 260; emphasis in original]<br><p>So when we make reference to members of mankind as sons and daughters of God, it is not a symbolic term. Our Heavenly Father is the actual father of the spiritual bodies of mankind.<br><p>In this spiritual body can be found latent powers inherited from the divine parents. These powers await maturation, education, training, and experience of many kinds. In 1872, Elder Lorenzo Snow&amp;mdash;then a member of the Quorum of the Twelve&amp;mdash;said about these powers:<br><p><i>We were born in the image of God our Father; he begot us like unto himself. There is the nature of deity in the composition of our spiritual organization; in our spiritual birth our Father transmitted to us the capabilities, powers and faculties which he himself possessed, as much so as the child on its mother&amp;rsquo;s bosom possesses, although in an undeveloped state, the faculties, powers and susceptibilities of its parent.</i> [<i>JD</i> 14:302]<br><p>Elder John A. Widtsoe reaffirmed this concept with these words:<br><p><i>Man is one of the eternal, imperishable realities of the universe. His story begins in the infinite past, before the earth was made. His eternity reaches into the yesterdays as into the tomorrows. He belongs to the endless ages.</i><br><p><i>In the beginning, man was with God, a child of God, begotten by Him. He has a divine pedigree. In the pre-existent, spiritual domain, as a son or daughter of the divine Father, he increased in knowledge and power and grew in spiritual stature. At length he was prepared for the earth career and willing to accept its conditions. Man is not an accidental or transient invader of earth. Instead, he is a creature of plan and progress.</i><br><p><i>As a child of God, man partakes of the divine nature of his Father. Within him lie germs of infinite development. Potentially he is a Godlike being. Therefore he may rise eternally toward the likeness of his Father in heaven. Upward, divine, unending, is man&amp;rsquo;s high destiny. </i>[<i>CR,</i> October 1936, p. 97]<br><p>What a beautiful and amazing inheritance! The nature of deity in the composition of our spiritual organization opens the door to the vision of eternal life and divine destiny.<br><p>In &amp;ldquo;The Family: A Proclamation to the World,&amp;rdquo; the following is declared:<br><p><i>All human beings&amp;mdash;male and female&amp;mdash;are created in the image of God. Each is a beloved spirit son or daughter of heavenly parents, and, as such, each has a divine nature and destiny.</i> [<i>Ensign,</i> November 1995, p. 102]<br><p>So we ourselves and all living creatures that have life on this earth were once spiritual beings, &amp;ldquo;called and prepared from the foundation of the world according to the foreknowledge of God&amp;rdquo; (Alma 13:3). We enter this, the second estate, or our earthly life, to receive a body so we may be in a position to perform the purpose outlined in Abraham 3:24&amp;ndash;28:<br><p><i>And there stood one among them that was like unto God, and he said unto those who were with him: We will go down, for there is space there, and we will take of these materials, and we will make an earth whereon these may dwell;</i><br><p><i>And we will prove them herewith, to see if they will do all things whatsoever the Lord their God shall command them;</i><br><p><i>And they who keep their first estate shall be added upon; and they who keep not their first estate shall not have glory in the same kingdom with those who keep their first estate; and they who keep their second estate shall have glory added upon their heads for ever and ever.</i><br><p><i>And the Lord said: Whom shall I send? And one answered like unto the Son of Man: Here am I, send me. And another answered and said: Here am I, send me. And the Lord said: I will send the first.</i><br><p><i>And the second was angry, and kept not his first estate; and, at that day, many followed after him.</i><br><p>Did you notice the important concepts that are mentioned in these verses? For example, &amp;ldquo;There stood one among them that was like unto God.&amp;rdquo; We are talking of Jesus Christ, the Firstborn and&amp;mdash;under the direction of the Father and by his power&amp;mdash;the Creator.<br><p>&amp;ldquo;And we will prove them herewith&amp;rdquo;: The word <i>prove</i> is a key word, fundamental to understanding the events, circumstances, and philosophy of life on this earth. Proving is an eternal principle. We have been proven before. Remember, &amp;ldquo;They who keep their first estate shall be added upon.&amp;rdquo; We go through the same process now on this earth, always placed in situations when and where the test will be more effective to strengthen and advance our eternal nature.<br><p>And if we pass the test, if we observe the commandments, if we live &amp;ldquo;by every word that proceedeth forth from the mouth of God&amp;rdquo; (D&amp;amp;C 84:44), then the great promise we find in Abraham that &amp;ldquo;they who keep their second estate shall have glory added upon their heads for ever and ever&amp;rdquo; (Abraham 3:26) or what we read about in Moses 5:11, &amp;ldquo;the eternal life which God giveth unto all the obedient,&amp;rdquo; will be our blessing, our eternal reward.<br><p>Now eternal life, or God&amp;rsquo;s life, consists of two things:<br><p>One is to receive the fulness of the glory of the Father (see D&amp;amp;C 93:19&amp;ndash;20).<br><p>Another is to have a continuation of the seed forever and ever (see D&amp;amp;C 132:19). Or, in other words, to live in an eternal family unit.<br><p>There is no way that our minds can conceive anything as great and as glorious as eternal life because that is God&amp;rsquo;s life, and what is greater than God? So eternal life is what we seek, and, in the words of President Joseph Fielding Smith, &amp;ldquo;To know the way to eternal life is far more important than all the learning that the world can give&amp;rdquo; (<i>CR,</i> April 1955, p. 51).<br><p>The plan of salvation has been established to enable us to obtain that eternal destiny. In &amp;ldquo;The Family: A Proclamation to the World&amp;rdquo; we find the following statement:<br><p><i>The divine plan of happiness enables family relationships to be perpetuated beyond the grave. Sacred ordinances and covenants available in holy temples make it possible for individuals to return to the presence of God and for families to be united eternally.</i> [&amp;ldquo;The Family: A Proclamation,&amp;rdquo; p. 102]<br><p>Let me repeat that phrase: &amp;ldquo;to return to the presence of God and for families to be united eternally.&amp;rdquo; That is the promise; that is the destination.<br><p>At this time I would like to ask for the help of two of the prophets of this dispensation to give comfort and answer some questions that can arise in the hearts of faithful, young people of the Church.<br><p>First, President Lorenzo Snow said:<br><p><i>There is no Latter-day Saint who dies after having lived a faithful life who will lose anything because of having failed to do certain things when opportunities were not furnished him or her. In other words, if a young man or a young woman has no opportunity of getting married, and they live faithful lives up to the time of their death, they will have all the blessings, exaltation and glory that any man or woman will have who had this opportunity and improved it. That is sure and positive.</i> [<i>Millennial Star,</i> vol. 61, 31 August 1899, p. 547]<br><p>And President Ezra Taft Benson also made these comments:<br><p><i>Not all women in the Church will have an opportunity for marriage and motherhood in mortality. But if you in this situation are worthy and endure faithfully, you can be assured of all blessings from a kind and loving Heavenly Father&amp;mdash;and I emphasize</i> all <i>blessings.</i> [<i>TETB,</i> p. 550; emphasis in original]<br><p>Maybe we can now review some basic principles that can help us in our eternal familial relationships and that can help us prepare ourselves to meet God.<br><p>Let me talk to you who are now or will be husbands and wives, fathers and mothers, to you children of God of divine origin and eternal destination.<br><p>Chief among the organizational arrangements and foreordinations in the premortal existence was the organization of lineage and family. Offices and positions in the Church or in the earthly kingdom would be important, but these would be only for a time and season, whereas relationships associated with the family are to endure throughout the endless eternities.<br><p>Elder David O. McKay said the following about the family as an eternal unit:<br><p><i>Latter-day Saints, the responsibility of saving this sacred institution devolves largely upon you, for you know that the family ties are eternal. They should be eternal. There is nothing temporary in the home of the Latter-day Saint. There is no element of transitoriness in the family relationship of the Latter-day Saint home. That all such ties are eternal should be maintained. To the Latter-day Saint the home is truly the cell-unit of society; and parenthood is next to Godhood.</i> [<i>CR,</i> June 1919, p. 77]<br><p>President Gordon B. Hinckley said:<br><p><i>Our Father in heaven, who loves his children, desires for them that which will bring them happiness now and in the eternities to come, and there is no greater happiness than is found in the most meaningful of all human relationships&amp;mdash;the companionships of husband and wife and parents and children.</i> [<i>CR,</i> April 1974, p. 31; or &amp;ldquo;The Marriage That Endures,&amp;rdquo; <i>Ensign,</i> May 1974, p. 23]<br><p>What a brilliant objective: an eternal family! Eternal families are not created simply through the birth of children. Strong family ties do not happen by chance. To assume that eternal families will be developed through osmosis by the mere fact that we are members of the Church and that our children have been born in the covenant is only wishful thinking. It is only an expression of desire. Family unity is forged by time, patience, service, teaching, and sacrifice. Eternal life is family life.<br><p>In order to accomplish that great objective, we must live worthy lives. Our Heavenly Father wants obedience from his children. He wants &amp;ldquo;a man [to] marry a wife by [his] word, which is [his] law, and by the new and everlasting covenant, and it is sealed unto them by the Holy Spirit of promise&amp;rdquo; (D&amp;amp;C 132:19). He wants a home where spouses remember their marriage vows and honor them. He wants a home where the father is devoted to the family with which he has been blessed&amp;mdash;a home where union, love, and understanding between father and mother and also between parents and children prevail. He wants a home where there is, in the words of President Spencer W. Kimball, &amp;ldquo;a father who procreates, provides, and loves and directs, and a mother who conceives and bears and nurtures and feeds and trains&amp;rdquo; (<i>TSWK,</i> p. 324).<br><p>For example, see what President Harold B. Lee had to say about the role of the father:<br><p><i>Fatherhood is leadership, the most important kind of leadership. It has always been so; it always will be so. Father, with the assistance and counsel and encouragement of your eternal companion, you preside in the home. It is not a matter of whether you are most worthy or best qualified, but it is a matter of law and appointment. You preside at the meal table, at family prayer. You preside at family home evening; and as guided by the Spirit of the Lord, you see that your children are taught correct principles. It is your place to give direction relating to all of family life.</i><br><p><i>You give father&amp;rsquo;s blessings. You take an active part in establishing family rules and discipline. As a leader in your home you plan and sacrifice to achieve the blessing of a unified and happy family. To do all of this requires that you live a family-centered life.</i> [<i>Father, Consider Your Ways</i> (pamphlet, 1973), pp. 4&amp;ndash;5]<br><p>President Harold B. Lee also said, &amp;ldquo;The most important of the Lord&amp;rsquo;s work that you will ever do will be the work you do within the walls of your own home&amp;rdquo; (<i>Strengthening the Home</i> [pamphlet, 1973], p. 7).<br><p>What is the most important priesthood calling that a man in the Church can have? Can he have any greater influence in the kingdom of God than the influence he has in the lives of his family members? Is he as concerned about magnifying his calling as a husband and father as he is about his other callings in the Church?<br><p>President Kimball said:<br><p><i>To begin to strengthen the priesthood, brethren, we must return the fathers to their divinely appointed place at the head of the family. As fathers ourselves we must ensure that we do not neglect our own families. We should be teaching our people over and over again that the most important position in time and eternity is that of the Father.</i> [Spencer W. Kimball, address delivered to priesthood leaders, August 1974]<br><p>And in &amp;ldquo;The Family: A Proclamation to the World,&amp;rdquo; this concept is amply ratified: &amp;ldquo;By divine design, fathers are to preside over their families in love and righteousness and are responsible to provide the necessities of life and protection for their families&amp;rdquo; (p. 102).<br><p>In Moses 1:39 we read: &amp;ldquo;This is my work and my glory&amp;mdash;to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man.&amp;rdquo; Likewise, we could say that this is the glory of men and women&amp;mdash;to bring to pass the mortality of the sons and daughters of God, to give the opportunity of earth experience to the children of our Father who are waiting to come, to participate in the great experience of this, the second estate.<br><p>So the greatest mission of women, through an honorable marriage, is to give life&amp;mdash;we must say earth life&amp;mdash;to those spirits, to our Heavenly Father&amp;rsquo;s children who desire to come to this mortal state to advance in knowledge, experience, and challenges in order to accomplish what is outlined in the plan of salvation. What a great honor and glory. What an ever-enduring happiness to become the mother of the sons and daughters of God&amp;mdash;not only for giving them earthly life but also for bringing them, by a careful and devoted motherhood, to transit on the path that leads to eternal life.<br><p>Providing opportunity for the spirit children of our Father in Heaven to come to earth and work out their own salvation with the consequent great price that mothers pay to make this possible is not, for sure, the whole responsibility of motherhood. In &amp;ldquo;The Family: A Proclamation to the World&amp;rdquo; we read, &amp;ldquo;Mothers are primarily responsible for the nurture of their children&amp;rdquo; (p. 102).<br><p>I would recommend to you to go and study the meaning of the word <i>nurture</i> and its implications. I am sure you will have a better and more profound understanding of what the First Presidency said in 1942:<br><p><i>This divine service of motherhood can be rendered only by mothers. It may not be passed to others. Nurses cannot do it; public nurseries cannot do it; hired help cannot do it&amp;mdash;only mother, aided as much as may be by the loving hands of father, brothers, and sisters, can give the full needed measure of watchful care.</i><br><p><i>The mother who entrusts her child to the care of others, that she may do non-motherly work, whether for gold, for fame, or for civic service, should remember that &amp;ldquo;a child left to himself bringeth his mother to shame.&amp;rdquo; (Prov. 29:15.) In our day the Lord has said that unless parents teach their children the doctrines of the Church &amp;ldquo;the sin be upon the heads of the parents.&amp;rdquo; (D&amp;amp;C 68:25.)</i><br><p><i>Motherhood is near to divinity. It is the highest, holiest service to be assumed by mankind. It places her who honors its holy calling and service next to the angels.</i> [In James R. Clark, comp., <i>Messages of the First Presidency,</i> 6:178; also in <i>CR,</i> October 1942, pp. 12&amp;ndash;13]<br><p>I would like to make clear, at this point, that we understand that there is not a superiority factor in the husband-wife relationship or in the roles that they play as they walk as a family in all righteousness to the mansions of exaltation ahead. The roles of father and mother are equally important, but not identical.<br><p>Elder Bruce R. McConkie said the following:<br><p><i>In the true Patriarchal Order man holds the priesthood and is the head of the household of faith, but he cannot attain a fulness of joy here or of eternal reward hereafter alone. Woman stands at his side a joint-inheritor with him in the fulness of all things. Exaltation and eternal increase is her lot as well as his. . . . Godhood is not for men only; it is for men and women together.</i> [<i>MD,</i> p. 844]<br><p>And Elder John A. Widtsoe emphasized the concept in these words:<br><p><i>By divine fiat, the Priesthood is conferred on the men. This means that organization must prevail in the family, the ultimate unit of the Church. The husband, the Priesthood bearer, presides over the family; the Priesthood conferred upon him is intended for the blessing of the whole family. Every member shares in the gift bestowed, but under a proper organization. No man who understands the gospel believes that he is greater than his wife, or more beloved of the Lord, because he holds the Priesthood, but rather that he is under the responsibility of speaking and acting for the family in official matters. It is a protection to the woman who, because of her motherhood, is under a large physical and spiritual obligation. Motherhood is an eternal part of Priesthood.</i> [John A. Widtsoe, <i>Evidences and Reconciliations,</i> arr. G. Homer Durham (Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1987), pp. 307&amp;ndash;8]<br><p>We can take, for example, the responsibility of presiding righteously in the home. If we understand that the priesthood is power and authority delegated by God to man on earth to act in His behalf in the name of Jesus Christ, we will come to the conclusion that to possess the priesthood is to have the privilege of calling down the powers of heaven to assist in fulfilling sacred responsibilities and opportunities. Priesthood power is delegated to mankind in order to assist Heavenly Father and the Savior in their glorious work&amp;mdash;&amp;ldquo;to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man&amp;rdquo; (Moses 1:39).<br><p>In D&amp;amp;C 121:34&amp;ndash;36 we read:<br><p><i>Behold, there are many called, but few are chosen. And why are they not chosen?</i><br><p><i>Because their hearts are set so much upon the things of this world, and aspire to the honors of men, that they do not learn this one lesson&amp;mdash;</i><br><p><i>That the rights of the priesthood are inseparably connected with the powers of heaven, and that the powers of heaven cannot be controlled nor handled only upon the principles of righteousness.</i><br><p>The priesthood, then, has been given to mankind so that families might have righteous leadership&amp;mdash;in other words, a representative of God to lead them.<br><p>This blessing of providing righteous leadership in the family should also be shared with wives. President Faust has said:<br><p><i>It is an unrighteous exercise of priesthood authority for a man, as a conduit through his priesthood office, to withhold or limit blessings which should flow through the priesthood to his wife and family. The priesthood blessings are not just male- or husband-limited, but reach their potential flowering in the eternal relationship of the husband and wife sharing and administering these great blessings to the family. Our wives have priesthood blessings, though not priesthood offices. These blessings are the keys to eternal life, salvation, and exaltation through obedience.</i> [James E. Faust, &amp;ldquo;Brethren, Love Your Wives,&amp;rdquo; <i>Ensign,</i> July 1981, p. 35]<br><p>Fidelity in marriage is a very important ingredient in having a happy family life here on earth and in giving us the assurance of looking forward to a resumption of that family life beyond the veil.<br><p>In the preface of section 42 of the Doctrine and Covenants we are told that the Prophet Joseph Smith specified this revelation as &amp;ldquo;embracing the law of the Church.&amp;rdquo; It provides significant, divine information relative to marriage and fidelity. The Lord declared in this revelation that men are to love their wives with all their hearts and are to &amp;ldquo;cleave unto her and none else&amp;rdquo; (v. 22). President Kimball explained the meaning of this commandment:<br><p><i>And, when the Lord says</i> all <i>thy heart, it allows for no sharing nor dividing nor depriving. And, to the woman it is paraphrased: &amp;ldquo;Thou shalt love thy husband with</i> all <i>thy heart and shalt cleave unto him and none else.&amp;rdquo;</i><br><p><i>The words</i> none else <i>eliminate everyone and everything. The spouse then becomes preeminent in the life of the husband or wife, and neither social life nor occupational life nor political life nor any other interest nor person nor thing shall ever take precedence over the companion spouse. We sometimes find women who absorb and hover over the children at the expense of the husband, sometimes even estranging them from him.</i><br><p><i>The Lord says to them: &amp;ldquo;Thou shalt cleave unto</i> him <i>and none else.&amp;rdquo; </i>[Spencer W. Kimball, <i>Faith Precedes the Miracle</i> (Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Company, 1972), pp. 142&amp;ndash;43; emphasis in original]<br><p>&amp;ldquo;And he that looketh upon a woman to lust after her shall deny the faith, and shall not have the Spirit; and if he repents not he shall be cast out&amp;rdquo; (D&amp;amp;C 42:23).<br><p>This reinforces the teachings of the Master: As a man thinketh, so is he (see Proverbs 23:7). One usually first becomes unfaithful in the mind and later in deeds.<br><p>President Faust has said:<br><p><i>Our loyalty to our eternal companion should not be merely physical, but mental and spiritual as well. Since there are no harmless flirtations and no place for jealousy after marriage, it is best to avoid the very appearance of evil by shunning any questionable contact with another to whom we are not married.</i> [James E. Faust, <i>CR,</i> October 1977, p. 14; or &amp;ldquo;The Enriching of Marriage,&amp;rdquo; <i>Ensign,</i> November 1977, p. 10]<br><p>The influence we have with other people is measured by the trust they have in us. If people do not trust us, they will pay little attention to us. But if their confidence in us is deep, they will withhold little or nothing from us.<br><p>It is that way with our relationship to our Heavenly Father. We are blessed only in proportion to our faith in him, and isn&amp;rsquo;t that faith easily interpreted in terms of trust? We believe God will help us because we trust him. If we had not trust in the Almighty, we would neither pray to him nor keep his commandments.<br><p>Do you remember the words of Nephi?<br><p><i>Let us be faithful in keeping the commandments of the Lord; for behold he is mightier than all the earth. </i>[1 Nephi 4:1]<br><p><i>How is it that ye have forgotten that the Lord is able to do all things according to his will, for the children of men, if it so be that they exercise faith in him? Wherefore, let us be faithful to him.</i> [1 Nephi 7:12]<br><p><i>And thus we see that the commandments of God must be fulfilled. And if it so be that the children of men keep the commandments of God he doth nourish them, and strengthen them, and provide means whereby they can accomplish the thing which he has commanded them.</i> [1 Nephi 17:3]<br><p>These are only a few of the many examples in the life of Nephi.<br><p>We follow President Gordon B. Hinckley because his life has established trust and love in our hearts. Because we trust him, we follow him, and thus is the Church enlarged.<br><p>That same kind of trust must abide in our families. Husbands and wives must trust each other and live in a way that will merit such confidence. There is no substitute for fidelity. And in the same way, parents must earn the trust of their children. How can that be accomplished? By providing unfailing companionship, by setting the proper examples to follow, and by teaching the divine precepts that can be found in the gospel of Jesus Christ.<br><p>Listen to what the Psalmist told us about our children:<br><p><i>Lo, children are an heritage of the Lord: and the fruit of the womb is his reward.</i><br><p><i>As arrows are in the hand of a mighty man; so are children of the youth.</i><br><p><i>Happy is the man that hath his quiver full of them: they shall not be ashamed, but they shall speak with the enemies in the gate.</i> [Psalm 127:3&amp;ndash;5]<br><p>Good family life on this earth is vital to our enjoyment of family life in the realms of our Heavenly Father.<br><p>For that testimony which dwells in our hearts, we go to the temple and marry therein. For that reason we have children and rear them according to the principles of the gospel so they may continue in our family circle in the eternities to come.<br><p>Why would God make us spend so many years of our life on the earth raising offspring, rearing our children, rearing his children? One answer might be that man&amp;rsquo;s growth includes learning to be part of a family&amp;mdash;particularly learning to be a parent. God is not raising children; he is raising parents&amp;mdash;parents who can someday fulfill the eternal role of parents as God fulfills his.<br><p>In a general conference address President J. Reuben Clark expressed the following:<br><p><i>I would like you to reflect upon the fact that our children came to us with spirits that did not ask us to bring them, but with spirits, through some operation of which I am not aware, that are assigned to us; and they come to us as our guests. We are responsible for the mortal tabernacling of that spirit; and I should like each and every Latter-day Saint to get that fact into his heart, that the child which is his, or hers, comes at the invitation, virtually, of them who beget it, and then I would like you to reflect upon the responsibility which that brings home to each and every man and woman who is a parent. Yours is the responsibility to see that this tabernacled spirit loses no opportunity, through you, to prove his worthiness and righteousness in living through his second estate.</i><br><p><i>Now the point that I wish particularly to emphasize is this&amp;mdash;you parents cannot shift that responsibility to anyone else. It is yours; you cannot divest yourselves of it.</i> [<i>CR,</i> October 1951, p. 57]<br><p>Maybe we can repeat now the fundamental concepts that we have been mentioning: We have been begotten and born of heavenly parents; God is our Eternal Father, the Father of us all. In consequence, we are his children, and therefore we belong to his family. Since we are to become like him, &amp;ldquo;perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven&amp;rdquo; (Matthew 5:48), family life is vital for Latter-day Saints. Or, in the words of Elder Dallin H. Oaks:<br><p><i>Our theology begins with heavenly parents. Our highest aspiration is to be like them. Under the merciful plan of the Father, all of this is possible through the atonement of the Only Begotten of the Father, our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ. As earthly parents we participate in the gospel plan by providing mortal bodies for the spirit children of God. The fulness of eternal salvation is a family matter.</i> [&amp;ldquo;Apostasy and Restoration,&amp;rdquo; <i>Ensign,</i> May 1995, p. 87]<br><p>With these concepts in mind, at the same time we can ask ourselves this question: &amp;ldquo;Will a father desire that his children have every good thing that he has?&amp;rdquo; The answer surely would be that that is what a good father will desire. So isn&amp;rsquo;t it logical to think that in the beginning, when God and our Heavenly Mother begot us and brought us forth in the spirit world, their great desire for us was that we become like them?<br><p>In order to make that desire a reality as we strive to be good children, we make every effort to be good parents. The eternal reward&amp;mdash;the desire and objective to reach&amp;mdash;is exaltation or eternal life. It is the kind of life that God lives. It is the continuation of the family in eternity. It is eternal increase. It is the inheriting of all things. It is to receive all that our Father has.<br><p>May we be blessed as we journey in this segment of eternity, living the gospel and following the great Exemplar, even Jesus Christ, in his name. Amen.</p><br><p><i>&amp;copy; Intellectual Reserve, Inc. All rights reserved.</i></p> <br>

<br>
I would like to share with you a fictitious story that was told to me by my friend Professor Jimmie Smith at Texas Tech University. Even though this story is fictional, it has, I believe, a very important and extraordinary message.<br><br>In an olden time there lived a king who wanted something very special and unique for his approaching birthday. To accommodate his desire, this king called together all the wise men in the kingdom and gave them a charge to invent a new and unique game in honor of this birthday. The king decreed that the game must be simple yet challenging. Most important, the game must give honor and respect to all kings everywhere. He declared that the individual who won this competition would receive the wish of his heart. After some time had elapsed, one of the wise men developed the game we now know as chess. He presented his creation as a gift to the king. The king thought the new game was just wonderful. He particularly liked it because everything about the game seemed to center on the king. In fact, as you probably know, the whole game of chess is focused on just one thing: protecting the king.<br><br>The king happily told the wise man he could have his wish realized for conceiving such a great game. The wise man responded quickly by stating that all he wanted was a relatively simple thing that was based on the checkerboard used for the game. Recall that the chess checkerboard uses a grid of eight by eight alternately colored squares--a total of 64 squares. The wise man said that what he wanted was the volume of wheat generated by the process of placing one kernel of grain on the first square, two kernels on the next square, four on the next square, and so on. I believe you get the idea: each succeeding square doubled the number of kernels of grain that were on the previous square. The king thought that was a rather foolish, simpleminded wish but agreed to grant it forthwith. He ordered his squires to bring in a bushel of wheat. The king's squires began placing kernels of wheat on the board. In the beginning it seemed like it would be a very simple process. However, when they reached square 19, they had emptied the initial bushel of wheat. They went and got several more bushels, but, to their dismay, by the time they got to about square 30, they had exhausted all of the wheat in the kingdom.<br><br>Now, if we consider carrying this hypothetical story to completion, ponder that China is the largest producer of wheat in the world today. That country currently harvests about 3,700 million bushels of wheat a year. That's about the amount of wheat needed to fill to square number 52. To complete the process to square 64, it would take about 6,500 years of China's current production.<br><br>This is a fairly lengthy story to preface my remarks for this morning, but I have used this make-believe tale in introduction because of its powerful message. This message says that very simple things--like regularly doubling your effort--can have a tremendous magnifying effect.<br><br>Today I would like to speak with you about a relatively simple yet powerful personal characteristic. This characteristic is magnanimity. I have chosen this theme because I have a strong professional interest in ethical behavior--specifically, the ethical behavior of engineers. I know that being magnanimous is one of the highest forms of ethical conduct in both personal and professional behavior. If we will but incorporate magnanimous behavior in our everyday actions, our positive impact on others will be significant. Then, much like the outcome of doubling the grains of wheat in our fictional story, our positive impact will first affect a few individuals. Subsequently those individuals can affect others, and then others again, so that eventually the larger community in which we reside, even the whole world, could be influenced.<br><br><i>Magnanimity,</i>as a word, does not appear directly in the scriptures. The 1828 edition of<i>Webster's Dictionary</i>gives the definition of<i>magnanimity</i>as<br><br><i>greatness of mind; that elevation or dignity of soul, which encounters danger and trouble with tranquility and firmness, which raises the possessor above revenge, and makes him delight in acts of benevolence, which makes him disdain injustice and meanness, and prompts him to sacrifice personal ease, interest and safety for the accomplishment of useful and noble objects.</i>[Noah Webster,<i>An American Dictionary of the English Language</i>(New York: Johnson Reprint Corporation, 1970), vol. 2, s.v. "magnanimity"]<br><br>Synonyms of<i>magnanimity</i>are<i>generosity, benevolence, unselfishness, altruism, kindness,</i>and<i>high-mindedness.</i><br><br>The importance of magnanimity and how one can live this trait has been given to us fully by the teachings and living example of our Savior. His life was full of magnanimous actions toward both his disciples and adversaries. His words and instructions on the subject are clearly recorded in both ancient and modern scripture. Most notably, while on the cross, he said, "Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do" (Luke 23:34).<br><br>He also taught that we should strive to emulate his very actions. In 3 Nephi 27:21, he instructed:<br><br><i>Verily, verily, I say unto you, this is my gospel; and ye know the things that ye must do in my church; for the works which ye have seen me do that shall ye also do; for that which ye have seen me do even that shall ye do.</i><br><br>The Saints of that day responded and did what they had seen the Savior do. The result was recorded in 4 Nephi 1:15–17:<br><br><i>And it came to pass that there was no contention in the land, because of the love of God which did dwell in the hearts of the people.</i><br><br><i>And there were no envyings, nor strifes, nor tumults, nor whoredoms, nor lyings, nor murders, nor any manner of lasciviousness; and surely there could not be a happier people among all the people who had been created by the hand of God.</i><br><br><i>There were no robbers, nor murderers, neither were there Lamanites, nor any manner of -ites; but they were in one, the children of Christ, and heirs to the kingdom of God.</i><br><br>This condition prevailed for about 200 years. It was an era of total love amongst the people.<br><br>Today I would like to share with you several powerful and true accounts of magnanimous acts and liken them to what the Savior taught. I hope that through these examples we might be able to consider how we can magnify this characteristic in our lives. I should mention that in an engineering ethics class that I teach, one of the assignments given is for each class member to take a personal value, such as magnanimity, and try living it completely for a week. The result of this assignment generally provides a new awareness of the positive effects of incorporating such ideals in our lives. You might consider such an assignment today as an experiment on magnanimity.<br><br>The first story is an inspiring illustration of true forgiveness and an example of being raised far above revenge. It seems that the elements of war often provide the grounds for magnanimous actions. This story took place in the course of the atrocities of war when an enemy soldier pursued a young civilian woman and her brother down a street. The siblings became cornered in an angle of a wall, and the brother was slain before his sister's eyes. She subsequently dodged down an alley, leaped a wall, and escaped. Later captured, and having been trained as a nurse, she was forced by the enemy authorities to work in a military hospital. Into her ward was brought, one day, the same soldier who had slain her brother. He was very ill. A slight inattention on the nurse's part would insure his death. The young woman faced a bitter struggle in her mind. Vengeance was a powerful conviction, as was the impression of love. In the end, the better side of her conquered, and she nursed him as carefully as any other patient in the ward. The soldier had recognized the young lady as well, and, one day, being unable to restrain his curiosity, he asked his nurse why she had not let him die. She respectfully replied to him, "I am a follower of him who said 'Love your enemies and do them good.'" This statement caused the soldier to ponder the situation for a long time. At last he responded to her, "I never knew that there was such a religion. If that is your religion tell me more about it, for I want it." (Story paraphrased from Harry Emerson Fosdick,<i>Twelve Tests of Character</i>[New York: Association Press, 1941], pp. 166–67.)<br><br>The young nurse truly had adequate reason to at least have some other person administer medical help to the young soldier. But she understood what the Savior taught about forgiveness of enemies. In the story's end we see the beginning of another story. The follow-up story would likely result in a new direction for the life of the soldier. His life would likely be directed toward goodness, service, and love for mankind. It would be a life where he would delight in doing good. Thus we get a glimpse of the result of magnanimous actions. They not only allow good to be done on a one-on-one basis but open the door, by example and precept, for additional magnanimous actions.<br><br>The next story, which is equally instructive, is an episode in the life of the distinguished Confederate general Robert E. Lee.<br><br><i>When Robert E. Lee was a cadet at West Point, a classmate took a violent and irrational dislike to him. The animosity persisted into later life. For many years this fellow officer made malicious attacks on Lee. One day a mutual acquaintance asked Lee what he thought of this individual. To the questioner's surprise, Lee spoke in the highest terms of him. Then his questioner said slyly, "I guess you don't know what he's been saying about you for years." "You have not asked me," Lee replied, "for his opinion of me. You have asked me for my opinion of him."</i>[As related by James G. Gilkey in Stanley I. Stuber and Thomas Curtis Clark, eds.,<i>Treasury of the Christian Faith: An Encyclopedic Handbook of the Range and Witness of Christianity</i>(New York: Association Press, 1949), pp. 775–76]<br><br>General Lee was known as a man of honor and as one who exemplified the highest of moral character. I am confident that his honorable actions were both observed and emulated by the soldiers who served with him. Thus General Lee is one who, by practicing acts of magnanimity, could double the effect and then have those effects doubled again by the actions of others.<br><br>I believe General Lee incorporated fully in his life the teachings of the Savior given in Matthew 18:21–22:<br><br><i>Then came Peter to him, and said, Lord, how oft shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? till seven times?</i><br><br><i>Jesus saith unto him, I say not unto thee, Until seven times: but, Until seventy times seven.</i><br><br>An example of how General Lee's character may have been taken and magnified by another is demonstrated in the actions of one of his soldiers, a Confederate sergeant named Richard Rowland Kirkland. Sergeant Kirkland's story took place in December of 1862. The Union army had just captured the town of Fredericksburg, Virginia, and had turned their sights to Marye's Heights. Marye's Heights was a large hill where General Lee had his soldiers well fortified and securely placed behind a prominent stone wall. These Confederate soldiers were totally out of sight of the Union army. It is important to note that the Confederate forces numbered only about 6,000 as compared to the Union forces, which numbered well over 40,000.<br><br>The Union army began to attack the Confederates at Marye's Heights, but their offensive proved devastating. In the initial confrontation there were more than 12,000 Union soldiers cut down by the well-camouflaged Confederate guns. Many of the wounded Union men lay only a few yards away from where the Southern soldiers were positioned. On the cold winter night that followed, numerous maimed soldiers died from exposure to the elements. Many of the injured cried for help. A Confederate soldier, our Richard Rowland Kirkland, could not withstand the scene. To his commanding officer he said, "All night and all day I have heard those poor people crying for water, and I can stand it no longer. I . . . ask permission to go and give them water." Permission was initially denied, but finally, with canteens strapped around his neck, he went over the stone wall and began to give water and aid to the fallen enemy. The Union soldiers were at first too surprised to shoot. Then they began to cheer him when they saw what he was doing.<br><br>Sergeant Richard Rowland Kirkland became known as "the angel of Marye's Heights." There is a monument at that stone wall near Fredericksburg that honors the Confederate soldier. It was crafted by the same man who sculpted the famous Iwo Jima monument. The statue portrays Sergeant Kirkland lifting the head of the wounded enemy soldier and giving him water. A plaque honoring Kirkland hangs in the Episcopal church in Gettysburg. It reads: "A hero of benevolence, at the risk of his own life, he gave his enemy drink at Fredericksburg." (Story taken from Alexander B. Morrison,<i>Visions of Zion</i>[Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Company, 1993], pp. 33–35.)<br><br>Sergeant Kirkland's story demonstrates the heights of sublime love and compassion one can give to one's fellowman. This incident truly describes an individual who understood what the Savior taught when he said:<br><br><i>But I say unto you which hear, Love your enemies, do good to them which hate you,</i><br><br><i>Bless them that curse you, and pray for them which despitefully use you.</i>[Luke 6:27–28]<br><br>In a 1984 BYU devotional, then president Jeffrey R. Holland taught of the magnanimity exemplified by the Prophet Joseph Smith (see "A Robe, a Ring, and a Fatted Calf,"<i>Ensign,</i>August 1985, pp. 68–72). The particular incident concerned a very significant event between the Prophet and Brother William W. Phelps.<br><br>In paraphrasing Elder Holland's rendition of the story, we learn that in the early years of the Church, the Prophet Joseph had no more devoted and reliable assistant than William Wines Phelps. Brother Phelps had numerous talents. He was gifted musically and was a noted newspaper editor at the time he joined the Church. In the beginning he was faithful and devoted to his assignments. He wrote the beloved hymn "The Spirit of God Like a Fire Is Burning," which was sung at the dedication of the Kirtland Temple. He was sent as one of the first Latter-day Saints to Jackson County, Missouri. There he was called by the Lord as a member of the stake presidency of "that center stake of Zion" (Holland, "A Robe," p. 71).<br><br>Unfortunately, troubles soon developed for Brother Phelps. These troubles were initially ecclesiastical aberrations. The concerns later became financial improprieties. Things became so serious that the Lord revealed to Joseph Smith that if Brother Phelps did not repent, he would be "removed out of [his] place" (<i>HC</i>2:511). William Phelps did not repent and was excommunicated on March 10, 1838.<br><br>The Prophet Joseph and several others tried to love Brother Phelps back into the fold, but he would have nothing of it. Later that year, Phelps, along with several others, signed a very damaging and harmful affidavit against the Prophet and other leaders of the Church. The result of this affidavit was that the Prophet Joseph Smith was sentenced to be publicly executed on the town square in Far West, Missouri. Fortunately, General Alexander Doniphan intervened, and the Prophet was miraculously spared the execution. But Joseph was not spared spending five months--November through April--in several Missouri prisons, including his time in the frightful, ill-named Liberty Jail.<br><br>This was a time of severe suffering for all the Saints. The Prophet was in a wretched prison. The persecutions of the Church intensified. The main body of the believers had to make their way to a malaria-infested swamp on the banks of the Mississippi River--a place called Commerce, Illinois. William Phelps caused much of this struggle, suffering, and heartache.<br><br>Two years later, William Phelps wrote to Joseph in Nauvoo. His repentant letter was full of anguish, remorse, and sorrow. He wrote:<br><br><i>Brother Joseph:</i><br><br><i>. . . I am as the prodigal son. . . .</i><br><br><i>I have seen the folly of my way, and I tremble at the gulf I have passed. . . . Says I, "I will . . . ask my old brethren to forgive me, and though they chasten me to death, yet I will die with them, for their God is my God. The least place with them is enough for me, yea, it is bigger and better than all Babylon." . . .</i><br><br><i>I know my situation, you know it, and God knows it, and I want to be saved if my friends will help me. . . . I have done wrong and I am sorry. . . . I ask forgiveness. . . . I want your fellowship; if you cannot grant that, grant me your peace and friendship, for we are brethren, and our communion used to be sweet.</i>[<i>HC</i>4:141–42]<br><br>The Prophet wrote back immediately. This letter of the Prophet's demonstrates the magnificence of his soul--in other words, his magnanimity. As Elder Holland said in his talk about this story, "There is a lesson here for every one of us who claims to be a disciple of Christ" (Holland, "A Robe," p. 72). The Prophet's letter read:<br><br><i>Dear Brother Phelps: . . .</i><br><br><i>You may in some measure realize what my feelings . . . were, when we read your letter. . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . We have suffered much in consequence of your behavior--the cup of gall, already full enough for mortals to drink, was indeed filled to overflowing when you turned against us. . . .</i><br><br><i>However, the cup has been drunk, the will of our Father has been done, and we are yet alive, for which we thank the Lord. And having been delivered from the hands of wicked men by the mercy of our God, we say it is your privilege to be delivered from the powers of the adversary, be brought into the liberty of God's dear children, and again take your stand among the Saints of the Most High, and by diligence, humility, and love unfeigned, commend yourself to our God, and your God, and to the Church of Jesus Christ.</i><br><br><i>Believing your confession to be real, and your repentance genuine, I shall be happy once again to give you the right hand of fellowship, and rejoice over the returning prodigal. . . .</i><br><br><i>"Come on, dear brother, since the war is past,</i><br><i>For friends at first, are friends again at last."</i><br><i>Yours as ever,</i><br><i>Joseph Smith, Jun.</i><br>[<i>HC</i>4:162–64]<br><br>It is most significant to remember that William Phelps was selected to preach Joseph's funeral sermon. It was also he who penned the magnificent hymn that memorialized the martyred prophet, "Praise to the Man." He became an outstanding citizen of Utah. He was an ordinance worker in the Endowment House, a member of the state constitutional convention, surveyor general and chief engineer of the Great Salt Lake Valley, speaker of the House of Representatives, and a member of the board of regents for the University of Deseret (see Susan Easton Black,<i>Who's Who in the Doctrine and Covenants</i>[Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1997], p. 226). Surely Joseph was practicing the gospel in its fullness in his actions toward Brother Phelps. They were in complete adherence to the Lord's teaching in section 64 of the Doctrine and Covenants, verses 9–10:<br><br><i>Wherefore, I say unto you, that ye ought to forgive one another; for he that forgiveth not his brother his trespasses standeth condemned before the Lord; for there remaineth in him the greater sin.</i><br><br><i>I, the Lord, will forgive whom I will forgive, but of you it is required to forgive all men.</i><br><br>Again, in this story we can understand the magnifying effects of magnanimity. In essence, when one magnanimous act is done, it propagates many, many more similar acts.<br><br>In a recent incident on December 11, 1995, a devastating fire destroyed the majority of Aaron Feuerstein's Malden Mills textile plant in Lawrence, Massachusetts. (For the following story, see Joel C. Adair, "Resolving Problems in Engineering Ethics, Precept and Example," master's thesis, Brigham Young University, 1999, pp. 91–98.) Only a single production structure survived, and it was damaged and without power. However, this meager remaining portion of his enterprise was enough to convince owner Aaron to rebuild.<br><br>The decision to rebuild this industry may not seem significant; however, consider the broader picture. The U.S. textile industry had its origins in New England, but now Malden Mills was among the last of the textile manufacturers to remain in that region. Most manufacturers left the area to reestablish themselves in regions of cheaper labor. Malden Mills remained because Aaron felt that to produce the high-tech fabrics that had made his company successful, he needed skilled workers who had unfaltering work ethics and who took pride in their product and in the company. These workers he rewarded with high wages and fair treatment.<br><br>To rebuild, he had to act quickly to ensure that valuable customers would not be lost. Rebuilding would go against everything that corporate America expected. Feuerstein was 70 years old and could have easily collected the insurance money and begun a comfortable retirement. Doing so, however, would have left 2,320 employees without work. This was the time that Aaron Feuerstein totally lived up to the things he had learned during his Orthodox Jewish upbringing. In his understanding, he needed to be a "mensch." This expression comes from a Yiddish proverb that states, "When all is moral chaos, this is the time for you to be a mensch." A mensch is a person who exhibits exceptional moral courage, a person who does the right thing when nobody else will. Being a mensch means to be magnanimous.<br><br>Three days after the fire, Feuerstein announced to his workers that he would continue to pay them full salary for the next 30 days, even though they would likely not be able to work. He had intended to announce full salary for 90 days, but the other major executives of his business wanted to be more cautious, so Aaron agreed to the 30-day announcement. He told the executives, however, "Well, it doesn't make any difference. I'll announce at the end of the first 30 days another 30 days, and at the end of that another." Full insurance coverage was also provided his workers for the three months. In addition, since Christmas was near, each employee's paycheck after the fire contained a $275 Christmas bonus. Feuerstein also made his annual contribution of $20,000 to several local charities.<br><br>During the reconstruction period, a significant conflict developed between Feuerstein and his corporate executives. Since most of the equipment had been totally destroyed, it made good sense to the executives to consider more automated processes for their product. Such changes could improve quality and reduce costs, thus leading to significantly higher profits. However, Feuerstein remained vehemently opposed to such a shift. He believed that it was the workers' skills that resulted in their superior products and that adopting highly automated systems would displace workers to whom he had promised employment. In the end, Feuerstein's concern for his workers prevailed.<br><br>It is significant to note that by the end of December, production of Polartec, the company's primary product, was back to 20 percent of normal, and by May the production was back to 85 percent of the normal output.<br><br>Aaron Feuerstein's example of magnanimity has earned him several prominent awards. He maintains, however, "I haven't really done anything. I don't deserve credit. Corporate America has made it so that when you behave the way I did, it's abnormal" (Adair, "Resolving Problems," p. 98). After being presented with George Washington University's 1996 CEO of the Year Award, he explained:<br><br><i>In 1866, Arlington Mills built its first plant. Just a year later, a conflagration destroyed the entire mill. The proprietors then were determined to rebuild, without publicity and without celebrity status. At that time it was normal to care about your business and community. The value system of 130 years ago is the same value system that my grandfather and father taught me; nothing's changed. So why all of a sudden this celebrity status? Perhaps it's a reflection on some of the modern CEOs of today. As a CEO, it is my responsibility to make sure our employees' spirit isn't broken and their American dream isn't crushed. They're not just a pair of hands and a cut-able expense. Without them we can't succeed.</i>[Adair, "Resolving Problems," p. 98]<br><br>The magnanimity demonstrated by Aaron Feuerstein is truly inspiring. His story is one of true Christlike behavior in the face of devastating personal loss. Our world would be a better place if all corporate leaders had the same values and commitment to community as was demonstrated by Aaron.<br><br>I believe that the Apostle Paul may have best described the actions of Brother Aaron Feuerstein when he taught:<br><br><i>Fulfil ye my joy, that ye be like-minded, having the same love, being of one accord, of one mind.</i><br><br><i>Let nothing be done through strife or vainglory; but in lowliness of mind let each esteem other better than themselves.</i><br><br><i>Look not every man on his own things, but every man also on the things of others.</i>[Philippians 2:2–4]<br><br>A circumstance that often leads to the opportunity to exercise magnanimity is when misunderstandings take place and these misunderstandings lead to significant difficulties. This is a common occurrence. An example of such a situation, and the resulting magnanimous action, is recorded in the Book of Mormon in chapters 60 and 61 of Alma. (See also Neal A. Maxwell,<i>Meek and Lowly</i>[Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Company, 1987], pp. 23–25.) Let me set the stage for you of this significant incident.<br><br>The chief judge and governor of the land at this time was the righteous and beloved leader Pahoran. During Pahoran's leadership there were great contentions in the land resulting in violent tumult and war. The main strife was between those loyal to Pahoran and the group we know as the "king-men," who were trying to establish a monarchy for the government. Fortunately for Pahoran, his chief military leader was the great Book of Mormon patriot General Moroni.<br><br>This Moroni is truly one of the most popular and inspirational leaders of the Book of Mormon. It was this Moroni who wrote the title of liberty on his coat and rallied his people to patriotically defend their homeland.<br><br>As we have noted previously, the acts of war often provide the grounds for magnanimous acts. So it is in this case. However, the situation here was not between those who perceived themselves as enemies but between those who likely had the utmost respect for each other: Moroni and Pahoran. Moroni was in dire need of supplies and reinforcements for one of his supporting generals, Helaman. Moroni sent a letter to Pahoran requesting that support be sent to assist Helaman.<br><br>Unfortunately, Moroni did not know that Pahoran himself was under siege and had been forced to flee from Zarahemla. Because of the prevailing circumstances, Pahoran was unable to refortify Helaman's forces. Since no aid was rendered, Helaman's army suffered great losses. The anxious Moroni was incensed at what he perceived as indifferent behavior by his government and his country's leader. Moroni immediately sent his leader another letter and spared no words in his condemnation of Pahoran. Moroni accused Pahoran of great neglect, thoughtless stupor, slothfulness, wickedness, sitting in idleness, and being a traitor. He even threatened to come and cleanse the inequity that he perceived existed in the government.<br><br>Moroni's letter, however, did not overly disturb Pahoran. His response in Alma 61 is magnanimous:<br><br><i>And now, in your epistle you have censured me, but it mattereth not; I am not angry, but do rejoice in the greatness of your heart. I, Pahoran, do not seek for power, save only to retain my judgment-seat that I may preserve the rights and the liberty of my people. My soul standeth fast in that liberty in the which God hath made us free.</i>[v. 9]<br><br><i>Therefore, my beloved brother, Moroni, let us resist evil, and whatsoever evil we cannot resist with our words, yea, such as rebellions and dissensions, let us resist them with our swords, that we may retain our freedom, that we may rejoice in the great privilege of our church, and in the cause of our Redeemer and our God.</i>[v. 14]<br><br>Then, in verses 19–20:<br><br><i>And now, Moroni, I do joy in receiving your epistle, for I was somewhat worried concerning what we should do, whether it should be just in us to go against our brethren.</i><br><br><i>But ye have said, except they repent the Lord hath commanded you that ye should go against them.</i><br><br>In the first verse of chapter 62, we read of Moroni's feelings after reading Pahoran's letter:<br><br><i>And now it came to pass that when Moroni had received this epistle his heart did take courage, and was filled with exceedingly great joy because of the faithfulness of Pahoran, that he was not also a traitor to the freedom and cause of his country.</i><br><br>This outstanding Book of Mormon story teaches us much about proper behavior between individuals in times of extreme stress. We learn that even among the strongest of leaders, misunderstandings can easily be generated. The Savior taught in the Sermon on the Mount:<br><br><i>Therefore if thou bring thy gift to the altar, and there rememberest that thy brother hath ought against thee;</i><br><br><i>Leave there thy gift before the altar, and go thy way; first be reconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer thy gift.</i>[Matthew 5:23–24]<br><br>Moroni did indeed reconcile his concerns with Pahoran and then went about the Lord's work.<br><br>In closing, I am sure that it is obvious that each day provides numerous opportunities to practice magnanimity. We can practice it with our loved ones, within the classroom, at our place of employment, with our friends and associates, and also with those with whom we choose not to associate. Be the relationship that of professor to student, husband to wife, parent to child, brother to sister, supervisor to employee, or any other one-on-one relationship, we will have the opportunity to be magnanimous. These opportunities will not simply occur on an occasional basis but will present themselves time and time again.<br><br>I also know that it is one of the most difficult Christlike values for us to emulate consistently. Brigham Young taught:<br><br><i>One of the hardest lessons for me to learn on earth is to love a man who hates me. . . . I do not think I have got this lesson by heart, and I do not know how long I shall have to live to learn it. I am trying.</i>[<i>JD</i>14:97]<br><br>To be severely wronged by another, yet to return love, compassion, and care, as was done by the nurse, is most difficult. Also, to be slandered without returning slander, as was accomplished by Robert E. Lee, is a powerful illustration of implementing self-control and altruism. The Confederate soldier, Sergeant Richard Kirkland, demonstrated benevolence and love for his fellowmen, even though they were his declared enemies, by providing comfort to them when they needed it most. The Prophet Joseph Smith taught us how to truly forgive and act toward one who has intentionally caused us significant harm. Aaron Feuerstein showed that being benevolent was far more important than being personally secure. And finally, the reconciliation between Moroni and Pahoran set a pattern for us to emulate when misunderstandings develop between the best of friends. If we can incorporate the essence of the virtue of magnanimity into our character, not only will our personal life be enriched, but the effect for good that we have on others will be profound.<br><br>The hymn we sang to begin this devotional today, "Lord, I Would Follow Thee" (<i>Hymns,</i>1985, no. 220), has a powerful connection to the subject I have been sharing with you. Recall some of the phrases of this inspired music, in particular the passage "To the wounded and the weary I would show a gentle heart." Those words seem to characterize both the young nurse and Sergeant Kirkland. And the expression "I would be my brother's keeper" describes clearly the actions of both Aaron Feuerstein and the Prophet Joseph. Most important, the basic message of the hymn that we should follow the Savior, that we should walk in the path that he has shown, provides us the model for all of our actions.<br><br>I hope that we may continually improve our behavior toward others in the way our Savior would have us do, to be magnanimous in our thoughts and deeds. To this end I humbly pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Steven E.

<h1>lity of Failure - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
At the outset I want to make one thing clear. I love competition, and I like winning more than losing. My friends with whom I play racquetball know that I hate to miss a single shot (even though I miss many), much less lose a game or series. I am a quietly competitive kind of guy. But I have been perplexed by the idea that is current in our time and among many members of the Church that "winning is everything." I believe that in an ultimate sense, the eternal sense, this is true. But along the path, as we work our way toward our eternal salvation, is winning, is success, is making more money, is acquiring more things, is knowing more, is having the highest degrees, is holding the very top position, is being assistant to the mission president, is having more baptisms while serving as a missionary really what life is all about? My talk today centers on the worth of serving well and doing our best and then allowing the Lord to count the value of our sacrifice.<br><br>In the early 1960s, shortly after I married my wife, JoAnn, an important experience happened in our family. My older brother, Todd, was selected as a member of the BYU College Bowl team to participate on national television. He was made captain of the four-person team, something our family considered a wonderful distinction. I'm not sure how BYU people of earlier eras would rank that event, but many of us considered the four-win, one-loss run of our team to be one of the most important happenings in the intellectual history of BYU. We thought it put BYU on the map as a school of better than solid academic distinction.<br><br>Yet when the team flew into the airport and was greeted by a large and enthusiastic crowd, I remember Todd saying something like, "Why are you all here? We lost." Within a few days Elder Harold B. Lee gave a devotional address and mentioned not only the team's wins but also its final loss. I can't remember the exact words, but his message was that sometimes we learn more from defeat than from victory.<br><br>I have thought many times about Elder Lee's brief message. Life did not end with the defeat that Sunday afternoon. For the members of the team, it was actually just getting started. I don't know what happened to two of the four team members, but I've watched my brother's career as a faculty member and administrator here at BYU with interest and family pride. His good friend from the team, David Stone, has recently been called into the Second Quorum of the Seventy. No, life did not end with that single loss.<br><br>In our extremely competitive world, we sometimes have the impression ground into us that if we are not number one, we are not anyone at all. The national champions are remembered with fame and glory whereas whomever ended in second place is forgotten or, in the eyes of some rabid fans, tossed into the dustheaps of history.<br><br>I have borrowed the title of my talk today from a book by the historian of Japan, Ivan Morris. It is titled<i>The Nobility of Failure.</i>In his introduction Professor Morris wrote:<br><br><i>Our red-toothed, red-clawed world, attuned to the struggle for survival and dominance, reveres success, and its typical heroes are men and women whose cause has triumphed. Their victory is never without travail, and often its price is the hero's life. Yet, whether he survives to bask in the glory of his achievements ... or proudly dies ..., the effort and sacrifice will, in the most pragmatic sense, have been worthwhile.</i>[Ivan Morris,<i>The Nobility of Failure: Tragic Heroes in the History of Japan</i>(New York: Holt, Rinehart, and Winston, 1975), p. xxi]<br><br>Today I have chosen to share some thoughts on the worth of not being number one. Or, better said, I wish to emphasize that what appears to be failure is sometimes the greatest success. Only time and eternity reveal the greater truth.<br><br>I was impressed with part of Salt Lake Olympic Committee president Mitt Romney's message to the graduates of the Marriott School of Management this past April. Contrary to the kind of advice that is sometimes given to graduates--saying that if they will work hard they will surely succeed and grow rich--he forthrightly stated that even though we may work hard, keep the rules, cross every<i>t,</i>and eat everything on our plates, we might not be big successes in life. A good deal depends on fate or luck or circumstance. Sometimes the good guys do not win--or so it appears. He said his own father, Governor George Romney, following his defeat in his attempt to gain the Republican Party's nomination for the presidency, had this reaction: "I aspired, and though I achieved not, I was satisfied."<br><br>I have also been impressed with the post-presidency years of President Jimmy Carter, a man who has done much for our nation and the world. Defeat is not the end for truly good men and women.<br><br>Today I will share with you in brief form the story of 17 men who served the Church in a cause they considered a failure. The cause was the mission of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints to India, Burma, and Siam (Thailand) between 1851 and 1856. I first became aware of this great chapter in Church history when I wrote about it in my master's thesis. Recently, with many more sources and resources, I have rewritten the story of the mission:<i>Nothing More Heroic: The Compelling Story of the First LDS Missionaries in India</i>(Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Company, 1999).<br><br>Last summer my wife and I, in company with Shahram and Sarah Paksima--wonderful BYU students who served as our guides and helpers--traveled to India to retrace the footsteps of those early missionaries. Our goal was to visit as many of the cities and cantonments, villages, shrines, temples, and roads where missionaries of the Church's East India Mission served in the 1850s as was possible. We started our travels in Bombay. This was appropriate because Hugh Findlay, one of the first two full-time missionaries in India, served there and in Pune, 80 miles distant, for several years, most of it alone. We could have begun our trip in Calcutta, where the first converts to the Church were made, but our plans worked better from Bombay.<br><br>Wherever we went we looked for the imprint of their steps. Not much remained after almost 150 years, but most of the cantonments--military bases or camps--were still in place. We were surprised that they were so large--more like towns than camps. Our missionaries visited cantonments wherever they went in India. Unfortunately, because of military and government policies regarding preaching on cantonment, they were largely rejected and unable to have influence among the European military personnel. But I believe I'm getting a bit ahead of myself. I need to tell you at least the main parts of the story.<br><br>In 1849 two young Latter-day Saint sailors, George Barber and Benjamin Richey, neither of whom held the priesthood, sailed from Liverpool, England, to Calcutta, India. Because their ship needed repairs, it was put in dry dock, and they spent some time at a home for sailors. There they met a scripture reader named Maurice White. Their conversations with him regarding their newfound faith led them into company with a group called the Plymouth Brethren. The young sailors taught the restored gospel to their new friends, and soon several of them were converted. But because they held no priesthood authority, Barber and Richey had to leave their converts unbaptized when their ship sailed from Calcutta.<br><br>Some months later, written requests for living witnesses arrived in Liverpool from Calcutta. Church leaders decided to ask Joseph Richards, a Church member who was an elder, to visit with the Plymouth Brethren on his next trip to Calcutta. He was a sailmaker on the merchant ship<i>Gloriosa.</i>In June 1851, Richards met the Church's friends in Calcutta and baptized four of them--James Patrick Meik; his wife, Mary Ann; Matthew McCune; and Maurice White. Richards ordained White an elder and called him as president of the Wanderers Branch. These new members were the first to be baptized as Latter-day Saints in all of Asia. The Wanderers Branch was the first Church unit in Asia. Richards remained in Calcutta for only two weeks and then returned with his ship to England.<br><br>Based on this small success, Elder Lorenzo Snow, who was president of the Church's missionary work in Italy, Switzerland, and Malta, decided to include India in his jurisdiction. He sent Englishman William Willis to Calcutta and Scotsman Hugh Findlay to Bombay. Willis arrived in Calcutta on Christmas Day of 1851. Findlay arrived in Bombay by March or April 1852.<br><br>Initially, Elder Willis had wonderful success. He was greeted well and warmly by six members of the Church. White, the branch president, had left for England, but James Patrick Meik and Matthew McCune had taken up the work and had baptized several others. Meik was constructing a small meetinghouse in the heart of Calcutta. Elder Willis was pleased when representatives of various groups of Indians sought him out and exhibited interest in his message. Before long his ministry took him 20 miles or so beyond Calcutta in several directions. He regularly wrote to Church leaders in Liverpool regarding his successes. In January 1852 he wrote that he was "bounding with grateful emotions" that he had been called to preach the gospel in India ("Letter from Elder William Willis: The Gospel in Calcutta"<i>Millennial Star</i>14 [15 March 1852]: 91). He began baptizing groups of Indians--all former Christians, mostly Baptists. Four months later, in May 1852, he reported a Church membership of 189. Most of these were native farmers. There were about 19 Caucasians among the group.<br><br>Willis' seeming success and positive reports to England led Elder Snow to carry a positive recommendation to the leading Brethren in Salt Lake City that the East India Mission should be enlarged. On August 28–29, 1852, the Church held a special conference in Salt Lake City. The First Presidency called 108 missionaries to many states and nations. Nine elders were called to India and four were called to Siam (Thailand). They left Salt Lake City in late October and traveled south to San Bernardino by wagon train in a group of almost 40 missionaries. At San Bernardino they sold their wagons and stock and sent their money back home. Then it was on to San Pedro, where they found a small ship to carry them to San Francisco. After several weeks of unsuccessful fund-raising there, the elders were blessed to receive a large contribution from a California member named John M. Horner. They could now continue on to India. They sailed through the Golden Gate on January 28, 1853, and 86 days later arrived at Calcutta. Captain Zenos Winsor and his clipper ship, the<i>Monsoon,</i>had been wonderful hosts.<br><br>But on arriving in India the elders faced disappointing news. Elders Willis and Joseph Richards (who had returned to India as a full-time missionary in the summer of 1852), had left Calcutta to preach the gospel at various cities and cantonments up the Ganges basin. By April 1853 they were in the vicinity of Delhi. Furthermore, almost all of the native Indian members in and around Calcutta had already fallen away. There was also an apostasy among the European Saints. Only six or eight members remained of an expected 200.<br><br>The problem among the Indians related to their expectation to be paid to be members of the Church. The issue was complicated. Time will allow only a brief explanation. Indian converts were outcast when they joined any Christian church. They lost their place in society. They had no former social relationships, no occupation, no means of financial support, no place to live, and no community political rights or power. When they became Christians, they in effect became part of a Christian quasi-caste. Their occupation was now to be Christians, with all that implied. To be Christian was now their work. Conceivably, if asked what they did for a living, they might have answered, "I am a Christian." I'm stretching this just a little bit, but I want to make a point. When they went from denomination to denomination or from mission to mission seeking higher compensation, they were doing a somewhat reasonable thing within the context of their own experience and circumstances. They wanted the best pay they could get for doing their new caste occupation--being Christian. But this reality did not help the disappointed hearts of the missionaries. They considered these people to be hypocritical apostates and developed a great distrust for Indians.<br><br>Among the European members of the Church there was another problem--polygamy. At the same special conference at which the elders received their calls, the Church had made public its doctrine and practice of plural marriage. Word of this announcement arrived in Calcutta via the mail steamer three weeks before the elders arrived there. Polygamy was the shout heard round the world. The new members in Calcutta were deeply troubled by the doctrine, and some apostatized. But that was just the beginning. Nearly everywhere they went throughout the subcontinent, the elders were persecuted and rejected for their beliefs.<br><br>But there was nothing to do but go on. Soon after they arrived, Mission President Nathaniel V. Jones assigned the other eight India elders to places around the country. Two were assigned to go up the Ganges (they eventually traveled over a thousand miles to Delhi and beyond), three were sent to Madras, two were asked to go a few miles north to Chinsura (until they heard from Elder Findlay in Bombay), and Jones and a companion remained in Calcutta. Elder Chauncey W. West, who presided over the four Siam-bound elders, having learned that the way was hedged up to travel overland to Siam (a war was raging in Burma), made the decision to try to teach the gospel in Ceylon (modern Sri Lanka) and then move on to Siam when it was possible. He and Elder Benjamin F. Dewey went briefly to Ceylon and then on to Bombay, where Elder Hugh Findlay was laboring. They stayed there a few months and then sailed home around the south side of Sumatra, through the straits between that island and Java, around the east side of Borneo, through the South China Sea to Hong Kong, and then finally back to San Francisco.<br><br>One of the Siam elders, Elam Luddington, made it to Bangkok briefly but was persecuted by Christians and Buddhists and finally fled after 127 days in the country. His voyages home were frightening and life-threatening. The fourth Siam elder was Levi Savage, Jr. He spent most of his mission alone in Burma, where he learned to speak and write Burmese. On the way home from his mission, he joined with the Willie Handcart Company. It was Savage who warned that group not to go on because of the lateness of the date. Nevertheless, he went forward with that ill-fated company of emigrant pioneers and did his best to alleviate the suffering when it came.<br><br>Ultimately, the India elders visited most of the important cities on the subcontinent. They were not totally without success. They baptized well over 100 converts, 20 or so of whom emigrated to Zion. But they also saw a number of their converts weaken, wane, and wash away with the waves of criticism and persecution.<br><br>One of the most difficult problems for the elders was the news of missionary success from Britain and Denmark. In both places thousands of people were joining the Church and moving on to Utah to be with the Saints. The India missionaries discussed among themselves and also in their letters to the British Church periodical the<i>Millennial Star</i>their sense of failure when compared with the truly fruitful fields. They did their best to explain that matters in India were not like those in England. They occasionally complained in their journals and wished for a better place to teach the gospel.<br><br>Frankly, while traveling in India last year, I found it difficult. There are many, many people, and conditions leave much to be desired. I remember picking our way along the jam-packed, overworked sidewalk in downtown Calcutta. I found myself wondering how anyone survives with so much heat, so many buses and trucks belching black exhaust, so many people, so many taxis, so much humidity, so little sidewalk. How can anyone stand the constant pressure of hawkers and the pull at one's trousers of beggars clamoring for baksheesh? Getting across the street was like swimming perpendicular to a massive school of enormous, fuming fish. Looking upstream or down at the traffic was almost like watching a complex water ballet of vehicles weaving in and out. How can people drive such streets? How can anyone get anything done? Did our early missionaries really walk these very streets? I asked myself. No, the streets they walked have been gone a long time. But they walked and worked in this very place and many other places much like it. The early elders did not fight exhaust fumes or as many people in the streets, but the heat and humidity were almost unbearable. Poverty was ever present. Transportation was tediously slow and difficult. And diseases common to tropical climates--malaria, cholera, dysentery, and others--were a problem.<br><br>We traveled from place to place last summer in sturdy air-conditioned trains. When we rode through the countryside following the routes of the elders, we went in comfortable, air-conditioned automobiles. And when we retired for the night, we slept in clean hotel rooms after eating clean, tasty food. My heart goes out to our early missionaries who traveled so far on foot or by bullock cart. Many nights they slept on the ground under trees or in abandoned sheds, not knowing what kinds of varmints and poisonous snakes might share their rustic rest but trusting in Almighty God that he would spare their lives another night.<br><br>Among Europeans in India our missionaries seem to have been the only ones who walked and carried their own bags and belongings. Others felt it was beneath their station to stoop to such labor. Villagers found them odd and often stared at them as they plodded through their dusty or muddy paths. Lacking fresh water, our elders sometimes drank from wells, but usually drank from tanks, simple reservoirs used by the natives to catch monsoon rainwater. By the end of the year these reservoirs were rank and unsavory.<br><br>At times the temperatures were so high that sunstroke was almost unavoidable. Most Englishmen in India at that time would not leave their bungalows between 10 o'clock in the morning and the cool of evening. But the elders usually had no place to hide from the sun. One of the elders, William Carter, suffered so miserably in the heat that President Jones sent him home after only a couple months in the country. President Jones said Carter "was too far advanced in years and had been through too many hardships to stand the climate of India" (William F. Carter, "Incidents from the Journal of William F. Carter," in Kate B. Carter, comp.,<i>Heart Throbs of the West</i>[Salt Lake City: Daughters of Utah Pioneers, 1943], 4:17). This action probably preserved the life of the elderly Elder Carter. He was 42 at the time.<br><br>To summarize, the elders faced a number of problems. The single greatest deterrent to their success was the then-accepted doctrine of plural marriage. A second great problem was the refusal of the cantonment commanders to allow the elders to preach in those areas. Closely associated with this problem was the wholesale rejection of the elders by most of the Europeans throughout the country. They were an arrogant and haughty group who considered themselves above the elders and most other men. There was much corruption and immorality among the European civil servants and soldiers.<br><br>But was everything dark and evil? Were there no good people to assist the elders? Actually there were some wonderful people, native Indians and Europeans, who came to their aid and made their lives bearable and at times satisfying. In almost every city a few generous individuals provided places to sleep, rooms in which to preach, and food to eat. Others even paid for the publication of tracts, handbills, and pamphlets. Elder Skelton wrote that the only times he went hungry were the times when he didn't want to ask for food. The Lord always provided if Elder Skelton would ask. And in each major place--Calcutta, Madras, Bombay, Poona, Karachi, and Hyderabad--converts to the restored gospel gave freely of their personal resources to support the Lord's purposes. Perhaps the kindest people as a group were the captains of ships and river steamers. By count, the India and Siam elders sailed on at least 49 oceangoing sailing ships and river steamers. In a number of instances the captains took them gratis or at greatly reduced fares. Six of the elders sailed around the world without purse or scrip.<br><br>In closing, what can be said of the East India and Siam missions of 1851 to 1856? Relatively few converts were made. Certainly the missions did not change India or Siam. One of the important facts is that all 17 elders lived through the experience. This may sound trivial today, but I doubt if we could find another group of European men of similar age who went to India from England and America at that time who did not lose up to half of their number in a similar time period. Diseases and debauchery took many lives. Our elders suffered miserably with malaria, dysentery, and fevers of diverse kinds, but they were blessed to survive and return home to their loved ones. In addition to the problems related to health were those connected with travel. Various of the elders experienced harrowing times at sea. But they returned home safely.<br><br>Probably the most important observation we can make in historical retrospect is that the mission strengthened the missionaries' testimonies. They accepted the call from the Lord and did their best to establish the restored gospel in the mission field. As I have reviewed these men's journals and other writings, I have not found a single complaint or question regarding the wisdom of Elder Lorenzo Snow or President Brigham Young in sending them to India. The elders were obedient. They trusted in the Lord and in their leaders. Among these elders several announced publicly upon their arrival in Utah that they were ready to accept any future assignments from their priesthood leaders. For example, Elder Chauncey Walker West wrote:<br><br><i>I feel grateful to my Father in Heaven that my life has been spared to mingle again with the saints in these peaceful valleys, and I now report myself on hand for duty whenever the servants of God call, for the Priesthood is my law.</i>["The India Mission: Letter No. 5,"<i>Deseret News</i>5, no. 36 (14 November 1855): 286]<br><br>I should mention that these men were Church members with considerable experience. Most were married. The average age was 32. Richard Ballantyne had already founded the Sunday Schools of the Church before his call to India. Three of them had been in the Mormon Battalion. Others had fought in the Battle of Nauvoo in 1846. And still others had helped construct the Nauvoo Temple. One was among the first group of pioneers to enter the Valley of the Great Salt Lake. All of them died in the faith, and most of them lived long lives and produced a great posterity.<br><br>Another point is that even though convert baptisms were few, about 20 members emigrated to Utah to be part of the commanded gathering. The descendants of the Meiks, McCunes, Booths, Hefferans, Taits, Davies, and others who came to Zion are grateful for the missionary service rendered to their ancestors in India.<br><br>Finally, the Church was obedient to the Lord's commandment to take the gospel to every nation, kindred, tongue, and people. It was not easy to go to places like India, Burma, Ceylon, and Siam. But the Lord had commanded it. Did it matter if the elders did not have great success? Not really. The Lord was trying his Church and his people. To some the mere fact of going may not seem that important, but it was. In his dedicatory prayer of the Hong Kong Temple in May 1996, President Gordon B. Hinckley noted the faithfulness of the three elders who served in that unsuccessful mission at the same time the elders were in India. He prayed:<br><br><i>We are grateful for the faith of those who, nearly a century and a half ago, first came to Hong Kong as missionaries of Thy Church. Their labors were difficult and largely without reward. But their coming was an evidence of the outreach of our people to all nations of the earth, in harmony with the commandment of Thy Beloved Son that the gospel should be preached to every nation, kindred, tongue and people.</i>["Hong Kong Temple: 'May Thy Watch Care Be Over It'" (dedicatory prayer),<i>Church News,</i>1 June 1996, p. 4]<br><br>In a similar way we can honor the elders who served in India. They did not succeed impressively, but they went and they served and they remained faithful.<br><br>Observers of the martyred Joseph Smith might have found his life a failure if they had seen his limp and lifeless body on the ground at Carthage Jail. And many who looked on the Savior as he hung dying on the cross might have considered his mission a failure as well. But time has shown the apparent temporary failure of Joseph Smith to be but the prelude to the glorious growth of the Lord's work. And the Savior's apparent failure at Calvary was in actuality the greatest conquest in all eternity, the conquest over sin and death. That we may learn to distinguish between what appears to be success and what is success in eternal terms is my prayer, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>R.

<h1>g the Family - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Throughout history, stable societies have recognized (and protected) the family as the basic unit of society precisely because the family is the social unit that has the primary responsibility for rearing and educating children. The family has successfully performed these fundamental tasks, in large part, because peaceful existence within a secure family demands that family members recognize (and respect) not just "rights" but communal responsibilities. During the latter half of this century, however, a modern emphasis on autonomy has shifted the focus of academic and governmental energies away from the recognition of (and respect for) communal responsibilities to a focus on "individual rights."<br><br>An outstanding example is the United Nation&#39;s Convention on the Rights of the Child. The convention establishes previously unrecognized autonomy "rights" for children and interposes government between children and their parents to an unprecedented degree. The convention, in the words of Elder Bruce Hafen, goes a long way toward "abandoning children to their autonomy."<sup>1</sup>This abandonment of our children--and our families--continues apace. For example, in New York last week, my associate Kay (Kathryn Balmforth), who is another director of NGO Family Voice (also known as the World Family Policy Center), attended a preparatory meeting for the five-year review of the International Conference on Population and Development. There Kay watched for three days while the attendees of this important conference debated whether they would even include a reference to "parents" in a document that purportedly created a child&#39;s right to sexual freedom, sexual training, and reproductive choice. At this important international meeting, it seemed that the mere mention of parental guidance on sexual matters was anathema.<br><br>The social consequences have been disastrous. In the words of Elder Hafen, because of the "emerging but misguided tendency among some adults to defer increasingly to children&#39;s preferences," the modern world may well fail to encourage the "development of the personal competence needed to produce an ongoing democratic society comprised of persons capable of . . . responsible action."<sup>2</sup>It is time to appreciate (and correct) the consequences of the modern focus on autonomy and of disregard of the family. It is time to recognize and reemphasize the central role of the family community in creating and maintaining a stable society. It is time, in short, to direct some of the energy we have lavished on protection of the individual to the defense and protection of the family. Without this defense, the family, the most basic community of all, may be imperiled.<br><br>I first became involved with issues of family policy and society in June 1996, when, almost by accident, I attended a U.N. conference in Istanbul, Turkey. The conference, known as Habitat II,<sup>3</sup>was the culmination of a decade-long series of conferences designed to develop a "blueprint" for international (and ultimately domestic) legal relations during the coming century.<sup>4</sup>These conferences have been accurately perceived as significant international law-making events.<sup>5</sup>They have also followed a predictable (and extreme) ideological course primarily championed by a powerful lobby that, according to one scholar, "ha[s] marginalized parents, ignored the family, and denigrated cultural and religious values."<sup>6</sup>What made the Istanbul conference remarkable was that it departed from this set course.<br><br>As a result of an unusual series of events, I was selected to give a short four-minute speech before one of the drafting committees at the Habitat conference. The speakers who took the podium before me urged the conferees to recognize same-sex partnerships, increase funding for adolescent sexual reproductive services, provide 18 to 20 hours a day of government-sponsored day care, and take all "necessary steps" to insure that every woman was "fully employed" outside the home. Marriage and family, if noted at all by these speakers, were referenced primarily as institutions that reinforce odious cultural stereotypes and that subjugate and demean women. My message was rather different.<br><br>I began my remarks by informing the conferees that the family--as recognized in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other important U.N. documents--is the fundamental unit of society. It<i>is</i>the fundamental unit, moreover, precisely because it is the laboratory where little boys learn to love, respect, and work with little girls, and where little girls learn the same essential skills in dealing with little boys. I reminded the delegates that if we don&#39;t learn these skills within the home, there is little chance that we will learn them elsewhere. Accordingly, I urged the delegates to do what they could to strengthen the family rather than expend the vast majority of their energies and time creating substitute social structures--or, perhaps even worse, creating legal structures to intervene in and disarrange the family.<br><br>I pointed out, for example, that extensive studies had shown that the incidence of teenage pregnancy and abortions actually<i>increases</i>following the initiation of "traditional" sex education programs that emphasize the teaching of technical sexual "know-how," including the use of prophylactics. By contrast, however, the incidence of adolescent pregnancy, abortion, and sexually transmitted disease is dramatically reduced through family-based education programs.<br><br>At the conclusion of my short remarks, I emphasized the essential message of the First Presidency&#39;s proclamation on the family<sup>7</sup>: that there is a "fundamental connection" between a decent society and "the reinforcement of strong, stable families."<sup>8</sup>The "traditional family," I reminded the delegates in Istanbul,<br><br><i>is the necessary foundation for . . . larger communities because it is the sanctuary where women and men learn cooperation, sacrifice, love, and mutual support; it is the training ground where children learn the public virtues of responsibility, work, fair play, and social interdependence.</i><sup>9</sup><br><br>The basic structure of society, I asserted, "is built from the fundamental values fostered by strong families."<sup>10</sup>I concluded by urging the conferees to consider seriously the need to protect traditional values in drafting and implementing the Habitat Agenda.<br><br>The reaction to the speech was remarkable. Many of the speakers who had preceded me at the podium hissed as I returned to my seat. But most of the delegates in the audience gave me a standing ovation. Indeed, after the speech I was approached by the ambassador from Saudi Arabia, who embraced me warmly. "Where have you been?" he asked. Next, he asked a very important question: "What can we do?"<br><br>I gave the ambassador a short list of items that could be changed in the draft Habitat Agenda that would strengthen rather than weaken the family&#39;s central role. Just 36 hours later, the heads of the Arab delegations in Istanbul issued a joint statement announcing to the entire Habitat conference that its members would not sign the Habitat Agenda unless (and until) certain important changes were made.<br><br>As a result, and at the insistence of the heads of the Arab delegations, several very important changes were made in the Habitat Agenda. Instead of defining<i>marriage</i>and/or<i>family</i>in a manner that explicitly legitimated same-sex marriages and families (as did the original draft), the final Habitat Agenda defined the marital relationship as one between "husband and wife."<sup>11</sup>Instead of numerous explicit paragraphs mandating worldwide abortion on demand, only one (somewhat hedged) reference to "reproductive health" remained.<sup>12</sup>The Habitat Agenda, finally, formally recognized the family as "the basic unit of society" that "should be strengthened."<sup>13</sup><br><br>These developments, viewed from the perspective of current American and European legal trends, are significant. The Habitat conference sent a strong message that strengthening the family--not the simple recognition of more "rights" or the creation of additional substitute social units--is the answer to many of our modern problems.<br><br>This message, of course, is obvious. The family<i>is</i>the basic unit of society and<i>must</i>be strengthened. But the fact that this message is obvious has not prevented us from ignoring it. During the past 50 years, American and other societies have been much more preoccupied with the individual and the individual&#39;s rights, and, indeed, with the creation of wealth, than with protection of the basic social unit within which individuals survive and thrive. The consequences are now becoming apparent around the globe.<br><br>Justice Georg Fr. Rieber-Mohn, a member of Norway&#39;s Supreme Court, recently gave an address at the David M. Kennedy Center for International Studies at Brigham Young University that traced the close connection between the decline of the family and the decline of society. Because the justice&#39;s remarks vividly captured many of the root causes of modern social decline, I will quote from his remarks.<br><br>Justice Rieber-Mohn began by noting that at the conclusion of World War II, Norway (along with other Scandinavian countries) set out to create the ultimate "bonum commune" or "good society." According to the justice, Norway had a very good start. As he stated:<br><br><i>If one looks back on Norway&#39;s near postwar period--the 1950s--we had a homogeneous and stable society. The Labour Party had a clear majority in the Parliament, we had full employment and a slowly rising prosperity in the wide stratum of the population. A modern welfare state with increasingly better social security was beginning to take form. . . . Criminality was under control, the police and the courts were soundly entrusted, mother was at home taking care of her children, and marriages usually lasted a lifetime through.</i><sup>14</sup><br><br>By the conclusion of the 1950s, the justice recounted that poverty was virtually eradicated, medical care was extended to all, and education essentially became universal. Did Norway, therefore, enter social nirvana? Not according to Justice Rieber-Mohn:<br><br><i>From around 1965 to around 1995 the criminality in Scandinavia has more than quintupled. . . . In this thirty-year perspective, displacements have also appeared on the criminal front. Thefts and burglaries played an even more predominant role in the beginning of the period. Violence has later increased in dimension, even though thefts are still dominant. It is also my impression that within individual crime categories there has been a transition towards a steadily harder criminality. Violence is more brutal than previously. More often it is unprovoked, affecting completely innocent and coincidental victims, and, increasingly with use of knives and firearms. . . .</i><br><br><i>But it is not only the development of crime that agitates in this period. Also a series of other alarming tendencies increased. . . . From 1970 to 1988 the frequency of suicides in Norway doubled. . . . And if we look at the divorce frequency, it has quadrupled from 1960 until 1990. . . .</i>[Moreover,]<i>thirty-nine percent of the children born in Norway in 1995 were from informal cohabitations. It is undoubtedly known that this type of relationship is less stable than ordinary marriages.</i><sup>15</sup><br><br>Justice Rieber-Mohn, of course, describes Norwegian society, but parallels with the rest of the world are obvious. I don&#39;t have the statistics on the United States, but I believe that we can track similar trends. Indeed, the justice himself noted that this "dismal development in Scandinavia is maybe just a pale shimmer of much worse signs in the development in the United States."<sup>16</sup>As residents of the United States, we can affirm that Norway&#39;s "pale shimmer" is indeed an intense reality in America at the turn of the millennium.<br><br>What explains the abrupt negative developments noted by Justice Rieber-Mohn? The justice suggested at least two possible answers. The first involves the failure of a social theory. The second, and more fundamental answer, however, involves the failure of a social institution.<br><br>The first cause of Norway&#39;s modern difficulties, according to the justice, is the basic failure of "the classic Marxistic analysis and understanding of society that was so popular until just a few years ago."<sup>17</sup>I might question whether it was only popular until a few years ago. I think it may be growing in popularity as we speak. According to the justice, "If one removes poverty, social differences, unemployment, and social insecurity, one does<i>not</i>at the same time remove criminality, anguish, mental agony, and malice among people."<sup>18</sup>Material comfort, in sum, does not guarantee a decent, stable civilization. Poverty, insecurity, and the lack of education--and, indeed, the lack of individual rights--are social ills that must be battled, but their elimination will not secure an equitable society. As the Savior succinctly put it, "Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God" (Matthew 4:4).<br><br>The second cause for the decline of modern Norwegian society noted by Justice Rieber-Mohn involves the breakdown of the Norwegian family. It is a breakdown being repeated in far too many societies around the world today:<br><br><i>There can be no doubt that the contact between parents, and especially between mother and child, has been substantially reduced in our society in the course of a thirty-year period. In short, it has been expressed like this: "Mothers left the homes, and the fathers did not come home." . . .</i>[W]<i>omen left the home in the course of a few years. The time was right. I find it difficult to not see that many homes made a sacrifice for this. They sacrificed time--that is undisputable. But they also sacrificed nearness, security, love, and procurement of values from adults to children.</i><sup>19</sup><br><br>The brunt of the breakdown of the modern family has been born by those least able to bear it: our children. As Justice Rieber-Mohn noted:<br><br><i>Children were to a great extent entrusted more or less to improvised solutions before kindergarten facilities gradually became better. But common for these solutions, also kindergartens, is that parents transfer the responsibility for major parts of a child&#39;s upbringing to a larger extent to people whose values and function as models they know very little about. Most people in Norway will be very unwilling to loan their new car to a relatively unknown person, at least over any length of time. But one loans one&#39;s children to strangers for month after month and year after year, already from their second year of life. One is anxious for damages on the car, but one closes one&#39;s eyes to possible unfortunate influence on children--unless it concerns something as drastic as violence from a childminder or sexual abuse in a kindergarten.</i><sup>20</sup><br><br>What, if anything, can be done to halt the trends noted by Justice Rieber-Mohn? A definitive answer is well beyond the ken of a simple law professor from Utah. Nevertheless, I offer a few initial suggestions.<br><br>First of all, we must live "by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God" (Matthew 4:4). Three and one-half years ago, the First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles issued a proclamation to the world regarding the centrality and importance of the family unit. The fundamental truths taught in that proclamation must become a central part of our social discourse. A valiant, worldwide struggle for individual rights over the past 50 years has led many to assume (or at least presume) that autonomy is the fullest reality anyone can hope to achieve. But our collective faith in this modern chimera ignores the homely reality that, as the poet said, "no man is an island."<sup>21</sup>We exist and find ultimate fulfillment only as members of communities. No community is more important--more central--to who we are, what we can be, and what we should be than the family.<br><br>Let me become a little personal and depart from my text for a minute at this point to bear you my testimony about the importance of the Church&#39;s proclamation on the family. I was a bishop in Orem when that document was issued at Women&#39;s Conference in September 1995, as I recall. I remember attending that meeting and hearing it read by President Hinckley. My reaction at the time may have been the same reaction that many of you might have had. It was a nice document. It stated things that I believed in, truths that I understood and felt to be true, but I thought it was just a nice statement. I didn&#39;t expect that it would do much, and frankly, at the time, I was rather convinced that the world was on a tack where the world wouldn&#39;t listen. This was a proclamation to the world. In fact, I remember thinking as I drove home from the meeting, and my firm conviction at the time was, that the world not only wouldn&#39;t listen but perhaps couldn&#39;t listen.<br><br>In Istanbul I had an opportunity to speak about the proclamation to people who didn&#39;t even know they were hearing the words of a modern prophet. As a result of a four-minute speech that encapsulated a few of the ideas in that proclamation, I saw some amazing things happen. I have since described them as the legal equivalent to the parting of the Red Sea, and it was close to that kind of an event.<br><br>As I concluded that conference in Istanbul, I had the privilege of hiking to a mosque in Istanbul, the Süleymaniye. There I saw many of my Moslem brothers and sisters praying on a rug that my guide explained to me represented the tree of life. The tree at the bottom of the rug was in tight bud, but at the top where they placed their hands to pray, the tree was bearing white fruit. The guide explained that if we attained life in the presence of Allah, we would be in his presence and would be able to eat of the fruit of what he called the tree of life. At that moment I had a profound spiritual witness that we are indeed children of the same God. We are all children of the same Heavenly Father. He loves us, and he speaks to all of us through a modern prophet. I felt a kinship with my brothers and sisters there in that mosque that day that has changed my life. I bear you my witness that the proclamation on the family to the world is indeed the word of God to this generation and to the entire world at this time. Because of that fact, I&#39;ll go to my second point.<br><br>Second, we must be willing to engage in social discourse about the family even if the discourse (at times) becomes difficult. We have just concluded a very difficult meeting in New York involving the five-year review of the Conference on Population and Development. Things didn&#39;t go as well as we&#39;d hoped. There wasn&#39;t a miraculous parting of the Red Sea this time. There were some things that happened at this conference that, perhaps, were somewhat negative. Nevertheless, people listened, and seeds were planted. There have been changes made. When I look back at the difference between the way people are listening to the principles taught in the proclamation now, as opposed to three years ago when this whole project began, I&#39;m dumbfounded. I will never forget the U.N. ambassador who asked me, "Where have you been?" The answer at the time was, "Home in Provo, Utah, minding my own business."<br><br>In fact, I wasn&#39;t just minding my own business; I was busy writing law review articles, moaning and groaning about how bad things were and that they were only going to get worse. I found out in Istanbul that I didn&#39;t just have to moan and groan. I could stand on my feet, pull up my socks, take a deep breath, exhibit a little courage, and speak out the truth of modern prophets. The time has come for all who care about reversing the trends described by Justice Rieber-Mohn to make their presence known in the public square.<br><br>The first draft of the Habitat Agenda provided numerous prescriptions (and proscriptions) that would have significantly altered family life--including the very definition of<i>spouse.</i>The outcome at Istanbul would have been quite different if profamily advocates had stayed home. I daresay the outcome even at this last somewhat disappointing meeting in New York would have been different if profamily advocates had stayed home. There needs to be more than one voice on these issues. The world has heard one voice for an extended period.<br><br>From the 14th to the 17th of November 1999, the World Family Policy Center from Brigham Young University (formerly known as NGO Family Voice) will host (together with the Howard Center of Chicago, Illinois) the Second World Congress of Families in Geneva, Switzerland. The congress will bring together leading scholars, governmental officials, diplomats, and religious leaders from around the world to discuss strengthening the family "as the fundamental unit of society." In fact, I just received this morning from my fax machine a letter of confirmation from the Vatican that Cardinal Trujillo--the head of the Pontifical Council on the Family and head of the Congregation of the Faith, the most important of the three congregations within the Vatican--will be attending this congress as an official representative of the Catholic Church. As part of that effort, A Call from the Families of the World has been drafted by a prestigious international, interfaith community. Copies of the call have been placed in the lobby of this auditorium and are also available in 45 different languages at my office in the Law School. The call is also posted on the World Wide Web at www.worldcongress.org. I urge you to visit the Web site and learn more about the World Congress of Families. In particular, I urge you to read the call and sign it. The families of the world must make their voices heard.<br><br>Third, as we engage in social discourse about the family, it is time to thoughtfully (and prayerfully) reexamine the basics. According to Justice Rieber-Mohn, one of the basic causes for familial disintegration in Norway is mothers leaving the home. Although one answer (repeatedly given by modern prophets) is to encourage mothers to return home, this response may not be feasible in every situation. So how should families respond? This question will be difficult enough, but even more fundamental questions loom: Does marriage consist of a union between a man and a woman? If the answer to this question is "yes" (as the proclamation states), we have to answer the question with "why?" These questions must now be asked, and we must learn to give them answers. Thoughtful answers will help illuminate not only<i>what</i>roles families have traditionally played, but<i>why</i>society has valued the family and<i>how</i>that value can be perpetuated in the modern world.<br><br>Fourth, we should take all necessary steps to strengthen our own familial relationships. Although expert advice abounds and bookshelves groan on this subject, one of the best--and simplest--formulas for a successful family comes from an African-American scholar, Niara Sudarkasa. She has written that the Yoruba society from West Africa strove to inculcate "seven Rs" into family life: respect, responsibility, restraint, reciprocity, reverence, reason, and reconciliation.<sup>22</sup>Families that teach (and evidence) these remarkable traits will provide essential strength, not only for family members but for society (and the world) at large.<br><br>Fifth, and finally, we must retain faith in a faithless world. However out of style, we must not forget that a quest for transcendence is essential to human success. A recent visit to Rome reacquainted me with some of the greatest art in the world--much of it directly inspired by religious faith. Great works, including great families, require commitment to something greater than ourselves. And that, in the end, may be the most valuable gift that we gain by defending our families. I say this in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Richard G. Wilkins was a professor of law at the J.

The final version of paragraph 18 now adds that, while "various forms of the family exist," "marriage" arises out of the "free consent of the intending spouses, and husband and wife should be equal partners" (Habitat Agenda, chapter 2, Goals and Principles, par. 18). Thus, "marriage" involves "spouses" who are "husband and wife."<br><br>12. The draft of the Habitat Agenda prior to debate in Istanbul contained more than 28 explicit references to abortion. All of these references were dropped and replaced with a single admonition that governments "should" (not "must," as in the earlier draft) "ensure universal access for women throughout their life span to a full range of affordable health care services, including those<i>related to</i>reproductive health care" (Habitat Agenda, chapter 4, Global Plan of Action, par. 96[d][bis]; emphasis added).<br><br>The underlined words<i>related to</i>were added to clarify that abortion was not<i>necessarily</i>part of "reproductive health care." Prior to the Habitat Agenda, "reproductive health care" had been defined by the World Health Organization (a U.N. agency) as including the "interrupt[ion of] unwanted pregnancies."

<h1>te Look at Perfect - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Let me introduce my subject with a brief story. A month or so ago, on a Saturday morning, my wife, Barbara, was busy finishing a baptismal dress for a neighbor girl, and the house was in need of a good picking up and vacuuming. The need was there, so I did what I frequently do in such situations: I pressed the children into service. Unfortunately, I sometimes become grouchy when cleaning house. I noticed, however, that every time I asked my 12-year-old son Matt to do a job, he always responded with a smile and a genuinely cheery face. He was apparently trying to overcome my grouchiness by smiling--which became obvious to me, as it did to everyone else. I apparently kept ignoring the oh-so-obvious smiles, however, because Matt finally said, "Dad, whoever said that smiles were contagious didn't know about your antibodies." I finally melted into a smile.<br><br>Well, my antibody against the contagion of a smile is one of my several flaws, which, like a messy house, could use a good picking up and vacuuming. And that is only one of the several flaws I am aware of, thanks to the help of my wife and children. Who knows how many more flaws are lurking, hidden away from my discernment?<br><h2><i>Perfect</i><b>Versus<i>Complete</i></b></h2><br>The thought of such imperfections--obvious sometimes, but sometimes even hidden from ourselves--can be disconcerting in light of Christ's celebrated injunction: "Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect" (Matthew 5:48). Given the tough realities of everyday life, how can we be perfect, even as our Father is perfect? Such things as cleaning house, dealing with people who put us in uncomfortable situations, and reacting to smashed thumbs and road rage sometimes present us with a self-portrait, when looked at honestly, that is further removed from the perfect ideal than we would like to own up to. What we actually do when facing the problems of life compared to what we should do can sometimes lead to discouragement.<br><br>In what follows, I would like to explore the meaning of the word<i>perfect,</i>with the hope of showing that the bar that seems so high might be readily cleared by any one of us who really does love the Lord and sincerely wants to honor him. Simply put, I would like to show that<i>perfect</i>does not mean now what it used to mean in King James' time. Please understand that I do not aim to diminish Christ's injunction but to render it comprehensible in a gospel setting.<br><br>First, let me be clear that today<i>perfect</i>means something much more specific than it did 400 years ago. Originally, when borrowed from French, it meant 'finished, complete, excellent." It came to French from Latin<i>per-,</i>"completely," and<i>-facere,</i>"to do" (see<i>American Heritage Dictionary,</i>s.v. "perfect"). In modern English, however,<i>perfect</i>always raises in our minds a much more specific idea of "flawless, without defect." We hear, for example, "he pitched a perfect game," or "she got a perfect score on the exam," and so on. But the idea of "flawless" as the principal meaning of<i>perfect</i>is new to the English language.<br><br>What happened to change the meaning of<i>perfect?</i>The word<i>complete</i>came into English in the early 1300s, but with a highly restricted meaning. It only applied to "completeness of requisite parts"; for example, a complete assembly.<sup>1</sup>It could not apply to actions, states, and qualities, such as "complete purity," although it would have been proper back then to say "perfect purity," meaning "complete purity." But just about the time the King James translators were at work, the meaning of<i>complete</i>was expanding to include actions, states, and qualities.<sup>2</sup>With this expansion of<i>complete</i>came the contraction of<i>perfect,</i>so that today<i>perfect</i>still means "complete," but additionally it always means "without flaw." It is for this reason that the various forms of the word<i>perfect</i>occur 123 times in the Old and New Testament, whereas<i>complete</i>occurs only three times. Furthermore, the Hebrew and Greek words that wound up being translated "perfect," in the main, have the general notion of "complete" or "end."<br><br>That said, let us take a fresh look at the notion "complete" to see what it might mean to be complete in a broader gospel context, reminding ourselves that anything that is perfect is necessarily complete, but anything that is complete is not necessarily perfect.<br><h2><b>Completion in Covenant</b></h2><br>In the first place, all covenants, agreements, contracts, bonds, treaties, and the like are founded on the idea of completeness. By definition, a covenant is a set of instructions agreed upon by two parties that outlines their behavior. When I agree, as one party, to take upon myself Christ's name, to remember him always and to keep his commandments, and the Lord agrees, as the other party, that his spirit will be with me always, then we are brought together by the renewal of the baptismal covenant. A covenant is the means by which two incomplete parties become one--a completed whole. In his beautiful prayer to his Father, Christ made this point in John 17:21–23:<br><br><i>That they all may be one; as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in us. . . .</i><br><br><i>And the glory which thou gavest me I have given them; that they may be one, even as we are one:</i><br><br><i>I in them, and thou in me, that they may be made perfect</i>[or complete]<i>in one.</i><br><br>If we think of<i>perfect</i>as "complete," then we can see how it is possible for God, Christ, and their true followers to be<i>really</i>one, brought from incompletion to completion by covenant.<br><br>If<i>covenant--</i>which literally means "coming together"--is an agreement by two parties to do something, there is a second part: actually doing it. If I agree that I will show up at 11 in the morning on Tuesday, July 13, 1999, to give a devotional, and either I or all of you do not come (both thoughts occurred to me), then the agreement is breached: it is a defective, incomplete contract. All covenants are validated only on condition that two parties complete what they agreed to do.<br><h2><b>Completion in Marriage</b></h2><br>Bringing two otherwise incomplete individuals to a complete whole by covenant is also the very definition of marriage. In a response to the Pharisees, Christ, quoting Genesis 2:24, said, "Have ye not read, that . . . for this cause shall a man leave father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife: and they twain shall be one flesh? Wherefore they are no more twain, but one flesh" (Matthew 19:4–6). Christ was essentially speaking here of a covenant, since marriage is a set of agreed-upon instructions that guides the behavior of a man and a woman. Ideally they act toward each other in ways different from anyone else in the world because of that agreement and that covenant. They become one flesh in the real sense of covenant.<br><br>In marriage we are complete, as our Father and Mother in Heaven are complete.<br><br>But in another more literal sense, the married couple can become one flesh. We know by modern science that before each one of us here was anybody, we were two distinct germ cells: one a meiotic cell of 23 chromosomes from our biological father and the other a similar cell from our biological mother. We were nothing until the union of those two incomplete cells, yielding a full complement of 46 chromosomes.<br><br>At the instant of union, our parents became "one flesh" through us, which miracle of new life constitutes possibly the highest form of all covenants. Indeed, by becoming one flesh, parents not only create new life but a new family--the very foundation upon which all enduring societies rest. The evidence is overwhelming that children do better with the appropriate contributions of both a mother and a father. It is not difficult to see that social systems founded on such families likewise do better. The good health of a nation and even the international community really is founded on the family as defined in the proclamation set forth by the First Presidency and the Council of the Twelve (see "The Family: A Proclamation to the World,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 1995, p. 102).<br><br>With the biological covenant of new life and the consequent social covenant of new families comes the need for connection to all those families that preceded us.<br><h2><b>Completion in Temple Work</b></h2><br>This brings us to a related but different kind of completion, one without which the Lord will<br><br><i>come and smite the earth with a curse.</i><br><br><i>. . . It is sufficient to know, in this case, that the earth will be smitten with a curse unless there is a welding link of some kind or other between the fathers and the children. . . . For we without them cannot be made perfect; neither can they without us be made perfect.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 128:17–18]<br><br>In reference to this scripture, Elder Russell M. Nelson made the point that "<i>perfect</i>was translated from the Greek<i>teleios</i>meaning 'brought to its end, finished, complete'd" ("A New Harvest Time,"<i>Ensign,</i>May 1998, p. 36, footnote 10). With the restoration of all these and other keys of past dispensations, we have "a whole and complete and perfect union, and welding together of dispensations, and keys, and powers, and glories" (D&amp;amp;C 128:18).<br><br>Again, the doctrine of completion is manifest, because we become, as it were, "saviors on Mount Zion" by being proxies for those who otherwise do not have earthly access to saving ordinances. We become one with our ancestors through temple work. Joseph Smith said:<br><br><i>But how are they to become saviors on Mount Zion? By building their temples, erecting their baptismal fonts, and going forth and receiving all the ordinances, baptisms, confirmations, washings, anointings, ordinations and sealing powers upon their heads, in behalf of all their progenitors who are dead, and redeem them that they may come forth in the first resurrection and be exalted to thrones of glory with them; and herein is the chain that binds the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the children to the fathers, which fulfills the mission of Elijah.</i>[<i>Teachings,</i>p. 330; see also pp. 191 and 366]<br><br>It is this grand vision of completion--Elijah's magnificent mission of binding all Adam and Eve's children into one unbroken whole--that finds concrete manifestation in the current explosion of new temples and genealogical interest. There are currently 57 complete temples and another 57 under construction (see LDS Gems on the Internet), and there are millions of hits each day on the Church's new genealogy Web site. Elder Nelson has told us that "microfilming has been done in 110 countries, accumulating more than 2 billion exposures with approximately 13 billion names" (Nelson, "A New Harvest Time," p. 35). This stunning growth was unimaginable just a few short years ago.<br><br>"As man now is, God once was: As God now is, man may be" (Lorenzo Snow, in Eliza R. Snow,<i>Biography and Family Record of Lorenzo Snow</i>[Salt Lake City: Deseret Company, 1884, 1975], p. 46; see also<i>Teachings of Lorenzo Snow,</i>comp. Clyde J. Williams [Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1984], pp. 2, 5). We have the potential of becoming complete even as our Father in Heaven is complete. What a sweeping, vast vision Joseph was able to share with us.<br><h2><b>The Completion of the Resurrection</b></h2><br>The stern reality of our own death also requires the doctrine of completion, since death in its broadest sense is a disjoining of parts that are otherwise properly intact. The Doctrine and Covenants makes it clear that "spirit and element, inseparably connected, receive a fulness of joy; and when separated, man cannot receive a fulness of joy" (D&amp;amp;C 93:33–34). Elder Melvin J. Ballard's poignant description of how we might long for our bodies in the spirit world underlines one of the unique and wonderful doctrines of Mormonism (see<i>Melvin J. Ballard: Crusader for Righteousness</i>[Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1966], p. 213). Contrary to beliefs held by others, one of Mormonism's great contributions to theology is that the body is not evil, but good. We need to be complete--spirit<i>and</i>element--even as our Father in Heaven is complete, so that we, like him, can receive a fullness of joy. It is probably significant that in the Old World Christ said, "Be ye therefore perfect [complete], even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect" (Matthew 5:48); whereas in the New World,<i>after</i>his resurrection, he said, "Therefore I would that ye should be perfect even as I, or your Father who is in heaven isperfect" (3 Nephi 12:48). The Resurrection made him complete--like his Father. In the Resurrection we will be made complete, even as our Father and now Christ are complete.<br><h2><b>The Completion of the Atonement</b></h2><br>If the Resurrection is Christ's universal gift to God's children, then the Atonement is his particular gift, given only to the penitent. And if the Resurrection welds spirit to body to overcome physical death, then the Atonement joins our spirit to the Holy Spirit to overcome spiritual death. And, as the Resurrection brings completion, the Atonement also brings completion, but unlike the Resurrection, completion comes in two distinct but related ways:<br><br>First, our sins bring an imbalance to the scales of eternal justice; paying for our sins, Christ brings those scales back to a complete and perfect equilibrium. In the words of Mosiah, God gave "the Son power to make intercession for the children of men--Having . . . taken upon himself their iniquity and their transgressions, having redeemed them, and satisfied the demands of justice" (Mosiah 15:8–9). We are justified through Christ: the price has been paid to the last farthing, and equilibrium is complete.<br><br>Second, the Atonement--literally<i>at-one-ment--</i>is the completion of a covenant, which in its simplest form is this: We stop sinning and Christ pays for our sin. There are those who say that salvation comes from works--from the absolution that comes from the sacraments. Others say that it comes from faith--from declaring Jesus to be the Savior. This is the ancient debate of faith and works. Works are defined as the sacraments (or, in our terms, ordinances). Faith is defined as proclaiming Jesus as the Savior of the world. But we know from modern scriptures that remission of sin comes from sacrifice--sacrifice on Christ's part and sacrifice on our part:<br><br><i>Behold he offereth himself a sacrifice for sin, to answer the ends of the law, unto all those who have a broken heart and a contrite spirit; and unto none else can the ends of the law be answered.</i>[2 Nephi 2:7]<br><br><i>And ye shall offer up unto me no more the shedding of blood; yea, your sacrifices and your burnt offerings shall be done away. . . .</i><br><br><i>And ye shall offer for a sacrifice unto me a broken heart and a contrite spirit. And whoso cometh unto me with a broken heart and a contrite spirit, him will I baptize with fire and with the Holy Ghost.</i>[3 Nephi 9:19–20]<br><br>If we are justified through Christ's absorbing our sins, we are sanctified through a process involving three steps: First, we genuinely suffer a broken heart and a contrite spirit for our sins. Second, we consequently manifest our sorrow by leaving behind us those sins; we go our way and sin no more. Third, we are sanctified through the baptism of fire and the Holy Ghost.<br><br>The bottom line is this: We were once spiritually dead through a separation from God by the absence of his spirit, but we are now, so to speak, resurrected--spiritually made alive--by the baptism of fire and the Holy Ghost. We were once sinful and incomplete, but through the process of the Atonement we are both justified and sanctified, completely and wholly.<br><br>We are in this sense complete, even as our Father in Heaven is complete--and one step nearer to being like him, too.<br><h2><b>Completion Through the Church</b></h2><br>I have always appreciated Paul's wonderful metaphor comparing the body of Christ--the Church--to the body of a person. He said that<br><br><i>the body is not one member, but many. . . .</i><br><br><i>And the eye cannot say unto the hand, I have no need of thee: nor again the head to the feet, I have no need of you. . . .</i><br><br><i>That there should be no schism in the body; but that the members should have the same care one for another. . . .</i><br><br><i>Now ye are the body of Christ, and members in particular.</i>[1 Corinthians 12:14, 21, 25, 27]<br><br>To me, what he is saying is that each of us as a member of Christ's body is incomplete--as incomplete as any given organ of our body is incomplete: "If the whole body were an eye, where were the hearing? If the whole were hearing, where were the smelling?" (1 Corinthians 12:17), and so on. Truly, none of us<i>can</i>be saved as individuals. We are saved as Zion, because you and I complement each other. What I cannot do, you can do. What you cannot do, I (or someone else) can.<br><br>My daughters Kirsten and Jennifer recently came home from girls' camp. Having four teenagers (I count my 12-year-old because he acts like one), my wife and I are acutely aware that we cannot be all things to our children. We cannot do some things that others can. We are incomplete. From my point of view, it is almost incalculable the preparation, work, time, energy, and goodwill that the Young Women leaders of our ward did to bring girls' camp to its successful conclusion. And I believe that the eternal good that was done, spiritually and physically, in behalf of those girls truly is incalculable. All that my ward sisters did, multiplied by the millions who oversee girls' camps and Scout camps, who teach Sunday and weeknight lessons, who home teach and visit teach, who work on welfare farms, who go on missions, and so on, contribute to the general good. All of us in our incomplete states need each other to bless and receive blessings. We complete each other.<br><br>I believe that the Lord in his genius set up the Church in such a way that we do not go and pay someone to give us a beautiful Sunday lesson. He requires sacrifice from us. When we accept a calling, we agree to prepare a lesson and be there to teach the nursery--whether it is convenient or not. It is a kind of covenant. The older I get the more I am convinced that all sin--all of it--has its roots in the dirty soil of self-gratification and self-absorption. Any sin I can imagine--from stealing to covetousness to adultery to murder--has at its core an exaggerated sense of self. But the Lord has set up an organization that is<i>structurally</i>designed to combat the over-exaggerated self, since every Church calling I know of is premised on service to others.<br><br>I think it is for this reason that Paul says that the body of Christ is for the perfecting [completion] of the Saints:<br><br><i>And he gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers;</i><br><br><i>For the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ:</i><br><br><i>Till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ.</i>[Ephesians 4:11–13]<br><br>As committed workers in Christ's Church, we learn to be Christians, both inside and outside the Church. In his Church, we are completed.<br><h2><b>Completion of This Talk</b></h2><br>At this point I can imagine you might be anxious for the completion of this talk. I am prepared to satisfy your anxiety. Just let me conclude by saying this: I believe that God, in his genius, has made it possible for us, in a very practical way, to become complete like him. He has given us great and true covenants, including especially the baptismal covenant and those wonderful guides to life, the temple covenants. He has given us the institution of marriage, where spouses complete each other and become one flesh through their children. He has given us--in all our imperfections--the opportunity to be saviors on Mount Zion, to be a part of the complete, eternal linking of all of Adam's children. He has given us his Son to bring body back to spirit to overcome physical death and to bring the Holy Spirit back to our spirit to overcome spiritual death. He has given us his Church to help us overcome the vanity of self through service to others.<br><br>In short, he has given us a practical religion, which, if lived, brings us "unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ"--and to his Father. I could not say it better than Brigham Young:<br><br><i>I am decidedly in favor of practical religion--of everyday useful life. And if I today attend to what devolves upon me to do, and then do that which presents itself tomorrow, and so on, when eternity comes I will be prepared to enter on the things of eternity. But I would not be prepared for that sphere of action, unless I could manage the things that are now within my reach. You must all learn to do this.</i>[<i>JD</i>5:3–4; text modernized]<br><br>The gospel is true. I love it and would recommend it to anyone who wants to live a complete life in this imperfect world and in the worlds to come.<br><br>I leave these thoughts with you in the name of our Savior, Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>John S. Robertson was a BYU professor of linguistics and chair of the Linguistics Department when this devotional address was given on 13 July 1999.</i><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>1.

<h1>hip and the Gospel - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Brothers and sisters, I would like to share with you this morning some scholarly developments that I think are very exciting. But, as I hope to persuade you, they are exciting not merely in an academic sense. If they were not more than that, they would have little or no claim on the attention of a university devotional assembly. I believe, and I know I am not alone in this belief, there is divine purpose in the things I will treat today. I believe that there is more going on here than our own merely human efforts can fully explain. Moreover, if I did not believe, passionately, that scholarship and the gospel belong together, I would not be here at Brigham Young University.<br><br>In November of this year, the Foundation for Ancient Research and Mormon Studies, or FARMS, will celebrate its 20th birthday. John Welch and several of his fellow attorneys developed the idea for FARMS while car-pooling to work in Los Angeles. Since then, the foundation has grown in a remarkable fashion from a tiny shoestring operation to a substantial organization that sponsors and coordinates significant research, publishes weighty books, and distributes its findings to every corner of the globe.<br><br>I might add here my strong feeling that Jack Welch represents a striking instance--and hardly the last--of how uniquely qualified people and necessary resources have been raised up or provided at crucial junctures. Surely lawyers who possess expertise in tax-exempt foundations--accompanied by training in ancient languages and literatures at BYU, Oxford, and Duke--can't be all that common.<br><br>FARMS took a major step when Professor Welch joined the faculty of the law school here at Brigham Young University. Whereas the foundation continued to be independent and self-supporting, it received some very basic assistance--in the form of work space, for example--from BYU. And its proximity to the scholars and scholarly resources of the Church's flagship school was crucial to what FARMS would become.<br><br>One of the elements of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints that distinguishes it from other Christian movements is its openness to scriptural texts beyond the Bible:<br><br><i>Wherefore, because that ye have a Bible ye need not suppose that it contains all my words; neither need ye suppose that I have not caused more to be written.</i><br><br><i>For I command all men, both in the east and in the west, and in the north, and in the south, and in the islands of the sea, that they shall write the words which I speak unto them; for out of the books which shall be written I will judge the world, every man according to their works, according to that which is written.</i><br><br><i>For behold, I shall speak unto the Jews and they shall write it; and I shall also speak unto the Nephites and they shall write it; and I shall also speak unto the other tribes of the house of Israel, which I have led away, and they shall write it; and I shall also speak unto all nations of the earth and they shall write it.</i><br><br><i>And it shall come to pass that the Jews shall have the words of the Nephites, and the Nephites shall have the words of the Jews; and the Nephites and the Jews shall have the words of the lost tribes of Israel; and the lost tribes of Israel shall have the words of the Nephites and the Jews.</i><br><br><i>And it shall come to pass that my people, which are of the house of Israel, shall be gathered home unto the lands of their possessions; and my word also shall be gathered in one. And I will show unto them that fight against my word and against my people, who are of the house of Israel, that I am God, and that I covenanted with Abraham that I would remember his seed forever.</i>[2 Nephi 29:10–14]<br><br>Still, as the passage just quoted clearly says, the Book of Mormon by itself does not exhaust the treasures of revelation and scripture that we can expect to receive in this last dispensation. Nor does it seem that even our other standard works, the Doctrine and Covenants and the Pearl of Great Price, represent the last that is to be received.<br><br>In a passage familiar to most Latter-day Saints, Isaiah prophesied of a people who would "be brought down," who would "speak out of the ground," whose "speech shall be low out of the dust," a "whisper out of the dust" (Isaiah 29:4). We generally take this to refer to the coming forth of the Book of Mormon. But the recovery of the Book of Mormon actually unleashed a spectacular flow of ancient documents that have literally begun to be restored to us from "the ground" and "out of the dust." The Dead Sea Scrolls and the Coptic Gnostic library at Nag Hammadi, in Egypt, are probably the most famous of these, but the list is considerably more extensive. Professor Hugh Nibley, who could be described without too much exaggeration as the "patron saint" of FARMS, has alerted us over the past half century to the immense importance that some of these documents may have for the study of Latter-day Saint scripture and doctrine.<br><br>Several years ago, through contacts established by Professor Truman Madsen, FARMS became involved with Dr. Emanuel Tov, the leader of the international editorial team working on the Dead Sea Scrolls, and with Dr. Weston Fields, the head of Jerusalem's Dead Sea Scrolls Foundation. Out of those contacts emerged a project to produce an electronic, searchable version of the scrolls, drawing on BYU's unique strengths in computer manipulation of texts in different languages and scripts.<br><br>Something else that emerged was the Center for the Preservation of Ancient Religious Texts, or CPART. FARMS established CPART when it became apparent that producing a scrolls database was a very, very big undertaking. CPART functions as a department of FARMS, specializing (unlike the rest of the foundation) in projects that, although they may well be of deep interest to Latter-day Saints, have no obvious or immediate Mormon connection and most likely have a largely non-LDS audience. Indeed, the mission of CPART is to make ancient texts (and some medieval texts) available, essentially without commentary or "spin." What their audience then makes of those texts--and, indeed, what the Latter-day Saints connected with CPART make of them when not wearing their CPART "hats"--is something with which the center, as such, does not concern itself.<br><br>Professor Noel Reynolds, who was then also the president of FARMS, served as the first director of CPART, and it was he, along with Professor Donald Parry, who spearheaded the scrolls project from its beginning.<br><br>Our involvement with the scrolls has put CPART, FARMS, and Brigham Young University at the very focus of current research in the area. Indeed, Weston Fields, the director of the Dead Sea Scrolls Foundation in Jerusalem, has said that Provo, Utah, is now--along with Jerusalem itself and the University of Notre Dame--one of the three most active centers for scroll research in the world. CPART, for instance, owns one of the world's largest collections of scroll images, and there are now four members of the BYU faculty (professors Donald Parry, Dana Pike, David Rolph Seely, and Andrew Skinner) working on the international Dead Sea Scrolls editorial team. When FARMS and BYU hosted an international conference on the scrolls in 1996, virtually every scholar in the field came from throughout North America, Europe, and Israel to Provo. Some of the people who attended were so famous--I had been reading their work since I was young--that I had assumed they were<i>dead.</i><br><br>The FARMS/BYU compact disk of the Dead Sea Scrolls has been circulating to leading scholars in a beta version for some time now. Come September, the prestigious Dutch academic publishing house E. J. Brill, of Leiden, will begin to distribute it publicly.<br><br>Given the controversies surrounding the scrolls, and the difficulty that all but a few scholars have had in getting access to them during the 50-plus years since their discovery, their appearance in an easily searchable electronic version is a potentially revolutionary development. It will, I think, have incalculable ramifications for their future study. Soon anyone in the world will be able to work through the scrolls--either in transcription or by studying enhanced photographs of the original documents themselves--in the comfort of his or her private study. The significance of such work for understanding the formative period of both Judaism and Christianity is incalculable.<br><br>It is gratifying to realize that Latter-day Saints, and the Latter-day Saint university, have played a pivotal role in this effort--an effort that truly brings the Dead Sea Scrolls "out of the dust."<br><br>As FARMS and CPART began to assemble a team of people who could handle the demands of the Dead Sea Scrolls project, one of those who joined up was our computer and technical expert, Steve Booras. Brother Booras has been immensely helpful in that project, but he has also come to be our leader (in conjunction with others from the College of Engineering and Technology and among BYU's computer specialists) in an entirely different field, where Latter-day Saint expertise is developing a worldwide reputation.<br><br>Multispectral imaging is a technology that allows us to take digital images of documents or document-analogues using the optimal areas of the spectrum for recovering the information they contain. Brother Booras took his equipment to the ancient Maya site of Bonampak, for instance, just over the Mexican border from Guatemala, to join an expedition jointly sponsored there by BYU, Yale University, and the National Geographic Society. The famous murals of Bonampak, which were painted around a.d. 800, are deteriorating, and it seemed urgent to capture the best possible images of them before they decayed any further. Using multispectral imaging, Brother Booras was able to capture beautiful pictures of the stunning murals. Astonishingly, though, the equipment was also able to detect hieroglyphic writing beneath the murals that nobody--including the ancient Maya themselves--had seen since the murals were painted over them 12 centuries ago. And this was done, as a physician might say, "noninvasively"; there was no need to peel off or otherwise damage the murals to get at the underlying texts.<br><br>Since then, Brother Booras and Professor Gene Ware have used the same technology in the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan. There the challenge was posed by documents recently recovered from the ruins of a Byzantine church situated at the famous site of ancient Petra that had burned down in the early 500s of the Christian era. Carbonized but not quite destroyed, these Greek papyri had proven frustrating to conventional photographic techniques. But they can now be read, thanks to multispectral imaging.<br><br>When Brothers Ware and Booras reported on their results at a meeting of papyrologists--specialists in the study and handling of ancient papyri--in Florence, Italy, Professor Marcello Gigante was in the audience. He immediately wanted to know if similar technology could be applied to ancient texts retrieved from the so-called "Villa of the Papyri" in Herculaneum, just outside Naples. Herculaneum was destroyed in a.d. 79 by the same horrific eruption of Mount Vesuvius that annihilated the people of nearby Pompeii. Since the 18th century, hundreds of papyrus pieces have come out of the ruins of the villa, simultaneously preserved and carbonized by the lava and mud in which they were covered. There is, in fact, hope that the main library is still there to be found.<br><br>Preliminary work by Brother Booras and Professor David Rolph Seely was spectacularly successful in making the papyrus texts--which seem to represent a wealthy library concentrated on Epicurean philosophy--clear and bright, as if they had just been written. It is even possible, in some cases, to see accidental marks inadvertently made by the scribe as he copied the text.<br><br>Accordingly, we have decided to send Steve Booras and his wife over to Naples in the fall to head up what will probably be a six-month project to produce clear digital images of the ancient papyri of Herculaneum. In doing so, we will restore voices not merely from the dust but from the rock-hardened lava flow of a natural catastrophe that had effectively silenced them since the first century of the Christian era.<br><br>The Dead Sea Scrolls project and multispectral imaging represent the two areas in which CPART functioned until last year, when I was appointed the first full-time director of the center. I brought with me a project that had, until then, lacked a real institutional home. It has now found one in FARMS and its Center for the Preservation of Ancient Religious Texts.<br><br>In my own special field of Islamic studies, I had always strongly felt that more translations were needed of the major, classical texts of Islamic civilization. Barring such translations, one had either to become a specialist--to devote years of study to mastering difficult languages like Arabic and Persian (or Farsi)--or, essentially, to give up on reading most of the primary sources. Unlike classical Greece and Rome, for which multiple versions of Homer, Plato, Virgil, Aristotle, Ovid, and Sophocles are readily and cheaply available even for casual readers, it is very difficult for all but a specialist to gain access to al-Farabi, al-Ghazali, Avicenna, and their peers.<br><br>This is especially unfortunate, it seems to me, for a people who have received the divine command to "seek . . . out of the best books words of wisdom" (D&amp;amp;C 88:118). Some of the greatest books ever written--in philosophy, science, medicine, literature, and mathematics--were produced by the great world civilization of Islam. But they have remained largely inaccessible to the West.<br><br>So a few years ago, with the support of the BYU administration and vital help from several extremely generous donors, we were able to establish the Islamic Translation Series at Brigham Young University. So far we have published two volumes in the series with strong English translations and the original Arabic texts on facing pages, and we have many more in the pipeline. In fact, the story with the Islamic Translation Series has been much the same as it has been for CPART in general: Successful completion of one project has drawn more attention, which has in turn brought in more projects. Various metaphors come to mind, such as a snowball rolling downhill and becoming an avalanche. More often, though, as I try to direct or at least to keep on top of what is happening, I think in terms of the old image of trying to take a drink from a fire hose. It is far better than a drought, of course, but a bit difficult to manage nonetheless.<br><br>During a recent trip to Tehran, I was promised two new manuscripts for the series. A professor at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem is proposing joint ventures. A member of the Martin-Buber Institut at Germany's University of Cologne has submitted two translations to us of Arabic medical works by the illustrious medieval rabbi, philosopher, and physician Moses Maimonides. Impelled by these new texts, we are establishing a subseries devoted to Arabic science.<br><br>The series is having international impact. I had imagined that it would, but I confess that I did not realize how soon or how much. Copies of our books have been presented to university leaders throughout Israel/Palestine and Jordan. The Grand Shaykh of al-Azhar University in Egypt, one of the oldest and most prestigious of Islamic educational institutions, has a copy, and the ambassador of Egypt recently requested 10 more copies for religious leaders in his country. An Austrian professor, a Latter-day Saint, has made formal presentations of the volumes to several leading libraries in that area of Europe, and I know that the First Presidency has offered volumes as gifts to a visiting Indonesian political leader and to Jehan Sadat, the widow of the late president of Egypt, when she came to Utah. Copies have been given to Muslim religious dignitaries from the People's Republic of China and to guests from Islamic areas of Russia.<br><br>Three gala dinners have been held in Washington, D.C., Beverly Hills, and New York City to celebrate the series. President Bateman and a member of the Council of the Twelve spoke at each of them to audiences of Islamic community leaders, academics, and dozens of Muslim consuls and ambassadors. At the event in Washington, D.C., a number of senators and congressmen attended; in New York, the senior members of the staff of the secretary general of the United Nations were present and enthusiastic. More than one said to us, effectively, "No other group treats us with the respect that you show to us." We are now discussing receptions that will be hosted by the embassy of Egypt in Washington and by two or more Islamic countries at the United Nations in New York early next year to mark the publication of additional volumes.<br><br>Probably most touching to me, though, was an encounter during my recent trip to Iran. Three female university students, clad from head to toe in coal-black chadors, approached rather tentatively and handed me a handwritten note thanking me, in earnest if quirky English, for the Islamic Translation Series. If I had had any doubts that the series could serve as a small but real bridge between sometimes estranged cultures, that settled it. There are probably not two more alienated countries right now than the United States of America and the Islamic Republic of Iran, yet this small academic project managed to rise above differences of religion and politics.<br><br>Now let me say at this point that I do not relate these anecdotes to take pride in them or to boast. I myself am astonished at the reception that CPART's efforts are receiving. And, again, I cannot help but think that there is something--Someone--at work here, something far beyond our meager and sometimes stumbling efforts.<br><br>My one concern continues to be: Do we have the resources--human and financial--to handle all of the opportunities that are coming our way?<br><br>The potential projects arriving on our doorstep seem to be endless. We have been asked, Can you do the same thing for Maya glyphic texts that you have done for the Dead Sea Scrolls? Answer: Yes, we can. Can you, another asks, do a similar project with Greek, for the New Testament and for related papyri? Yes. And with comparative ease. The WordCruncher software developed here at BYU is a marvelous tool; it is fundamental to the Dead Sea Scrolls database and would be at the heart of any other such project. So we are exploring prospects for working with the Ancient Biblical Manuscripts Center in Claremont, California, on a global New Testament text project, and we are thinking seriously about papyrus collections in Europe and on the monastic peninsula of Mount Athos in Greece. I personally hope that we can someday move forward with a project on the great ancient cuneiform library at Ebla, now that Professor Terry Szink has joined the faculty at BYU.<br><br>Thus far we have found the resources arriving on our doorstep when we needed to move forward. And, I admit, I've come almost to expect them. During a visit to Provo, the Egyptian ambassador asked if we could do a database for Coptic, the ancient Christian language of Egypt, like the one we have produced for the Dead Sea Scrolls. Again the answer is yes. And, thanks to a generous donation, we now have Dr. John Gee working on the FARMS staff, a specialist in late Egyptian. So we are very well situated if we choose to move in that direction. Recently, too, we have had indirect contacts with leaders of the Armenian Christian community, and the question has arisen whether we should attempt to do something with Armenian manuscripts. This is an interesting possibility; Armenia was the first country in the world to declare itself Christian, and many ancient documents, their originals long since lost, are now preserved only in Armenian. But, I worried, Armenian is a very much neglected language in the West, and we had literally nobody who could handle it. But not to worry: Suddenly there appeared an Armenian woman, Irena Abramian, with a graduate degree in engineering and computer science, a specialist in databases who speaks Russian and Armenian natively and who studied classical Armenian at the university. Additionally, she speaks fluent Hebrew. Thus we hired her to help us finish up the scrolls database while we prepare to launch an Armenian undertaking. If we had<i>designed</i>someone to assist us in an Armenian project, we could not possibly have improved on her. It is experiences like these, almost too numerous to mention--indeed, almost uncanny--that impel me to see some sort of divine purpose in these things, and to expect further such experiences.<br><br>Some while ago, another person, a Syriac Orthodox priest, approached us and asked us whether we could do a database for Syriac. Again the answer was yes. Syriac is the Christian form of Aramaic, the language spoken by the Savior during his mortal ministry. It is also the language of a very rich and very old Christian literature. This priest donated to us the substantial collection of Syriac microfilms that he had been working on for many years. He also put us in contact with Mar Bawai Soro, a bishop of the ancient Assyrian Church of the East, a Nestorian church that has historically been based in Iraq.<br><br>Bishop Soro, in his turn, has been of invaluable help as we move forward with an effort to make Syriac literature more accessible to the world. In February I traveled with Dr. E. Jan Wilson, the associate director of CPART, to Beirut and to Rome to look into possibilities of working in those areas. In both places it was Bishop Soro who made crucial contacts for us.<br><br>In Beirut we were the guests for a week of Father Samir Khalil at the Jesuit residence there. Father Samir is one of the leading experts in the world on the literature of Eastern Christianity, and he arranged for us to meet with representatives of, or even to visit, major collections at his university and at monasteries in the area around the city. We had gone with the question, first, whether or not there were Syriac manuscripts available for digitizing, and, second, whether their custodians would allow us access to them. The answers to both questions were resoundingly positive. There are huge manuscript resources in Lebanon, and--warned, perhaps, by the destructions of the recently concluded 15-year Lebanese civil war--the keepers of the collections are, so far as we can determine, eager to have their treasures "backed up" electronically. Indeed, we found great willingness to help. One person there who has proven to be a great friend is a Maronite Catholic college professor of Lebanese extraction who was raised in Salt Lake City.<br><br>With all of this in mind, we are sending Dr. Wilson and his wife, Eileen, to Beirut in September for at least a year. There they will prepare digital images of Syriac and Christian Arabic manuscripts and, perhaps, Armenian materials, which exist in Lebanon in great abundance. Lebanon is the entryway to the rich but (in the West) almost forgotten libraries of the ancient Christian Orient--in Syria, Turkey, and Iraq, as well as in Lebanon itself.<br><br>The service that this will provide is considerable. I don't need to tell you that the region we are discussing here has a long history of political instability. That means that access to the documents has often been spotty, and, even more than that, it means that their very existence is in perpetual danger. All it takes is one Molotov cocktail and an entire ancient library can disappear. This is not merely a theoretical possibility: Thousands of manuscripts have vanished in the past few decades alone. And, not infrequently, we don't even know what we have lost, since they have either been inadequately cataloged or not cataloged at all. Moreover, even under the best of circumstances, it is difficult to get at the manuscripts, since they very often do not exist in centrally accessible places but, rather, are scattered among mountaintop monasteries whose locations were chosen deliberately for their inaccessibility and whose administrators do not want frequent visitors. By making all or most of the Eastern Christian literary tradition available in computer-searchable form, however, we allow scholars and others to work with the manuscripts in their own offices, without needing to touch the often fragile documents or to pester isolation-seeking monks or to deal with the difficult politics and travel of the region. And we put them all together, creating a virtual library far better than any single collection in the Middle East or beyond.<br><br>Permit me here to say something about Christian Arabic literature also. Millions of Arab Christians live in the Near East and have done so since Arabic became the dominant language in the region in the mid–seventh century. They are, in fact, in many cases, the descendants of the earliest converts to Christianity in the region of its birth. Yet the study of Christian Arabic materials is neglected in the West. Why? Because Arabic is thought of as the language of Islam--which, of course, it is. Thus those who study Arabic do so almost without exception in order to gain entrée to the world of Muslims, medieval or modern, whereas students of Christian history almost never think of Arabic as a valuable tool for that field. So the impressive heritage of Christian Arabic falls between two stools, a victim of Western academic specialization.<br><br>We intend to take steps to remedy that problem, for hundreds of Christian Arabic manuscripts sit on the same library shelves with Syriac manuscripts, having been written by the same people and used by the same communities. Thus we foresee making these materials available in compact disk form along with the Syriac documents. And a selection of them will be published in searchable, transcribed versions.<br><br>After Dr. Wilson and I concluded our February visit to Beirut, we traveled to Rome, where we met with Bishop Soro, our Assyrian friend. There, thanks to contacts he had established, we were able to meet also with Father Farina, the prefect of the Vatican Apostolic Library, regarding a project to digitize a portion of that library's very fine collection of Syriac materials. It seems that there are no insuperable obstacles to such a project. Neither the prefect nor his ecclesiastical superiors--thanks to a remarkable series of contacts and experiences--appear to have any objection to admitting a group of Mormon scholars to their collection and jointly publishing an electronic selection of their manuscripts with Brigham Young University. (At this point, I would like you to consider for just a second how very noteworthy that is.)<br><br>Bishop Soro hopes that any work that we do with the Vatican on a CD will prove to be only the beginning. And, in fact, others at the Vatican have suggested that we move beyond their Syriac collection to their vast wealth of Greek biblical manuscripts. Bishop Soro has now been to BYU on two different occasions and has learned a bit about Latter-day Saint beliefs. During our time with him in Rome, he suggested a theme for a second Vatican-based CD: We could do something, he said, about the deification of human beings. Your people would be interested in that, wouldn't they? He remarked that his encounters with Mormons had resensitized him to the former prominence of that doctrine in his own very old tradition. He has actually delivered a sermon on the topic, which he says was one of the best received sermons he has ever given.<br><br>There is, as I hope you can see, no shortage of work to be done. We hope, for instance, to launch a dual-language series of selected Syriac texts in translation on the model of the Islamic Translation Series. The leading authority in the field, Professor Sebastian Brock of Oxford, has already signaled his willingness to help. (One of his former graduate students, by the way, is a British Latter-day Saint, a returned missionary, whom we also hope to involve in the effort.)<br><br>A dual-language series in Christian Arabic literature is also in our plans for the near future. Father Sidney Griffith, of Catholic University, the foremost name in the field in North America, has enthusiastically offered his services.<br><br>Each of these projects would benefit scholars, of course. But the dispersed communities of Eastern Christianity--many of them now refugees in the West and losing their languages--would gain from having their literary heritage easily accessible in both the original language and in translation. Frankly, I can think of few projects that are so likely to win friends for Brigham Young University and the Latter-day Saints among other Christians and that so perfectly fit the exhortation to our university community to "go forth to serve."<br><br>Can we do it? We have the technical ability. In that regard, we have no current rivals. I am utterly convinced that if the Lord wants us to do it, we will. The supporting donors, the necessary contacts, and the competent workers will arrive when needed. Thus far, they always have. This is bigger than we are.<br><br>Why BYU? Why FARMS and CPART? Why can we do these things where others have failed to do them, or even where others have tried and failed? Apart from the divine impetus and help that I firmly believe has grounded our efforts thus far, there is something unique about our community that helps us. These are matters of religious import for us and not merely of scholarly interest. These are certainly far more than just ways to make a career mark. We really do believe in the coming forth of ancient documents in the latter days. It is an element of our faith. And, in our community, something of the disadvantage of academic specialization is overcome by the fact that we are, all of us, religiously interested in ancient documents. Thus our specialists in antiquity can draw on the enthusiastic, devoted, and indispensable help of engineers and computer scientists and technologists who share their interest and commitment. I don't know of many other places where that would be true, and I am deeply grateful for it.<br><br>I return, in closing, to the prophecies of the coming forth of ancient texts "out of the dust." With other believing Latter-day Saints, I have always known that this would happen. What I had never realized is that there is now a very strong likelihood that those documents will come forth through Brigham Young University. We are at the absolute center of the process. These documents are coming through Utah. And, in the process, these projects and these contacts with people we could never have hoped to meet and regions we could not have dreamed of affecting only a short while ago are helping to bring the Church "out of obscurity"--as was prophesied would happen (see D&amp;amp;C 1:30).<br><br>Brothers and sisters, I hope you can sense some of the momentousness of this, at least as I see it, and I hope I have been able to convey at least a portion of my own excitement and conviction. I bear you my testimony that the Church is true, that the gospel has been restored, and that the Lord is active in his work, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Daniel C.

<h1>neer Roots to a World-Class Institution - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
In just a few months all of us will experience a first that is rare in the history of humankind. We will enter a new millennium. As we approach the end of the 20th century, the torch of enlightenment shines brighter than ever. The opportunity to learn of intellectual and spiritual truths has never been greater. It is now possible for the world's population to read about the latest scientific discovery within hours of the event. It is possible for Church members anywhere in the world to access President Hinckley's latest sermon within minutes of its delivery. The rate of discovery in the world of science is unparalleled. A larger and larger proportion of the world's population recognizes the value of and seeks after higher education. In this milieu, Brigham Young University has begun to flower as a world-class institution with a potential worldwide influence.<br><br>As we approach a new millennium, it seems appropriate to pause for a moment and reflect on the university's past, to review some key events that have influenced BYU's journey and remember a few of the many wonderful men and women who pioneered our path to excellence. Following the history, I wish to speak of the present in light of four institutional objectives that have been developed during the past year. These objectives are not new, as they are implied by BYU's Mission Statement and the aims documents. In a succinct manner, however, they state the university's reasons for being and the aspirations that guide us. Next I wish to report on the success of the capital campaign and describe the support that is being provided. Finally I will present a brief perspective on the future by looking "through a glass, darkly." Like Paul of old, we only see and "know in part" (1 Corinthians 13:12).<br><h2><b>The Past</b></h2><br>Most people associated with Brigham Young University are acquainted with its beginnings. At least we are familiar with President Brigham Young's charge to Karl G. Maeser: "You ought not to teach even the alphabet or the multiplication tables without the Spirit of God."<sup>1</sup> We are also familiar with the stories that describe the financial difficulties experienced during the early years. Elder L. Tom Perry gave us a wonderful summary last evening of the many threats to the school's existence during its first 75 years. As I reviewed the same history, it was apparent that every president of this institution up to President Ernest L. Wilkinson faced the threat of closure. Why? Because there was no money! The university did not have any! The Church had very little! The people had none!<br><br>The school was established in a desert by an immigrant people who were in the early stages of forming an economic base. By 1875 economic transactions were still largely founded on barter. There was little money available and even less in circulation. People were paid in kind with home produce--sometimes from the land and sometimes from the spinning wheel. In spite of the hardships, the LDS people were hungry for education. They prized knowledge, both secular and spiritual. They were willing to sacrifice in order for their children to receive schooling. In this environment, Brigham Young University had its beginnings.<br><br>In reviewing the history and progress of the university, I have divided the 125 years into four periods. The first is 1875 to 1900. I have labeled this period "Early Days, Difficult Times." The second covers a 50-year period from 1900 to 1950. These years are a time of transition from a small normal school to a major university. The label I have affixed is "Building a University Foundation." The third time frame is coincident with the tenure of President Ernest L. Wilkinson, 1951 to 1971. The 20-year period is one of astounding growth. I have called the Wilkinson era "Growth and Laying a Foundation of Excellence." The final period covers the last 28 years, 1971–1999. Caps on the size of the university allowed its constituents to focus on quality rather than quantity. Improvements in almost every facet of university life occurred from the classroom to the lab, from the library to the research productivity of the faculty. The title for the last period is "A Time of Excellence."<br><br>I do not intend to review the university's history today. A full review would be lengthy and laborious. Rather, I will describe one or two key events and, in some cases, relate a story illustrating the legacy inherited from those who have gone before. Perhaps by reviewing our pioneer beginnings and reliving a few key events, we will have a clearer view of what the future may hold. Most important, doing so will help us renew our resolve to continue building an institution of manifest destiny. As I have reviewed various documents relating to the past, it has been interesting to note that every time a crisis occurred that threatened the existence of BYU, the heavens were opened and assurance was given regarding the future of Brigham Young University. We now turn to its fragile beginnings.<br><h3><i><b>1875–1900: Early Days, Difficult Times</b></i></h3><br>There is reason to believe that President Brigham Young had been thinking of establishing a system of LDS educational institutions to serve the population of Utah at least two years before the founding of Brigham Young Academy. At a minimum, there is clear evidence that he wished to form a high-quality university that would include the teaching of religious principles at its core. The basis for this conclusion is a letter written in 1873 by Colonel Thomas L. Kane to President Young that contains the first known reference to a school called Brigham Young University. Colonel Kane's letter stated:<br><br><i>I know your sentiments; that Utah should before this [1873] have been educating her own teachers, and preparing if not publishing her own text books. The young fledglings who would resort to our Eastern seminaries of learning--to learn what you will hardly be able to unteach them all their days--should even now be training in the Brigham Young University, normal college of the highest grade, to officiate as "Zion" tutors and professors.</i><sup>2</sup><br><br>President Young in an earlier communication had told Colonel Kane of his desire to found an educational institution to serve as an offset to the "modern unfaith"<sup>3</sup> taught in other schools. Thus, two years before the founding of the academy, the venerable Church leader wanted to establish and endow a major institution of learning.<br><br>In addition to Colonel Kane's letter, a newspaper account of a meeting between Warren Dusenberry and President Young indicated the same. Warren Dusenberry and his brother had established a school in Provo in 1869. By 1875 the school was about to be closed for financial reasons. Upon learning of its pending closure, President Young asked Warren Dusenberry to visit with him. Dusenberry reported the following:<br><br><i>I received a communication from Pres. Brigham Young to call upon him. I did so. After expressing his disapproval of our breaking up the school . . . he said he intended endowing an institution of learning with sufficient means to make it an honor to the Territory and her people. . . . He requested me, in company with others, to immediately draft the necessary papers for founding the BYA. I knew it would require a great struggle, yet I knew it would be what it is today.</i><sup>4</sup><br><br>President Young then singled out six prominent men and one woman to serve as trustees. Abraham O. Smoot was elected president of the board. President Young stipulated that the "Old and New Testaments, the Book of Mormon and the Book of Doctrine and Covenants shall be read and their doctrines inculcated in the Academy" as a counter to the trend of the day that was to eliminate religion from higher education.<sup>5</sup> He then deeded to the trustees some of his personal property as an endowment for the academy. Initially, Brigham Young Academy was "not an official Church school, but one of which Brigham Young was individually the founder and proprietor."<sup>6</sup> Brigham Young and his heirs retained the right to approve or disapprove board decisions. For the two years that Brigham lived following the establishment of the school, problems were easily worked out. Following Brigham Young's death in 1877, however, the final authority for governing the school lay in the hands of his children and grandchildren, of which there were not a few. The family raised questions regarding Brigham Young's promises to the board of trustees, and it became almost impossible to find agreement.<sup>7</sup> As a consequence, the school found itself in financial difficulties within a very short period of time.<br><br>Karl G. Maeser was principal of the Twentieth Ward School in Salt Lake City at the time Brigham Young Academy was founded. Shortly thereafter, his schoolhouse was severely damaged by an explosion at a nearby arsenal. Maeser sought out the bishop to report the damage and found him with President Young. Upon learning that Brother Maeser no longer had a building to meet in, Brigham immediately called him to serve as the principal of the new school in Provo. The new school opened in January 1876 under the temporary leadership of Warren Dusenberry. Brother Maeser arrived in April 1876.<br><br>Two years later, shortly after the death of Brigham Young, Karl Maeser had a dream. In the dream he was given the design of a new building, but he did not know its purpose. At the time they were meeting in Lewis Hall on Center Street and Third West. In 1884, six years after the dream, Lewis Hall burned to the ground, leaving the school without a place to meet. As the Lewis building was burning, Karl Maeser understood the meaning of his dream six years earlier. His description of the dream is as follows:<br><br><i>I found myself entering a spacious hallway with open doors leading into many rooms, and saw President Brigham Young and a stranger, while ascending the stairs, beckoning me to follow them. Thus they led me into the upper story containing similar rooms and a large assembly hall, where I lost sight of my guides, and awoke. Deeply impressed with this dream, I drew up the plan of the location shown to me and stowed it away without any apparent purpose for its keeping nor any definite interpretation of its meaning, and it lay there almost forgotten for more than six years, when in January, 1884, the old Academy building was destroyed by fire. The want of new localities caused by that calamity brought into remembrance that paper, which on being submitted suggestively to the board, was at once approved of, and our architect, a son of President Young, instructed to put into proper . . . shape. . . . When in future days people will ask for the name of the wise designer of the interior of this edifice, let the answer be: Brigham Young.</i><sup>8</sup><br><br>The new building that was completed in 1892 is known today as the Academy or Education Building on what was the lower campus. Given the subsequent history of the building and Brother Maeser's story that Brigham Young designed it, one appreciates even more the group of Provo citizens that have banded together to save it.<br><br>Brigham Young Academy experienced one financial crisis after another following the Lewis building fire. By the mid-1880s, the school was in dire straits. The faculty and staff received only one-third of their salary in 1885.<sup>9</sup> Conditions became so desperate that Zina Young Williams appealed to President John Taylor for help. You may remember my retelling of her story at last year's annual university conference and President Taylor's response that her father, Brigham Young, had appeared to him in the night and had assured President Taylor that all would be well, "that Christ himself was directing, and had a care over [the] school."<sup>10</sup> At the time, everyone, including Karl Maeser and Abraham O. Smoot, was buried with debt. Brother Maeser became so discouraged that he decided to leave the academy and join the faculty of the University of Deseret. As Elder Perry mentioned last evening, Brother Maeser told his wife and daughter to pack the household goods and personal belongings. For two days Sister Maeser and Eva sat on the trunks waiting to move. On the third day the daughter finally asked when they would be leaving for Salt Lake City. Brother Maeser replied: "I have changed my mind. I have had a dream--I have seen Temple Hill filled with buildings--great temples of learning, and I have decided to remain and do my part in contributing to the fulfillment of that dream."<sup>11</sup><br><br>Karl Maeser stayed for another six or seven years until the new building was completed. He was the intellectual and spiritual architect who laid the foundation for today's magnificent institution. George Brimhall, a student of both Dusenberry and Maeser, described the impact that Karl Maeser had on him in the following words: "Judge Dusenberry showed me the road to higher education, but Karl G. Maeser showed me the way to a higher life."<sup>12</sup><br><br>Just as Brother Maeser was the spiritual and intellectual force in the early days of the academy, so Abraham O. Smoot was the financial savior. He was a highly successful businessman, president of the Utah Stake, and mayor of Provo. He died penniless and heavily in debt for personally endorsing loans to save Brigham Young Academy. It is recorded that "his iron will [and administrative abilities] saved the institution a number of times."<sup>13</sup><br><br>Benjamin Cluff, Jr., replaced Principal Maeser and served from 1892 to 1903. He proved to be a competent administrator who was quite different in personality and temperament from Karl G. Maeser. At the time of his leaving, Maeser was 63 years of age, "staid in appearance, an adherent of Prussian methodology in education, and conservative as well as sober in his demeanor; while Cluff, on the other hand, was only 34, vibrant, impetuous, and imbued with new educational ideas" he had brought from the University of Michigan. "Maeser advocated a closed educational society for the Church, while Cluff gloried in his . . . association with . . . gentile faculty."<sup>14</sup> The contrast was so stark that some people began comparing the two leaders. Maeser's daughter reported to her father some of the comments. Brother Maeser then said to the daughter: "Oh, my child, it should never have been said. That is a school of destiny, and no man can thwart its purpose."<sup>15</sup><br><br>President Cluff adroitly resisted the notion that Brigham Young Academy become a feeder school to the University of Utah. He guided the institution through the financial panic of 1893–94 and finally convinced Church leaders to incorporate the academy inside the Church. From 1896 onward, the financial well-being of BYU has been intimately tied to the financial conditions of the Church. Throughout this century, sacred funds have provided the means to support the growth and improvements that we now enjoy.<br><h3><i><b>1900–1950: Building a University Foundation</b></i></h3><br>In 1903 the name of the institution was changed to Brigham Young University. The first half of the 20th century was one of dynamic growth as the student body increased from 50 college students to 5,000 by midcentury. The Church assumed all of BYU's past debts in 1918, and a close alliance developed between the Church and the school. During the first decade the normal training school was expanded to include the training of high school teachers.<sup>16</sup> In 1907 the Maeser Memorial Building project was undertaken on Temple Hill--the first building on the upper campus. The faculty sacrificed up to one-half of a year's salary to make it a reality.<sup>17</sup> Five new colleges plus the graduate school were added in the 1920s. The colleges included Education, Arts and Sciences, Commerce and Business Administration, Applied Science, and Fine Arts. Key personnel attracted to the university during this period include Harvey Fletcher, Carl Eyring, Sidney Sperry, Gerrit de Jong, Thomas Martin, Hugh Nibley, Reed Bradford, Clinton Larson, Alma Burton, Herald R. and Harold Glen Clark, and many others.<br><br>Jesse Knight and Franklin Harris played major roles in keeping the university moving forward during the first half-century. Jesse Knight, the son of Newel Knight, who was a close friend of the Prophet Joseph Smith, never knew his father, who died at Winter Quarters after leading the first 50 Saints out of Nauvoo. His mother and eight children made their way to Utah and eventually settled in Utah County for a time. Jesse eventually struck it rich in the mining industry. Through a healing of a daughter and the encouragement of a son, he became a major benefactor of BYU, sustaining it financially over a number of years.<br><br>Franklin S. Harris was the fourth leader of the university. He was a major driving force from 1921 to 1944. He attracted strong faculty, built the first library and academic buildings on upper campus, and was an extraordinary defender. He was the first president to travel on official business outside the United States, as he was invited on three separate occasions to present a paper in Japan, help settle 60,000 Jews in Russia, and reorganize the Department of Agriculture for the government of Iran. On the trip to Japan, he invited and then received the first foreign students outside North America to attend the university.<sup>18</sup> On the trip to Russia he hired a Russian opera star to teach music at BYU.<sup>19</sup><br><br>Student enrollments increased significantly in the 1920s and the late 1940s following the two world wars. A hiatus was reached during the Great Depression as Church and university finances came under considerable pressure. Throughout the 50-year period, Church officials debated the wisdom of maintaining a system of higher education that included a number of junior colleges plus BYU. On numerous occasions declarations were made indicating that the schools would be closed or turned over to the state governments. Eventually, all of the units were transferred with the exception of BYU and Ricks College.<br><br>One incident that reveals again the destiny of Brigham Young University occurred during the depths of the depression. The Church was deeply in debt, and President Heber J. Grant made a trip to New York to meet with the banking community regarding a substantial loan. One of the conditions levied on the Church by the bankers was the shedding of the educational institutions. Following the meeting with the bankers, President Grant called Church leaders in Salt Lake City to inform them of the outcome. Word quickly spread to Provo that BYU would be closed. University archives contain a document that records an interview with Sidney B. Sperry, who had joined the faculty a year or two before the event. The interview recorded the following:<br><br><i>Brother Sperry stated that during the early nineteen thirties the depression became so severe that the Church found it impossible to provide financial support for its many enterprises and that when President Grant went to New York to secure a substantial loan it was necessary for him to agree to give up the various colleges which the Church was supporting, including . . . BYU. Brother Sperry said the announcement made him heartsick because so many people had sacrificed so much to keep the Church colleges going, especially . . . BYU.</i><br><br><i>Shortly after President Grant made his announcement from New York, Brother Sperry said he awakened in the middle of the night and saw a vision of the Brigham Young University of the future. He saw beautiful modern buildings extending along the entire east bench and saw great concourses of people coming to the University to receive guidance and instruction. In connection with the University he saw a temple and therefore knew that . . . BYU was going to remain a Church institution.</i><br><br><i>The following morning Brother Sperry said he advised a number of his colleagues that he was certain the Church was not going to give up BYU. When President Grant returned from New York he said all of the Church junior colleges would be turned over to the State but that the Church would continue to operate the Brigham Young University.</i><sup>20</sup><br><br>A sequel to the story occurred almost 40 years later when General Authorities were considering two sites for the Provo Temple. One was in front of Y Mountain and the other was in front of Rock Creek Canyon. Before the choice was made, Brother Sperry in a conversation with Cleon Skousen told him that the temple would not be in front of the Y because in his 1930s vision it was further north.<sup>21</sup><br><br>Following World War II, the university suddenly burgeoned. Can you imagine the challenges faced by President Howard S. McDonald and the faculty and staff when the enrollment increased from 1,500 students in the spring of 1945 to 2,700 in the fall of the same year? In today's terms, the increase is equivalent to leaving school last April with 30,000 students and returning this month to find 54,000. It would be another four years before an additional building was added to campus.<br><h3><i><b>1951–1971: Growth and Laying a Foundation of Excellence</b></i></h3><br>The modern era for Brigham Young University began during the 1950s. Although I am not familiar with Church finances during the 1950s, the economic boom that followed World War II must have contributed to the well-being of the Church. Tithing contributions in the 1950s and 1960s would still have been modest, compared with today's figures, if for no other reason than the difference in Church membership. Nevertheless, it is safe to say that the entire second half of the 20th century has been a time of prosperity for the United States and most nations across the earth. It has been an extraordinary time for building the Church and a major university. And that is precisely what happened.<br><br>As almost all know, President Ernest L. Wilkinson was a key figure in providing the buildings that Sidney Sperry saw in his dream. The Eyring Science Center was dedicated a short time before President Wilkinson arrived. It was the fifth building on the upper campus. Today there are about 300 buildings. A large proportion of upper campus was built during the 1951–1971 period.<br><br>Student enrollment increased from 5,000 students in 1951 to 25,000 in 1971. A commensurate increase in the faculty also occurred. The Wilkinson period continued the recruitment of strong faculty with graduate degrees from major American universities. Student services expanded, student housing mushroomed, and a city was built on Temple Hill. Perhaps the most important event during the Wilkinson administration was the creation of student wards and stakes. This one spark of inspiration has had enormous impact on the entire campus community.<br><br>Elder Neal A. Maxwell, speaking as Church commissioner of education at the time of Wilkinson's resignation, said of him:<br><br><i>This is the man who too often is remembered for the brick-and-mortar growth of this institution when in fact its major thrust has been in the direction of quality and excellence. For this he deserves, I think, much of the credit for what has happened here in the making of a university.</i><sup>22</sup><br><br>Speaking of the Wilkinson years after becoming president of the university himself, Elder Dallin H. Oaks stated that BYU "would probably still be struggling around the fringes of community college status had it not been for the remarkable and relentless leadership of the Wilkinson Era."<sup>23</sup><br><h3><i><b>1971–1999: A Time of Excellence</b></i></h3><br>Student enrollment caps came into existence in the mid-1970s. Consequently, physical growth has not been a major factor in university life during the last 25 years. It has allowed the faculty, staff, and administrations to focus on the quality of the offerings as well as the quality of the facilities. President Dallin H. Oaks early in his administration indicated that he had two objectives. The first was to "reinforce the University's drive for excellence as an academic institution" and the second was to "preserve the distinctive spiritual character and standards of the University.<sup>24</sup><br><br>All four university presidents since 1971 (Oaks, Holland, Lee, and Bateman) have been charged with the dual responsibility of improving learning in both sacred and secular realms. The expectation is that the university will excel in both. Building testimonies is as much a part of this university as teaching chemistry. Brigham Young University is an integral part of the Church and is expected to play a role in building the kingdom. President Harold B. Lee, in his charge to President Oaks in 1971, stated:<br><br><i>Brigham Young University, led by its president, must never forget its role in bringing to reality the ancient prophecy--to build the mountain of the Lord's house in the tops of the mountains, so great and so glorious that all nations may come to this place and be constrained to say, "Show us your way that we may walk therein." (See Isaiah 2:2–3.)</i><sup>25</sup><br><h2><b>The Present</b></h2><br>Given the incredible history of this institution, where do we stand today? The data indicate that improvement across campus is continuing, and the university, like a flower, is through the budding stage and has begun to show its beauty. The quality and beauty of our programs are capturing attention, and our creative works, as well as our graduates, are making a difference in the world. During the past year a set of institutional objectives were proposed that I would like to share with you. I also invite further discussion. I will use the objectives to illustrate the status of the university. The objectives are not new, as noted earlier. They are implied by BYU's Mission Statement written in the 1980s and the aims formulated in this decade. In a succinct manner they outline the standards and aspirations set for the university by the board of trustees.<br><h3><i><b>First Institutional Objective</b></i></h3><br>The first objective is concerned with the quality of teaching at Brigham Young University. The objective relates to the four aims and reads as follows:<br><br><b>Educate the minds and spirits of students</b> within a learning environment that<br><br>• increases faith in God and the restored gospel,<br><br>• is intellectually enlarging,<br><br>• is character building,<br><br>• and leads to a life of learning and service.<br><br>Evidence regarding the quality of teaching at BYU comes in many forms. Two recent surveys are informative with respect to the spiritual, intellectual, and character offerings of the faculty and staff and their impact on students. The first relates to the spiritual offering and was administered at Brigham Young University this past year by Keith Wilson of Religious Education in tandem with two professors from Baylor University. This survey of BYU faculty compared results from similar church-related institutions such as Baylor, Notre Dame, and Boston College. These researchers sought to analyze the influence of religion in an academic setting. One part of the survey assessed the willingness of faculty to share their beliefs in the classroom. One of the questions asked faculty how they felt about expressing certain Christian behaviors on campus.<br><br>The behaviors included a willingness to discuss gospel-related questions when those questions are raised by class materials; a willingness to share religious experiences in class; a willingness to lead a class in prayer; and a willingness to bear testimony. The faculty surveyed were asked to respond to each category.<br><br>My purpose in using the data today is not to compare the BYU faculty responses with those from other campuses but to look at the extraordinarily high percentage of "yes" answers received. Ninety-nine percent of the BYU faculty surveyed indicated a willingness to answer gospel-related questions raised by class materials. Ninety-two percent of the faculty currently do share or are willing to share personal experiences that have a faith component. More than four out of five are willing to lead the class in prayer. Finally, nine out of 10 faculty members are willing to bear witness of their personal testimony of the restored gospel. The last question was not asked of faculty at the other universities.<br><br>I believe these extraordinary responses reflect the faithfulness of the faculty and their commitment to the mission of Brigham Young University. I also believe that the faithfulness of the faculty and staff are reflected in the answers received in a recent survey of our graduates of three years ago. The survey asked BYU graduates from the class of 1995 to express their feelings about a BYU education. The following responses are typical.<br><br><i>I had a science teacher who told us that our purpose at BYU is to figure out our relationship with God. You know, that was his encouragement. And he spent like a whole hour one day talking on it. And as far as even my beliefs as being LDS, I think he was right. The whole BYU experience is there for young people to figure out who they are in relationship with their God. And I think between the wards and between intellectual and social development, I think it can do that if you apply the system right.</i><br><br><i>I came from a small town where there were only a few members. I'd never been around so many Church members in all my life, and I started to understand the Church in a different way. It's kind of like having a picture of the Church in my head to take away with me, irrespective of where I go.</i><br><br><i>My wife and I had our first daughter at BYU, and we decided that we would both continue to go to school. . . . And I don't know if we could have done that at many other schools, but I remember a couple of examples of how BYU helped us. I guess it positively contributed to our family. We had tried to work out schedules so . . . one of us would watch our daughter while the other one was in class. There were a couple of times when that didn't work out. One time my wife had to take a quiz, but she had to have our daughter with her. And our daughter was one month old. Our baby started crying during the middle of that Russian quiz. The teacher went over, picked our daughter up, took her outside, and rocked her to sleep. Anyway, this teacher is one of the most world-renowned guys as far as Russian studies go . . . , and I cannot get that out of my mind, thinking that he was taking care of my daughter so my wife could learn. I think he really had the good picture, realizing that family and education don't have to conflict with each other--they can help each other.</i><br><br>The academic quality of BYU is becoming known outside Provo. Most have seen last Friday's issue of the <i>U.S. News and World Report</i> that gave the magazine's annual assessment of the various institutions that make up higher education.<sup>26</sup> Like most presidents whose institutions were not ranked first, I believe that the measures used in the report are somewhat inadequate and fail to fully evaluate the quality of an institution. For example, SAT and ACT scores are used to indicate the quality of students entering a university, but GRE, GMAT, LSAT, MCAT, and other scores are not used to measure the quality of what happens to the student while at the university. Instead, a qualitative measure known as "academic reputation" provided by administrators at other universities is used. This measure is largely based on the performance of doctoral programs and biases the results against an institution like ours where the number of such programs is limited.<br><br>Still, we are pleased with the <i>U.S. News and World Report</i> rankings, both the recent undergraduate rankings and the graduate school rankings, which were reported last March. Both the J. Reuben Clark Law School and the Marriott School are among the top 50 in the United States. The more recent rankings place the Marriott School and the College of Engineering among the nation's best, with the university at large ranking in the second tier. The overall ranking for BYU among 1,400 institutions of higher education and 228 major research universities jumped significantly from 109th last year to 80th this year, due to marginal improvements in a number of categories. Categories where improvement occurred include the freshman retention rate, the graduation rate, faculty resources, student selectivity, financial resources, and the alumni giving rate.<br><br>I first came to the university 32 years ago. At the time there were pockets of excellence on campus. I left BYU in the early 1970s and returned in the late seventies. I noticed a significant improvement as program strength was more widespread. Today every program is one of quality with a strong and productive faculty. Staff quality has improved as additional resources have been made available by the board of trustees. Please do not misinterpret my statements. We have not arrived! There is more to do! But we have vision, commitment, and some additional resources--these are the ingredients that will move us forward.<br><h3><i><b>Second Institutional Objective</b></i></h3><br>The second institutional objective concerns the quality of research performed at BYU. It is my firm opinion that a major university must contribute to the world's storehouse of knowledge. Also, we believe that the research and creative efforts should be consequential; i.e., they should make a difference. With this in mind, the second objective reads as follows:<br><br><b>Advance truth and knowledge</b> to<br><br>• enhance the education of students,<br><br>• enrich the quality of life,<br><br>• and contribute to a resolution of world problems.<br><br>The second objective will be fulfilled if our research involves students and improves their education directly or indirectly; if the creative works in the fine arts and humanities capture or add beauty to this world; if the theoretical research performed in the laboratory provides a clearer understanding of how things work; if the research and creative efforts in the biological, social, health, physical, and engineering sciences and in law and business improve the world in some way.<br><br>The deans supplied me with many examples of consequential scholarship by a number of scholars in almost every department. I wish there were time to highlight each one. In the interest of time, I have selected three. The danger is that my selection will stereotype what is meant by important research. Please recognize that my selection is limited.<br><br>The first is a study of families with children with disabilities. An interdisciplinary team of BYU faculty from nursing, family sciences, and education have followed a group of families with children with disabilities for the past five years. Their work has been nationally and internationally recognized as an important effort to understand the role of all family members in the significant experience of raising a child with a disability. Data include important insights related to areas of stress as well as areas of family growth, including the power of religious faith.<br><br>The second example comes from the clinical psychology faculty, where three professors through a long-term project have produced a reliable and inexpensive test to measure the level of depression in human beings. The questionnaire is currently used by HMOs, government agencies, and state hospital systems covering millions of individuals. The advantages of the instrument, which has been exhaustively tested, include quicker detection--reducing the costs of treatment--and its unique ability to measure the effect of ongoing therapy or medication on the level of illness.<br><br>The third example comes from the College of Engineering, where a number of faculty are engaged in pioneering research into configurable computing. One article in <i>Scientific American</i> indicated that the work at BYU places the university among the top five in the world with respect to this type of research.<sup>27</sup> Another article demonstrated that configurable computing can speed up some computing applications by a thousand times.<sup>28</sup><br><h3><i><b>Third Institutional Objective</b></i></h3><br>The third institutional objective is concerned with the influence that BYU may have in blessing LDS members around the world. The objective reads:<br><br><b>Extend the blessings of learning</b> to members of the Church in all parts of the world.<br><br>With 1.5 million 18- to 25-year-olds in the Church and a significant portion who would like to attend BYU, it is obvious that only a tiny fraction can be served on campus. Moreover, the proportion served will decline over time. Some will attend other universities where they can take institute classes. Others will not have the opportunity to study. What are the ways in which this university can reach out and bless them?<br><br>First, two steps already have been taken on campus to accommodate more students. The first is the 2,000 FTE student increase in the enrollment cap. Obviously, this is a small step. The second is the visiting student or open enrollment program for the spring and summer semesters. This will allow a few thousand more students to come. For example, the number of visiting students last year, the first year of the program, totaled just over 1,100. This year the number increased to 1,800. For the first time we can tell applicants who are rejected for fall and winter that they can come in the spring and summer. We believe the number of visitors will continue to increase as additional bottleneck courses are added and a summer language institute is initiated.<br><br>Other steps taken include the development of an Internet curriculum to complement and eventually replace the pencil and paper courses of Independent Study. One year ago I indicated that BYU had 20 courses on-line. The number today is 117. Of this number, approximately 20 are high school courses. For some countries the high school courses are more critical than the college materials. During the next three or four years another 200 or more courses will be added. The best part of the Internet course development is that teams of faculty from various departments are working on the large GE courses. The first priority is to develop high-quality course materials for on-campus students. The HEPE 129 course designed last year was the first of this type with 16 faculty and 40 students collaborating to build the finest course developed in America in 1998. It received the Helen Williams Award as a result. A family history course produced by Susan Easton Black recently received the national UCEA award (University Continuing Education Association) for one of the best courses designed in 1999. A panel of judges carefully reviewed a large number of courses before giving the award.<br><br>As some faculty know, a new bachelor of general studies has been approved by the appropriate faculty committees. This degree replaces the bachelor of independent study program. With the appropriate number of residence hours, students who leave the university without graduating can complete a degree over the Internet. Of the 300,000 alumni, approximately 150,000 did not graduate. Continuing Education personnel recently stratified the nongraduates by the number of hours completed on campus. There were more than 600 former students with more than 140 hours of credit but no degree. The first set of letters inviting alumni to finish were sent to them. The second letter of invitation will go to those with 120 hours or more, and so on. The program was announced a few months ago, and there are now 713 active registrants in the new BGS program and 1,000 who have applied.<br><br>The usual scenario one thinks of when considering instruction over the Internet is a student at home taking a course. A more important option in distant places is for a group of students taking courses together under the direction of a mentor. Currently the Church Educational System is conducting experiments with pilot programs in Brazil and Mexico. One can think of circumstances where BYU students could assist through a service/learning internship. This was tried in Brazil and Mexico during the summer with approximately four students in each country. We are evaluating their experience presently.<br><br>The foreign groups may take courses not to complete a degree but to obtain a set of skills that will enable them to improve their employability. Or using the courseware may lead to entrance to a university in their country. Recently I met with the senior executives of one of the largest multinational corporations in the world. They are in the midst of major expansion plans in Central and South America. I asked the executives if they would be interested in hiring natives in those countries who had spent the last two years in a highly disciplined program where they arose every morning at 6:30, studied written materials for two hours, spent 10–12 hours per day meeting people and trying to explain their beliefs, learned to handle rejection, had developed strong oral communication skills, and were totally honest in their dealings. Moreover, they were now in a program learning English as a second language and becoming proficient in the use of the computer. The first response was one of disbelief. The second was a commitment to work with Church employment people in those countries to hire returned missionaries.<br><br>There are many ways in which Brigham Young University can extend the blessings of learning across the world. Technology is opening the door for high-quality instruction and interaction that will cut across geographical boundaries and cultures.<br><h3><i><b>Fourth Institutional Objective</b></i></h3><br>The final objective relates to nonmembers. The objective is:<br><br><b>Develop friends</b> for the university and the Church.<br><br>Friends of the faculty and staff quickly learn about the quality of the university. Research ties between BYU faculty and faculty of other institutions are important in the development of friends in the academic community. Collaboration on research and conferences is much easier today because of improvements in communications. National and international conferences also allow the staff to present papers on their work at BYU. Again, their counterparts learn about innovations at BYU. A number of BYU administrative staff are considered leaders in their areas.<br><br>For many years BYU's performing groups have been ambassadors for the Church and the university. Perhaps you saw the <i>Church News</i> article last Saturday entitled "Goodwill Ambassadors."<sup>29</sup> The article described the quality and breadth of our programs. So far, in 1999, 644 BYU students have presented 336 concerts in 160 cities in 13 countries. Approximately 330,000 people watched the live performances, and another 35.5 million saw them on television.<br><br>BYU's ambassadorial program brings foreign ambassadors to campus at a rate of two or three per semester. They speak to an assemblage in the Kennedy Center and meet students from their country as well as returned missionaries who served there. They meet with members of the First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve. They see this magnificent campus and learn about us as a people.<br><br>These are the four objectives. Before proceeding to the capital campaign, may I suggest a word of caution. The key focus must be the <i>quality</i> of on-campus education. If our attention is diverted away from the first and second objectives to the third and fourth, the foundation of excellence will be eroded and the university will fail to reach its potential. It is important to understand that the third and fourth objectives will be realized if we are successful in achieving the first two. If the light on campus becomes a "standard for the nations," then the outside world will be attracted to us. The first two objectives involve everyone in one way or another and should occupy a very large fraction of our time. In contrast, the third and fourth objectives are derivatives, and only a few people will be directly involved.<br><h2><b>The Capital Campaign</b></h2><br>The capital campaign was initiated in September 1993 by President Lee. The goal was $237 million for a variety of purposes: endowment, buildings, scholarships, faculty support, and programs. A program review in 1996 raised the target to $250 million. Although the initial plans contemplated completion in August of 2000, the successful efforts to date warrant a celebration and early termination per President Gordon B. Hinckley's challenge in April 1996. He challenged those present at the public announcement to work hard and complete the campaign in less than four years. The following is a status report on the campaign.<br><br>The material that appears in the table below lists the amount collected through July 31, 1999. Through the end of July, a total of $313 million had been raised. Although I do not have a full accounting for the first three weeks of August, I am aware of another $10 million received this month. The totals received through July for the various categories are:<br><table border="0" width="60%" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="0"><br><tbody><br><tr><br><td width="30%">University and College Endowment</td><br><td width="15%">$ 33.2</td><br></tr><br><tr><br><td width="30%">Scholarships and Grants</td><br><td width="15%">$ 55.4</td><br></tr><br><tr><br><td width="30%">Learning Enhancement</td><br><td width="15%">$ 91.2</td><br></tr><br><tr><br><td width="30%">Buildings</td><br><td width="15%">$ 17.1</td><br></tr><br><tr><br><td width="30%">Programs</td><br><td width="15%"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">$ 38.0</span></td><br></tr><br><tr><br><td width="30%"></td><br><td width="15%">$233.2</td><br></tr><br><tr><br><td width="30%"></td><br><td width="15%"></td><br></tr><br><tr><br><td width="30%">Lighting the Way--Unrestricted</td><br><td width="15%">$ 24.4</td><br></tr><br><tr><br><td width="30%">Lighting the Way--Restriction Pending</td><br><td width="15%">$ 28.2</td><br></tr><br><tr><br><td width="30%">Other Program Funds Raised Outside Goals</td><br><td width="15%"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">$ 16.4</span></td><br></tr><br><tr><br><td width="30%">TOTAL BYU--PROVO</td><br><td width="15%">$302.3</td><br></tr><br><tr><br><td width="30%"></td><br><td width="15%"></td><br></tr><br><tr><br><td width="30%">TOTAL BYU--HAWAII</td><br><td width="15%"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">$ 10.6</span></td><br></tr><br><tr><br><td width="30%">LIGHTING THE WAY TOTAL</td><br><td width="15%">$312.9</td><br></tr><br></tbody><br></table><br>The unrestricted funds will be used to increase the university endowment that can then be used to fill in the gaps and support programs across campus. For example, 11 professorships were awarded last year. These came from earnings off the endowment. Although we have announced only two new professorships today, we are working on the possibility of future announcements. It is expected that funds will be available to support a limited number of research proposals based on merit that tie to the institutional objectives. ORCA grants to support student research projects may also be expanded. The deans have indicated in early August meetings a number of needs in the various colleges. We believe that some funds will be available for those purposes.<br><br>It is important to understand that all funds received by the university during the campaign are sacred and come under the jurisdiction of the board of trustees. Budgets are being prepared for the year 2000 that will include proposed expenditures of campaign funds in order for the board to review and approve. Obviously, a significant portion of the funds have been restricted by the donors for certain purposes. We must honor their wishes as well.<br><br>Although we will declare victory at a September 24 celebration in the Marriott Center with President Hinckley present, the campaign will officially close on December 31, 1999. The total amount raised by that time is expected to be in the neighborhood of $375 million. Moreover, we have identified additional needs that were not in the current campaign. One need is a replacement building for the Joseph F. Smith Family Living Center, which is proving costly to maintain. The board has approved a plan to raise funds for this purpose.<br><br>Fund-raising will not end in December but will transition to new objectives. More than 145,000 people contributed to the current campaign. Support has been widespread and generous. I believe there are two keys to successful fund-raising at Brigham Young University. The first is an understanding on the part of Church members that BYU is an integral part of the Church and is faithful in its responsibility to help build the kingdom. The second is the quality of our programs.<br><h2><b>The Future: World-Class, Worldwide</b></h2><br>With an extraordinary faculty, highly qualified students, resources from the board, and support from private donations to help us improve, the small seed planted in 1875 is maturing into a beautiful, white tree--one whose fruit is delicious to the taste, one that will shine as a standard for the nations because of its dual nature. For the first time I see a world-class, worldwide university as a reality. We have not arrived! In this lifetime we will never be fully satisfied. There is still much work to be done! But the quality is coming and the influence is spreading.<br><br>In closing, may I share a recent experience. A short time ago I got a call from Elder Holland indicating that he had just received an assignment to accompany a friend of the First Presidency on a visit to BYU. The individual in question is a well-known leader in Asia and heads one of the largest Muslim groups in the world--a group totaling 40 million members. The leader had learned about BYU's first translation of an Islamic work: <i>The Incoherence of the Philosophers</i> by Al-Ghazali. During the visit he indicated that the book had a profound influence on him as a young man. He was pleased with the translation, but even more important he appreciated the efforts of Professor Daniel Peterson and the scholars working with him to produce a series of Islamic classics in a Western language. He clearly understood the potential cultural bridge that is being built between two worlds--Islam and the West.<br><br>Accompanying the leader was a visiting professor at Harvard and a prominent Asian businessman. Following a luncheon and a campus tour, both expressed surprise at the beauty, size, and cleanliness of the campus. They were not aware that BYU is the largest private university in the United States, that students come from each state in the Union and from more than 100 foreign countries. They were amazed to learn that more than 60 languages are taught on campus and more than 80 are spoken. Discussions were held regarding the possibility of further visits, student exchanges, and the recruiting of BYU students for employment.<br><br>As the visitors left, I thought how important BYU is as a window on the Church. The glass is not dark but clear and allows viewers to see the values and truths of the restored gospel. Through this window nonmembers feel the importance of education to Church members. They see the youth of the Church, note their strength, and observe the peace within them. The veil that separates is thin when they meet with faculty, discern their cultural sensitivities, and sense the quality of their work and thought.<br><br>How grateful I am for Brigham Young University, for the assemblage of faculty, staff, and students gathered here. I appreciate even more deeply the special role played by BYU in addition to its fundamental purpose of educating young people. It is an integral part of the kingdom of God on earth. It is an important arm of the Church in helping the world come to an understanding of who the LDS people are and of the values and light that we treasure.<br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>1. In Alma P.

<h1> a Light That Is a Standard to the Nations - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Just over a week ago in our August commencement, President Hinckley was asked to give impromptu remarks at the close of the ceremony. He arose and with great feeling exclaimed that he was so proud of BYU--this "crown jewel" in the kingdom, as he called it. He was proud of the graduates who represent the university so well. He singled out the faculty and said that he was proud of your excellence and your service to the kingdom.<br><br>Other members of the board of trustees have expressed similar feelings in the recent past. I believe that collectively we have been making significant progress lately. As I have reflected on my sense that BYU is becoming a more refined instrument of light, a standard that shines forth, I have felt a reassuring confirmation that the Lord's hand is operating to help us. I want to share with you some recent examples of this phenomenon and make some observations about what I think is fostering this progress.<br><br>President Bateman discussed with us this morning our current draft of BYU's institutional objectives. I think it has been helpful for us to discuss with the board of trustees and with deans, directors, and department chairs a statement of objectives. We want to continue that discussion with the campus community during this school year. Specifically, my colleagues and I on the Academic Vice President's Council hope to discuss your response to and questions about these objectives as we visit with you in informal department brown bags during the year.<br><br>As we have developed the institutional objectives, a key theme for me has been the clarification of BYU's role in the kingdom. The more clear we become about our role in the kingdom, the more light from the Lord's Spirit I feel among us, the greater the harmony I feel with the board, and the greater unity I feel among us as a community. In addition, this growing alignment with the Lord's purposes has inspired people of goodwill who have contributed record amounts and are enthusiastic about continuing to help us as President Bateman showed us this morning.<br><br>I think that there are several factors that contribute to this growing alignment and unity at BYU:<br><br>1. As I said, we are clarifying BYU's role in the kingdom of God.<br><br>2. We are making hard choices to focus our offerings and services.<br><br>3. We are seeking to get our hearts right, to collaborate in the spirit of self-sacrifice to improve these areas.<br><br>4. We are becoming leaders in the fields where we have chosen to focus.<br><h2><b>Clarifying BYU's Role</b></h2><br>In 1975 President Kimball gave an address to commemorate the beginning of BYU's second century. He provided some ideas that are particularly relevant to aligning the university with the gospel and the needs and standards of the Church. I quote now from that address:<br><br><i>As previous First Presidencies have said, and we say again to you, we expect (we do not simply hope) that Brigham Young University will "become a leader among the great universities of the world." To that expectation I would add, "Become a unique university in all of the world!"</i><sup>1</sup><br><br><i>BYU can tower above other universities . . . because of the unique light BYU can send forth into the educational world. Your light must have a special glow, for while you will do many things in the programs of this university that are done elsewhere, these same things can and must be done better here than others do them. You will also do some special things here that are left undone by other institutions.</i><sup>2</sup><br><br><i>Members of the Church are willing to doubly tax themselves to support the Church Educational System, including this university, and we must not merely "ape the world." We must do special things that would justify the special financial outpouring that supports this university.</i><sup>3</sup><br><br>In the "Second Century" address and in some of the other talks<sup>4</sup>he gave here at BYU, President Kimball suggested what some of these special things are that we must do. Some of them include:<br><br>1. Teach for the eternities, giving prominence to revealed truth in our teaching.<br><br>2. Strengthen the testimonies and character of young people along with their intellects.<br><br>3. Prepare youth to serve as leaders in the Church, their families, and society so as to provide dividends on the Church's investment in them.<br><br>4. Be a refining host for brilliant stars--our graduates--in a variety of fields.<br><br>5. Hire and develop faculty who are men and women of God.<br><br>6. Qualify ourselves to receive, when the Lord chooses, revelation for our scholarly and creative pursuits in addition to "the natural unfolding of knowledge [we expect] to occur as a result of scholarship."<sup>5</sup><br><br>7. "Be willing to break with the educational establishment (not foolishly or cavalierly, but thoughtfully and for good reason) in order to find gospel ways to help mankind. Gospel methodology, concepts, and insights can help us to do what the world cannot do in its own frame of reference," he said.<sup>6</sup><br><br>8. Develop art that does not "give in to the ways of the world" and "that edifies man, which takes into account his immortal nature, and which prepares us for heaven."<sup>7</sup><br><br>9. "Become the acknowledged language capital of the world in terms of our academic competency"<sup>8</sup>and through the MTC.<br><br>10. Provide "pockets of competency" to "be used by the Church increasingly" for special purposes.<sup>9</sup><br><br>President Kimball explicitly mentioned that these were just a few of the areas of special concern for development at BYU.<sup>10</sup><br><br>Our recent efforts to align our programs with the needs of students and the priorities of the Church have seemed to be a kind of fulfilling of President Kimball's vision. For example, President Kimball mentioned a focus on languages. We have recently established a Center for Language Studies that will help us focus and develop our language learning capability and service. Some of the strategic questions for BYU, in light of Church and student needs, are: Which languages shall we offer? At what level? And for whom? The center will lead our discussions to determine student and Church needs, to help us improve our research and capability in language learning, and to consider how we can serve as many people as possible. For example, the center is preparing a Summer Language Institute for next year that will provide intensive language learning for both matriculated and non-matriculated students in less commonly taught languages as well as in "bottleneck" major language courses. We can invite visiting faculty from around the world to teach students--especially returned missionaries or preparing missionaries--in this program. The center will also coordinate collaborative research with the MTC.<br><br>It has been enlightening to observe the development of the School of Family Life and the former NGO Family Voice, now the World Family Policy Center, over the past few years. The proclamation on the family by the First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve has been a wonderful boon that has galvanized the faculty.<sup>11</sup><br><br>We have encouraged and watched with interest a conversation among the animal science faculty led by Dean Kent Crookston that I believe is leading to some good ideas. The question they have begun to ask is: What should our program look like at BYU, given worldwide Church needs? Their program has to some extent focused on farm production more attuned to the needs of Utah and other western states. As they consider collaboration with Church needs, they are seeing the opportunity to design a program that will bless their students and the Church significantly, even though it may not look like more conventional agricultural station programs. This is precisely the kind of thinking that President Kimball was encouraging.<br><h2><b>Focusing Our Efforts</b></h2><br>Paradoxically, being of service, especially when our cause is important, can lead us to say yes to too many things and therefore fail to be as good as we need to be at any of them. I have seen many departments and individual faculty overextend themselves because they want to help the Church and respond to every student need. If we are to be very good, given finite resources, we must decide which of the many good things we can do that should be done. However, this is a very difficult task at a university. Indeed, some observers say that it is nigh unto impossible to make significant changes to focus and reallocate attention from one area to another. For example, Arthur M. Cohen, in his well-written and well-regarded recent book entitled<i>The Shaping of American Higher Education,</i>commented that we can't reallocate resources and thus refocus higher education institutions because we don't have a "way of determining relative value."<sup>12</sup><br><br>BYU is, in many ways, faced with this same challenge. However, we do have some help in "determining relative value." I have seen how President Bateman has worked with the Brethren to develop a sense of current Church priority. For example, we have concluded that we should focus particular attention on three countries--China, the Ukraine, and Jordan--to help the Church open doors there. Our faculty have responded brilliantly, and we have some exciting developments taking place.<br><br>I also think that we are improving our ability as an institution to manage change and to refocus. I have watched faculty and other groups be prayerful about understanding the needs of students and of the Church and come to a consensus that I thought would be impossible at the outset. The organization of the School of Family Life is a good example of this phenomenon. It took some time for the former Family Sciences Department and their colleagues in other departments and in the Law School who were interested in the family to come to some broad consensus about a focus and a structure to help them pursue that focus. I watched skillful people like Clayne Pope and Jim Harper involve and incorporate ideas from approximately 80 faculty members, external advisors, central administration leaders, and members of the board of trustees. They worked hard to address a host of differences in approaches to research, preferences for organizational arrangement, disciplinary interest, and so on. As they have aligned themselves with the principles of the Church's proclamation on the family, they have developed increased clarity about curriculum needs, research topics, and outreach activities to strengthen the family. I compliment them on beginning such a large refocusing operation with deliberate care.<br><br>I also think that the Brethren have been inspired to give us counsel and guidance as we started the School of Family Life, which has lifted us beyond our traditional disciplinary commitments. For example, President Packer presented a stirring charge to the new School of Family Life. He saw them as being willing to break with some educational fashion to do what they are doing and told them that they<i>must</i>be successful because of the demise of the family in so many quarters. He told them that they would be able to go where the Brethren could not go and that their work was critical to the kingdom.<br><br>In addition to this inspiration and guidance, the support of the Brethren has led to significant increases in donor support for the new school and its programs. We have also been able to reallocate resources from other areas of the university to support the clarified mission.<br><br>We have just completed another quite successful reorganization as we created the Center for Instructional Design. Based on excellent work by faculty and staff committees, Noel Reynolds and Scott Howell combined people from three different organizations to improve our ability to prioritize and develop course materials for BYU, Continuing Education, Ricks, BYU--Hawaii, the LDS Business College, and the Church as a whole. Here again we have been able to improve our focus and knit people together in ways that promise to make us better.<br><br>We are just starting another effort to improve about which you should be aware. Our admissions and records office programs are known nationally for providing student access to information and telephone registration. IBM just reported on a best-practices survey of work in this area. I quote from that report:<br><br><i>The University of Delaware and Brigham Young University . . . started their change processes before most of the rest of us realized the need for change. They had the luxury of learning at their own pace before the Web changed everything. Now, when these institutions consider next steps, they do so with a staff that is prepared for successful change. They are leading institutions.</i><sup>13</sup><br><br>Notice that the principal praise from this IBM survey was for our ability to adapt and continue to improve. We have recently launched a committee called VISTA that will look at how we can improve even further our services to our students--all of our students, on and off campus, undergraduate and graduate, entering and graduating--with information for planning, advising, registration, finding grades, and so forth. We want to provide one-stop services and quick access to personal attention when needed. This committee's membership comes from Student and Campus Life, Continuing Education, faculty, students, Admissions, Records, Financial Aid, and software development. They have taken time to build their team and to listen to students and major service providers. They are planning significant data gathering and planning efforts this fall and winter. We will keep you informed about their progress.<br><br>If we are going to continue to improve our contributions to students, to the Church, and to society, we will have to get even better at managing thoughtful and careful changes like these. We will also need to get better at using assessment tools and processes to help us engage in ongoing reevaluation of the results of our work so that we can keep learning and adjusting along the way. From what I have seen, I am hopeful that we will be able to do so.<br><h2><b>Getting Our Hearts Right</b></h2><br>One of the reasons I am optimistic about our chances of refocusing and improving over time is the sense I have of your hearts. I see in you as a body a willingness to put first the needs of students and the Church. Indeed, I think that we have a comparative advantage in this regard that allows us to collaborate across organizational and disciplinary boundaries that are much more difficult to transcend in other universities of similar size. Consider just a few examples.<br><br>I speak with administrative colleagues in other institutions who are amazed at the size of our Freshman Academy. This fall almost one-third of our freshmen are enrolled in this living/learning program. They are even more amazed at the close collaboration between housing, student life, and faculty personnel that is required to make it work well.<br><br>I attended a national conference in June on educational renewal in Seattle. Our Center for the Improvement of Teacher Education and Schooling represents one of the two most prominent national efforts to create a partnership between schools of education, university faculty, and public schools. This partnership has established exciting initiatives to improve the preparation of elementary and secondary teachers, to provide improved literacy for grade-school students, and to prepare administrators, to name just a few. But the most impressive thing to the people in other institutions is the degree of involvement from our deans and faculty in various disciplines. This is a national problem, and although we aren't perfect, we have remarkable support at BYU.<br><br>However, collaborating across the organization is not the same thing as giving up programs in which we have invested our expertise and identity. But, here again, I have seen people with great hearts respond beautifully to changes.<br><br>For example, a chief source of funding and positions for the new School of Family Life has come from the former department of Clothing and Textiles, which was just formally terminated this year. I can tell you from personal experience with our colleagues in that department that they were, to a person, opposed to the decision we finally made to close the department. They were articulate defenders of the programs they had so lovingly and skillfully developed. However, once the decision was made, they have made great efforts to find new ways to contribute. One faculty member is currently helping the Theatre and Media Arts program, another is in the Chemistry Department, and the rest of the faculty, along with the staff and office support, have gone to the new School of Family Life. This infusion of people and resources into the family work will prove to be invaluable. As I mentioned earlier, the opportunity to align with student, Church, and societal needs brings light and excitement and the opportunity to be a standard to the world. This was not a choice between good work and bad work. This choice, like almost all of our choices, was between two or more good things.<br><br>I hasten to clarify that my talk about focusing our university should not be construed to mean that we intend to stamp out individual inspiration and creativity. Our efforts must leave room for some experimentation and individuality. I'll give just one example that may illustrate my concern here. Cole Durham of our Law School just received a university professorship for work that is leading to the establishment of a center to foster religious liberty--work that neither he nor the Law School predicted would be so important to the Church, the discipline, and the world when he arrived some 20 years ago. Until nine years ago he was establishing academic credibility in comparative criminal law, human rights, and comparative religious liberty law. He had felt inspired by something President Oaks had said about international constitutional issues and had been casting about to find his niche. Then, in 1990, the Berlin Wall came down. Cole was in just the right places, with good credentials and contacts. He has been commuting to former Soviet bloc countries ever since to help them fashion new constitutions and statutes that provide for religious liberty. He has become a world expert in this area. His yearly conference on this topic at BYU brings scholars and country officials from across the world. His work has been enormously helpful to the Church in improving its legal status in a variety of countries and in opening doors for our missionaries. We have to have room for such inspiration.<br><br>As an institution we cannot focus on everything. We have to make decisions about where to allocate resources. However, in such a large place we have to provide room for individuals to take risks, to follow their individual inspiration from the Lord, and to pursue important work that may not bear fruit for years.<br><h2><b>Becoming Leaders</b></h2><br>By clarifying BYU's role, focusing our efforts, and collaborating as Christians, we have in many ways become a light and a standard to the nations. There is much at stake. Recent experiences have confirmed to me how important it is to be true to our trust as the Church's university and to be very good at what we choose to do. During the past year or so we have gone through reaccreditation reviews for three programs whose associations had strict policies forbidding discrimination with respect to sexual preference: the Law School, Marriage and Family Therapy, and Clinical Psychology. In each case we explained that our approach is to avoid demeaning others but to be clear that sexual activity outside the bounds of a duly authorized heterosexual marriage would not be accepted. We also suggested that those who fomented in favor of such behavior would be subject to discipline. In each case the accrediting bodies had to consider the quality of these nationally prominent programs and the clarity of our position and practice. All three were given exceptions and were reaccredited.<br><br>However, the case of Clinical Psychology was particularly challenging. The American Psychological Association (APA) sent a second team composed of two members of their national council to investigate this issue after the first visiting team had given us a clean bill of health. President Bateman and I met with them following their interviews with faculty, students, and program administrators. They confirmed that our faculty and students were excellent and that they handled this issue well within the context of our clear policy. I remember telling them that they, the APA, had a real problem. What would it do to their credibility both within and without their association to turn down a program that had contributed so much to the profession for a policy that was so closely aligned with our strongly held religious beliefs? Didn't they believe in institutional pluralism, in our right and responsibility to make our unique contribution to society? They agreed with my assessment. This was their problem, a very difficult one. Shortly after their visit, we received notification that the program had been fully reaccredited.<br><br>I don't relish such confrontations. But I foresee that this is not the last time we will be called to account for our moral choices. We must be very clear about our commitments and our rationale for them. We must also be very good. As President Kimball said, we must be a "unique university in all the world" with a "special glow." If we are, the Lord will bless and prosper our efforts to become a light and a standard to the nations.<br><h2><b>Conclusion</b></h2><br>The work I have been talking about is the institutional equivalent to having our "eye single to the glory of God" (D&amp;amp;C 4:5, 82:19). As you remember, the Lord promises that "if your eye be single to my glory, your whole bodies shall be filled with light, and there shall be no darkness in you" (D&amp;amp;C 88:67). The opposite is also true. Unless we align our eyes and our hearts with God's glory, we will, to that extent, be filled with darkness.<br><br>At the inauguration of President Dallin Oaks, then commissioner of education Neal A. Maxwell said: "Brigham Young University seeks to improve and 'sanctify' itself for the sake of others--not for the praise of the world, but to serve the world better."<sup>14</sup><br><br>May we so sanctify ourselves is my prayer in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Alan L.

<h1>: Eternal Evolution of the Mind, Heart, and Soul - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Brothers and sisters, friends: welcome to the Brigham Young University 1999 fall semester. It is good to be here today. It is awe inspiring to look out over this vast congregation. We are all in the right place at the right time. How very blessed we are to be at this great university to increase our knowledge of truth, both secular and spiritual. The quest for learning is a ceaseless quest for truth.<br><br>Ultimately, any person who seeks after truth will be led to the gospel of Jesus Christ, for it contains all truth. Gospel principles bless all who seek to understand God's ways and His plan for the everlasting salvation of His children. The gospel teaches people who they are and of the potential that life promises not only on this earth but in the eternities. The teachings of the Lord Jesus Christ provide a clear understanding of mankind's relationship to God. Seekers after truth learn that they are His spirit children, that He is a loving and kind Father in Heaven, and that each person's destiny is to return to a heavenly home if they will be true and faithful.<br><h2><b>Eternal Progress</b></h2><br>In a survey of Americans performed for the Lutheran Brotherhood by Yankelovich Partners, most adults were concerned with and wanted answers to eternal questions. Those participating in the survey were asked the following question: "What [would you] ask a god or supreme being if [you] could get a direct and immediate answer?" The most frequently asked question was: "What's my purpose here?" Thirty-four percent, or more than one of every three persons, wanted to know the purpose of life. The second most popular question was: "Will I have life after death?" Almost one out of five persons asked this question. Another 16 percent asked the question: "Why do bad things happen?" and another 7 percent wondered if there is intelligent life elsewhere. Seventy-six percent of the individuals surveyed asked questions pertaining to one's ultimate purpose and destiny. (See "Going to a Higher Authority," USA Snapshots,<i>USA Today</i>[28 May 1999]: 1A.) There is a thirst for spiritual knowledge. The answers to these questions are contained in the gospel of Jesus Christ. The plan of salvation as contained in the restored gospel provides clear and definitive answers to these queries.<br><br>The plan of salvation teaches that mortality is but one stage of life and that life existed before one's birth and stretches into the eternities after death. Life's purpose is to "be added upon" (Abraham 3:26), to be tested, and to participate in a growth process that has eternal consequences. The knowledge gained and the decisions made in this life are critical and determine one's ultimate destiny. Mortality is a time to acquire spiritual knowledge, to be tested with respect to one's use of agency, to experience the bitter and the sweet, to learn from one's mistakes, and to succeed with the Lord's help.<br><br>All of God's children are endowed with a special light or conscience that allows them to differentiate between truth and error (see John 1:9, Moroni 7:15–16) and to learn from experience. The more obedient one is to light, the more truth one receives (see D&amp;amp;C 50:23–24). It follows that the more consistent one's life is in living truth, the greater one's capacity and strength. Some individuals live in a time or place where access to truth is limited. Since earth life is but one phase in eternity, they are given opportunities later consistent with their willingness to live whatever truths they enjoyed on earth (see D&amp;amp;C 137:5–10). There is life after death. There is intelligent life elsewhere (see Moses 1:33). There is purpose to life.<br><br>One of the most glorious truths contained in the Lord's plan is that of eternal progress--the opportunity to progress from mortality to immortality, to overcome death and receive a glorified resurrected body, to overcome weakness and progress until one receives a glory and station like that of our eternal parents (see 1 Corinthians 15:42–44, D&amp;amp;C 76:94–95). President Gordon B. Hinckley has commented on this subject as follows:<br><br><i>The whole design of the gospel is to lead us onward and upward to greater achievement, even, eventually, to godhood. This great possibility was enunciated by the Prophet Joseph Smith in the King Follett sermon (see</i>Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith,<i>pp. 342–62) and emphasized by President Lorenzo Snow. It is this grand and incomparable concept:</i>As God now is, man may become!<i>(See</i>The Teachings of Lorenzo Snow,<i>comp. Clyde J. Williams, Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1984, p. 1.)</i>["Don't Drop the Ball,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 1994, 48; emphasis in original]<br><br>What is eternal progress? For those in mortality and in the spirit world, it is an increase in spiritual knowledge, moral strength, and intelligence based on righteous living. It is the internalizing of true principles in the way one thinks and lives. It is repenting of one's sins and feeling the forgiveness that comes from the Atonement through the Holy Spirit. The scriptures indicate that intelligence is more than intellectual capacity. It is a righteous disposition that leads one to forsake evil (see D&amp;amp;C 93:36–37). The acquiring of spiritual knowledge and intelligence comes through diligence in obeying eternal laws. For one to receive the strength required to progress eternally, one must have a testimony that certain principles are true--i.e., a confirmation through the Holy Spirit that one is on the right path. This requires the companionship of the Holy Ghost. He serves as a teacher, a cleanser, a witness, a sanctifier, and a sealer. He links individuals into the power and grace of the Savior's atonement.<br><br>The growth process is characterized by small steps as indicated by the Lord's words to Nephi:<br><br><i>For behold, thus saith the Lord God: I will give unto the children of men line upon line, precept upon precept, here a little and there a little; and blessed are those who hearken unto my precepts, and lend an ear unto my counsel, for they shall learn wisdom; for unto him that receiveth I will give more; and from them that shall say, We have enough, from them shall be taken away even that which they have.</i>[2 Nephi 28:30]<br><br>The process of spiritual growth described in the above scripture is like the process of a child learning to play the piano. The child begins with simple melodies that are mastered with hours of practice. The practice and lessons learned then provide the foundation for mastering more complex compositions. Eventually, with discipline and rigor and many additional practice hours over a significant period of time, an accomplished pianist is produced. Most growth processes in life are a type and shadow of the way in which God intends for us to grow, line upon line and precept upon precept, until we become finished products. President Hinckley has commented on the growth process in these words:<br><br><i>None of us . . . knows enough. The learning process is an endless process. We must read, we must observe, we must assimilate, and we must ponder that to which we expose our minds. I believe in evolution, not organic evolution, as it is called, but in the evolution of the mind, the heart, and the soul of man. I believe in improvement. I believe in growth.</i>[<i>TGBH,</i>298]<br><br>Several years ago, while my husband and I were living in Japan, we had the opportunity to visit the town of Wajima on the west coast. Wajima is the home of Japan's famous lacquerware. The Wajima factory has a display of the manufacturing process that illustrates the many steps required to create a beautiful piece of lacquerware. There are 19 steps involved before the final design is added. Of particular interest is the number of times an item is polished following the additions of lacquer and lacquer paste. As I studied the various steps, I thought how like life the lacquerware manufacturing process is. As human beings, we are continually being added upon--growing from one lesson to another, from grace to grace.<br><br>Polishing is part of life. Polishing removes the rough edges. Often, polishing is represented by the hard times, the difficult times, the sad times. God does not inflict evil upon us or pave our way with stones. The bad things, referred to in the Yankelovich survey, are often man-made or environmental in origin. Even so, they are part of the design of life. Their purpose is to burnish our souls and help us understand our dependence on God. When we are exhausted from the trials of the day, the Lord through His Spirit refreshes our spirit and prepares us for a new day. Our purpose is not to escape problems but to overcome them with the Lord's help. God through His prophets said, "I have refined thee, but not with silver; I have chosen thee in the furnace of affliction" (Isaiah 48:10). He also said that all "things shall give thee experience, and shall be for thy good" (D&amp;amp;C 122:7). The heat of the day may not only exhaust us but also purge the impurities within.<br><br>In Matthew 5:48 the Lord admonishes all of us: "Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect." It is possible in the eternities to know all things and have the capacity to endure all things and live according to all truth. However, the goal will not be reached in this lifetime, nor can it be accomplished on one's own. As imperfect beings subject to the world's temptations, we need the help of an all-wise Father and His Son. We can only be perfected through the Father's plan, with the core of that plan centered in Christ and His atonement (see Moroni 10:32–33).<br><br>During the time we lived in Japan, we were provided a furnished apartment. Consequently, there were only a few items that we took with us from our home in the United States. Family pictures, books, favorite recipes, and a beautiful crystal egg were among the items we chose. At one point in time, the crystal egg belonged to our daughter Michele. It had been part of her egg collection. When Michele married, she took the eggs to her new home with the exception of the one made of crystal. She said to me, "You keep it, Mom. I know how much you admire it." The crystal egg was special to me. First, it reminded me of Michele, her generosity, and her purity and desire to serve others. It reminded me of the many other eggs in Michele's collection. As the egg collection grew over a number of years, I often thought how like people they are--some large, some small, some plain, others decorative and colorful. Some of the eggs were humorous and others dignified. Looking at the eggs was like looking at humanity--each special in its uniqueness.<br><br>The crystal egg also reminds me of perfection. It has many facets. When the egg is held up to the light, the crystal facets seem to attract, cleave to, and then reflect the light rays. It sets a standard for me. I would like to attract the light of truth into my life and then reflect light to others. I desire to be a servant of Jesus Christ and reflect His light. If the world were filled with light, it would be perfect--perfect in Christ. We would have experienced the step-by-step process of having been born of God. We would have the image of Christ in our countenance (see Alma 5:14).<br><br>The purpose of learning is eternal in nature. Some truths are more important than others. President Spencer W. Kimball stated plainly: "The secular without the foundation of the spiritual is but like the foam upon the milk, the fleeting shadow" (<i>TSWK,</i>390). Sacred truths are the key to one's eternal progress. We<i>have</i>been given much--and we, too, must give. I say this in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Marilyn S. Bateman, wife of Merrill J. Bateman, gave this devotional address on 7 September 1999.</i><br><br><i>© Brigham Young University. All rights reserved.</i>

What a wonderful sight you are--students, faculty, and staff literally gathered from the four corners of the earth in fulfillment of Isaiah's prophecy, wherein he said:<br><br><i>And it shall come to pass in the last days, that the mountain of the Lord's house shall be established in the top of the mountains, and shall be exalted above the hills; and all nations shall flow unto it.</i><br><br><i>. . . Come ye, and let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, to the house of the God of Jacob; and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths.</i>[Isaiah 2:2–3]<br><br>You are gathered in the tops of the mountains to learn of the Lord's ways--both sacred and secular. You have made the journey walking in His paths with a desire to continue. Welcome to the weekly devotional--a hallmark of Brigham Young University, where those who attend have the opportunity to be taught by the Lord's Spirit and by His servants. We extend a warm welcome to the many missionaries who have returned, the large number of new freshmen and transfer students, and almost 20,000 continuing students. You are 29,000 strong and are numbered among the finest young people on earth. All of you are children of Israel--literal or adopted descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. As their children you are entitled to the Lord's blessings promised to them as you follow in their footsteps.<br><br>Last week I participated in the marriage sealing of a young couple in the Salt Lake Temple--the house of the Lord Isaiah saw in vision. The sealing ordinance is one of the supreme blessings inherited from Abraham. In that ceremony, the young couple were promised all the blessings of their forefathers if they would be faithful. They were promised the blessings of the priesthood, a righteous posterity, a homeland, and a kingdom. For some the homeland is in the Middle East. For others it is in the Americas. Or it could be on any of the other continents: Europe, Asia, Africa, or Australia. The spiritual kingdom for which the faithful are striving is the one promised by Christ when he said: "In my Father's house are many mansions: if it were not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you" (John 14:2).<br><br>As I watched the young couple lay claim to their spiritual birthright, I was impressed with the power of knowing and having faith in one's relationship to Abraham and Sarah, to Jacob, to Joseph and his brothers. We are Israel! We are inheritors of the Lord's promises to our ancient forefathers. One of the most powerful and distinguishing doctrines of the restored gospel is the notion that the Bible is about us, that we are part of the biblical narrative. Although the rest of Christianity applies Bible teachings to their lives, it is our belief that the Bible was written by our ancestors, who saw our day and left messages for us.<sup>1</sup>Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and other prophets saw in vision the restoration of the gospel in the last days, the gathering of Israel, the stretching of the Lord's tent across the earth, the building of latter-day Zion and its temples, and stakes being strengthened as a refuge from the storm (see Isaiah 2:2–3; 29; 54:2–4; Jeremiah 29:14; 31; 32:37–40; Ezekiel 37:15–23). And, may I add, Isaiah saw us at Brigham Young University.<br><br>As the children of Israel, we invite you to sup from the Lord's table of learning at this great university where both spiritual and temporal foods are served. We welcome you to the most beautiful campus in America. The buildings are clean, the grounds are paradisiacal, and the Spirit is present. The library addition is complete, the sidewalks and plaza are in place, and the landscaping is almost finished. We invite everyone to become familiar with and use the magnificent, state-of-the-art, underground library. The new building is literally a temple of learning. The glass entryway is stunning as it allows the surrounding landscape and mountains to come inside and combine with the marbled granite floors and stairways. The wood paneling on each level is a work of art. As you walk down the stairs and enter the periodical area, notice how perfectly the wood grain has been matched from one panel to another. Notice the quality of the tables and chairs. Every study table is wired for laptops with connections to Route Y. You will find more sunlight in the new underground library than in any other building on campus.<br><br>It is our hope that everyone will respect this new facility and its contents. Please remember that this campus is different in that the grounds and buildings have been dedicated by prophets as temples of learning and they belong to the Lord. All of us are the Lord's guests while at the university.<br><br>Recently I shared with the faculty and staff some key events from BYU's history. During the preparation of the material, some insights were gleaned with regard to the special nature of this institution. Today I wish to share a few of them with you. Also, four institutional objectives developed during the past year were discussed at the Annual University Conference. They are not new. They are implied by BYU's Mission Statement written in the 1980s and the aims formulated in this decade. In a succinct manner, however, they outline the standards and aspirations set for the university by the board of trustees. I wish to examine them from a student's point of view.<br><h2><b>Lessons from BYU's History</b></h2><br>The first lesson one learns in reviewing BYU's history concerns the extraordinary faith of the early Saints who forged this institution. They founded Brigham Young Academy in a desert with a fragile economic base. However, they understood the importance of education, especially for their children, and were willing to sacrifice every temporal asset they had in order to keep the school alive. This was true of the faculty and staff and also of the citizens throughout the valley. It was not uncommon for Karl G. Maeser and his staff to receive less than one-half pay during the 1880s. Abraham O. Smoot, a highly successful businessman, stake president, mayor of Provo, and chairman of the board of Brigham Young Academy, gave his buildings, his land, and mortgaged his home in order to save the institution. He died penniless, having given everything to the school.<br><br>The faith of BYU's founders was never stronger than during times of crisis. I was particularly impressed with Karl G. Maeser's conviction as he responded to Reed Smoot, a student, during the 1884 fire that destroyed the academy's only building. As it became apparent that they could not save the Lewis building, the student said to Maeser, "Oh, Brother Maeser, the Academy is burned!" Maeser responded, "No such thing, it's only the building."<sup>2</sup>Six years earlier, shortly after the death of Brigham Young, Maeser had a dream in which President Young showed him the design of a new building. At the time Brother Maeser did not understand the purpose of the dream. Six years later, as he looked at the charred ruins of Lewis Hall, he could see in his mind's eye the building that would take its place.<sup>3</sup><br><br>The second observation one notes while looking at BYU's history is the strong link forged between the university and the heavens. Each time a crisis threatened the survival of the school, the heavens were opened and instructions given. Principal Maeser's dream about the new building was the first. A second occurred a few years later in the mid-1880s. During one of the darkest hours, when it seemed that the school would close, Brigham Young appeared to President John Taylor, assuring him of the school's importance in the kingdom and giving him instructions for its survival. In the dream President Young said that "Christ himself was directing, and had a care over [the] school."<sup>4</sup><br><br>On another occasion, Karl G. Maeser had a dream in which he was shown the university of our day. This dream was given to at least two other persons during the early part of BYU's history. The dreams assured the continuance of the university by showing the upper campus "filled with buildings--great temples of learning" with thousands of students attending. (This morning as I stood in the Smoot Building and looked out on the new quad and saw students crossing in every direction, I believe I saw what Karl G. Maeser saw in 1885.) When Karl G. Maeser received the dream, the university did not have a building and only a few students. He told his wife and daughter that he wanted to do his "part in contributing to the fulfillment of that dream."<sup>5</sup><br><br>A second time the vision was given to a student as well, young Alfred Kelly. He was scheduled to give a commencement address and to also encourage the sale of the upper campus so the school's debts could be paid. He was troubled by the assignment and had written and discarded a number of speeches-dev. The following is an account of Kelly's experience as recorded by B. F. Larsen, who was president of the graduating class at the time Kelly gave the speech.<br><br><i>Finally one morning with a feeling of desperation he walked toward Temple Hill. He stopped to rest and think when he reached the hill top. . . .</i><br><br><i>He partially closed his eyes and was startled. He stood as if transformed. The advancing sunlight suddenly assumed the appearance of people. The trees, the bushes, the ripples on the surface of Utah Lake, everything in the valley disappeared. Only people were there, young people moving toward Temple Hill. Hundreds of people, thousands of young people came into view advancing with the warm sunlight to the place where this campus is now built. . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . The whole of the present campus was illumined beyond the power of description and Kelly saw buildings here, not homes but temples of learning, large buildings, beautiful buildings, buildings which covered the top of this hill.</i><sup>6</sup><br><br>At the commencement Kelly shared his experience. The message was so powerful that Jesse Knight, touched by the Spirit, came forward and offered his resources to save the campus.<sup>7</sup><br><br>The third time the vision was given, Sidney B. Sperry, a faculty member, assured his colleagues that the university would not be sold or given away. His dream occurred in the early 1930s during the depths of the depression. He had just learned that New York bankers had told President Heber J. Grant that a loan to the Church was conditional on the closing of Brigham Young University. Brother Sperry went home heartsick that evening but was<br><br><i>awakened in the middle of the night and saw a vision of the Brigham Young University of the future. He saw beautiful modern buildings extending along the entire east bench and saw great concourses of people coming to the University to receive guidance and instruction. In connection with the University he saw a temple and therefore knew that . . . BYU was going to remain a Church institution.</i><sup>8</sup><br><br>It is interesting to note that the vision of thousands of young people gathering on Temple Hill in beautiful, modern buildings was given to a head of the institution, to a faculty member, and to a student. There is a law that begins, "In the mouth of two or three witnesses" (2 Corinthians 13:1, D&amp;amp;C 6:28).<br><br>A final insight gleaned from the historical review concerns the element of sacrifice. From the beginning, sacrifice has been an operational principle of this institution. Almost everyone associated with BYU has felt a special commitment to its divine mission and has been willing to give whatever was needed in order to move the university forward. I am reminded of Carl F. Eyring, dean of Arts and Sciences in the late 1940s. Besides teaching his share of classes and serving as dean, he also supervised the construction of the Eyring Science Center. He spent evenings and Saturdays doing manual labor on the building. Ill with cancer during the last year of its construction, he died soon after the building was dedicated.<sup>9</sup>The marvelous building named after him has just been renovated. It was refurbished rather than razed because of its superior construction. Today it stands as a memorial to this man's willingness to sacrifice his time, energy, and his life for the university.<br><br>As I contemplate the commitment and sacrifice of those who have gone before, I wonder what the Lord expects of us. We live in a time of abundance. Perhaps our call is not one of financial leanness but one of time and commitment to excellence. If Brigham Young University is to reach its destiny of becoming a world-class university, it will happen only if we continue the tradition of sacrifice--a sacrifice of time, talents, and heart to the advancement of truth and knowledge. We must be frugal in the use of our resources, but not in our willingness to spend our time and energy to become the very best. With these insights in mind, we now turn to the four institutional objectives.<br><h2><b>Institutional Objectives</b></h2><br>The first objective is concerned with the quality of learning at Brigham Young University. The objective relates to the four aims and is as follows:<br><br><b>Educate the minds and spirits of students</b>within a learning environment that<br><br>• increases faith in God and the restored gospel,<br><br>• is intellectually enlarging,<br><br>• is character building,<br><br>• and leads to a life of learning and service.<br><br>The aims are concerned with the souls of men and women. This institution was established to educate the mind, the heart, and the spirit. Unlike most other institutions that began with these objectives, we have not narrowed our purpose during the past century. Evidence of our continued pursuit of all four aims is found in the Princeton Review's<i>The Best 331 Colleges,</i>published just one week ago.<sup>10</sup>This edition for the year 2000 randomly sampled 59,000 students at 331 colleges asking questions about academics, campus life, study hours, and other topics. The local press often publicizes the fact that we rank as the number one "stone-cold sober school." But that ranking is a derivative of something much more basic and important. That ranking reflects the faith of our faculty, staff, and students. To illustrate, BYU ranks number one in the survey with respect to students who "pray on a regular basis." BYU students were ranked the most religious. We rank in the top 20 in terms of student satisfaction. For me, the most satisfying ranking was the school with the "best quality of life." If we are true to the university mission, this campus should enjoy an unparalleled quality of life. These rankings speak not only to the spiritual dimension of the university but also to academics and character development. A recent survey by another polling group suggested that BYU continues its academic climb. There is more and more recognition of the university's intellectual accomplishments across a broad spectrum.<sup>11</sup><br><br>As students, what is your responsibility with respect to the first objective? First, you have a responsibility to strengthen your testimony while at the university. The faculty, staff, and ecclesiastical leaders can provide you with many opportunities. But the choice is yours. I recommend that you read the scriptures daily, even if only for a few minutes. Accept Church assignments and fulfill them. Make daily prayer a pattern in your life. You cannot afford days without prayer. President Hinckley recently told a congregation of youth:<br><br><i>You need His help. You cannot do it alone. You'll come to realize that and recognize that. Live worthy of the blessings of God. Get on your knees and thank Him for His goodness to you and express unto Him the righteous desires of your hearts. He hears, He responds, He answers.</i><sup>12</sup><br><br>Next, you must study! It takes approximately three hours of study outside class for every hour in the classroom. If you take 15 hours of credit, you should allocate upward of 45 hours for study per week. That still leaves more than 100 hours for work, sleep, and personal time. I also recommend that you establish personal relationships with faculty and staff. The stretching of your intellect occurs as much through relationships with people as through books.<br><br>The second institutional objective is also concerned with learning. It is concerned with the quality of research at BYU. It is defined as follows:<br><br><b>Advance truth and knowledge</b>to<br><br>• enhance the education of students,<br><br>• enrich the quality of life,<br><br>• and contribute to a resolution of world problems.<br><br>The second objective is concerned with consequential creative work. It may be done in the laboratory, in the art studio, in the library, in a faculty office, or in a student apartment. It is our hope that this objective will become one of the defining characteristics of the university. We are working diligently to improve our graduate research programs. Just as important, we expect BYU to become a leader in undergraduate research in America. BYU faculty are engaged in making the world a better place. The learning process requires that students participate! You have not come here just to read books under the guidance of a professor. You must become engaged in the research process. This is not always possible as a freshman or sophomore. Often an intellectual foundation must be established before contributing to the discipline is possible. On the other hand, we have outstanding examples of freshmen becoming engaged in research. By the time a student leaves BYU, he or she should have been involved in a creative project. The student will learn more and be better prepared to contribute to a world awaiting solutions. Freshmen and sophomores, find out what juniors and seniors are doing in the way of research.<br><br>The third institutional objective extends the reach of the university to members in other parts of the world. It reads as follows:<br><br><b>Extend the blessings of learning</b>to members of the Church in all parts of the world.<br><br>What can a student do to advance the cause of learning among Church members beyond the campus? The first is to serve a mission. You will have an opportunity to teach the gospel to members and nonmembers. You may serve in a foreign country and have a companion who does not speak English. One of the most important skills in today's business world is a command of the English language. Be diligent in helping your companion improve his or her English skills as they help you master their language. Encourage them to attend the institute program when they finish their missions.<br><br>Another opportunity is in the area of service-learning internships. At this point in time, there are a small number of openings for students with a command of Spanish or Portuguese to serve in a Latin American country teaching English as a second language or computer skills to recently returned native missionaries. This program is being conducted in cooperation with Church Welfare Services and the CES institute program. We have learned that some Church members in developing countries can double or triple their salaries with four to six months training in English and computers. There are other service-learning opportunities as well.<br><br>If you as a student have computer programming skills, there may be an opportunity to work with faculty, the curriculum design unit, or the Division of Continuing Education in preparing a semester-online course for on-campus use or an Internet course for off-campus use. Last year I was surprised to learn that one of my close friends from West Africa, a freshman, was programming Web courses for Continuing Education. We now have approximately 1,000 students in other parts of the world taking online courses from BYU. This number is expected to increase exponentially over the next few years.<br><br>The final objective is:<br><br><b>Develop friends</b>for the university and the Church.<br><br>May I use two examples to illustrate the ways in which students can contribute to this objective. The first comes in the form of a letter written to Janet Scharman, dean of Student Life. The letter describes the service rendered by a BYU student to a stranger and the feelings engendered in the recipient:<br><br><i>A few months ago, I was driving home from Salt Lake, and my car broke down on the very dark and snowy main road of Tooele. The snow was coming down hard and. . .the road was very dark. I didn't know what to do, and I didn't want to call my wife. . .and subject her and our six-year-old son to the extreme and dangerous weather conditions. I was thinking about walking the two to three miles home when a car pulled up behind me on the side of the road. I walked back to the car, and the driver asked me if I needed any help. I told him that my car lost power, and I didn't know what could have happened. He said that he'd be more than happy to give me a lift home.. . .I asked where he lived in Tooele.. . .He said he didn't live in Tooele. He was on his way back to BYU, saw that I was broken down, and turned around to help! I couldn't believe it! He had all that driving to do on a dark snowy night, and he took his valuable driving time (and personal safety) to help a total stranger!. . .I explained to him that I was from the California Bay Area, and this type of thing is just unheard of!. . .I was so happy and ecstatic with him that I asked for his name and who to write to at BYU. Needless to say,</i>[the young man]<i>was very humble and said, "Oh, don't worry about it, they don't even know who I am. You don't need to do that." I told him that I did need to.. . .Janet, please find</i>[this young man].<i>Let him know that "they" do know who he is and that BYU should be proud to have someone like him representing their school.</i><sup>13</sup><br><br>The story illustrates the power of serving others. When one forgets oneself and reaches out to help a person in need, a friendship begins. It is my understanding that the letter has been made known to our student, and he is to be commended for representing himself and the school so well.<br><br>The second story unfolded this summer and centers on the service rendered a foreign government officer by two BYU students from the same country. The official had been assigned by her government to do a special report on the LDS Church. Until the assignment she had been responsible for minority religions in her country. She had completed sometime earlier a PhD thesis on Protestantism in America. In order to complete her study of the LDS Church, she was invited by Church officials to spend three weeks in Salt Lake City and Provo visiting with Church leaders and a small team of BYU faculty.<br><br>Three individuals were assigned to host the visitor. One was a professor at BYU who was a returned mission president from the visitor's country. Two were BYU women students native to the country in question. Between the three of them, they arranged housing, meals, appointments, translation, and visits to Temple Square, Welfare Square, and other off-campus sites. They helped her gather information and learn firsthand about the Church.<br><br>During the second week the visitor became ill. Having some knowledge of the Church, she asked one of her student hosts if it would be possible to receive a health blessing. The young student, a recent convert, responded favorably but was not sure who might give the blessing. She asked for a little time. Suddenly she felt a prompting and hurried to the temple. There she met two returned missionaries who had served in her homeland. They accepted the invitation and administered to the visitor. Three days later the government visitor said to her student friend, "Your Church is true!"<br><br>The student responded, "Why do you say that?"<br><br>The woman then said, "Because of the feeling that was present during the blessing given by the two young men."<br><br>One does not know what the government official will do in her personal life with respect to the Church. One does know, however, that a strong friendship exists between the woman and her hosts. The students and the professor who served her during the three-week period have become the woman's close friends. The professor has been invited to attend the meeting at which she will present her report to top government leaders.<br><br>Service is the key to friendship. When we give of our time and talents to help others, positive relationships develop.<br><br>Brothers and sisters, you have been gathered in the tops of the mountains for a special purpose. You have been seen in vision on a number of occasions. Isaiah said that you would come "walk[ing] in his paths" in order to learn "of his ways" (Isaiah 2:3). Karl G. Maeser, Alfred Kelly, and Sidney B. Sperry saw you by the thousands entering modern buildings on Temple Hill. You have been gathered on this campus to strengthen your testimonies and acquire sacred and secular knowledge that will give you the power to be a righteous influence in this world. May the Lord bless you to this end is my prayer in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Merrill J. Bateman was the president of Brigham Young University when this devotional address was given on 7 September 1999.</i><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>1. See Richard D. Ouellette, "Mormon Studies,"<i>Religious Studies Review</i>25, no. 2 (April 1999), 162: In reviewing Philip L. Barlow's<i>Mormons and the Bible,</i>Ouellette notes that Joseph "Smith viewed his life as a continuation of the biblical narrative." And, quoting Barlow, Ouellette also observed that "as the Saints trekked to the West, reliving the story of Israel, the 'Mormon identification with biblical peoples, events, and prophecies became experientially more all-encompassing than that of any other major group during the nineteenth century, and probably of the preceding and succeeding centuries as well' (100)."<br><br>2.

<h1>Regrets - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I am deeply humbled to be in communication with you tonight. You are some of the most choice, righteous, and devoted of Father in Heaven's children on earth. I have had the personal privilege of being with many of you in different locations throughout the world. I am most grateful for this opportunity to share another experience with you tonight.<br><br>You represent the flower of the youth of the Church. I feel that as a body you are better prepared and are more valiant in confronting the challenges of the world in your determination to obey the Master than any other generation in the history of the Church. The challenges you face are also more numerous and more intensely focused. Yet never was there a more exciting, stimulating, potentially productive time to live on earth.<br><br>Some of you are ending a summer vacation and beginning a new experience in formal education. Others are nearing completion of that education. Some are doing other important things. All face vitally important decisions. From whatever background or whatever activity you come, I welcome you.<br><h2><b>Making Decisions</b></h2><br>Inasmuch as this assignment has been known for some time, I have pondered and prayed, weighed different alternative subjects, and finally felt to select one intended to help you make well those decisions that vitally affect your happiness now and forever. Those decisions include: who will be your eternal companion, what will be your profession, how will you sustain your family, and how to live worthily in a world that is ever more difficult. I have read and pondered scriptures and some works of the prophets, seeking to identify principles that will help you make the right choices and follow them to a successful conclusion.<br><br>Because you are an exceptionally select audience, I believe that, regarding most important things in life, you already know what to do; you have made those decisions. But perhaps there are some who find, as do I, that at times it's hard to complete all of the important decisions made. I don't mean that one is necessarily doing the wrong things, just that not enough of the right ones are being accomplished. I feel deeply the responsibility of sharing truths with you tonight in a way that is acceptable to the Lord and helpful to each of you personally to make and keep correct decisions.<br><h2><b>Trust and Deceit</b></h2><br>I would like to begin with two visual aids to illustrate the two potent influences that constantly surround you. I will then use a third illustration to help you confirm which of these influences you may be following at a given moment in your life.<br><br>Would those individuals who were selected to help me quickly come up to the stand? I need to explain what we are going to do. I am going to ask you to form a circle. As I describe what we are going to do, I want to explain that this may look like it will be dangerous to you--but if you trust me, I promise it won't be. I'm going to ask you to follow exactly what I tell you to do. If you don't, I'm not going to feel responsible.<br><br>As I explain what we are going to do, if anybody wants to back out, I'll understand. [Elder Scott held up a lightbulb with two cords.] I'm going to cut off this extra plug that we won't need, and then I am going to bare the wires. What I'm going to ask you to do is to grasp your hands. Elder Eyring, you are Commissioner of Education, you ought to have some fun with this. Would you wrap that bare wire around your finger? Now grasp hands. Does somebody want to hold this other bare wire? Please hold it very carefully. Anyone want to leave? Do you know what I am going to do now? I am going to plug this in. Now don't go up in flames.<br><br>[He plugged in the cord and the lightbulb lit up, but nothing happened to those holding the wires.] Thank you. Nothing happened. But before I go on, I want to tell you: Don't<i>ever</i>try to do that yourself. Because I knew they would trust me, I made it so that there was no way that second wire could be connected to the current. In a few minutes I'm going to explain the purpose of that. First, I have another test to run.<br><br>I have a block of wood here, and I'm going to show you a demonstration of the power of mind over matter. All right? Now I have never done this publicly, so if I fail, will you please forgive me? I am going to concentrate so hard on that block that I am going to see if I can make it move. Now just bear with me for a second. [He concentrated on the block for a moment, and it moved.] Now with that encouragement, I am going to see if I can make it fall over. [He concentrated again and, with some exertion, it fell over.]<br><br>The purpose of these examples is to demonstrate that one of the forces in your life is trust; the other is deceit. That was deceit. I don't have the power to move anything with my mind, and I don't think anybody else has. There is a radio-controlled device inside of it that made it possible for me to move that over. Now let me explain what we have just done and why.<br><br>Although we have had some fun, these examples I have shared were not intended for entertainment. They are to provide a hook in your mind where you can securely tie eternal principles that will help you identify, choose, and fulfill correct decisions so as to receive the blessings the Lord wants you to obtain.<br><br>The first example embodies many of the challenges in life. I asked a group of trusting youth to do something their own experience would indicate would bring them difficulty. Yet I also said, "If you will follow my instructions carefully, I promise you that nothing unpleasant will happen to you. You have my promise. But please follow carefully the instructions I give you or I cannot be responsible." They trusted me, and because of that trust we were able to carry out a useful illustration.<br><br>In another place in the world, with a small group of youth, I tried this same demonstration. As I explained to the young men and women in the circle that nothing would happen to them, I noticed that one of the girls, whom I had intended to hold the bare wire, carefully moved her fingers down the cable until it reached the insulation. She did not trust me. I was greatly disappointed. Yet this is an example of how some in the world today meet challenges. They want to have it both ways. They want to appear to be doing the right things, but they also want to earn the friendship of those who are not.<br><h2><b>Trust the Lord</b></h2><br>Do not play games with the Lord. When you trust Him fully, He is able to bless you richly. He knows what is best for you. Sometimes a very clever person can deceive a human being, but none of us can do that with the Lord. Trust Him. Live so that He can trust you. He then can guide and bless you more abundantly. I am confident that the Lord expects each of you exceptional youth to do the right things. He expects you to be pillars of strength in His kingdom.<br><br>What of my mind over matter example? I explained that it was based on deceit. Did that remind you of so many things you see in the world around you? One who follows the pattern of deceit tries to appear to have influence and capabilities that he does not possess.<br><br>Satan is the epitome of this model of life. Lucifer does not have power over a righteous individual because the Lord strengthens that person. Be assured that were he to have such capacity he would use it. God's constant protection of our moral agency assures that he cannot have such power. Satan can have no influence over a righteous individual unless that person yields to temptation or allows fear to overcome faith.<br><br>The devil does have great influence in this world, because individuals make the wrong choices. He is the father of lies. Nothing he tempts you to do will have a beneficial outcome--absolutely nothing. The hook may be baited by seemingly attractive promises and outcomes, but he is the master of deceit and his agents are powerfully effective in his cause. As a servant of Jesus Christ, I bear solemn witness that as you trust the Lord, are obedient to His commandments, and follow the directions of the Spirit, Satan will not have power over you.<br><br>The heavenly light that sheds forth from God has power to overcome the darkness of unwholesome influences around you. That is as certain to occur as does a brilliant light overpower the darkness in a room. How can you get the brilliant light of the Lord into your life more abundantly? By making consistently the right choices and fulfilling them.<br><h2><b>Discerning Between Good and Evil</b></h2><br>Now I would like to illustrate how you can determine when an influence for good or evil is operating in your life.<br><br>I have asked Camille Call to help me if she will. Do you know what we are going to do?<br><br><i>Camille:</i>I have no idea.<br><br>Great. That means it's going to work. I have arranged this box so that one part of it has a very powerful attraction to good, and another part has a very strong rejection. Can you pass your hand over the box and see whether you can tell me where either one is? You can't do it; I could not do it.<br><br>Now let me give you a sensor. [He handed her a green magnet.] That is a sensor that is attracted to good. Can you find where the attraction is on the box? [Camille placed the magnet on the "good" side, and it was attracted to it.] Now, it should be rejected from the bad part. Can you move it around until something happens? There it is; you found it.<br><br>I am going to give you a sensor that represents evil. [He handed her a red magnet.] Show me what happens with it when you try those same places. It is rejected from good and attracted to evil.<br><br>Okay, now let me put another box representing transgression on top of that one. With the good sensor, see if you can sense the good. Can you feel it there? Is it weaker? Look for the evil. Try it; see if it is stronger. It is much stronger, isn't it?<br><br>Let's do it again with more transgression. [He placed another box on top of the other two.] See if you can even detect any of the good. No? How about the evil? It is rejecting it. Try the other sensor, the evil one. Is it stronger? Yes. Thanks, Camille. Now let's explain the meaning of that example.<br><br>Did you notice how Camille was able to discern invariably, without error, the influence representing good and the influence representing evil with the sensing tool that was provided, when there was no barrier in the way? As I added the barriers representing transgression, detection of good was more difficult and finally impossible, whereas the influence of evil grew stronger.<br><br>We also observed that when an evil-seeking tool was used, evil appeared to be good and good appeared evil. That is what occurs when an individual begins to rationalize departures from truth and proper behavior. It may begin with a small thing and then grow and grow into major difficulties.<br><br>You have observed in the lives of others how particularly serious transgressions become increasingly compelling. Finally the person is consumed by such appetites and does things that seem to be totally unreasonable and illogical. One cannot understand why a growing array of commandments are broken through a pattern of life that cannot bring happiness. It is because sin is addictive. Once begun, serious sin is hard to restrain and most difficult to overcome.<br><br>You have the capacity to develop an incredibly sensitive instrument within your own being to discern righteous and evil influences around you. It is done by cultivating the gift of the Holy Ghost. That is accomplished by consistent, righteous living so that the correct choices are made and followed to completion. As you enhance your capacity to sense the direction of that infallible influence in your life, you will avoid disappointment, discouragement, and even tragedy. May this simple example help you remember to trust the Lord, His servants, and those who are living exemplary lives, who you know have no ulterior motive in the counsel they give.<br><h2><b>Currents of Divine Influence</b></h2><br>In the October 1974 semiannual general conference, President Spencer W. Kimball gave a message that has repeatedly blessed my life. He spoke of how icebergs are quietly moved through the ocean by immense currents that guide them. He taught that we are more like ships than icebergs, for we have our own motive power to give us the advantage. He said:<br><br><i>The icebergs spawned by the Greenland ice sheet followed a highly predictable course. As the silent Labrador Current ceaselessly moves to the south through Baffin Bay and Davis Strait, it takes with it these mountainous icebergs, even against the force of the winds and the waves and the tides. Currents have much more power to control its course than the surface winds.</i>[<i>CR,</i>October 1974, 159; or "Ocean Currents and Family Influences,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 1974, 110]<br><br>President Kimball continued:<br><br><i>Youth . . . are subjected to so many swirling winds that we sometimes wonder if they can survive. The winds of fashion push those about who are insecure and who require the feeling that they are in step with the crowd. The winds of sexual temptation drive some to . . . dash bright prospects or to degrade themselves. Bad companions, addicting drugs, the arrogance of profanity, the slough of pornography--all these and more act as influences pushing us, if we are not being carried forward by a strong, steady current toward the righteous life.</i>[<i>CR,</i>October 1974, 160; or "Ocean Currents,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 1974, 110–11]<br><br>This example has taught me that there are currents of divine influence in our lives that will lead each of us along the individual plan the Lord would have us fulfill here on earth. Seek, through the Spirit, to identify and carefully follow the current of direction that the Lord has placed in your life. Align yourself with it. Choose, willingly, to exercise your agency to follow it. Do not be overcome by concentrating solely on today and its challenges, difficulties, and opportunities. President Kimball called those things the relatively insignificant surface winds and waves of today. They are the preoccupations that must not capture your interest and attention so as to consume your life.<br><br>Oh, how I would encourage you to weave deeply into the fabric of your soul the recognition that your life now is a part of a much bigger plan the Lord has for you. You lived part of it in the premortal existence. You were valiant there and came here because you wanted to grow more and enjoy greater happiness. What you decide to do now will affect how well that divine plan He has for you is fulfilled. More than that, your decisions today can powerfully affect your children and grandchildren. Think carefully about the preparation of the parents of your own children. Of course, I mean you and the eternal companion you will be sealed to in the temple.<br><br>The more closely you follow the current of divine guidance, the greater will be your happiness here and for eternity--moreover, the more abundant will be your progress and capacity to serve. I do not fully understand how it is done, but this current in your life does not take away your agency. That right of moral agency is so important to our Father in Heaven that He was willing to lose one-third of His spirit children that it might be preserved.<br><br>You can make the decisions you choose to make. A disposition to do right brings peace of mind and heart. Should choices be wrong, there is a path back: repentance. When its conditions are fully met, the Atonement of the Savior provides a release from the demands of justice for the errors made. You can again follow the plan the Lord has for you here on earth. It is wondrously simple, and so incomparably beautiful.<br><br>As you continue to live righteously, you will always know what to do. Sometimes the discovery of that may require significant effort and trust on your part. Yet you will recognize what to do as you meet the conditions for such divine guidance: obedience to the commandments of the Lord, trust in His plan, and avoidance of anything that is contrary to it.<br><h2><b>Distractions</b></h2><br>Have you noticed that when you have determined to accomplish a very important task, many other good ideas for other things to do seem to come to your mind? If they are allowed to interfere, they will distract you from the more important objective. I have found help by writing down those thoughts as they come, promising myself that as soon as I finish the important task, I will attend to them in priority. That practice helps me stay focused on those matters which are essential.<br><br>I believe there are times in your life when, because of your righteousness and your determination to do what is right, Satan will not be able to deflect you into serious transgression. He will switch then to the strategy of placing before you a banquet of good and worthwhile things to do, meant to distract you from those that are the most important and essential to accomplish in your life.<br><br>Fortunately, as you pray for guidance, the Holy Ghost will help you identify those matters that are vital and necessary to accomplish above others. That means that at times you may have to set aside things that would be worthwhile and enjoyable to pursue--for those that are most vitally important for that period of your life.<br><br>Have you discovered that detailed instructions on how to make choices, or how to live your life based on someone else's experiences, are not nearly as helpful as is personal guidance from the Holy Ghost? Such divine guidance comes from pondering and living the doctrines of the Lord, understanding His plan of happiness, and obtaining the ordinances and keeping the covenants central to that plan. Such a foundation allows the Holy Ghost to give you guidance and direction, taking into consideration your personal strengths and needs. The promptings of the Holy Ghost will tell you how you stand before God, if you are progressing or retrogressing, what you need to improve on, and how to do it.<br><h2><b>Do What Is Right</b></h2><br>The principles we have discussed I know are true. They have blessed my life many times. One vivid example is when I was called to be a mission president. At the time I was working as a civilian for an admiral in charge of a program essential to the national defense of our country. When I told the admiral of the call, he was most upset because he did not understand how it had come and what it meant. He concluded a tense conversation with these words: "You are a traitor to your country. I'll see that you never have success in this industry. I will not speak to you again. You are finished here. If that's the way Mormons are, I'm going to get rid of all that work for me."<br><br>I said, "Admiral, I will carefully turn my assignment over to a replacement unless you prevent me from continuing in this office."<br><br>I knew what was right for me to do, but I was very concerned that my decision could cause a loss of work for innocent people who were honorably supporting their families in the program. As I struggled with that thought, there came into my mind the words of the song "Do what is right; let the consequence follow" ("Do What Is Right,"<i>Hymns,</i>1985, no. 237). I could not see how that challenge could possibly be worked out, but I felt a peace and a calmness as I proceeded to do my best to instruct a replacement.<br><br>I can see now that the Lord guided me each step of the way in what to do and what to say. My replacement was a very capable, experienced individual who learned rapidly. I was impressed to identify those things that needed to be done and even was able to outline some suggestions for important future improvements in the program.<br><br>On my last day at work I met with the admiral again. The experience was totally different. That conversation ended with a much deeper appreciation for each other and for my beliefs. No other Church member was adversely affected because of my decision.<br><br>As we close this experience together, think of what the words of the song "Do What Is Right" mean in your life. May the doctrinal message it contains be as helpful to you as it has been to me.<br><h2><b>Live to Have No Regrets</b></h2><br>Unless you have already done so, make this decision now: "I will live to have no regrets." I cannot tell you how immensely important it is for your life here on earth and throughout eternity to be able to say, regarding those serious sins of immorality that could be committed on earth, "I have no regrets; I have not participated."<br><br>I know that through the process of repentance even egregious sins can be forgiven. Yet, in quiet moments of deep pondering, there must remain a disturbing memory when those boundaries have been crossed, even when full forgiveness has been given by the Savior. How much more serenely pleasant it is to live never having done those things. I testify that such a life brings immense joy, peace, and tranquility. Live to have no regrets.<br><br>There are many ways to be motivated to do good in life. Perhaps setting goals is one that helps you, or establishing a way to report progress toward those goals with a trusted parent, friend, or priesthood leader.<br><br>You may have discovered that an even stronger motivating force to do right is to study, ponder, and distill truths from the doctrines of the Church as the very foundation of your life. Doctrine, understood and applied, is a mighty, sustaining, supporting force when we have determined to do what is right.<br><br>I have found another extremely potent motivating influence. I am sure many of you have discovered it. It is the love of a cherished, eternal companion and a compelling desire not to disappoint her. With that there is the powerful motivating force of the love of children and parents.<br><br>Yet there is another, even more significant, motivating influence than these. It is the profound love of Father in Heaven and His Beloved Son Jesus Christ and of the Holy Ghost. This divine Godhead is the very foundation of all that we experience and enjoy for good. It is our Father's plan of happiness that provides the way. It is the love of our Savior for us and His capacities earned from His willing Atonement that give us the power to grow and overcome mistakes. It is the direction of the Holy Ghost that leads us to make the right choices and warns us of dangers in our path. These, my dear friends, provide the basis upon which you can build a secure life. They are absolutely trustworthy, They are perfect in love and compassion, and They want your success more than you could ever desire. They will help you<i>live to have no regrets.</i><br><br>I solemnly testify that this Being we refer to as our Master and Redeemer is a glorified being of incomparable capacity to express love. I bear a solemn witness that He lives and will guide you. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Richard G. Scott was a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when this fireside address was given at Brigham Young University on 12 September 1999.</i><br><br><i>© Intellectual Reserve, Inc.

<h1>s: Our Greatest Search - James E. Faust - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
My beloved brothers and sisters, to be on this campus and in your presence is always a joy. I must confess, however, that I feel overwhelmed at the prospect of addressing so many of you and saying something that justifies taking you away from your studies. I do not have the answer to all of life's questions. I don't even know all the questions!<br><br>I feel a bit like the college professor who asked a student during an examination: "Does the question embarrass you?"<br><br>"Not at all, sir," replied the student; "not at all. It is quite clear. It is the answer that bothers me!" (From<i>10,000 Jokes, Toasts, and Stories,</i>eds. Lewis and Faye Copeland [Garden City, New York: Doubleday, 1965], 375 [#3842].)<br><br>My beloved companion of 56 years is here with me today, and I express appreciation to her. She has walked with me in a joint search for happiness that, on my part, has exceeded my fondest hopes and expectations. Indeed, it is our search for happiness that I wish to discuss today. Having lived quite a few years now, I have concluded that since we don't always desire that which is good, having all our desires granted to us would not bring us happiness (see Alma 41:3–7). In fact, instant and unrestrained gratification of all our desires would be the shortest and most direct route to unhappiness. The many hours I have spent listening to the tribulations of men and women have persuaded me that both happiness and unhappiness are much of our own making.<br><br>As the Prophet Joseph Smith told us:<br><br><i>Happiness is the object and design of our existence; and will be the end thereof, if we pursue the path that leads to it; and this path is virtue, uprightness, faithfulness, holiness, and keeping all the commandments of God.</i>[<i>Teachings,</i>255–56]<br><br>The more faithfully we keep the commandments of God, the happier we will be.<br><br>Although men are "that they might have joy" (2 Nephi 2:25), this does not mean that our lives will be filled only with joy, "for it must needs be, that there is an opposition in all things" (2 Nephi 2:11). Happiness is not given to us in a package that we can just open up and consume. Nobody is ever happy 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Rather than thinking in terms of a day, we perhaps need to snatch happiness in little pieces, learning to recognize the elements of happiness and then treasuring them while they last.<br><br>Pleasure is often confused with happiness but is by no means synonymous with it. The poet Robert Burns wrote an excellent definition of pleasure in these lines:<br><br><i>But pleasures are like poppies spread--<br>You seize the flow'r, its bloom is shed;<br>Or like the snow falls in the river--<br>A moment white, then melts forever;<br>Or like the borealis race,<br>That flit ere you can point their place;<br>Or like the rainbow's lovely form<br>Evanishing amid the storm.</i><br>[<i>Tam O'Shanter</i>(1793), lines 59–66]<br><br>Pleasure, unlike happiness, is that which pleases us or gives us gratification. Usually it endures for only a short time. As President McKay once said, "You may get that transitory pleasure, yes, but you cannot find joy, you cannot find happiness. Happiness is found only along that well beaten track, narrow as it is, though straight, which leads to life eternal" (<i>CR,</i>October 1919, 180).<br><br>We are enticed daily to pursue worldly pleasures that may divert us from the path to happiness. But the path to true and lasting happiness is, repeating the Prophet Joseph Smith's words, "virtue, uprightness, faithfulness, holiness, and keeping all the commandments of God" (<i>Teachings,</i>255–56). Ralph Waldo Emerson said, "Rectitude is a perpetual victory, celebrated not by cries of joy but by serenity, which is joy fixed or habitual" ("Character,"<i>Essays: Second Series</i>[1844]).<br><br>Your presence here today indicates that since the beginning you have shared the desire to be happy with all mankind. Obviously there is a great difference between feeling happy at a given moment and being happy for a lifetime, between having a good time and leading a good life. Most of you, being Americans, claim the pursuit of happiness among your inalienable rights, as set forth by our Founding Fathers. This concept was not introduced by them, however, as early philosophers like Aristotle, Plato, Socrates, Locke, Aquinas, and Mill opined that happiness is the most fundamental of all human searches.<br><br>In Tolstoy's book<i>War and Peace,</i>the Russian writer had his character Pierre Bezúkhov learn "that man is created for happiness, that happiness is within him, in the satisfaction of simple human needs, and that all unhappiness arises not from privation but from superfluity" (Leo Tolstoy,<i>War and Peace,</i>trans. Louise and Aylmer Maude [New York: Simon and Schuster, 1942], 1176; see also Constance Garnett translation, book 14, chapter 12). So often we find ourselves striving for the superfluity. We are not content with what we have and think that happiness comes from having more or acquiring more or being more. We look for happiness but go in the wrong direction to find it.<br><br>The story is told of Ali Hafed, a wealthy ancient Persian who owned much land and many productive fields, orchards, and gardens and had money out at interest. He had a lovely family and at first was contented because he was wealthy, and wealthy because he was contented.<br><br>An old priest came to Ali Hafed and told him that if he had a diamond the size of his thumb, he could purchase a dozen farms like his. Ali Hafed said, "Will you tell me where I can find diamonds?"<br><br>The priest told him, "If you will find a river that runs over white sands, between high mountains, in those white sands you will always find diamonds."<br><br>"Well," said Ali Hafed, "I will go."<br><br>So he sold his farm, collected his money that was at interest, and left his family in charge of a neighbor, and away he went in search of diamonds, traveling through many lands in Asia and Europe. After years of searching his money was all spent, and he passed away in rags and wretchedness.<br><br>Meanwhile, the man who purchased Ali Hafed's farm one day led his camel out into the garden to drink, and as the animal put his nose into the shallow waters, the farmer noticed a curious flash of light in the white sands of the stream. Reaching in, he pulled out a black stone containing a strange eye of light. Not long after, the same old priest came to visit Ali Hafed's successor and found that in the black stone was a diamond. As they rushed out into the garden and stirred up the white sands with their fingers, they came up with many more beautiful, valuable gems. According to the story, this marked the discovery of the diamond mines of Golconda, the most valuable diamond mines in the history of the ancient world.<br><br>Had Ali Hafed remained at home and dug in his own cellar, or anywhere in his own fields, rather than traveling in strange lands where he eventually faced starvation and ruin, he would have had "acres of diamonds." (Story paraphrased from Russell H. Conwell,<i>Acres of Diamonds</i>[Westwood, New Jersey: Fleming H. Revell Company, 1960], 10–14.)<br><br>We feel only pity for Ali Hafed as we picture him wandering homeless and friendless farther and farther away from the happiness he thought he would find in digging up diamonds in a far-off place. Yet how many times do we look for our happiness at a distance in space or time rather than right now, in our own homes, with our own families and friends?<br><br>The Savior of the world taught us to seek that inner peace which taps the innate happiness in our souls. He said, "My peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid" (John 14:27).<br><br>When we were living in São Paulo, Brazil, a new home was being constructed next to ours. The workmen on the project were paid only a few cents an hour and worked from six in the morning to six in the evening. Yet they whistled and sang all day long. Sometimes it was more than we wanted to hear! But I never had the heart to tell them to tone it down.<br><br>A few years ago I interviewed a relatively young man who was being called as mission president. He had had a very successful career as an investment counselor. Because he had a young family, I was concerned about how he would take care of them when he returned from the mission field. He made it very clear that he was not interested in making large sums of money. He explained that he had worked for the very wealthy. To him, they did not seem happy or fulfilled, and they seemed preoccupied with acquiring more.<br><br>That inner peace spoken of by the Savior seems elusive when we are preoccupied with things we have or things we wish we had. In a time when we are both obsessed and consumed with the possession and the acquisition of objects, the counsel of Moses seems more needed than ever: "Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's wife, nor his manservant, nor his maidservant, nor his ox, ... nor any thing that is thy neighbour's" (Exodus 20:17).<br><br>We are indebted to Dr. Homer Ellsworth for sharing with us many years ago two contrasting stories about the happiness of mothers. Often, in the days when the gender of the child could not be predetermined, expectant mothers were very set upon having a boy or a girl. Sometimes when the baby was not of the anticipated gender, the mother was temporarily disappointed. Of course this disappointment was forgotten as soon as the mother cuddled her newborn for the first time.<br><br>Dr. Ellsworth told us that a few new mothers demonstrated their immaturity for a day or two. One who wanted a boy baby and happened to receive a girl baby showed her displeasure by throwing tantrums and objects all over her hospital room for a day or two. One wise old nurse, when feeding time came, took a baby boy born with a small facial deformity from the nursery and quietly slipped him into the disconsolate mother's arms. The immature mother exclaimed, "This is not my child!"<br><br>The wise old nurse said, "Well, it is the right sex. Maybe its mother would be willing to trade babies with you." There followed no more demonstrations of immaturity.<br><br>In contrast, some years ago a special child was born to a young mother. This child was born without eyes. It was normal in all other respects except there was nothing to resemble eyes or sockets above the nose. This wise mother might in bitterness have said, "Why did this have to happen to my child?" or "Why did this have to happen to me?" Instead she said, "The Lord must really love us and have confidence in us. We really must be favored to have been given this child. To think the Lord picked our home, knowing how much special love and care this child would need, is very humbling and comforting. We are grateful for this special child and for the blessings it will bring to our home."<br><br>In the story<i>The Little Prince,</i>the fox was wiser than he knew when he said, "Now here is my secret, a very simple secret: It is only with the heart that one can see rightly; what is essential is invisible to the eye" (Antoine de Saint-Exupéry,<i>The Little Prince,</i>trans. Katherine Woods [New York: Harcourt, Brace and World, 1943], 70). The odyssey to happiness lies in the dimension of the heart. Such a journey is made on stepping-stones of selflessness, wisdom, contentment, and faith. The enemies of progress and fulfillment are such things as self-doubt, a poor self-image, self-pity, bitterness, and despair. By substituting simple faith and humility for these enemies, we can move rapidly in our search for happiness.<br><br>Happiness has a price, as President Kimball said in<i>The Miracle of Forgiveness:</i><br><br><i>"What is the price of happiness?" One might be surprised at the simplicity of the answer. The treasure house of happiness is unlocked to those who live the gospel of Jesus Christ in its purity and simplicity. Like a mariner without stars, like a traveler without a compass, is the person who moves along through life without a plan. The assurance of supreme happiness, the certainty of a successful life here and of exaltation and eternal life hereafter, come to those who plan to live their lives in complete harmony with the gospel of Jesus Christ--and then consistently follow the course they have set.</i>[Spencer W. Kimball,<i>The Miracle of Forgiveness</i>(Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1969), 259]<br><br>Selfish pride and happiness don't go together. Nephi told us that we must "come down in the depths of humility. ... The things of the wise and the prudent shall be hid ... forever--yea, that happiness which is prepared for the saints" (2 Nephi 9:42–43). The Lord, speaking through King Benjamin, reminded us:<br><br><i>I would desire that ye should consider on the blessed and happy state of those that keep the commandments of God. For behold, they are blessed in all things, both temporal and spiritual; and if they hold out faithful to the end they are received into heaven, that thereby they may dwell with God in a state of never-ending happiness.</i>[Mosiah 2:41]<br><br>Many speak these days about the rights of consumers to enjoy products that are "free, perfect, and now"--that is, at low cost, with no defects, and immediate service. The problem is that too many of us try to<i>consume</i>happiness rather than<i>generate</i>it. Shakespeare expressed a philosophy in<i>As You Like It</i>that seems commendable: "I am a true labourer: I earn that I eat, get that I wear; owe no man hate, envy no man's happiness; glad of other men's good" (<i>As You Like It</i>, 3.2.65–67). Earning what we eat will make us self-sufficient, but giving back a little by helping our neighbor or our fellow students will bring us something more. For example, if you deliver to an atomic energy breeder reactor the energy of three truckloads of fuel, it will return the energy of four or maybe five truckloads of fuel. Happiness, like the breeder reactor, adds and multiplies as we divide it with others.<br><br>I realize that many of you students are not wealthy. One poor man said, "I know that money isn't everything. For example, it isn't mine." And another observed, "Even books on how to be happy without money cost more than I can afford." (Both quotes from Sam Levenson,<i>You Don't Have to Be in</i>Who's Who<i>to Know What's What</i>[New York: Simon and Schuster, 1979], 185.) However, the relationship of money to happiness is at best questionable. An unknown author said, "Money is an article that may be used as a universal passport to everywhere except heaven, and as a universal provider of everything except happiness." Henrik Ibsen reminded us, "Money may buy the husk of many things, but not the kernel. It brings food, but not the appetite; medicine, but not health; acquaintances, but not friends; servants, but not faithfulness; days of joy, but not peace or happiness."<br><br>An unknown poet has written:<br><br><i>Success is speaking words of praise,</i><br><i>In cheering other people's ways,</i><br><i>In doing just the best you can<br>With every task and every plan.</i><br><br><i>It's silence when your speech would hurt,</i><br><i>Politeness when your neighbor's curt.</i><br><i>It's deafness when the scandal flows<br>And sympathy with others' woes.</i><br><br><i>It's loyalty when duty calls.</i><br><i>It's courage when disaster falls.</i><br><i>It's patience when the hours are long.<br>It's found in laughter and in song.</i><br><br><i>It's in the silent time of prayer,</i><br><i>In happiness and in despair.</i><br><i>In all of life and nothing less,<br>We find the thing we call success.</i><br><br>In summation, our search for happiness largely depends on the degree of righteousness we attain, the degree of selflessness we acquire, the amount and quality of service we render, and the inner peace that we enjoy. We also have some external sources of happiness, including those loved ones and friends whose smiles and regard mean so much to us--in my case, the members of my family who are here today. Our destinies are bound by ties of common interest and sympathy to a host of others, unknown to us personally, within and without the Church.<br><br>Some of you here today may have detoured from the road to peace and happiness through transgression. With all my heart I urge you to begin the process of clearing up any problem so that you may again enjoy a quiet and a peaceful conscience. When we truly repent of our sins, the Lord has promised, "I, the Lord, remember them no more" (D&amp;amp;C 58:42).<br><br>May I suggest a further requisite in the continuing quest to live happily every hour, every day, every month, and every year of our lives. The golden pathway to happiness is the selfless giving of love--the kind of love that has concern and interest and some measure of charity for every living soul. Love is the direct route to the happiness that would enrich and bless our lives and the lives of others. It means that you show love even to your enemies, "bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you" (Matthew 5:44). In so doing you will be fulfilling the greater commandment to love God Himself and to enjoy His love. You will soar above the ill winds that blow, above the sordid, the self-defeating, and the bitter.

<h1>mith and the Problem of Evil - David L. Paulsen - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Nothing challenges the rationality of our belief in God or tests our trust in Him more severely than human suffering and wickedness. Both are pervasive in our common experience. If this is not immediately evident, a glance at the morning paper or the evening news will make it so. On the larger scale and at the moment, names like Oklahoma City, Columbine, Kosovo, and Turkey evoke image upon image of unspeakable human cruelty or grief. But Auschwitz and Belsen still haunt our memories. Closer to home, who can fathom the anguish of family members in West Valley when they discovered their precious little girls suffocated together in the trunk of an automobile, the tragic outcome of an innocent game of hide-and-seek. Or the trauma of a dear friend of mine and his five young children who day by day for several months watched their lovely wife and mother wither down to an emaciated skeleton of 85 pounds as she endured a slow and painful death from inoperable cancer of the throat. Scenes like these are repeated daily a thousand and a thousand times.<br><br>But we need not speak only of the sufferings of others. Few of us here will escape deep anguish, for it is apparently no respecter of persons and comes in many guises, arising out of our experiences of incurable or debilitating diseases, mental illness, broken homes, child and spouse abuse, rape, wayward loved ones, tragic accidents, untimely death--the list goes on and on. No doubt many of us have already cried out, "Why God? Why?" And many of us, often on behalf of a loved one, have already pleaded, "Please, God, please help," and then wondered as, seemingly, the only response we've heard has been a deafening silence. All of us have struggled, or likely will struggle, in a very personal way with the problem of evil.<sup>1</sup><br><br>I say<i>the</i>problem of evil, but actually there are many. Today I want to consider with you just three, which I will call (1) the logical problem of evil; (2) the soteriological problem of evil; and (3) the practical problem of evil. The logical problem is the apparent contradiction between the world's evils and an all-loving, all-powerful Creator. The soteriological problem is the apparent contradiction between certain Christian concepts of salvation and an all-loving Heavenly Father. The practical problem is the challenge of living trustingly and faithfully in the face of what personally seems to be overwhelming evil.<br><h2><b>I. The Logical Problem of Evil</b></h2><br>Soaked as it is with human suffering and moral evil, how is it<i>possible</i>that our world is the work of an almighty, perfectly loving Creator? So stated, the logical problem of evil poses a puzzle of deep complexity. But the conundrum evoked by our reflection on this question appears to be more than just a paradox: we seem to stare contradiction right in the face. The ancient philosopher Epicurus framed the contradiction in the form of a logical dilemma: Either God is unwilling to prevent evil or He is unable. If He is unwilling, then He cannot be perfectly good; if He is unable, then He cannot be all powerful. Whence then evil? And 18th-century sceptic David Hume expressed the contradiction in much the same way:<br><br><i>Why is there any misery at all in the world? Not by chance, surely. From some cause then. Is it from the intention of the Deity? But he is perfectly benevolent. Is it contrary to his intention? But he is almighty. Nothing can shake the solidity of this reasoning, so short, so clear, so decisive.</i><sup>2</sup><br><br>Hume's succinct statement has since provided the framework within which the logical problem of evil has been discussed. However, I believe Hume's way of formulating the problem is far too narrow, unjust to both challenger and defender of belief in God--especially to the Christian defender. I do not believe that for the challenger intent on disproving God's existence the problem has been stated in its starkest terms. For in addition to affirming that (i) God is perfectly good and (ii) all powerful, traditional Christian theologians commonly affirm two additional propositions that intensify the problem: (iii) God created all things absolutely--that is, out of nothing; and (iv) God has absolute foreknowledge of all the outcomes of His creative choices. Although apologists for belief in God have labored long to reconcile the world's evil with God's goodness and power, they have often overlooked the much more difficult task of reconciling evil not only with His goodness and power but with God's absolute creation and absolute foreknowledge as well. Twentieth-century English philosopher Antony Flew takes these additional premises into account in arguing that any such reconciliation is impossible. It is perfectly proper in the face of apparently pointless evil, he says, to look first for some<i>saving</i>explanation that will show that, in spite of appearances, there really is a God who loves us. But Flew claims that believers have assigned God attributes that block a saving explanation altogether:<br><br><i>We cannot say that</i>[God]<i>would like to help but cannot: God is omnipotent. We cannot say that he would help if he only knew: God is omniscient. We cannot say that he is not responsible for the wickedness of others: God creates those others. Indeed an omnipotent, omniscient God must be an accessory before (and during) the fact to every human misdeed; as well as being responsible for every non-moral defect in the universe.</i><sup>3</sup><br><br>To state Flew's argument differently: If God creates all things (including finite agents) absolutely (that is, out of nothing), knowing beforehand all the actual future consequences of His creative choices, then He is an accessory before the fact and ultimately responsible for every moral and nonmoral defect in the universe. And if, as some believers allege, some human agents will suffer endlessly in hell, God is also at least jointly responsible for these horrendous outcomes. But if so, how can He possibly be perfectly loving? Given the traditional understanding of God, whatever our consistency-saving strategies, in the end, I believe, we must candidly confess that they are not very convincing.<br><br>On the other hand, this exclusive focus on reconciling evil with<i>just</i>a set of divine attributes is unfair to the Christian defender. For it fails to acknowledge the incarnation of God the Son in the person of Jesus of Nazareth and His triumph over suffering, sin, and death through his atonement and resurrection. Any Christian account of the problem of evil that fails to consider this--Christ's mission to overcome the evil we experience--will be but a pale abstraction of what it could and should be.<br><br>I propose, then, to consider the problem of evil from this broader perspective, confronting it in terms of its starkest statement but also in terms of its strongest possible solution: a worldview centered in the saving acts of Jesus Christ.<br><br>The Prophet Joseph Smith received revealed insights that<i>do</i>address the problem of evil in its broadest terms. His revelations suggest what might be called a soul-making theodicy, centered within a distinctively Christian soteriology (or doctrine of salvation), but both framed within a theology that rejects both absolute creation and, consequently, the philosophical definition of divine omnipotence which affirms that there are no (or no nonlogical) limits to what God can do. The Prophet's worldview, I believe, dissolves the logical and soteriological problems of evil while infusing with meaning and hope our personal struggles with suffering, sin, and death. To show (albeit briefly) that this is so is my purpose this morning.<br><br>Theodicy (literally, God's justice) is the attempt to reconcile God's goodness with the evil that occurs in the world. In coming to appreciate the power of Joseph Smith's revealed insights for such reconciliation, it will be instructive to compare and contrast them with the theodicy developed by contemporary philosopher John Hick in his fine book<i>Evil and the God of Love,</i>widely recognized as the watershed work on the problem of evil.<br><br>In<i>Evil and the God of Love,</i>Hick constructs a soul-making theodicy that retains the doctrine of absolute creation. The soul-making component in Hick's theodicy is highly reminiscent of Joseph Smith's revelation. Both affirm that God's fundamental purposes in creating us and our world environment include first, enabling us, as morally and spiritually immature agents created in the image of God, to develop into God's likeness; and second, enabling us to enter into an authentic (that is, a free and uncompelled) relationship of love and fellowship with Him. To achieve these ends, Hick says, God endowed us with the power of self-determination (or, as he calls it, incompatibilist freedom) and, to preserve that freedom, epistemically distanced us from Himself. God effects that distancing, Hick suggests, by having us emerge as largely self-centered creatures out of a naturalistic evolutionary process; or, as Joseph Smith maintains, by God's "veiling" our memory of our premortal existence. God also endowed us, Hick says, with a rudimentary awareness of Him and some tendency toward moral self-transcendence. The Prophet identifies this awareness and predisposition as the light of Christ, or the Spirit, which "enlighteneth every man through the world" (D&amp;amp;C 84:46). Soul-making (that is, development into the moral and spiritual likeness of God) occurs as we overcome our self-centeredness by making moral choices within an environment fraught with hardship, pain, and suffering.<br><br>To this point, the understandings of Hick and Joseph Smith seem strikingly similar.<br><h3><b><i>Absolute Creation: Hick and Joseph Smith</i></b></h3><br>With respect to creation, however, Hick and the Prophet maintain decidedly different positions. Hick affirms absolute creation (or creation out of nothing), whereas Joseph Smith denies it. And this difference brings us to a major point of my address. With his affirmation of absolute creation, Hick affirms all four theological postulates--perfect goodness, absolute power, absolute foreknowledge, and absolute creation--which confront him head-on with Flew's divine complicity argument. And Hick sees as clearly as Flew, and explicitly acknowledges, the logical consequence of his position: God<i>is</i>ultimately responsible for<i>all</i>the evil that occurs in the world. Hick explains why this is so.<br><br><i>One whose action, A, is the primary and necessary precondition for a certain occurrence, O, all other direct conditions for O being contingent upon A, may be said to be responsible for O, if he performs A in awareness of its relation to O and if he is also aware that, given A, the subordinate conditions will be fulfilled. . . .</i>[God's]<i>decision to create the existing universe was the primary and necessary precondition for the occurrence of evil, all other conditions being contingent upon this, and He took His decision in awareness of all that would flow from it.</i><sup>4</sup><br><br>But given Hick's admission that God is ultimately responsible for all the evil that occurs in the world, how can he possibly claim that God is perfectly loving?<br><h3><b><i>Hick's Way Out</i></b></h3><br>Hick sees one, and<i>only</i>one, way out. His avenue of escape is through an appeal to a doctrine of universal salvation. In Hick's view, all of us will finally achieve an authentic relationship with God in a postmortal life, the value of which will far outweigh any finite evil suffered here. He explains:<br><br><i>We must thus affirm in faith that there will in the final accounting be no personal life that is unperfected and no suffering that has not eventually become a phase in the fulfilment of God's good purpose. Only so, I suggest, is it possible to believe both in the perfect goodness of God and in His unlimited capacity to perform His will. For if there are finally wasted lives and finally unredeemed sufferings, either God is not perfect in love or He is not sovereign in rule over His creation.</i><sup>5</sup><br><br>Though I find Hick's way out appealing, its scriptural warrant is questionable, and it engenders conceptual difficulties of its own. Let us consider briefly just two.<br><br>1. Though in Hick's view God endows us with a strong power of self-determination, it does not follow from his view that our choices occur in a vacuum. They are always choices of particular persons with particular natures. Recall that Hick describes our primordial nature as being largely self-centered with a rudimentary awareness of God and some slight tendency toward morality. Since in Hick's account God creates out of nothing these primal natures (or, alternatively, the world process that invariably produces these natures), I see no reason, given Hick's assumptions, why God could not have made us significantly better than we are. Why not, for example, give us some significant reduction in our sometimes seemingly overwhelming tendencies to self-centeredness or some significant increase in our natural aversion to violence? Such creative choices on God's part might have narrowed somewhat the options over which our own choices might range, but would apparently negate neither incompatibilist freedom nor soul-making objectives. Seemingly, Hick's absolute creator could have made a much better world than ours.<br><br>2. On the other hand, it is hard to see how it can be certain (as Hick claims) that God, without compromising anyone's freedom, will<i>inevitably</i>lure every finite agent into a loving relationship with himself. Given that in Hick's view we must have incompatibilist freedom in order to enter into an authentic personal relationship with God, how can it be certain that there won't be, as C. S. Lewis suggested, "rebels to the end" with "the doors of hell . . . locked on the<i>inside"?</i><sup>6</sup>How can this possibility be precluded? Hick suggests that although it is not theoretically, it is practically precluded because<br><br><i>God has formed the free human person with a nature that can find its perfect fulfilment and happiness only in active enjoyment of the infinite goodness of the Creator. He is not, then, trying to force or entice His creatures against the grain of their nature, but to render them free to follow their own deepest desire,</i>which can lead them only to Himself.<i>For He has made them for Himself, and their hearts are restless until they find their rest in Him.</i><sup>7</sup><br><br>But now Hick is waffling, for it appears that we are not free after all. If so, Hick's position is inconsistent. To account for moral evil, Hick posits God's giving us incompatibilist freedom and genuine independence to choose for ourselves--even contrary to His desires for us. But given his affirmation of absolute creation and absolute foreknowledge, Hick sees that God's perfect goodness is possible only if not one soul is lost. To salvage God's goodness, Hick is forced to accept some mode of determinism that undermines his free-will defense. Hick's way out, as appealing as it first appears, seems on analysis to be incoherent.<br><h3><b><i>Joseph Smith's Way Out</i></b></h3><br>Joseph Smith's way out of the conceptual incoherency generated by the traditional theological premises is to not go in. His revelations circumvent the theoretical problem of evil by denying the trouble-making postulate of absolute creation--and, consequently, the classical definition of divine omnipotence. Contrary to classical Christian thought, Joseph explicitly affirmed that there are entities and structures which are co-eternal with God himself. On my reading of Joseph's discourse, these eternal entities include chaotic matter, intelligences (or what I will call primal persons), and lawlike structures or principles. According to Joseph Smith, God's creative activity consists of bringing order out of disorder, of organizing a cosmos out of chaos--not in the production of something out of nothing. Two statements from Joseph's King Follett sermon should give some sense of how radically his understanding of creation departs from the classical Christian notion. With respect to the Creation, Joseph wrote:<br><br><i>You ask the learned doctors why they say the world was made out of nothing; and they will answer, "Doesn't the Bible say He</i>created<i>the world?" And they infer, from the word create, that it must have been made out of nothing. Now, the word create came from the</i>[Hebrew]<i>word</i>baurau<i>which does not mean to create out of nothing; it means . . . to organize the world out of chaos--chaotic matter. . . . Element had an existence from the time</i>[God]<i>had. The pure principles of element are principles which can never be destroyed; they may be organized and reorganized, but not destroyed. They had no beginning, and can have no end.</i><sup>8</sup><br><br>More particularly, with respect to the creation of man, Joseph added:<br><br><i>The mind of man--the immortal spirit. Where did it come from? All learned men and doctors of divinity say that God created it in the beginning; but it is not so. . . . I am going to tell of things more noble.</i><br><br><i>We say that God himself is a self-existent being. . . .</i>[But]<i>who told you that man did not exist in like manner upon the same principles? Man does exist upon the same principles. God made a tabernacle and put a spirit into it, and it became a living soul. . . . How does it read in the Hebrew? It does not say in the Hebrew that God created the spirit of man. It says, "God made man out of the earth and put into him Adam's spirit, and so became a living body."</i><br><br><i>The mind or the intelligence which man possesses is co-equal</i>[co-eternal]<i>with God himself."</i><sup>9</sup><br><br>Elsewhere Joseph taught that there are also "laws of eternal and self-existent principles"<sup>10</sup>--normative structures of some kind, I take it, that constitute things as they (eternally) are. What are possible instances of such laws or principles? Lehi, I believe, made reference to some such principles in the enlightening (and comforting) explanation of evil he provided to his son Jacob as recorded in 2 Nephi 2 of the Book of Mormon. (I call that explanation Lehi's theodicy.) "Adam fell that men might be," Lehi told Jacob, "and men are, that they might have joy" (2 Nephi 2:25). But to attain this joy, Lehi explained that<br><br><i>it must needs be, that there is an opposition in all things. If not so . . . , righteousness could not be brought to pass, neither wickedness, neither holiness nor misery, neither good nor bad. . . .</i><br><br><i>And</i>[so]<i>to bring about his eternal purposes in the end of man, after he had created our first parents . . . , it must needs be that there was an opposition; even the forbidden fruit in opposition to the tree of life; the one being sweet and the other bitter.</i><br><br><i>Wherefore, the Lord God gave unto man that he should act for himself. Wherefore, man could not act for himself save it should be that he was enticed by the one or the other.</i>[2 Nephi 2:11, 15–16]<br><br>According to Lehi, there are apparently states of affair that even God, though omnipotent, cannot bring about. Man is that he might have joy, but even God cannot bring about joy without moral righteousness, moral righteousness without moral freedom, or moral freedom without an opposition in all things. With moral freedom as an essential variable in the divine equation for man, two consequences stand out saliently: (i) the inevitability of moral evil; and (ii) our need for a Redeemer.<br><br>If my interpretation of 2 Nephi 2 is correct, then it seems as if we ought to reject the classical definition of omnipotence in favor of an understanding that fits better with the inspired text. Given that text, how ought we understand divine omnipotence? B. H. Roberts plausibly proposed that God's omnipotence be understood as the power to bring about any state of affairs consistent with the natures of eternal existences.<sup>11</sup>So understood, we can coherently adopt an "instrumentalist" view of evil wherein pain, suffering, and opposition become means of moral and spiritual development. God is omnipotent, but He cannot prevent evil without preventing greater goods or ends--the value of which more than offsets the dis-value of the evil: soul-making, joy, eternal (or godlike) life.<br><br>Armed with Joseph Smith's doctrine of entities co-eternal with God and our revised definition of divine omnipotence, let us consider again the logical problem of evil and Flew's argument charging God with complicity in all the world's evil. From Joseph Smith's theological platform, it does not follow that God is the total or even the ultimate explanation of all else. Thus it is not an implication of Joseph's worldview that God is an accessory before the fact to all the world's evil. Nor does it follow that God is responsible for every moral and nonmoral defect that occurs in the world. Within a framework of eternal entities and structures that God did not create and that He cannot destroy, it seems to me that the logical problem of evil is dissolved. Evil is not logically inconsistent with the existence of God. Within the Prophet's worldview there can be saving explanations of the world's evil--explanations that in no way impugn God's loving-kindness. To see what such explanations might be like, we need to fill out the picture considerably. And to do so it will be useful to move from argument and analysis to narrative. Time does not allow me to do it, but I invite each of you, in reflecting on these matters, to rehearse again the old familiar and yet ever new and renewing story of the plan of salvation. To do so is to articulate a Mormon theodicy.<br><h2><b>II. A Soteriological Problem of Evil</b></h2><br>Earlier, when I first introduced the logical problem of evil, I argued that most discussions of the problem were too narrow and especially unfair to the Christian believer in that they failed to take into account the problem's strongest possible solution--the incarnation of God the Son in the person of Jesus of Nazareth and his triumph over sin, suffering, and death through His atonement and resurrection. But ironically, what I referred to as "the strongest possible solution" to the problem of evil when understood in traditional terms becomes, itself, part of the problem. How can this be?<br><br>This--the soteriological problem--arises out of the New Testament teaching that salvation comes through and<i>only</i>through Christ. For instance, John reports Jesus as having claimed this very thing: "I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me" (John 14:6). Similarly, Peter: "Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved" (Acts 4:12).<br><br>Thomas Morris, professor of philosophy at Notre Dame, in his book<i>The Logic of God Incarnate,</i>puts the difficulty (which he calls a "scandal") this way:<br><br><i>The scandal . . . arises with a simple set of questions asked of the Christian theologian who claims that it is only through the life and death of God incarnated in Jesus Christ that all can be saved and reconciled to God: How can the many humans who lived and died before the time of Christ be saved through him? They surely cannot be held accountable for responding appropriately to something of which they could have no knowledge. Furthermore, what about all the people who have lived since the time of Christ in cultures with different religious traditions, untouched by the Christian gospel? How can they be excluded fairly from a salvation not ever really available to them? How could a just God set up a particular condition of salvation, the highest end of human life possible, which was and is inaccessible to most people? Is not the love of God better understood as universal, rather than as limited to a mediation through the one particular individual, Jesus of Nazareth? Is it not a moral as well as a religious scandal to claim otherwise?</i><sup>12</sup><br><br>Claremont professor of philosophy Stephen Davis expresses a similar perplexity. In a recent issue of<i>Modern Theology</i>he put the problem this way:<br><br><i>Suppose there was a woman named Oohku who lived from 370–320 B.C. in the interior of Borneo. Obviously, she never heard of Jesus Christ or the Judeo-Christian God; she was never baptized, nor did she ever make any institutional or psychological commitment to Christ or to the Christian church. She</i>couldn't<i>have done these things; she was simply born in the wrong place and at the wrong time. Is it right for God to condemn this woman to eternal hell just because she was never able to come to God through Christ? Of course not. . . . God is just and loving.</i><sup>13</sup><br><br>This problem that Morris and Davis state can be expressed in terms of an inconsistent triad, a set of three premises--all of which are apparently true, yet the conjunction of any two of which seemingly entails the denial of the third:<br><br>1. God is perfectly loving and just and desires that all of His children be saved.<br><br>2. Salvation comes only in and through one's acceptance of Christ.<br><br>3. Millions of God's children have lived and died without ever hearing of Christ or having a chance to receive salvation through Him.<br><br>Number 3 is indisputable, forcing us, it seems, to give up either 1 or 2--both of which seem clearly warranted on biblical authority. So how to resolve the puzzle? The issue is receiving much attention right now from keen and sensitive Christian thinkers. Proposed resolutions are many, ranging from "universalism" on one pole to "exclusivism" on the other. Universalists typically affirm premise 1, compelling them to deny the explicit New Testament teaching that salvation comes only in and through acceptance of Christ. Exclusivists usually affirm number 2, concluding that Oohku, and millions of others like her, must be lost. But this leaves<i>them</i>at a loss to square their view with number 1. Neither view is satisfactory.<br><br>Many of you in the audience are, no doubt, smiling, recognizing that adding a premise 4 to the triad resolves the puzzle:<br><br>4. Those who live and die without having a chance to respond positively to the gospel of Jesus Christ will have that chance postmortemly.<br><br>Thank God for Joseph Smith! And not merely for resolving one more thorny problem of evil--which he surely did (or, God did, through him)--but for being the instrument through whom God restored the knowledge and priesthood powers that make the redemption of the dead possible. Elder John Taylor wrote truly when he penned these words: "Joseph Smith, the Prophet and Seer of the Lord, has done more, save Jesus only, for the salvation of men in this world, than any other man that ever lived in it" (D&amp;amp;C 135:3).<br><h2><b>III. The Practical Problem of Evil</b></h2><br>I want to finish by considering the Prophet Joseph Smith's contribution to the practical problem of evil--the challenge of living trustingly and faithfully in the face of what personally seems to be overwhelming evil. Joseph left us much by way of revelation that speaks to<i>this</i>problem of evil, but perhaps his own life speaks more powerfully than the words.<br><br>Joseph was no stranger to sorrow. He spoke, though inspired by God, from the crucible of his own experience. In D&amp;amp;C 127:2, the Prophet reflected: "The envy and wrath of man have been my common lot all the days of my life. . . . Deep water is what I am wont to swim in." Indeed, Joseph faced continual persecution. He was tarred and feathered, subjected to numerous lawsuits, and confined in intolerable conditions in dungeon-like jails. He was deeply affected by the deaths of his brothers Alvin and Don Carlos, and his father also died prematurely. Four of his 11 children, including twin sons, died at childbirth, and a fifth died at 14 months. Joseph was never financially well-to-do and was often impoverished. For much of his life he had no regular place to call home. After the failure of the bank in Kirtland, many of his friends turned against him. Members of the Church published the<i>Nauvoo Expositor</i>for the purposes of denouncing him, and this event eventually culminated in his martyrdom. Even Joseph, who walked so closely with God, on occasion in his life experienced the troubling sense of God's absence when he felt God should have been there for him.<br><br>A case in point: the dark days of 1838 when the Saints were driven from Missouri. The setting was as follows: A vast number of Mormon families had been burned out of their homes by mobs. Fathers were tied to trees and bullwhipped. Thirty-four people, including men and children, had been massacred at a settlement known as Haun's Mill. Shortly thereafter, the Mormon settlement at Far West, Missouri, was besieged and sacked by the state militia. Soldiers raped some of the women so many times that they died from the torture. Joseph Smith had been betrayed by a friend and turned over to military mobsters to be killed. He was taken to a small dungeon called Liberty Jail. During the four months of imprisonment, Joseph and his companions were abused, fed human flesh, and left in filthy conditions.<br><br>Joseph Smith felt abandoned by God. In a prayer Joseph questioned from the depths of his soul:<br><br><i>O God, where art thou? And where is the pavilion that covereth thy hiding place?</i><br><br><i>How long shall thy hand be stayed, and thine eye, yea thy pure eye, behold from the eternal heavens the wrongs of thy people?</i>[D&amp;amp;C 121:1–2]<br><br>In response to this prayer of the soul's desperation, Joseph heard God:<br><br><i>My son, peace be unto thy soul; thine adversity and thine afflictions shall be but a small moment;</i><br><br><i>And then, if thou endure it well, God shall exalt thee on high. . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . Know thou, my son, that all these things shall give thee experience, and shall be for thy good.</i><br><br><i>The Son of Man hath descended below them all. Art thou greater than he?</i>[D&amp;amp;C 121:7–8; 122:7–8]<br><br>Confronted with what seemed to be overwhelming evil, Joseph found meaning in his suffering, maintained hope, trusted God, and kept the faith. And God spoke peace.<br><h2><b>Conclusion</b></h2><br>As I have perused the philosophical literature on the problem of evil, noted men's perplexities, and then returned to once more ponder the revelations and teachings of Joseph Smith, I have been constantly amazed. Joseph had no training in theology, no doctor of divinity degree; his formal education was at best scanty. And yet through him comes light that dissolves the profoundest paradoxes and strengthens and edifies me through my own personal trials. The world calls him "an enigma," but I know that the inspiration of the Almighty gave him understanding. I bear witness that he was a prophet of God. In the sacred name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>David L. Paulsen was a BYU professor of philosophy when this forum address was given on 21 September 1999.</i><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>1. At the outset, I must acknowledge my debt to others for much that appears in this address. My thinking on the subject was first stimulated by reading many years ago Truman Madsen's<i>Eternal Man--</i>a classic that ought to be reprinted. My thinking has been further shaped by conversations and collaborative work with Blake Ostler. Indeed, some of my text today is taken from that work. Finally, my thinking has been refined by numerous in-class and out-of-class discussions with hundreds of students over the past 27 years. To these students and to Truman and Blake, I express gratitude.<br><br>2. David Hume,<i>Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion,</i>ed. Nelson Pike (Indianapolis: Bobbs-Merrill, 1970), 91.<br><br>3.

During the summer of 1988, our family had an experience I would like to share with you. On July 5 of that year, we were in southern Utah visiting my parents in the small town where I grew up. Not far from there, in one of Utah's national parks, there is a waterfall where I had been swimming many times as a young boy. On this day I decided to take my family to the waterfall swimming, something we had done twice before during the previous month. We arrived at the waterfall about 1:15 p.m. and immediately noticed that the river was much higher than it had been previously because of recent heavy mountain rains. The waterfall was much wilder than normal and the water was extremely dirty. We commented that maybe we shouldn't swim because it looked too rough, but our sons begged us to let them swim with their two cousins who had never been swimming at a waterfall or cliff jumping before. We finally decided to let them swim. My wife, our two youngest children, my mother-in-law, and I sat on the bank and watched as they swam and jumped into the falls.<br><br>For approximately half an hour our four older sons--Scott, Conan, Tyler, and Chad--jumped off the cliffs into the base of the falls, and each time the force of the currents would push them out into the main stream of the river. We were almost ready to leave when the boys decided to jump one last time. They lined up at the top of the ledge with our nine-year-old son Chad jumping first. We all watched as Chad jumped into the water. We watched him go down under the water and then surface. But something was wrong. As his head came up we saw that he was being pulled backward toward the falls instead of being pushed out into the river. While being pulled back, he was sucked under the water by the undercurrents.<br><br>As my wife, LeAnn, and I screamed, our oldest son Scott jumped into the pool, trying to grab Chad. He couldn't reach Chad and, in fact, was nearly pulled into the undercurrents himself. I quickly jumped into the water with my clothes on trying to find him. The current was so strong that I couldn't even get close to the falls. In despair I tried several times to climb the cliff on the side of the waterfall so that I could jump in from the top of the falls and try to get Chad. Each time I tried to climb, I would slide down the wet sandstone back into the water. LeAnn also jumped into the water, but because of the strong currents, she could not get close to the base of the falls either. As she tried to climb the edge of the wall, she turned her ankle and broke it. She finally fell down on the side of the river, clasped mud in her hands, closed her eyes, and cried aloud, "We've lost him! We've lost him! Our Chad is gone!"<br><br>Our third son, Tyler, who was only 11, started pacing up and down the river in despair. Conan, our second son, ran to the top of the cliff and jumped in again. He knew he might land on and hurt Chad, but he felt he had no choice. He hoped that by jumping in, he might push Chad to the surface or out into the river. Conan jumped and then surfaced, but still no Chad. Then he offered a silent prayer. After jumping in immediately after Chad, our oldest son Scott offered a silent prayer, broke off a tree limb, and started probing into the water at the base of the falls for Chad.<br><br>LeAnn's mother was panicking and looking around the edges but soon turned her attention to flagging down cars up above on the highway. She sent Tyler back up the trail to the highway. Tyler, watching his grandmother cry, offered a silent prayer and immediately ran to the highway, stood in the middle of the road, and flagged down oncoming cars. We all knew that Chad would soon drown. He was under the water being tossed to and fro in the undercurrents. The water was extremely cold and vicious, and there were all kinds of holes in the ledges that he could get caught in. For approximately five minutes we searched for Chad. It was the most traumatizing five minutes of our lives. Still no Chad.<br><br>We had all but given up hope when I turned around on the cliff above the falls, spread out my hands in despair, and said to my weeping wife, "What can I do?" As I said these words, I spotted Chad floating facedown downstream. He had gone under the water past all of us. We were all looking in the waterfall, and he was downstream ready to go around a bend in the river. I yelled, "There he is!"<br><br>Our two oldest sons reached him first. As they lifted him from the water, he was very heavy because he was full of dirty river water. They laid him on the bank just as LeAnn and I arrived. At least now we had hope because we knew where he was. As I looked at my son, his lips were purple, he was not breathing, and he had no pulse. I immediately started mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. Conan yelled, "Give him a blessing, Dad! Make him come back." Between breaths I offered a quick priesthood blessing.<br><br>We recalled the CPR training that we had just been through. At the time I was our ward Scoutmaster and our oldest sons were Eagle Scouts. Everyone remembered something we had learned: keep his neck up, have his arms extended, clear his throat, close his nose, and force air down his throat. We watched carefully for a pulse or for breathing. For more than a minute we got nothing. Finally we got a thready, beady pulse and some breathing. Just small breaths, but he was breathing. Soon there was coughing and a feeble, broken, light voice saying, "Help me. Help me. Get me to the bank." We all thought he had brain damage because of his broken, high-pitched voice. It didn't even sound like Chad. None of us will ever forget how he looked as we pulled him from the water. His entire body was limp like spaghetti. His fingers, his ears, his nose, his mouth, and his lips were all purple. His eyes were open but rolled back into his head. His mouth seemed to be locked open. Indeed, he looked and acted dead.<br><br>As soon as I gave him the priesthood blessing and commanded him to recover, we rolled him on his side. He then threw up a lot of dirty river water. About then Tyler came running down from the highway with three people. Two of them were a German couple who spoke no English but had a blanket with which we covered Chad. The other was a young woman, 25 years old, who worked as a nurse in a hospital emergency room in Scottsdale, Arizona. She had a black bag full of medical instruments. She first took Chad's pulse, which she said was fading in and out. She treated him for shock and for the numerous cuts and abrasions on his head where he had been thrown against the rocks. For about 35 minutes she kept him alive until the park rangers came with another nurse, oxygen, and more medical supplies.<br><br>The ambulance arrived in about 45 minutes. They rushed Chad to a small medical clinic in a nearby town. A doctor who was visiting the clinic examined him, said he couldn't treat him there, and sent him on to the Richfield hospital. My wife, LeAnn, was in the same ambulance because of her broken foot. In Richfield they took X rays and saw that Chad's lungs were filled with silt, sand, and water. They told us he would probably get pneumonia and have swelling of the brain and other complications. My brother joined with me to give him a priesthood blessing with oil. They then sent us on our way to Provo.<br><br>When we arrived at the emergency room in Provo, the staff there immediately turned their attention to Chad. They took more X rays. When they put the X rays taken in Richfield and Provo side by side, they couldn't believe they were from the same patient. His lungs had cleared considerably, although one corner was still collapsed and still had water and silt in it. He continued to throw up river water and bile for about 13 hours. He spent another two days in the hospital and several more days recovering at home. Today he is fine and currently has one more month of his mission to serve in Chile.<br><br>Chad later told us that when he first went under the water, he was sucked into a whirlpool and was repeatedly banged against cliff walls. He said he would push off the walls with his feet only to find himself in another whirlpool. He said this happened at least three times. The last thing he remembered was saying a prayer. He said he was in the middle of a whirlpool almost standing still. He said that because of the force of the water, he could not fold his arms completely. He offered a simple prayer that said, "Heavenly Father, I'm thankful for this day. I need your help. Please help me, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen." Then he remembered no more.<br><br>As I look back on that experience, I realize there were many things that made Chad's recovery possible. First there were the many miracles given to us by Heavenly Father. One of the first things Chad said when he regained consciousness was, "Who grabbed my hand and pulled me out of the whirlpools?" He was insistent that he had seen someone grab his hand. It was none of us. There is no rational explanation of how he came out of the strong undercurrents and whirlpools. Another miracle was the nurse from Arizona who, together with her husband, had passed the waterfall and gone on about a mile and then decided to come back and take pictures because "it was so beautiful." Another miracle was the unbelievable clearing of his lungs. Another was his miraculous recovery after being in the water for more than five minutes.<br><br>There were many more miracles that I won't take time to mention today. In addition to the miracles, though, there were other factors that contributed to Chad's recovery. We were so thankful for the first-aid training we had received and knew from Scouting. Without first-response knowledge, Chad would not be alive today. We were also grateful for the ability to pronounce priesthood blessings and call upon powers from heaven. We aren't sure why Chad was brought back to us. Everyone told us he should have died.<br><br>Just as there were certain preparations we and others had made that brought Chad back to us--first aid and nurse training, power of the priesthood, faith, help from Heavenly Father, and quick response by others--there are preparations you can make that will help you weather the storms and waterfalls that lie ahead in your life. Today I would like to talk about some of the steps you can take to prepare for the whirlpools that will try to suck you in as you face the future.<br><br>When you graduate you will enter a world that is changing faster than ever before. It is a topsy-turvy world with declining morals, declining job security, increased social problems, fast-paced business changes, and increased global competition. It is also a world with more opportunities than ever before. Let me give you three indicators of how fast the world is changing:<br><br>1. First is the number of patents issued by the U.S. government. The first patent under the current patent numbering system was issued in July 1836. Since that time, the number of patents issued has increased every year but one, with last year having the largest increase and being the highest at almost 600,000 patents (see www.uspto.gov/web/offices/ac/ido/oeip/taf/issuyear.htm). Products and services covered by these patents will change the way we work and live in the future. In fact, it is amazing to think that the capacity of the world's most powerful and biggest computer 40 years ago is now contained in a little computer that fits in your pocket. And if experts' predictions are right, in only a few more years the power of today's biggest and most powerful computers will also be contained in a small pocket-size computer.<br><br>2. A second indicator of change is increased worker mobility and decreased job security. Job security has now decreased to where, in 1998, the median job tenure for workers 25 years and older was 4.7 years. In future years your typical job will average five years or less, and you will constantly be on the lookout for your "next" job. (See www.bls.census.gov/cps/pub/tenure_0296.htm.) The promise or thought of lifetime employment is a myth that few of you will experience. Americans are being "downsized," "right-sized," and cut from their jobs in record numbers. For example, even though the period from 1993 to 1997 were years of high corporate profits and a robust economy, more than two and a half million workers were laid off by companies in the U.S.<br><br>3. Third, the way we work and do business in the U.S. is changing. We have moved away from a manufacturing-based society to a service- and information-based society. Information and ideas are now more valuable than tangible goods. In the old economy, land, labor, and capital were important. In the new economy, information has infinite value. Bits are now more valuable than atoms. Even a car can be viewed as a computer chip with wheels. As an example of the power of information, if you look at the list of<i>Forbes</i>magazine's most recent 400 richest Americans, three of the top 14 are associated with companies that didn't even exist five years ago, including price-line.com, amazon.com, and e-bay.com. And, if you add executives from Microsoft, Dell Computers, and Oracle Corporation, only three of the 11 richest Americans are not from technology companies (see www.forbes.com/tool/toolbox/billnew/net98.asp?condition=25,99). As an example of the value of information, consider one of the most successful Internet companies: "Yahoo! Inc. collects some 400 billion bytes of information every day--the equivalent of a library crammed with 800,000 books" (Heather Green, "The Information Gold Mine,"<i>Business Week,</i>26 July 1999, EB 18).<br><br>Frank Ogden said, "As this bulldozer of change rolls over our planet we have a choice: to become part of the bulldozer or part of the road" (<i>Last Book You'll Ever Read</i>[Toronto: Macfarlane, Walter and Ross, 1994], chapter 1; or www.drtomorrow.com/lastbook/tlbchap1.html). That you students will enter a world of fast-paced change upon graduation is certain.<br><br>In my few minutes today I would like to consider with you how you can be successful and happy in this world of change. After all, you won't be at BYU forever, even though it may seem like it right now. If you continue to view the world from the perspective of an earlier, vanishing age, you will be unable to realize your full potential. As Norbert Wiener said, "We have modified our environment so radically that we must modify ourselves in order to exist in this new environment" (www.brint.com/papers/change/index.htm).<br><br>Specifically, I would like to discuss with you four strategies that I believe can bring you happiness and success in this uncertain and changing world that you face. What you will quickly realize as I proceed is that these strategies are very consistent with gospel teachings. In fact, I am more amazed each day that as the world changes faster and faster, activities and solutions that will make you successful and happy are more and more consistent with the gospel of Jesus Christ.<br><h2><b>Success Strategy 1: Having a Sense of Value and Purpose Beyond Your Work</b></h2><br>Speaking about her book<i>Disconnected: How Six People from AT&amp;amp;T Discovered the New Meaning of Work in a Downsized Corporate America,</i>author Barbara Rudolph stated that it will be much more difficult in the future "to find a sense of purpose and autonomy in work" (www.abcnews.go.com/sections/business/DailyNews/chat_transcript_980806_rudolph/index.html). She believes that workers will become more emotionally detached from their work and that because of this detachment there will be more social instability in America. She argues that workers who define who they are by their jobs will find that they will have less meaning in their lives in the future than they have had in the past. They will be more lonely and more unhappy. Fortunately, with our knowledge of the gospel it is easy to have a purpose beyond our jobs. We know that we are much more than workers. We know that we are children of God and can become just like Him. We know that the family unit is the only enduring organization in the eternities and that building a strong family is far more important than anything we will ever do at work.<br><br>I remember talking with a student of mine at Stanford a number of years ago. I asked him what he was going to do when he graduated from the Stanford MBA program. He said that he was going home to take over the family business--the Almond Roca Company. Sure enough, today Mark Haley is the president and CEO of that company. I thought at the time how lucky this young man was. In essence, a profitable company was being handed to him by his father. Today I have a bigger vision and know that we are even more blessed than he was. For, as it says in D&amp;amp;C 84:38, "And he that receiveth my Father receiveth my Father's kingdom; therefore all that my Father hath shall be given unto him." We have been given the same promise by our Heavenly Father that my student, Mark Haley, was given by his father. So my first suggested success strategy is to never forget what is really important in your life.<br><br>I look back on my life, and, although I have had a wonderful career and hope to have more productive years, what has given me the most joy has been coaching my son's baseball games, attending my daughter's clogging competitions, fishing, being in the mountains, and just being with my family. The pitfall you will all have to be very careful of is that the things that matter most in your life often don't have deadlines or timetables like your job and other commitments will. There are generally no scheduled meetings that say you must spend time with your spouse or do things with your children at a certain time or by a certain date. You will have to be proactive to make your family and the gospel priorities in your life.<br><br>One of my favorite stories comes from a book entitled<i>Love at Home--Starring Father</i>by George D. Durrant. In that book he tells of his time as a mission president in the eastern states. When he arrived in the mission field, one of his first orders of business was to throw a big rope over a high limb on the huge ash tree that towered over the mission home's front yard. A few months later he attended a mission presidents' seminar. Each president, asked what he felt was his best idea so far, reported on some program he felt had enhanced the missionary work. When President Durrant's turn came, he said, "The best thing I've done so far is to build a swing." He described the swing and explained that his major goal was to be a good father and how that swing had become his symbol of this setting of priorities. (From<i>Love at Home--Starring Father</i>[Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1978], 18–20.) You will never be happy in the future unless you anchor your life on things of eternal worth. And you will find your greatest happiness comes from being with your family, from performing service for others, and from living and serving in the gospel.<br><h2><b>Success Strategy 2: Keeping Yourself Nimble and Maximizing Your Options</b></h2><br>We know that one of the reasons Heavenly Father sent us to this earth was to see if we could make good choices. A prerequisite to making good choices is having freedom. In fact, it is the ability to make choices that gives us freedom. I believe that a very important success and happiness strategy in this fast-changing world is to do everything possible to maximize your options and choices and, hence, freedom. Although we live in a free country and have few, if any, externally imposed constraints, many of us lose or limit our freedom by actions we take and by choices we make. When the future is uncertain, as it is today, it pays to have a broad range of options open. Option theory rewards flexibility.<br><br>Let me give you a simple and, I hope, obvious example. Let's say you are going to walk from this Marriott Center to McDonald's on 1230 North. You would like to walk at a steady pace but get there as soon as possible. You would probably start by walking from here to the entrance of BYU, where the sign reads, "Enter to Learn; Go Forth to Serve." From there, to reach McDonald's you merely need to walk west on Bulldog Boulevard or 1230 North and cross the street to the south. As long as you stay on the north side of 1230 North, when you come to an intersection you can choose to walk either west or south and still make progress toward your goal of reaching McDonald's. You will have two options, so you won't have to wait for a stoplight. However, as soon as you cross to the south side of the street and walk by Wendy's, Teriyaki Stix, or Provo High School, you have lost one of your options--you can now only make progress toward your destination by going west. If you reach an intersection when the east-west light is red, you have no choice but to wait until the light turns green, allowing you to continue walking west. It is the same with life. In a rapidly changing world you want to keep as many options open as you can and keep yourself nimble so you can move quickly and take advantage of these options. As long as you keep your options open, you have more choices and freedom and will be more successful and happy in the future. There are several things you can do to maximize your options and keep yourself nimble and ready to act. I will mention five.<br><br>1. Do everything you can to build a good reputation. People with tarnished reputations lose options in life. Sometimes this loss of options occurs at work and sometimes it happens at home. Let me give you a couple of examples. In the play<i>All My Sons,</i>written by Arthur Miller, there is a place where a son sees that his father cheated in the business world. Up until then his dad had been his hero. When he confronts his dad, his father says that everybody does it, and you have to cheat to be successful. The son replies, "I know you're no worse than most men but I thought you were better" (act 3). This father had just lost options with his son.<br><br>In another example, I am aware of a woman who worked for a corporation for 37 years. We believe she was honest for the first 34. During the last three years she started embezzling. Eventually she stole $686,000. After she was caught, the company took her home, her cars, her retirement account, and most of her other assets. Through seizing all these assets, the company recovered about $400,000. She lost her reputation for honesty and the respect of her friends and was sentenced to serve one year in a federal prison. She is now out of prison but must make monthly restitution payments of $333 per month to the company. If she misses one payment she violates her parole and goes back to jail.<br><br>In other words, she must spend the rest of her life either working or in jail. She has lost options. And, to make matters worse, the IRS came after her and told her that she had $686,000 of income she didn't report on her tax return. When she finished negotiating with the IRS, they called the $400,000 she repaid the company a loan but assessed taxes on the $286,000 she will never repay (at $333 per month, she's not even paying the interest). With fines, penalties, and interest, she owes the IRS more than $200,000 and has entered in an agreement to make tax payments to the IRS of $540 every month. She is a now a convicted felon who works in a fast-food restaurant at fairly close to minimum wage. She is 70 years old and has no home nor other assets. This lady has lost not only her reputation but the freedom to live where she wants, work where she wants, buy what she wants, travel where she wants, and even marry who she wants, because her husband divorced her. You will have many more options in the future if you build a good reputation, a good name. As it says in Ecclesiastes 7:1, "A good name is better than precious ointment."<br><br>2. A second option and freedom-maximizing strategy is to get as much education, as much learning as possible. You must become a lifelong learner if you are going to succeed in the future. With the fast-paced changes we are experiencing, the content knowledge you learn at BYU probably won't be relevant very long. You must get as much education and learning as you can throughout your life. Consider the following quote by Brigham Young:<br><br><i>We might ask, when shall we cease to learn? I will give you my opinion about it; never, never. ...</i><br><br><i>We shall never cease to learn, unless we apostatize from the religion of Jesus Christ.</i>[<i>JD</i>3:203]<br><br>Personally, I am a certified public accountant, or CPA. When I graduated from BYU and sat for the CPA examination in 1971, there were only 15 professional standards that I had to learn to prepare for the exam. Today most of these standards have been superseded and aren't relevant anymore. In addition, we now have almost that many new standards being issued every year. The accounting profession, like all other professions, has had to change and become more dynamic to keep up with fast-paced changes in business and in the world. If I had to rely on what I learned at BYU to practice as a CPA today, I would be sued for malpractice. Indeed, the purpose of college is not to learn facts but to learn how to learn.<br><br>3. The third option-maximizing strategy is to maintain good health. When you lose your health or you become addicted to harmful substances or habits, you lose freedom. Personally, I am not quite as fit as I would like to be. I exercise regularly but have trouble watching what I eat. As a result, I have lost some options that others have. I remember one day riding motorcycles with my boys on Boulder Mountain in southern Utah. We were riding up a very rough and steep trail. Because they were all young and physically fit, all four of my older boys cruised right to the top on their motorcycles. I tried to follow them and tipped over. I tried again and tipped over a second time. After the third attempt and crash, I laid the bike down, hiked to the top, and told my sons to go back down and bring my bike up for me. Because I wasn't as physically fit as they were, I had lost an option. Section 89 contains a promise about these health options if we live according to the Word of Wisdom:<br><br><i>And all saints who remember to keep and do these sayings</i>[meaning maintaining good health and following the Word of Wisdom],<i>walking in obedience to the commandments, shall receive health in their navel and marrow to their bones.</i><br><br><i>And shall find wisdom and great treasures of knowledge, even hidden treasures;</i><br><br><i>And shall run and not be weary, and shall walk and not faint.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 89:18–20]<br><br>4. A fourth way to maximize your options and be nimble is to preserve your financial freedom. We now live in a world where everyone borrows--in fact, in the U.S., for every net saver, there are approximately 19 net borrowers. After your graduation, almost every day in the mail you will get solicitations from finance and other companies wanting to extend credit to you. They will use glowing terms and phrases about giving you financial freedom, but what they really want is for you to enter into financial bondage to them. Because I knew a few months ago that I would be giving this talk today, I have saved most of the debt solicitations I have received in the mail during that period. Here they are. There are 61 letters inviting and enticing me to go into debt.<br><br>When you take upon yourself debt, you lose freedom and options and the ability to act quickly and independently because someone else tells you how to spend your money. If you are encumbered with too much debt, you may not be able to change jobs, move, make an investment you should, or even serve when called upon by the Church. Debt is probably okay for your education, buying a home, buying a first car for work, or making investments in such things as real estate. But debt is not okay for most other things. So if you want to be happy and successful in the future, work hard to maintain your financial freedom. There is something very comforting--even spiritual--about living well within your means. Many scriptures warn us that debt takes away our freedom. Consider Proverbs 22:7, for example: "The rich ruleth over the poor, and the borrower is servant to the lender."<br><br>5. A final option-maximizing strategy I want to mention is staying free from guilt or maintaining a clear conscience. It is impossible to feel guilty and be happy. I remember a number of years ago when one of our children was shooting his bow and arrows in the backyard. As parents, we had told him several times not to get his bow and arrows out unless we were in the mountains, especially when we were not at home. On this day he had some friends with him, and they started messing around. He got his fancy new bow out to show "the guys." He thought he was focusing on the target, but instead he shot an arrow over our fence, across the road, and right through our neighbor's garage door. This happened early in the day. He lived with the guilt until about 10:00 that night when he could stand it no longer. Finally he came into our bedroom crying and admitting what he had done. I immediately got out of bed and got dressed. Hand in hand we went to the neighbor's home, and my son told him what he had done. We offered to pay for a new garage door, which we did. Although our son still felt badly about doing something he was told not to do, he was a lot happier facing the consequences of his actions because he didn't have to harbor that guilt any longer. He knew that until he told his parents and the neighbor, inside himself he was a liar with a guilty conscience. I personally don't believe you can ever reach your potential, have freedom or peace of mind, or be happy if you are harboring guilt. The scriptures make it clear that we cannot live in sin and be happy.<br><br>Considered together, these five activities of (1) building a good reputation, (2) engaging in continuous learning and education, (3) maintaining good physical health, (4) maintaining financial freedom, and (5) staying guilt free will bring you choices and opportunities in the future that others won't have and will allow you to act quicker than others to seize upon opportunities that will come your way in this fast-paced world.<br><h2><b>Success Strategy 3: Adding Value Every Day</b></h2><br>In the business world today, the time focus is shorter than ever before. Whereas organizations used to focus on annual performance--on how much profit they earned in a given year--they now focus more on quarterly and even monthly or daily performance. As the time focus becomes shorter and shorter, managers tend to make short-term decisions that make them appear to be more profitable. With this short-term focus, employees start to be treated more like assets that can be bought and discarded than as individuals who must be invested in and nurtured. When the officers of an organization know they will be evaluated on quarterly or monthly earnings and that laying people off will probably make them appear more profitable, they tend to care less about people as individuals. To be successful in this environment you must find a way to add value to your work every day. It is no longer "what you did for me yesterday" that counts; rather, it is "what you have done for me today." The day you stop adding value to your employer that is at least as great as the amount they are paying you, your job is at risk.<br><br>There are many ways you can add value. You can develop some expertise or skill that others don't have, you can work harder than others, you can have a better personality and disposition than others, you can work with customers better than others, or you can learn and adapt to change faster than others. You will add value best if you work at something you truly enjoy--something that you love to do. I can honestly say that I have looked forward to coming to BYU to work every day for the past 22 years. I love teaching, researching, and working with bright young students and colleagues.<br><h2><b>Success Strategy 4: Avoiding Self-Defeating Behaviors</b></h2><br>So far I have discussed three proactive success strategies: maintaining a sense of purpose and value beyond your work, maximizing options and keeping yourself nimble, and finding a way to add value every day. Regardless of how well you accomplish these, however, there are a few personal characteristics and actions that, if pursued, will limit your future success and happiness. I call these "inhibitors of success" or "self-defeating behaviors." Although there are probably others besides those I'll mention here, these five are particularly relevant to job success and happiness. I have watched each of them destroy the careers and lives of otherwise wonderful and talented individuals. These inhibitors, each of which I'll only spend a minute on, are:<br><br>1. Self-pity<br><br>2. Lack of humility<br><br>3. Not being able to set and maintain priorities<br><br>4. Selfishness<br><br>5. Suffering from what I call the "intent" syndrome<br><br>No matter how talented and blessed they are, some people seem not to be able to avoid falling into the self-pity trap. We have all seen it before. In this trap people feel sorry for themselves. They start to feel that everyone has a better life than they do and that they have been dealt an unfair deck by Heavenly Father and society. They believe everyone has a happier family than they have, a better job than they have, are more attractive and more healthy than they are, and have more money than they have. Although self-pity always hurts a person, it is particularly problematic in the business world. Self-pity is a tool of the devil. It is one of his primary ways to induce discouragement, which can lead to hopelessness and unproductivity. And unproductivity is deadly when you need to be adding value every day.<br><br>Fortunately there is a quick remedy to this problem. If you ever start feeling sorry for yourself, the best solution is to reach out and serve others. When you think about and serve others, you forget about your problems and soon realize that everybody else's life is not better than yours. I know of a man who, although he suffers from a severe wound he received in Vietnam and could feel sorry for himself, spends every Sunday afternoon rocking crack-cocaine babies in a hospital. It gives him a perspective that his problems really aren't that terrible and gives him a sense of fulfillment.<br><br>A simple exercise I would recommend for all of us is to write on a piece of toilet paper all the ways in which we feel sorry for ourselves and the reasons why we can't be successful and happy. Then we need to go to the bathroom and flush that paper down the toilet and move on. We limit ourselves much more by what we think we can't do than by what we really can't do.<br><br>A second self-defeating behavior and, frankly, one I worry most about in you students is a lack of humility. You students are so sharp--you're smart, you're talented, and you're young. You are even good looking. You have everything going for you. It would be easy for you to forget to be humble. And, in fact, I've had a few friends tell me that they've met BYU students who thought they were better than others because it is so tough to be admitted to BYU and they made it whereas others didn't. I hope that isn't the case. The very moment you cease to be humble, you start on a road that makes you less valuable to others, less willing to listen and learn from others, and less fun to be around. And, as we said before, if you aren't continuously learning, you will limit your future options.<br><br>A third self-defeating behavior is the inability to be organized and set priorities. We all know what is important. For example, you know when you have tests and other deadlines. Yet many of us tend to be procrastinators--to wait until the last minute. One of the greatest predictors of success in the workplace and even in the family is the ability to set priorities and follow through with them. When you fail to establish priorities, you let yourself be driven by others--as if you were a floating log being tossed to and fro by the currents of a river. Being organized and being able to set priorities will become even more important in the future as you have to juggle voice mail, e-mail, pager mail, fax mail, land mail, and all other types of correspondence and communication at work and in your personal life.<br><br>Selfishness is the fourth of my five self-defeating behaviors. When you are selfish, you think more of yourself and your needs than of others. I know a man who, because of his selfishness, has lost his family, his job (several times), and his friends. He is a lonely man because he doesn't know how to think about anyone besides himself. No matter how talented or educated you are, if you can't be a team player and let others receive credit, you will not be successful in the future. Indeed, selfishness is a surefire way to failure in the business world.<br><br>The final inhibitor of success or self-defeating behavior that I want to mention is what I call the "intent" syndrome. It is a fact that we all judge ourselves by our intentions and judge other people by their actions. And, for most of us, our intentions are much better than our actions. I don't know about you, but I intend to get up earlier, work harder, eat less, exercise more, and be a better father and husband. I personally think this is one reason why there are so many divorces in the world--husbands judge themselves by their intentions and judge their wives by their actions, and wives do the same thing. Both think they are better than they are and that their spouses are worse than they are.<br><br>None of us is as good as we think we are, and yet we are probably not as bad as other people think we are. When we judge ourselves by our intentions, we tend to rationalize our shortcomings and give ourselves more credit than we deserve. We also tend to judge our colleagues and others more harshly than we should and ourselves too leniently. We also tend to do less at work and at home than we think we are doing.<br><br>One of my research specialities is fraud. When you talk to someone who has committed fraud and been caught, they usually say something like "I intended to pay that money back. I really did." We look at them and say, "You dirty, rotten crook. You stole money." You see, we judge these people by their actions; they judge themselves by their intentions. If you want to be successful, try not to let the gap between your intentions and your actions become too large. And don't judge others too harshly or give yourself credit for more than you are really doing.<br><h2><b>Conclusion</b></h2><br>In conclusion, some current business writers believe that it will be harder to be successful and happy in the future. I disagree. With the right kind of preparation and the Lord's help, just as we were able to bring Chad back to life, you will be able to succeed in the future. With your knowledge of who you are and what is important in life and by maximizing options, adding value each day, and avoiding these inhibitors of success, the changing world you face presents great opportunities, not threats, for you. With your background, training, knowledge, beliefs, and standards, you are much better poised to take advantage of future opportunities than are most others. Let me congratulate you for your values, for your commitment to the gospel, for your righteous living, and for your hard work. You have all the ingredients to be highly successful and happy. You will be great and, if you remember the things we have talked about, you will be successful and happy. Be grateful for what you have.<br><br>The other day I had a student in my office who said, "Professor Albrecht, I have five job offers and don't know which one to accept." He was discouraged about the decision he had to make and didn't know what to do. I told him to get on his knees and thank Heavenly Father for the five job offers and for being so blessed. I told him that there are many people who don't even have one job offer. We should all be thankful for what we have.<br><br>I want you to know that I love this university and love being a faculty member here. It was while I was a student at BYU that I developed my testimony of the gospel. It was at BYU that I decided to serve a mission, even though no one in my family had served. It was at BYU that I met and married my sweetheart and wife. It was at BYU that I learned the value of an education and set priorities for my future life. Indeed, much of what I am and much of the way I define myself, I owe to my BYU experience. I hope and pray that you have the same kind of experience at BYU that I did.<br><br>I love the gospel. I know it is true. I know that as the world changes faster and faster, you will find solutions for happiness and success in the gospel and in the lessons you will learn at BYU. I wish you all success in the future. I say this in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>W.

<br>
I am honored to be here today, brothers and sisters, to give this devotional address. Brother Fred Skousen contacted me in the middle of June and asked me if I would be a devotional speaker. I told him I would be honored to do so, and we talked about topics. I said that I had a real concern about what is happening to marriage in America and that I would like to come and talk about that and why we all need to become involved--not only concerning families, which we talk a lot about nationwide, but why we have to have renewed interest in marriage as well.<br><br>There is nationwide concern about the next generation regarding marriage. I identify particularly the people from the ages 16 to 26 because some of the best thinkers in this nation have said, "As goes the next generation, so goes the nation." What you do regarding marriage and family will determine a lot about the future of this country. We are at a crossroad in the United States. The trends that have been established during the last four decades regarding marriage and family have contributed to the demise of marriage and family, but there are some indications that, nationwide, your generation is changing and is putting marriage and family as a top priority. So we are very interested to see which way you are going to go.<br><br>I believe that your generation is very critical for the Church, not only regarding your own marriages now or in the future, but because you will be training the next generation of young people. Go to the junior highs and elementary schools and look at them, because you will be having them in classes in the next decade or so. It is interesting that just a month ago Prime Minister Blair of the United Kingdom mandated that elementary school children be taught about marriage. Other nations are concerned about marriage. You have a real challenge ahead of you. I would invite you today to become part of the marriage movement, to become not only concerned about your own marriage and family but also about how and what you are going to teach others.<br><br>LDS is an acronym for Latter-day Saints, but I would like it to become also known as "Let's Do Something." We need to become involved. I think the Lord expects His people to become involved in good causes, and certainly this is a good cause.<br><br>My wife, Susan, is sitting on the stand. We met here at BYU, and I could take the full 30 minutes to share our experiences here. We took an Old Testament class together. Neither of us got very high grades in that class. To this day we don't know much about Old Testament, but that's where we met, and I'm grateful for that. I get nervous when she comes with me to give speeches, particularly if I'm going to talk about our marriage, because I have to revise my notes when she's here. I often hear whisperings in the night that I should become a better husband. I've recently realized that part of those whisperings are coming from her. Today I commit to her and to you that I will try to be a better husband.<br><br>My remarks today can be summarized in a humorous experience I had at BYU not long ago. I love spontaneous humor, and it occurred in a classroom with a parable.<br><br>In my marriage preparation classes at BYU I often quote a scripture on the very first day of class. It is the parable of the tower in Luke 14:28–30. It reads:<br><br><i>For which of you, intending to build a tower, sitteth not down first, and counteth the cost, whether he have sufficient to finish it?</i><br><br><i>Lest haply, after he hath laid the foundation, and is not able to finish it, all that behold it begin to mock him,</i><br><br><i>Saying, This man began to build, and was not able to finish.</i><br><br>This scripture notes that we should not begin something without counting the cost or effort it will take to finish the project. It is a great analogy about contemporary marriage. Almost all Americans (88 percent--down from 94 percent in the early 1970s) still marry during some point in their lives. But many have not counted the cost or effort it takes to stay married--evident by our high divorce rate during the past four decades.<br><br>During the first day of one of my classes not long ago, I told the students there was an important scripture in Luke 14:28–30 about contemporary marriage. I asked one of the students to read the scripture, and a young coed volunteered. Others in the class awaited this important insight from the Bible on contemporary marriage. But the young student mistakenly opened her Bible to Luke chapter 13 (not 14), verse 28, and read the following: "There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth."<br><br>Although the coed made an error in reading the scripture--much to the amusement of the rest of her classmates--she did, perhaps, capture the essence of contemporary marriage in America. Will we count the costs and make the efforts to continue in marriage once we begin? Or will there be, as it says in Luke 13:28, "weeping and gnashing of teeth"? Perhaps we have had too much of the latter and not enough of the former with marriage in America today.<br><br>During the week of April 5 through 9 of this year, my community education class sponsored a Marriage Awareness Week at Brigham Young University. We set up a table near the west entrance of the Wilkinson Student Center and put out an assortment of books, videos, pamphlets, and tapes--all describing the importance of marriage in America. Many students and faculty members stopped by our booth during the week, and some were more enthusiastic than others about our endeavor.<br><br>While I was with my students at our Marriage Awareness Week booth, one young coed briefly stopped for a moment and then asked, somewhat in jest, "Do we really need something like this at BYU?" My students and I tried to convince her that, yes, indeed, we do need a Marriage Awareness Week, and particularly at BYU. I would like to tell you why I feel so during the few minutes I speak at this BYU devotional this morning and share with you my renewed testimony that, in light of recent trends, "marriage is," indeed, "ordained of God" (D&amp;amp;C 49:15).<br><br>To present my case that we do need Marriage Awareness Week not only at BYU but in all communities in America, I would like to briefly call your attention to six items: (1) A Quote 2,000 Years Old, (2) A Scripture About Marriage and the Last Days, (3)<i>Marriage in America: A Report to the Nation,</i>(4)<i>The State of Our Unions,</i>(5) A Government Declaration on Marriage, and (6) A BYU Class Project.<br><h2><b>1. A Quote 2,000 Years Old</b></h2><br>I have always believed that marriage is very important in life for several reasons. But exactly how important it is I did not realize until the past few years. In the fall of 1996 I read a quote by Roman statesman and orator Marcus Tullius Cicero (106–43 b.c.). It is now hanging on my wall in my office at BYU. He said, "The first bond of society is marriage" (<i>De Officiis,</i>I, 78 b.c.). Notice that he did not say that marriage is just one bond, or another bond among several others. Cicero said that marriage is the first bond, and therefore the most important bond on which societies are built! During the priesthood session of our recent general conference, President Hinckley noted the same thing. He said, "God-sanctioned marriage between a man and a woman has been the basis of civilization for thousands of years" ("Why We Do Some of the Things We Do,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 1999, 54).<br><br>For nearly 30 years I have taught on four major college campuses that marriage is important for a variety of reasons. But I didn't fully realize its significance until reading and pondering the Cicero quote in light of what has recently been happening to marriage in this country and abroad. I began to read and study more intently what others have said in the past and are now stating about the importance of marriage. I can now say, without hesitation, I believe Cicero was correct: Marriage is the first bond of society.<br><br>Many have vigorously claimed that the family is the foundation of society. "Family values" are becoming increasingly popular in our local, state, and even national political campaigns. Family values appear to be an integral part of the political campaigns for the year 2000. We frequently hear about the importance of the family from the pulpit, sometimes from the media, and occasionally from a few other sources. The concepts of family and, particularly, parenting are "in" at the present time. But who is advocating marriage?<br><br>Why is it that we can talk even now on a national basis about the importance of family and almost completely ignore what is becoming more and more evident: stable marriages promote stable parents; stable parents are better able to rear stable children; stable children have a better chance of becoming stable adults; and stable adults are more likely to have stable marriages, thus completing the cycle. As Elder Neal A. Maxwell has observed:<br><br><i>How can a nation nurture family values without consistently valuing and protecting the family in its public policies? How can we value the family without valuing parenting? And how can we value parenting if we do not value marriage? How can there be "love at home" without love in a marriage?</i>[Neal A. Maxwell, "Take Especial Care of Your Family,"<i>Ensign,</i>May 1994, 89]<br><h2><b>2. A Scripture About Marriage and the Last Days</b></h2><br>There are many scriptures, both ancient and modern, about the last days. Toward the end of His mortal ministry, Christ's disciples inquired of Him about the last days and His second coming. They asked, "Tell us, when shall these things be? and what shall be the sign of thy coming, and of the end of the world?" (Matthew 24:3).<br><br>Jesus answered and spoke of conditions that would exist prior to His second coming. Of particular interest regarding marriage and family relationships, Jesus stated:<br><br><i>And then shall many be offended, and shall betray one another, and shall hate one another. . . .</i><br><br><i>And because iniquity shall abound, the love of many shall wax cold.</i>[Matthew 24:10, 12]<br><br>We also read in 2 Timothy 3:1–4:<br><br><i>This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come.</i><br><br><i>For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,</i><br><br><i>Without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent</i>[uncontrolled in seeking sexual gratification],<i>fierce, despisers of those that are good,</i><br><br><i>Traitors, heady, highminded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God.</i>[Also see D&amp;amp;C 29:8–21, 45:16–33; Mormon 8:25–32; and Bruce R. McConkie, "The Coming Tests and Trials and Glory,"<i>Ensign,</i>May 1980, 71–73]<br><br>But there is one scripture that has been of particular interest to me, and increasingly so during the past few years. That scripture is 1 Timothy 4:1–3. It reads:<br><br><i>Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils;</i><br><br><i>Speaking lies in hypocrisy; having their conscience seared with a hot iron;</i><br><br><i>Forbidding to marry, and commanding to abstain from meats.</i><br><br>Pay particular attention to that last phrase about "forbidding to marry, and commanding to abstain from meats." It is very significant in light of a latter-day revelation in 1831 on marriage: section 49 of the Doctrine and Covenants. It was given to the Prophet Joseph Smith concerning the Shakers or the United Society of Believers in Christ's Second Appearing.<br><br>The Shaker movement began in England about 1706 as an offshoot of the Quakers. Ann Lee (1736–1784) was a member, and in 1770 she became the leader of the church. Mother Ann, as she was called, and some of her followers came to the United States in 1774, and the religious movement grew rapidly. Even though Ann Lee had married and given birth to four children, all of whom died in infancy, it soon became evident that she believed marriage and the sexual relationships associated with it were detrimental to spiritual growth. The loss of her children and her unhappy experiences with her marriage undermined both her mental and physical health and strongly conditioned her views towards sexual intimacy and the institution of marriage.<br><br>As the Shaker movement expanded in America, one community was eventually established near Cleveland, Ohio, where Leman Copley had apparently lived. Among other things, Shakers believed baptism was unnecessary; celibacy was preferable to marriage; eating meat was inappropriate; Christ had returned to the earth as a woman, Ann Lee; and the millennial reign had begun.<br><br>There were two levels or orders among the Shakers. Those in the second order continued to live as singles, or, if married, with spouses and children often outside the Shaker communities. Those in the highest order, however, remained single or renounced marital vows to a husband or wife and moved into separate dwellings in Shaker communities where the interaction between men and women was highly regulated. Children from the marriages were well cared for but also lived in separate buildings apart from their parents. (See Edward Deming Andrews,<i>The People Called Shakers</i>[New York: Oxford University Press, 1953]; Marguerite Fellows Melcher,<i>The Shaker Adventure</i>[Princeton, New Jersey: Princeton University Press, 1941]; and Charles Nordhoff,<i>The Communistic Societies of the United States</i>[1875; reprint, New York: Schocken Books, 1965].)<br><br>In May 1831, the Lord apparently had the scripture of 1 Timothy 4:1–3 in mind when He gave the Prophet Joseph Smith the interesting revelation on the importance of marriage. Leman Copley, a new convert to the Church, had previously been a Shaker. Apparently Latter-day Saints had discussed the Shaker beliefs, and the revelation was given to correct some of the erroneous views.<br><br>Shakers believed, among other things, that one became closer to God by remaining single or by abandoning marriage and living a celibate life. When the revelation on marriage was given to the Prophet Joseph Smith, however, the Lord declared just the opposite was true: "And again, verily I say unto you, that whoso forbiddeth to marry is not ordained of God, for marriage is ordained of God unto man," and marriage was instigated "before the world was made" (D&amp;amp;C 49:15, 17).<br><br>These sentiments were reiterated 164 years later, in 1995, when the First Presidency of the LDS Church and the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles gave a proclamation to the world on the family. It stated:<br><br><i>We . . . solemnly proclaim that marriage between a man and a woman is ordained of God and that the family is central to the Creator's plan for the eternal destiny of His children. . . .</i><br><br><i>The family is ordained of God. Marriage between man and woman is essential to His eternal plan.</i>["The Family: A Proclamation to the World,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 1995, 102]<br><br>Hence we have a latter-day revelation and a modern proclamation regarding an ancient prophecy: The demise of marriage in the last days.<br><h2><b>3.<i>Marriage in America: A Report to the Nation</i></b></h2><br>With scriptural and prophetic admonitions in mind, let me now cite two recent reports. The first came out almost simultaneously with the LDS proclamation on the family in 1995. It was published by the Council on Families in America and is titled<i>Marriage in America: A Report to the Nation.</i>Here are observations from the executive summary of that report:<br><br><i>The divorce revolution--the steady displacement of a marriage culture by a culture of divorce and unwed parenthood--has failed. It has created terrible hardships for children, incurred unsupportable social costs, and failed to deliver on its promise of greater adult happiness. The time has come to shift the focus of national attention from divorce to marriage and to rebuild a family culture based on enduring marital relationships.</i>[<i>Marriage in America: A Report to the Nation</i>(New York: Council on Families in America, Institute for American Values, 1995), 1]<br><br>The report continues:<br><br><i>The core message of this report is basic and blunt. To reverse the current deterioration of child and societal well-being in the United States, we must strengthen the institution of marriage. We realize that strengthening marriage cannot be our only goal. But we insist that it must become our most important goal. For unless we reverse the decline of marriage, no other achievements--no tax cut, no new government program, no new idea--will be powerful enough to reverse the trend of declining child well-being. . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . We call for the nation to commit itself to this overriding goal:</i>To increase the proportion of children who grow up with their two married parents and decrease the proportion of children who do not. . . .<br><br><i>. . . Who, today, is still promoting marriage? Who is even talking about it? In place of a national debate about what has happened to marriage there has been silence--stone-cold silence.</i>[<i>Marriage in America,</i>4–5; emphasis in original]<br><br>Notice the report asked in 1995, "Who, today, is still promoting marriage? Who is even talking about it?" Perhaps they had not yet seen the Church's proclamation on families. I ask, brothers and sisters, should we be doing something about this? Should this topic be in our discussions? Is there something we should be doing particularly at Brigham Young University?<br><h2><b>4.<i>The State of Our Unions</i></b></h2><br>The second report is from Rutgers University, titled<i>The State of Our Unions.</i>It is part of the National Marriage Project, noting and reporting current trends of marriage in America. It was released in July of this year, ironically just two weeks after I was asked to speak at this devotional on the topic of marriage. The 32-page report noted:<br><br><i>Key social indicators suggest a substantial weakening of the institution of marriage. Americans have become less likely to marry.</i>[This is reflected in a decline of more than 43 percent, from 1960 to 1996, in the annual number of marriages per 1,000 unmarried women.]<i>When they do marry their marriages are less happy. And married couples face a high likelihood of divorce. Over the past four decades, marriage has declined as the first living together experience for couples and as a status of parenthood. . . .</i><br><br><i>Cohabitation</i>[living together]<i>is emerging as a significant experience for young adults. It is now replacing marriage as the first living together union.</i>[<i>The State of Our Unions</i>(New Brunswick, New Jersey: The National Marriage Project, 1999), 3, 10]<br><br>I will pause reading from the report for a moment. I just read an article yesterday or the day before that said that it is estimated now that one-half of couples who marry in the United States live together prior to marriage. Rutgers University put out another report about cohabitation indicating that cohabitation in fact increases the likelihood of divorce and does not decrease it (see David Popenoe and Barbara Dafoe Whitehead,<i>Should We Live Together?: What Young Adults Need to Know About Cohabitation Before Marriage, A Comprehensive Review of Recent Research</i>[New Brunswick, New Jersey: The National Marriage Project, 1999]). So we have this national trend of people just living together. The divorce rate actually declined in 1998 for the first time. I think one of the reasons is that fewer people are marrying.<br><br>Now, continuing with<i>The State of Our Unions</i>report:<br><br><i>When men and women marry today, they are entering a union that looks very different from the one that their parents or grandparents entered. . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . Marriage is surrounded by longer periods of partnered or unpartnered singlehood over the course of a lifetime.</i>[p. 6]<br><br><i>The United States lags well behind England, Australia, and Canada in the level and seriousness of governmental response to the widespread evidence of the weakening of marriage.</i>[p. 7]<br><br><i>Over the past two decades, the percentage of people who say they are in "very happy" first marriages has declined substantially and continuously.</i>. . .<br><br><i>. . . The pervasive generational experience of divorce has made almost all young adults more cautious and even wary of marriage.</i>[p. 8]<br><br>Other interesting insights from the Rutgers report point out:<br><br><i>Premarital sex has become something of a misnomer. Sex is increasingly detached from the promise or expectation of marriage.</i>[p. 9]<br><br><i>Marriage has lost broad support within the community and even among some of the religious faithful.</i>[p. 12]<br><br><i>Because women are better educated and more likely to be employed outside of the home today than in the past, they are not as dependent on marriage as an economic partnership.</i>[p. 14]<br><br>And what about the future of marriage in America?<br><br><i>Persistent long-term trends suggest a steady weakening of marriage as a lasting union, a major stage in the adult life course, and as the primary institution governing childbearing and parenthood.</i>[p. 15]<br><br>With these well-documented trends noted in America, what can we expect from other countries in the world? I attended a conference of the American Association of Christian Counselors in Dallas, Texas, in 1997, and this same question was posed and discussed. The projection? As goes America, so go the rest of the countries--although at different rates of change. The exposure of other people of the world to the American culture through our media, movies, television programs, and printed materials apparently gives insights and even motivation for change, whether for good or for evil. Americans, it was suggested, cannot be oblivious to the impact we have on the families and cultures of people in other countries. And because we have the greatest knowledge base and resources for helping, we cannot ignore either the opportunity or responsibility to assist marriages and families in other countries in the world as well as in our own.<br><h2><b>5. A Government Declaration on Marriage</b></h2><br>Even though the U.S. government did pass the Defense of Marriage Act in September 1996, defining marriage as a relationship between a male and female,<i>The State of Our Unions</i>report noted that the United States is lagging behind other countries in trying to promote and stabilize marriage. The demise of marriage in America apparently has begun to concern contemporary policy makers at the highest level of government. On September 21, 1999, Bruce Reed, President Clinton's chief domestic policy advisor, was quoted as saying, "To the extent that the collapse of marriage is behind larger social problems, the government has to deal with it." The reporter, Will Dunham, noted that "the Clinton administration has embraced the idea that strong marriages and two-parent families are in the national interest." In reference to this statement, Dunham quoted Reed again:<br><br><i>"That was a controversial notion when political leaders in both parties stepped forward in the early '90s and started talking about it," he added.</i><br><br><i>"It's not so controversial now, but I think it's not a moral judgment, it's just simply an analytical fact that if you can increase the ratio of kids who grow up with two parents you're going to reduce a number of social problems associated with (children in single-parent homes)."</i>["Decline of Marriage Called a Threat to U.S.,"<i>Deseret News,</i>21 September 1999, A2]<br><br>But the federal government is paying a high price for the catch-up policy on the importance of marriage. Just a week earlier, on September 13, 1999, the Department of Health and Human Services announced that four states and the District of Columbia had been given an award of a combined $100 million for reducing the number of births to unwed mothers without increasing the number of abortions. It is anticipated that this welfare windfall will be an annual event. California, Michigan, Alabama, Massachusetts, and the District of Columbia were each awarded $20 million for their efforts to reduce the number of births to unwed mothers based on data from 1996 to 1997. Utah likely will have difficulty qualifying for the $20 million annual award because it was noted we currently have the lowest percent of births to unwed mothers in the nation. Nationally, about one in three babies is born to unwed parents. Out-of-wedlock birth rates range from 16.4 percent in Utah to 45 percent in Mississippi. In Washington, D.C., the rate is 65 percent. (See Laura Meckler, "4 States, D.C. Rewarded for Cutting Unwed Births,"<i>Deseret News,</i>16 September 1999, A16.)<br><br>Australia has taken the lead of the countries in the world in trying to promote and stabilize marriage. In June 1998 the Australian government published an extensive report titled<i>To Have and To Hold: Strategies to Strengthen Marriage and Relationships</i>(Canberra: Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia). Marital and family disruption in Australia is estimated to cost the government $3 billion in direct costs and another $3 billion in indirect costs--a total of 4.4 percent of their total annual budget (p. 51). Recently, $18 million a year was set aside to strengthen marriages in that country.<br><br>On September 7, 1999, the<i>London Daily Telegraph</i>had an article stating "Schoolchildren are to be taught the importance of marriage as part of Tony's Blair's new moral crusade." The article reported that Prime Minister Blair wants "to reduce the number of teenage pregnancies in Britain--the highest in Western Europe" and that "teachers will have to instruct pupils aged between seven and 16 about the value of traditional two-parent families and the responsibilities of bringing up children." Also, "boys as young as 13 will be warned that they will be pursued by the Child Support Agency if they father babies." (From George Jones, "Children to Be Taught About Marriage,"<i>London Daily Telegraph,</i>7 September 1999.)<br><br>We cannot ignore marriage trends in other countries because they have impact on Latter-day Saints living in those areas. For instance, on September 15, 1999, Peter Lodrup, a professor of law at the University of Oslo, Norway, visited and spoke on the BYU campus. Some of us had a chance to meet informally with Professor Lodrup that morning for about an hour. We discussed marriage trends both in the United States and in Norway. He informed us that the vast majority of firstborn children in families in Norway are born out of wedlock. Nearly all couples live together prior to marriage in Norway, and apparently this is the case in many other Scandinavian countries. When a child is conceived and born in Norway, nearly all of the couples then marry. Thus, cohabitation before marriage and parenthood, according to Professor Lodrup, is nearly universal in Norway. Could this be a future trend for the United States as well? The trends indicate we are heading in that direction.<br><br>As Latter-day Saints we should be interested in what is happening in other countries regarding marriage and family. We have a substantial number of Latter-day Saints now who live outside the United States, so we are our brother's keeper not only on a national or state basis but, perhaps, on a worldwide basis.<br><br>At the state level in the United States, government leaders are beginning to realize a need for marriage awareness. Louisiana and Arizona passed covenant marriage bills in 1998 giving the option, once again, for a marriage commitment of "until death do us part" rather than the contemporary commitment of "as long as our love shall last" in the other 48 states. In April of this year (1999), Governor Frank Keating of Oklahoma in his inaugural address also announced a goal to reduce the divorce rate by one-third by the year 2010. Oklahoma currently has the second-highest divorce rate in the nation.<br><br>In relation to this, you might be interested to know that this year Florida passed a law that all high school seniors will take a course that includes marriage education before graduating. That was very controversial.<br><br>Governor Leavitt and First Lady Jacalyn S. Leavitt of Utah have also taken the lead among governors in promoting marriage at the state level. For the past seven years they have held a series of marriage conferences each year throughout the state with the largest held in Salt Lake City. The last one was held on September 24, 1999, in the Salt Palace with more than 1,500 in attendance. The first lady of Utah also announced that evening a second marriage conference to be held in Salt Lake City in the early part of the year 2000.<br><br>The Leavitts were also the first to organize a commission on marriage in the nation on September 18, 1998. As a result, they were asked to be the keynote speakers on July 1, 1999, at the Smart Marriage Conference in Washington, D.C. They addressed the topic, among other things, of why governments need to be involved in promoting and stabilizing marriage. I really appreciated Governor Leavitt's comments when he said that it is not so much that we as governments want to promote marriage but that when marriage and family fail, governments have to pick up the pieces, often at great cost to the government and community. That is why we have to get involved whether we want to or not.<br><br>On September 29, 1999, Governor Leavitt signed a declaration of marriage and declared September 25 to October 2, 1999, as Marriage Awareness Week in Utah.<br><br>The signing of the declaration in September was at a significant occasion called Utah Celebrates Marriage. It was held in the state capitol building. A highlight of the gathering was the presence of 34 couples from Utah who had been married 70 years or more. It was a marvelous thing. One couple from American Fork, Elijah and Alta Chipman, have been married for 76 years. They were proud to be interviewed about what it takes to be married 76 years. I also want to mention Erlend Peterson from our BYU administration. His family had a display table dedicated to his great-grandparents: Peter and Celestia Peterson from Fairview, Utah. In 1958 they had been married 82 years. It was a world record at the time. The Peterson's got a letter from President Eisenhower congratulating them, and there was a write-up in the January 1959<i>Life</i>magazine about them.<br><br>The Young Ambassadors were there with their director Randy Boothe. They sang love songs from the '20s and '30s to these couples who have stayed together over the years. I was proud to be from BYU and hear those wonderful young people sing those songs.<br><br>Now let me read the declaration on marriage. I think it summarizes very well the sentiments of many government officials--both state and federal--about the importance and prominence of marriage:<br><br><i>Declaration</i><br><br><i>Whereas, marriage in every known human society creates new families, binds men and women together in a network of affection, mutual aid, and mutual obligation, commits fathers and mothers to their children and connects children to a wider network of welcoming kin; and</i><br><br><i>Whereas, a healthy, loving marriage deserves our special respect because it provides irreplaceable personal happiness and creates the safest place for children to flourish and to enjoy the full emotional, moral, educational and financial benefits of both parents; and</i><br><br><i>Whereas, research indicates that men and women who marry and stay married in mutually supportive relationships generally live longer, experience better health, and enjoy more satisfying lives; and</i><br><br><i>Whereas, marriage breakdown takes a toll on the emotional, physical and financial well-being of all family members and communities and also increases the cost to taxpayers of many public human service programs; and</i><br><br><i>Whereas, Utahns are committed to promoting enrichment opportunities and resources that strengthen marital relationships and enhance personal growth, mutual fulfillment and family well-being; and</i><br><br><i>Whereas, I wish to applaud and encourage efforts by Utah citizens, faith communities, businesses, organizations, and local government and community leaders to strengthen marriages in a variety of ways, including marriage education programs, conferences, enrichment seminars and public policies that support marriage;</i><br><br><i>Now, Therefore, I, Michael O. Leavitt, Governor of the state of Utah, do hereby declare September 25–October 2, 1999, as Marriage Awareness Week in Utah, and urge each husband and wife to reflect upon their marriage and to commit to building and maintaining a healthy, loving marriage and family.</i><br><br><i>Governor Michael O. Leavitt</i><br><h2><b>6. A BYU Class Project</b></h2><br>Finally, I would like to draw your attention to a class project we recently completed at BYU. During the 1970s in America the value of marriage, and particularly an enduring marriage, was questioned. Fewer people married. Numerous couples started living together without marriage. Sex both before and outside marriage became more acceptable. And among those who did marry, the divorce rates skyrocketed and rose to an unprecedented 50 percent. Disposable marriages, as predicted in 1970 by Alvin Toffler in his book<i>Future Shock,</i>became a product of the time (see "Temporary Marriage," "Marriage Trajectories," and "The Demands of Freedom" in<i>Future Shock</i>[New York: Bantam Books, 1970], pp. 253–59).<br><br>A decade later, in the 1980s, we stepped back in America and took another look at marriage as an enduring relationship, and the "marriage movement" began. In 1982, for example, Rafe Van Hoy wrote a song that should have particular significance for Latter-day Saints. It was titled "What's Forever For?" and asked the question "Doesn't anybody ever stay together anymore?" It was sung by Johnny Mathis in the 1980s and popularized again in the 1990s by singer Michael Martin Murphey. The lyrics are as follows:<br><br><i>I see love-hungry people</i><br><i>Trying their best to survive.</i><br><i>When right there in their hands is a dying romance,</i><br><i>And they're not even trying to keep it alive.</i><br><br><i>So what's the glory in living?</i><br><i>Doesn't anybody ever stay together anymore?</i><br><i>And if love never lasts forever</i><br><i>Tell me, what's forever for?</i><br><br>This song has particular significance for Latter-day Saints because many of us commit to marry for time and eternity (forever) in holy temples of the Lord.<br><br>In my preparation for marriage classes at BYU, we have one unit on commitment. We note the observation by Dr. James C. Dobson that marriage is a marathon and not a sprint (see<i>Love for a Lifetime: Building a Marriage That Will Go the Distance</i>[Portland, Oregon: Multnomah Press, 1987], 120). We talk about what we commit to or what covenants we make at the time of marriage, often across sacred and holy altars.<br><br>During winter semester 1999 I asked my students at BYU to participate in a class project. I invited them to bring to class pictures of "older couples" who had been married a long time. They wanted to know "how old," and I just said "old." For the baby boomers who are listening, you may be interested in knowing that one young coed brought in a picture of Al and Tipper Gore. I looked at the picture and told my student that the vice president and wife were only in their early fifties. "Well," she responded, "you said you wanted pictures of old people!"<br><br>After we had collected a wide variety of pictures, one of my students, Melissa McKnight (now Melissa Wood), teamed up with Tamilisa Wood (not related), a media arts major. Under the guidance and direction of Glenn Anderson of the Instructional Technology Center, they matched the pictures up to another song composed by Lionel Richie in the early 1980s. It was later made popular by Kenny Rogers through his musical releases. The song was "Through the Years." It answers, in part, the question posed about the same time by Rafe Van Hoy: "Doesn't anybody ever stay together any more?"<br><br>We will now see our class project:<i>Through the Years.</i>It portrays what I believe is missing in contemporary marriage education in America today. This is but one example of what undergraduate students are capable of doing at Brigham Young University.<br><br>[The 4.5-minute video was shown.]<br><br>Do we need Marriage Awareness Week? Particularly at BYU? Let me conclude with an admonition given by President Gordon B. Hinckley just three years ago on September 17, 1996, at a BYU devotional. He said:<br><br><i>I deal much with cases of divorce and requests for cancellation of temple sealings. It is the most difficult of all the things with which I have to do. Almost without exception, each case involves deception, dishonesty, broken promises, violated covenants, heartbreak, and tragedy. Begin with your own home to preserve the sanctity of your marriage, the eternity of your covenants, and the happiness that comes where there is love and security and trust in the family. Put the comfort and happiness of your companion and your children ahead of your own and reach out with a helping hand to those whose marriages have become troubled.</i>[Gordon B. Hinckley, "Stand Up for Truth,"<i>BYU 1996–97 Speeches</i>(Provo: Brigham Young University, 1997), p. 24]<br><br>Note that last sentence: "Reach out with a helping hand to those whose marriages have become troubled."<br><br>By being firm advocates of marriage in the latter days, we very realistically can fulfill, in part, an ancient prophecy by Isaiah, also about the last days. This passage of scripture was also quoted by President Hinckley during the last general conference, during the Sunday morning session on October 2, 1999:<br><br><i>And it shall come to pass in the last days, that the mountain of the Lord's house shall be established in the top of the mountains, and shall be exalted above the hills; and all nations shall flow unto it.</i><br><br><i>And many people shall go and say, Come ye, and let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, to the house of the God of Jacob; and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths: for out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem.</i>[Isaiah 2:2–3; also 2 Nephi 12:2–3]<br><br>It is my hope that we, "in the top of the mountains," will let Christ and not the dominant cultural trends determine our conduct and the choices we make regarding marriage and family in these, the last days. Then we can teach others His ways that they, too, may walk in His paths.<br><br>With this responsibility we can also face the future with hope because the Lord has promised He will prepare the way for those who keep his commandments (see 1 Nephi 3:7).<br><br>I share with you my renewed testimony that marriage, the first bond of society, is indeed ordained of God. May we all preserve the sanctity of our marriages now or when they occur. Let us also do as President Hinckley admonished and reach out to others with support and revealed knowledge about marriage in these latter days.<br><br>May we act accordingly, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Brent A.

<h1>ce to God: Blessings of Submission - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
My years as a student at BYU were in the decade of the 1960s. It is hard for me to think of it as historical times, but I realize that for most of you, those years seem like ancient history. If you know something of that history, you will remember that it was a turbulent decade in the United States. There was much of dissension and protest and rebellion. Many began to question the legitimacy of authority--any authority. The words<i>the Establishment</i>became a disparaging label for government and college officials and the institutions they represented. We were advised by some younger sages, quite full of their own wisdom, not to trust anyone over 30, including parents. By the way, these "wise men" are now over 30 themselves, so I suppose we can safely ignore their advice.<br><br>This opposition to authority did not fade away with the end of that decade. If anything, the tendency has intensified. Some claim that any exercise of authority is, per se, abusive and repressive, that it infringes on their rights. You have noted, I am sure, the persistent focus on rights and the scant attention paid to responsibilities. There are those today who challenge even the authority of God. Because it is now so pervasive, if you are not careful, something of that attitude could seep into and infect your own feelings. I want today to reinforce in your mind and in your heart the love you feel for your Heavenly Father. I want to reinforce your allegiance to God and your desire to be a fit and loyal subject in His kingdom.<br><br>At one point in the book of Helaman, the narrator, presumably Mormon, paused in his account to reflect on the proclivity of the people to reject God in times of prosperity. As the result of a severe famine, the Nephites had, at the end of the 76th year of the judges, turned to God. Within a brief nine years, however, "they began again to forget the Lord their God. ... They did wax stronger and stronger in their pride, and in their wickedness; and thus they were ripening again for destruction" (Helaman 11:36–37). Contemplating this sad turning away that had occurred in less than a decade's time, Mormon lamented:<br><br><i>O how foolish, and how vain, and how evil, and devilish, and how quick to do iniquity, and how slow to do good, are the children of men; yea, how quick to hearken unto the words of the evil one, and to set their hearts upon the vain things of the world!</i><br><br><i>Yea, how quick to be lifted up in pride; yea, how quick to boast, and do all manner of that which is iniquity; and how slow are they to remember the Lord their God, and to give ear unto his counsels, yea, how slow to walk in wisdom's paths!</i><br><br><i>Behold, they do not desire that the Lord their God, who hath created them, should rule and reign over them; notwithstanding his great goodness and his mercy towards them, they do set at naught his counsels, and they will not that he should be their guide.</i>[Helaman 12:4–6]<br><br>We may each look at our own lives--at times when we have been slow to walk in wisdom's paths, when we may have set at naught the Lord's counsel and would not that He should be our guide. In hindsight it seems so irrational. Given His great goodness and mercy toward us, why should we not desire that He would rule and reign over us?<br><h2><b>God's Right to Rule in Our Lives</b></h2><br>If we are honest, we must first acknowledge that God has every right to direct us. We are, after all, His creation. Jacob reminded us that "by the power of his word man came upon the face of the earth, which earth was created by the power of his word" (Jacob 4:9). Benjamin made the same point with impeccable logic:<br><br><i>And now, in the first place, he hath created you, and granted unto you your lives, for which ye are indebted unto him.</i><br><br><i>And secondly, he doth require that ye should do as he hath commanded you; for which if ye do, he doth immediately bless you; and therefore he hath paid you. And ye are still indebted unto him, and are, and will be, forever and ever; therefore, of what have ye to boast?</i><br><br><i>... Ye cannot say that ye are even as much as the dust of the earth; ... ye were created of the dust of the earth; but behold, it belongeth to him who created you.</i>[Mosiah 2:23–25]<br><br>Beyond our being His creation, made up of materials that He owns, there is the even more important fact that, through His Son, He is the author of our salvation. Thus we are eternally indebted to Him not only for our mortal lives but also for our eternal lives. Paul said, "Neither by the blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption for us" (Hebrews 9:12). Joseph Smith testified, "That by him, and through him, and of him, the worlds are and were created, and the inhabitants thereof are begotten sons and daughters unto God" (D&amp;amp;C 76:24)--or, in other words, born again into the kingdom of God. Jesus Christ, the Son of God, has paid our ransom and satisfied justice. "He hath purchased [us] with his own blood" (Acts 20:28). In a very real sense, the Father and the Son can claim ownership of us.<br><br>Knowing these things, it is only with the most colossal arrogance that one could claim he owes no allegiance to God. There can be no argument, really. On what basis could we justify any resistance to His commandments? The case for disobedience simply does not exist.<br><h2><b>The Blessings of Submission to God: Freedom</b></h2><br>Even so, our submission to God is not simply a question of duty or obligation. The blessings that flow from welcoming God's rule in our lives are so enticing, and the alternative so appalling, that if we see things in their true light, we cannot be kept from walking in wisdom's paths. Among the greatest of the blessings that come from yielding to His will, though it seems ironic to some, is freedom. Let me explain.<br><br>First, we must recognize that there are only two options available to us, two paths. Alma put it this way:<br><br><i>Behold, I say unto you, that the good shepherd doth call you; yea, and in his own name he doth call you, which is the name of Christ; and if ye will not hearken unto the voice of the good shepherd, to the name by which ye are called, behold, ye are not the sheep of the good shepherd.</i><br><br><i>And now if ye are not the sheep of the good shepherd, of what fold are ye? Behold, I say unto you, that the devil is your shepherd, and ye are of his fold; and now, who can deny this?</i>[Alma 5:38–39]<br><br>Other prophets have stated the same truth. Elijah said simply, "How long halt ye between two opinions? if the Lord be God, follow him: but if Baal, then follow him" (1 Kings 18:21). I particularly appreciate Lehi's statement:<br><br><i>Wherefore, men are free according to the flesh; and all things are given them which are expedient unto man. And they are free to choose liberty and eternal life, through the great Mediator of all men, or to choose captivity and death, according to the captivity and power of the devil; for he seeketh that all men might be miserable like unto himself.</i>[2 Nephi 2:27]<br><br>There is no third or neutral way. Our choice in this life is not whether we will or will not be subject to any power. We will be. Our choice is to which authority will we yield obedience: God's or Satan's? As Lehi stated, it is a choice between liberty and captivity. If it is not one, it is necessarily the other.<br><br>It is important that we understand this choice because not knowing the truth could lead us into serious error. As I noted at the outset, there is a philosophy abroad in the world that, in essence, places man in the role of supreme being. This philosophy argues that there is no higher law than one's own preferences or feelings, one's own desires and opinions. Each person becomes a law unto himself or herself and should not be subject to any other authority. By this reasoning, whatever one feels is right for him is necessarily right, and the rest of the universe must acknowledge and accept that judgment. In Korihor's phrase, "whatsoever a man [does is] no crime" (Alma 30:17). No one can judge the right or wrong of another's choices.<br><br>People are not yet willing to accept the end result of this sophistry that would, for example, preclude punishment of a man who commits murder if he felt it was right for him to do it. We still want to define some actions as crimes and prohibit them because of their effects on others. But society has already moved a significant distance down the road toward nonjudgmental acceptance of any and all behavior. Adultery is no longer considered a crime in many jurisdictions despite its devastating impact on others, especially innocent parties. It is preached that such conduct is a personal choice, and the participants decide whether it is right or wrong for them. I have read of students who in their own minds cannot condemn the Nazi Holocaust because to do so would be imposing their values on others--something strictly forbidden by this code of moral relativism. Presumably such persons would not oppose any future genocide. The philosophy that makes each man or woman his or her own lawgiver clearly leads to a lawless and dismal end.<br><br>The Lord has said:<br><br><i>That which breaketh a law, and abideth not by law, but seeketh to become a law unto itself, and willeth to abide in sin, and altogether abideth in sin, cannot be sanctified by law, neither by mercy, justice, nor judgment. Therefore, they must remain filthy still.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 88:35]<br><br>License is not liberty. Self-absorption and self-indulgence are not freedom. It is yielding to the discipline of God's will and His love that brings true freedom--the freedom to excel, to create, to bless. The gospel, said President Gordon B. Hinckley, "is a plan of freedom that gives discipline to appetite and direction to behavior" (Gordon B. Hinckley, "A Principle with Promise,"<i>Improvement Era,</i>June 1965, 521). This path is one of increasing knowledge and capacity, increasing grace and light. It is the freedom to become what you can and ought to be. But for your freedom to be complete, you must be willing to give away all your sins (see Alma 22:18), your willfulness, your cherished but unsound habits, perhaps even some good things that interfere with what God sees is essential for you.<br><br>My aunt, Adena Nell Gourley, told of an experience from many years ago with her father--my grandfather, Helge V. Swenson, now deceased--that illustrates what I mean. She related:<br><br><i>Last week my daughter and I were visiting in my parents' home. Along about sundown my mother asked if we would like to step out on the back porch and watch Father call his sheep to come into the shelter for the night. Father ... is a stake patriarch, and you'll understand and forgive me when I say he is the personification of all that is good and gentle and true in a man of God.</i><br><br><i>About a block and a half away from the edge of the back lawn, five ... sheep were quietly grazing on the stubble of last summer's wheat field. Father walked to the edge of the field and called, "Come on." Immediately, without even stopping to bite off the mouthful of food they were reaching for, all five heads turned in his direction, and then they broke into a run until they had reached his side and received his pat on each head.</i><br><br><i>My little daughter said, "Oh, Grandmother, how did Grandfather get them to do that?"</i><br><br><i>My mother answered, "The sheep know his voice, and they love him." Now I must confess that there were five sheep in the field, and five heads went up when he called, but only four ran to Father. Farthest away, clear over on the edge of the field, looking straight toward Father, stood</i>[a]<i>large</i>[ewe].<i>Father called to her, "Come on." She made a motion as if to start but didn't come. Then Father started across the field calling to her, "Come on. You're untied." The other four sheep trailed behind him at his heels. Then Mother explained to us that some few weeks before this, an acquaintance of theirs had brought the</i>[ewe]<i>and had given it to Father with the explanation that he no longer wanted it in his own herd. The man had said it was wild and wayward and was always leading his other sheep through the fences and causing so much trouble that he wanted to get rid of it. Father gladly accepted the sheep, and for the next few days he staked it in the field so it wouldn't go away. Then he patiently taught it to love him and the other sheep. Then, as it felt more secure in its new home, Father left a short rope around its neck but didn't stake it down.</i><br><br><i>As Mother explained this to us, Father and his sheep had almost reached the</i>[straggler]<i>at the edge of the field, and through the stillness we heard him call again, "Come on. You aren't tied down any more. You are free."</i><br><br><i>I felt the tears sting my eyes as I saw</i>[the sheep]<i>give a lurch and reach Father's side. Then, with his loving hand on her head, he and all the members of his little flock turned and walked back toward us again.</i><br><br><i>I thought how some of us, who are all God's sheep, are bound and unfree because of our sins in the world. Standing there on the back porch, I silently thanked my Heavenly Father that there are true under-shepherds and teachers who are patient and kind and willingly teach us of love and obedience and offer us security and freedom within the flock so that, though we may be far from the shelter, we'll recognize the Master's voice when He calls, "Come on. Now you're free."</i>[Adena Nell Swenson Gourley,<i>I Walked a Flowered Path</i>(unpublished manuscript, 1995), 199–200]<br><br>It is exciting to realize that we can expand our freedom by perfecting our obedience. In President Boyd K. Packer's words, "We are not obedient because we are blind, we are obedient because we can see" (Boyd K. Packer,<i>CR,</i>April 1983, 90; or "Agency and Control,"<i>Ensign,</i>May 1983, 66).<br><h2><b>The Blessings of Submission to God: Peace</b></h2><br>Our yielding to God and his right to rule and reign over us brings other blessings. Among the foremost are the faith and confidence that permit us to live with peace. The Lord said to Joshua:<br><br><i>There shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life: as I was with Moses, so I will be with thee: I will not fail thee, nor forsake thee. ...</i><br><br><i>Only be thou strong and very courageous, that thou mayest observe to do according to all the law, which Moses my servant commanded thee: turn not from it to the right hand or to the left, that thou mayest prosper whithersoever thou goest.</i>[Joshua 1:5, 7]<br><br>If we likewise "observe to do according to all the law," we shall also have the confidence of God being with us as He was with Moses. With the Psalmist we will be able to say, "In God I have put my trust: I will not be afraid what man can do unto me" (Psalm 56:11). Has not the Lord promised, "In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world" (John 16:33)?<br><br>Years ago I presided in a Church disciplinary council. The man whose sins were the subject of the council sat before us and related something of his history. His sins were indeed serious, but he had also been terribly sinned against. As we considered the matter, my soul was troubled, and I asked to be excused to think and pray about it alone before rejoining the council.<br><br>I was standing in front of a chair in my office pleading with the Lord to help me understand how such evil could have been perpetrated. I did not see but rather sensed an immense pit with a covering over it. One corner of the covering was lifted slightly for just an instant, and I perceived within it the depth and vastness of the evil that exists in this world. It was greater than I could really comprehend. I was overcome. I collapsed into the chair behind me. It seemed to take my breath away. I cried silently, "How can we ever hope to overcome such evil? How can we survive something so dark and overwhelming?"<br><br>In that moment there came to my mind this phrase: "Be of good cheer; I have overcome the world" (John 16:33). Seldom have I felt such peace juxtaposed to the reality of evil. I felt a deeper appreciation for the intensity of the Savior's suffering, having a better, even frightening appreciation for the depth of what He had to overcome. I felt peace for the man who was before us for judgment, knowing he had a Redeemer whose grace was sufficient to cleanse him and also repair the injustices he had suffered. I knew better that good will triumph because of Jesus Christ, whereas without Him we would have no chance. I felt peace, and it was very sweet.<br><br>Joseph Smith understood this when he said, "Let us cheerfully do all things that lie in our power; and then may we stand still, with the utmost assurance, to see the salvation of God, and for his arm to be revealed" (D&amp;amp;C 123:17). The promise to those who submit to God is that His arm, His power, will be revealed in their lives. Jesus said:<br><br><i>Fear not, little children, for you are mine, and I have overcome the world, and you are of them that my Father hath given me;</i><br><br><i>And none of them that my Father hath given me shall be lost.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 50:41–42]<br><br>To live with this assurance is a blessing perhaps greater than you can today appreciate. Most of you have not yet lived long enough to know how precious peace is. Others, despite your youth, may have experienced feelings of desperation. But all of us, soon or late, in a moment of looming disaster or wearying confusion, having chosen God as our guide, will be able to sing with conviction, "Sweet is the peace the gospel brings" (<i>Hymns,</i>1985, no. 14).<br><br>President Gordon B. Hinckley is often heard to say words to the effect, "Things will work out" and "The Lord controls in the affairs of the Church and in the world." In 1983 he found himself at the pulpit of the Tabernacle in April general conference, the only member of the First Presidency able to be present. President Spencer W. Kimball and President Marion G. Romney were suffering from incapacitating illnesses. I suppose President Hinckley felt somewhat alone with a weight of responsibility that few can comprehend. He recounted:<br><br><i>Recently while wrestling in my mind with a problem I thought to be of serious consequence I went to my knees in prayer. There came into my mind a feeling of peace and the words of the Lord, "Be still and know that I am God." I turned to the scripture and read this reassuring statement spoken to the Prophet Joseph Smith 150 years ago: "Let your hearts be comforted concerning Zion; for all flesh is in mine hands; be still and know that I am God" (D&amp;amp;C 101:16).</i><br><br><i>God is weaving his tapestry according to his own grand design. All flesh is in his hands. It is not our prerogative to counsel him. It is our responsibility and our opportunity to be at peace in our minds and in our hearts, and to know that he is God, that this is his work, and that he will not permit it to fail.</i>[Gordon B. Hinckley,<i>CR,</i>April 1983, 4–5; or "He Slumbers Not, nor Sleeps,"<i>Ensign,</i>May 1983, 6]<br><br>Those who accept God's supremacy and act accordingly can count on His support. His power, His love, and His mercy all insure that He can and will sustain them. Those who reject God's rule do not have access to this precious peace. "There is no peace, saith the Lord, unto the wicked" (Isaiah 48:22). Reflecting on Korihor's end, for example, "we see that the devil will not support his children at the last day, but doth speedily drag them down to hell" (Alma 30:60). With no promises, other than what may come from the father of lies, those who have not taken God as their guide are plagued by insecurities, looking fearfully over their shoulders at real and imagined threats to their safety and happiness. As noted in Proverbs, "The wicked flee when no man pursueth" (Proverbs 28:1).<br><h2><b>Submission to God Must Be Voluntary and Wholehearted</b></h2><br>Although it is God's right to rule and reign over us, it is a right that generally He does not enforce. It is a true principle that He accepts only voluntary obedience, only that which is unforced. Moroni observed:<br><br><i>For behold, God hath said a man being evil cannot do that which is good; for if he offereth a gift, or prayeth unto God, except he shall do it with real intent it profiteth him nothing. ...</i><br><br><i>For behold, if a man being evil giveth a gift, he doeth it grudgingly; wherefore it is counted unto him the same as if he had retained the gift. ...</i><br><br><i>And likewise also is it counted evil unto a man, if he shall pray and not with real intent of heart; yea, and it profiteth him nothing, for God receiveth none such.</i>[Moroni 7:6, 8–9]<br><br>We should not expect freedom or faith or peace or any other such gift from our divine head if our acceptance of His leadership is lukewarm or grudging. If it is ritual rather than real righteousness, we should not expect a reward. A detached, aloof allegiance is for Him no allegiance at all. Our submission must be full, wholehearted, and unstinting. "See that ye serve him with all your heart, might, mind and strength, that ye may stand blameless before God at the last day" (D&amp;amp;C 4:2).<br><br>You will recall Benjamin's statement that one must become "as a child, submissive, meek, humble, patient, full of love, willing to submit to all things which the Lord seeth fit to inflict upon him, even as a child doth submit to his father" (Mosiah 3:19). What God requires is the devotion portrayed by Jesus, who was asked to drink a cup so bitter it amazed even Him, the great Creator (see Mark 14:33). Yet He did it, "the will of the Son being swallowed up in the will of the Father" (Mosiah 15:7).<br><br>For God truly to reign, the first commandment--to love Him with all our heart, might, mind, and strength (see Matthew 22:37, Mark 12:30)--must be first in our lives. President Ezra Taft Benson said:<br><br><i>When we put God first, all other things fall into their proper place or drop out of our lives. Our love of the Lord will govern the claims for our affection, the demands on our time, the interests we pursue, and the order of our priorities.</i>[Ezra Taft Benson,<i>CR,</i>April 1988, 3; or "The Great Commandment--Love the Lord,"<i>Ensign,</i>May 1988, 4]<br><br>This is not for the fainthearted or unstable. Our submission to His will can require some wrenching sacrifices. The Lord himself observed, "He that loveth father or mother more than me is not worthy of me: and he that loveth son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me" (Matthew 10:37). We do not know what may come. We must be able to say with Joseph Smith, "Whatever God requires is right" (Joseph Smith,<i>Teachings,</i>256), and with the Savior, "I do always those things that please him" (John 8:29).<br><br>There are some significant words added to a verse in Luke in Joseph Smith's inspired version. Luke, chapter 14, verse 27 reads: "And whosoever doth not bear his cross, and come after me, cannot be my disciple." The added words are: "Wherefore, settle this in your hearts, that ye will do the things which I shall teach, and command you" (JST, Luke 14:28). That is my plea to you. Settle it now in your heart that you will have God to rule and reign over you, that you will walk in wisdom's paths. Make the choice once and for all. Hold nothing back. "Offer your whole souls as an offering unto him" (Omni 1:26).<br><br>Don't resist or resent God's guidance; rejoice in it. Rejoice that He knows you and is willing to guide you. Rejoice that He binds Himself to bless you when you follow Him (see D&amp;amp;C 82:10). In an address here some years ago, President Boyd K. Packer related:<br><br><i>As I meet young people around the Church, they are always saying, "When will my parents ever think I have enough maturity to act for myself?" I know when with my family ... I know that they are ready for full freedom in any field of endeavor the very minute they stop resenting supervision. At that moment I can back off, let them go alone, and really just be there to respond if they come for help. ...</i><br><br><i>... We should put ourselves in a position before our Father in Heaven and say, individually, "I do not want to do what I want to do. I want to do what Thou wouldst have me do." Suddenly, like any father, the Lord could say, "Well, there is one more of my children almost free from the need of constant supervision."</i>[Boyd K. Packer, "Obedience," in<i>"That All May Be Edified"</i>(Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1982), 254, 257]<br><br>I can tell you what will happen to you. In yielding your will to His, God will tutor you in the successful use of moral agency. You will find freedom to be, to feel, and to do. You will be supported in all your trials. You will "bring forth as a very fruitful tree which is planted in a goodly land, by a pure stream, that yieldeth much precious fruit" (D&amp;amp;C 97:9). Over time your prayers will become powerful, and you will come into God's presence, through prayer, with confidence. Because of your unwearyingness in seeking the Lord's will rather than your own, He may promise you as He did Helaman's son, Nephi, "even that all things shall be done unto thee according to thy word, for thou shalt not ask that which is contrary to my will" (Helaman 10:5). Your life, your personality will take on the characteristics and qualities of Christ. As B. H. Roberts observed:<br><br><i>The man who so walks in the light and wisdom and power of God, will at the last, by the very force of association, make the light and wisdom and power of God his own--weaving those bright rays into a chain divine, linking himself forever to God and God to him. This</i>[is]<i>the sum of Messiah's mystic words, "Thou Father in me, and I in thee"--beyond this human greatness cannot achieve.</i>[B. H. Roberts, "Brigham Young: A Character Study,"<i>Improvement Era,</i>June 1903, 574]<br><br>I leave you my witness that through Jesus Christ, the Son of God, we may become one with God, just as He prayed that we might be (see John 17:20–23). May your reverence for these holy beings and your allegiance to them be the shining guide of your life forever, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>D.

<h1>ermon on the Last Days: Matthew 24 - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
More than 11 years ago I visited the remains of an ancient church that sits on the crest of the Mount of Olives. That visit piqued my interest in Jesus' sermon that Matthew has recorded in chapter 24 of his Gospel. The building itself commemorated Jesus' sermon, as well as the place of His ascension and His Second Coming. The remains stand atop the site where early Christian tradition recalled that Jesus had prophesied the fall of Jerusalem, the difficulties that His disciples would face, and events of the last days.<br><h2><b>The Setting</b></h2><br>It was probably on Tuesday of the last week of His life that Jesus climbed the Mount of Olives after leaving Jerusalem. He had spent His day teaching at the temple. As the sun began to sink toward the western horizon at day's end, Jesus paused high on the slope of the mountain with four of His apostles. They had evidently exited the city by leaving directly from the temple grounds through the so-called Golden Gate, which pierced the eastern wall. They then descended into the Kidron Valley before beginning their ascent.<sup>1</sup>The Gospel of Mark names the apostles who were with Jesus. They were the two pairs of brothers from Galilee: Peter and Andrew, James and John. Thus Jesus spoke the words of His sermon in the presence of the most trustworthy witnesses of that age. I wish to emphasize that this point is not minor. This discourse, detailed in Matthew 24, was to be one of the most significant of Jesus' mortal ministry.<br><br>The place where tradition says that they halted that afternoon cannot be far from where they actually stopped to rest themselves. In fact, it may be the very place. In the area of Gethsemane three paths led from the bottom of the Mount of Olives to the top, and they all converged near the crest where a single path continued eastward to Bethany.<br><br>Nowadays there are walls and buildings that block one's view. But in that era, the view of the city and its temple must have been spectacular. This party of five may have gazed westward across the Kidron Valley to the walls that surrounded the temple Court of the Gentiles. Raising their eyes slightly, they would have seen the sanctuary itself, an imposing edifice built of solid marble and decorated with gold leaf. King Herod had refurbished it handsomely and thereby created an enduring monument, perhaps the most impressive in the entire Roman world.<sup>2</sup>Looking above and beyond the temple enclosure, these men would have seen the upper city on the west ridge. Now largely in shadow because of the angle of the slanting sunlight, only the tops of buildings and homes would have been clear to their vision. Jesus knew, though the other four did not, that their last evening together would be spent in that part of town. The Last Supper was now only 48 hours away.<br><br>Tradition holds that Jesus and His four apostles sat together in a small cave near the crest of the mountain while He spoke the words of His now-famous sermon. Tradition has also associated this spot with other very important events, as we have noted. As a result, Queen Helena, the mother of the Roman emperor Constantine, founded on this spot a church that was built at the same time as the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem and the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem.<sup>3</sup><br><h2><b>Effects</b></h2><br>This sermon about the looming fate of Jerusalem and about events of the last days had two notable effects. First, Christians left the city long before it fell to Roman legionnaires in late summer a.d. 70.<sup>4</sup>In a word, Jesus' prophecy saved their lives. Second, at least as early as the fourth century, Christian pilgrims would climb the slopes of the Mount of Olives on the Tuesday before Easter to the traditional spot where Jesus delivered His sermon. There they would read together the words of Matthew in chapters 24 and 25.<sup>5</sup>By then they knew what had happened long ago to Jerusalem in fulfillment of Jesus' prophecies. After all, they had the account of Josephus, who was an eyewitness to much of the carnage. What they did not know, of course, was how Jesus' predictions about the last days would be fulfilled.<br><h2><b>Records</b></h2><br>Latter-day Saints stand in a unique position among Christians when it comes to appreciating this sermon. We possess no fewer than seven accounts. There are the three records of the sermon written by Matthew, Mark, and Luke. Then there are the revised versions of these chapters in the Joseph Smith Translation of the Bible. One of these latter, the one from Matthew, chapter 24, appears in the Pearl of Great Price as Joseph Smith--Matthew. We find the seventh account in section 45 of the Doctrine and Covenants. This last consists of only a part of the sermon. But the Risen Savior thought it important enough that He repeated at some length what He had shared with His apostles that evening on the Mount of Olives (D&amp;amp;C 45:16–59). There must be reasons for these added records, all coming through the inspired work of the Prophet Joseph Smith. I shall mention one that is obvious.<br><br>The added accounts now available through the Joseph Smith Translation and section 45 underline the significance of the sermon. To be sure, early Christians sensed the value of Jesus' discourse as a definitive statement about the fate of Jerusalem and the events of the last days. But the fact that the Lord inspired the Prophet Joseph to provide additional records to us in our day emphasizes its importance as the Savior's statement to us in our circumstances.<br><h2><b>Apocalyptic</b></h2><br>In this connection it is worthwhile observing that Jesus' prophecy fits comfortably within a type of discourse that students of ancient literatures call<i>apocalyptic.</i>This term derives from a Greek verb that means "to take off a covering"; that is, "to reveal." The best-known representative of this kind of religious expression is the book of Revelation in the New Testament. One of the chief features of this type of prophecy of the future is the very strong reassurance that God is in charge of events and that He will bring them to proper conclusion. A person does not read far in the accounts of Jesus' sermon before meeting this kind of assurance. For instance, Jesus predicted that in the last days "you ... shall hear of wars, and rumors of wars." Joseph Smith then added, "see that ye be not troubled, ... Behold, I have told you before" (JS--M 1:23–24). Here, according to inspired words received by Joseph Smith, Jesus reassured the apostles--and ourselves--that we are not to be troubled. In order to lower our anxiety about the way that events might go, He had informed us beforehand.<br><br>Here is another example: Jesus soothed believers by saying that, "Although, the days will come, that heaven and earth shall pass away; yet my words shall not pass away, but all shall be fulfilled" (JS--M 1:35). We note the force of Jesus' prophecy, even in the face terrible calamity: "My words shall not pass away." And who will guarantee that His words will not pass away? It is my testimony that the guarantor is Christ Himself.<br><h2><b>Early Prophecies</b></h2><br>One intriguing question, because of where it will eventually lead us, has to do with whether Jesus' discourse on the Mount of Olives was the first occasion that His disciples had heard such prophecies.<br><br>As a matter of fact, Jesus had already given expression to many of these teachings during His ministry. For example, Jesus had spoken directly about His Second Coming long before He arrived in Jerusalem the last time. In Luke, chapter 12, Jesus said, "The Son of man cometh at an hour when ye think not." The JST version of the same chapter adds, "The coming of the Lord is as a thief in the night."<sup>6</sup>Moreover, according to this very chapter in Luke, Jesus had addressed the unexpected character of His Second Coming. He related a story about a steward who does not know when his master will return home. In it, Jesus warned that the "lord of that servant will come in a day when he looketh not for him, and at an hour when he is not aware." The sense of the final judgment also permeates this passage, thus tying it to the last days and the Second Coming. For Jesus said that the lord who finds the servant to have been unfaithful "will cut him in sunder"--that is, dismiss him--"and will appoint him his portion with the unbelievers" (Luke 12:46).<br><br>These passages, and others,<sup>7</sup>make it plain that Jesus had already spoken about the last days and His Second Coming before His discourse to His four trusted apostles. Hence, we are justified in viewing Jesus' Mount of Olives sermon--at least in some of its parts--as a gathering of several strands of His prior preaching into a unified prophecy of the future.<br><h2><b>Pattern</b></h2><br>In this light there seems to be an interesting pattern in the discourse. In the parts about the future of the city of Jerusalem and the future of His followers, Jesus was rather specific. For instance, He spoke of the impressive buildings in the city lying in ruins, especially the temple. Jerusalem would be surrounded by armies and overrun by "the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet" (Matthew 24:15, Mark 13:14; see also Luke 21:20). In addition, the disciples would be hailed before authorities in "the synagogues" and be delivered "into prisons" (Luke 21:12; see also Mark 13:9). Moreover, those in Judea who saw that these evil days were approaching were to flee to "the mountains," not stopping even to pick up a few clothes (Matthew 24:16–18, Mark 13:14–16, Luke 21:21).<br><br>However, when Jesus began to address the situation in the last days, His words became more general, less precise. Was it because His view of the future was somehow dim? Not at all. The records let us know that His view was very clear. But He was evidently unwilling to let the whole view out of the bag, so to speak. He offered enough to warn us in our day about difficulties that we will face. But He spoke in more or less general terms. For instance, when the Lord rehearsed to Joseph Smith what He had said about circumstances that are traceable to people, He said, "In that day shall be heard of wars and rumors of wars, and the whole earth shall be in commotion." Furthermore, "the love of men shall wax cold, and iniquity shall abound" (D&amp;amp;C 45:26–27). Sound familiar? Yes. And we can tie Jesus' words to many events and currents in the modern world.<br><br>Jesus also spoke about unusual events in nature. For example, He spoke of "signs and wonders" that "shall be shown forth in the heavens above, and in the earth beneath." Presumably it would be in the earth that witnesses would "behold blood, and fire, and vapors of smoke." In the celestial realm, too, "before the day of the Lord shall come, the sun shall be darkened, and the moon be turned into blood, and the stars fall from heaven" (D&amp;amp;C 45:40–42). What are these signs and wonders? They could be any number of natural phenomena. We can recall photographs of natural disasters on television that generally match these expressions. One also thinks of modern warfare producing such scenes. So what do these images mean in Jesus' prophecy? The answer is that we do not know precisely. It could be any such phenomena. Or it could be none of them. We shall know only if, as the Lord says through Joseph Smith, we "shall stand in holy places, and shall not be moved" and "have taken the Holy Spirit for [our] guide" (D&amp;amp;C 45:32, 57).<br><h2><b>Fulfillment</b></h2><br>At this point we might ask whether we can somehow know the meaning of any of the images that the Savior appealed to. To answer, we turn back to the sermon. When Jesus chose to be clear, we sense a very literal fulfillment of His words. For instance, the prophecy that "there shall not be left here one stone upon another, that shall not be thrown down" (Matthew 24:2) was fulfilled to the letter, so to speak. Below what were the temple walls on the west side one can see the fallen, fractured stones of the royal porch named in honor of Solomon. Romans pushed these stones down from their lofty perches after the temple fell into their hands. In addition, one can find evidence here and there that legionnaires hooked their horses to pillars and decorative stones and dragged them off in order to pulverize them with sledge hammers. Not a piece of the temple superstructure remained standing after the Romans finished their devastating work. This fact alone leads me to believe that Jesus' prophecy of events of the last days will also be fulfilled to the final detail, even though we may not understand certain aspects of His imagery.<br><h2><b>The Question</b></h2><br>I want now to turn to other parts of the sermon. One of the immediate benefits of the Joseph Smith Translation has been to offer a more correct version of the disciple's question that coaxed the sermon from Jesus. The Gospel of Mark reports that "one of his disciples saith unto him; Master, see what manner of stones and what buildings are here!" (Mark 13:1). But according to JST Matthew 24:1, the request was, "Master, show us concerning the buildings of the temple; as thou hast said; They shall be thrown down and left unto you desolate." Then, after the party had reached the top of the Mount of Olives, the disciples begged, "Tell us, when shall these things be which thou hast said concerning the destruction of the temple, and the Jews; and what is the sign of thy coming; and of the end of the world?" (JST Matthew 24:4). From these passages, parts of which go back to inspiration received by Joseph Smith, we learn that Jesus had spoken about both the desolation of the temple and the last days on earlier occasions. This observation agrees with our prior point that Jesus had already made parts of the sermon public. The disciples simply wanted a fuller explanation, which Jesus then unfolded to their view.<br><h2><b>"Take Heed"</b></h2><br>Most of the sources agree that Jesus' first words in the sermon were: "Take heed that no man deceive you."<sup>8</sup>Jesus intended, I believe, that the disciples keep this warning in mind throughout the entire discourse. Jesus' first point, of course, was that His followers not think that any who came in His name, "saying--I am Christ," really bore His authority (JS--M 1:6, Matthew 24:5; cf. Mark 13:6, Luke 21:8). Furthermore, they were not to believe that the end had come with the fall of the city and its temple. For "after the tribulation of those days which shall come upon Jerusalem," He declared, there would "arise false Christs, and false prophets, and [would] show great signs and wonders" (JS--M 1:21–24; cf. Matthew 24:23–25, Mark 13:21–23).<br><br>In addition to these possible deceptions that would occur within or soon after the days of the apostles, there was a specific falsehood connected to the last days. It is the deception that "all is well." This statement, which I have borrowed from 2 Nephi 28:21 and 25, underlies the following in Jesus' prophecy:<br><br><i>As it was in the days of Noah, so it shall be also at the coming of the Son of Man;</i><br><br><i>. . . for until the day that Noah entered into the ark they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage;</i><br><br><i>And knew not until the flood came, and took them all away; so shall also the coming of the Son of Man be.</i>[JS--M 1:41–43]<br><br>We notice that, as the scriptures say here and elsewhere, wickedness was more or less the norm in the days of Noah, and everyone evidently assumed that life would continue as it had. Then came the flood, and it changed everything. The warning to those of the last days, of course, is not to assume that all is well and will remain so.<br><br>How does one avoid such a pitfall? Are there protections? The Lord offers a few clear hints, all tied to Joseph Smith's work on this sermon. The first represents a modification of a statement by Jesus in Matthew's Gospel. Matthew quoted Jesus as saying, "He that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved." The JST version very much intensifies the sense of enduring: "He that remaineth steadfast and is not overcome, the same shall be saved" (Matthew 24:13, JS--M 1:11). It is this set of qualities, then, that is to characterize the faithful. A second virtue appears in a passage that also modifies what we find in Matthew's Gospel. But the modification is very noticeable and appears this time in D&amp;amp;C 45. In Matthew 24:15 we read, "When ye therefore shall see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, stand in the holy place." The JST version of Matthew changes this passage but little. However, the Lord's words in section 45 make major alterations, pointing the statement to the last days. There we read:<br><br><i>There shall be men standing in that generation, that shall not pass until they shall see an overflowing scourge; for a desolating sickness shall cover the land.</i><br><br><i>But my disciples shall stand in holy places, and shall not be moved; but among the wicked, men shall lift up their voices and curse God and die.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 45:31–32]<br><br>The activity that permits disciples to survive without finding themselves among the wicked is standing in holy places. Such holy places, of course, include temples. Is there something that we can attach to temple worthiness in Jesus' words? In my view, yes.<br><br>A third spiritual security consists in treasuring up God's word. The relevant saying stands only in JST Matthew. In it Jesus assured His followers, "Whoso treasureth up my words, shall not be deceived. For the Son of Man shall come" (JST Matthew 24:39–40; also JS--M 1:37). Evidently, those who take the Lord's word seriously hold off a certain kind of deception that otherwise might engulf them.<br><br>The fourth promised protection also derives from the Prophet Joseph Smith. In D&amp;amp;C 45, the Savior said:<br><br><i>At that day, when I shall come in my glory, shall the parable be fulfilled which I spake concerning the ten virgins.</i><br><br><i>For they that are wise and have received the truth, and have taken the Holy Spirit for their guide, and have not been deceived--verily I say unto you, they shall not be hewn down and cast into the fire, but shall abide the day.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 45:56–57]<br><br>We note that in order to avoid deception we must take the Holy Spirit as our guide. It is a most important means of safety.<br><h2><b>The Last Days</b></h2><br>We now turn to descriptions of events in the last days. As we have seen, Jesus addressed the issue of natural disasters. We recall His words: "There shall be earthquakes ... in divers places, and many desolations" (D&amp;amp;C 45:33). One thinks back across the past few months to recall some terrible earthquakes that have led to the loss of thousands of lives. We need mention only Turkey and Taiwan, to name two. Although severe earthquakes have characterized other ages, such phenomena are indicators of the last days, indicators that Jesus underlined in bright colors. What interests me more here, however, is the ultimate purpose that natural disasters might be playing in the divine drama of our day. What might lie behind such frightening events? I shall hazard an answer, but only by appealing to scripture.<br><br>At the opening of the seventh seal in the book of Revelation, we read that "there was silence in heaven." Following the silence, seven angels in turn blew their trumpets, each musical sound heralding a disaster. After the sixth angel had winded the trumpet and disaster had followed, John wrote:<br><br><i>And the rest of the men which were not killed by these plagues yet repented not of the works of their hands, that they should not worship devils, and idols of gold, and silver ...:</i><br><br><i>Neither repented they of their murders, nor of their sorceries, nor of their fornication, nor of their thefts.</i>[Revelation 9:20–21]<br><br>How shall we understand this passage? On the surface at least, it seems plain that God expected people to repent in the face of disaster. They did not. Instead, they continued to rely on things for security and to pursue their normal lives of indulgence. Jesus said as much to His disciples on the Mount of Olives. Before His coming, He assured them, it shall be "as it was in the days of Noah" (JS--M 1:41). That is, life as people were living it seemed more or less normal. But what God wanted in Noah's day and--according to scripture--will want in our day is repentance.<br><br>In this light we note the very suggestive language of section 43 of the Doctrine and Covenants. In a passage wherein the Lord spoke of calling on the "nations of the earth" to repent, He intoned:<br><br><i>How oft have I called upon you by the mouth of my servants, and by the ministering of angels, and by mine own voice, and by the voice of thunderings, and by the voice of lightnings, and by the voice of tempests, and by the voice of earthquakes, and great hailstorms, and by the voice of famines and pestilences of every kind.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 43:25]<br><br>From such passages--and there are others<sup>9</sup>--it seems plain to me that in the divine scheme such painful, disrupting occurrences come as a shrill, heavenly voice that begs us to repent. Another voice will be that of missionaries.<br><h2><b>Our Place</b></h2><br>In this connection, do any of us figure in the scenes of the last days painted by Jesus for His apostles on that spring evening? As we might expect, the answer is yes. How so? Each of us in this room who has served a mission or who will serve a mission, or has or will lead another to the restored gospel of Jesus Christ, is a part of that painting. In Joseph Smith--Matthew, the Savior pointedly said, "Again, this Gospel of the Kingdom shall be preached in all the world, for a witness unto all nations" (JS--M 1:31). It is we who appear in this part of the painting--as missionaries. For only after we do our part "shall the end come, or the destruction of the wicked" (JS--M 1:31).<br><h2><b>Jerusalem, Again</b></h2><br>From this point on we note a certain vividness returning to Jesus' words. For He came to speak again of Jerusalem, this time in the last days. He prophesied in D&amp;amp;C 45:47, "Then shall the arm of the Lord fall upon the nations" of the Gentiles.<sup>10</sup>"And then shall the Lord set his foot upon this mount, and it shall cleave in twain, and the earth shall tremble" (D&amp;amp;C 45:48). Moreover, as the prophet Zechariah had once declared:<br><br><i>Then shall the Jews look upon me and say: What are these wounds in thine hands and in thy feet?</i><br><br><i>Then shall they know that I am the Lord; for I will say unto them: These wounds are the wounds with which I was wounded in the house of my friends. I am he who was lifted up. I am Jesus that was crucified. I am the Son of God.</i><br><br><i>And then shall they weep.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 45:51–53]<br><br>We should add parenthetically that the expression "I am" in this passage pointedly recalls the divine name revealed to Moses on the holy mount (Exodus 3:14). Significantly, Jesus applied this expression to Himself both in His mortal ministry and in postmortal appearances.<sup>11</sup>Thus, part of the reason that Jews will recognize Jesus will have to do with His identification of Himself as their God.<br><h2><b>Jesus as Servant</b></h2><br>In this context of Jesus' acts in the last days, I want to turn to an important promise that He offered to His faithful followers. Technically, this promise was not a part of His discourse on the Mount of Olives. But I would like to suggest that it was plainly associated with the sermon, at least in the minds of those who heard it. We read the promise in Luke, chapter 12. Let me sketch some background.<br><br>All the accounts of Jesus' discourse report His very strong caution to followers that they be watchful because, as He said, "In such an hour as ye think not, the Son of Man cometh" (JS--M 1:48; also Matthew 24:44, Luke 12:40, JS--M 1:46). Matthew and Luke record that Jesus then brought forward several illustrations to emphasize this point. Two invite our attention. In one, He said:<br><br><i>Who, then, is a faithful and wise servant, whom his lord hath made ruler over his household, to give them meat in due season?</i><br><br><i>Blessed is that servant whom his lord, when he cometh, shall find so doing.</i>[JS--M 1:49–50; also Matthew 24:45–46, Luke 12:42–43]<br><br>For emphasis, Jesus next presented a contrasting case:<br><br><i>But if that evil servant shall say in his heart: My lord delayeth his coming, ...</i><br><br><i>The lord of that servant shall come in a day when he looketh not for him, and in an hour that he is not aware of.</i>[JS--M 1:51, 53; also Matthew 24:48, 50; Luke 12:45–46]<br><br>There is a further point to make about this contrasting pair. In Matthew's account, these two illustrations appear as part of Jesus' discourse on the Mount of Olives. According to Luke, however, Jesus had featured these examples on an earlier occasion, specifically in connection with His Second Coming (Luke 12:40; JST Luke 12:44, 49–56). In that episode, Jesus spoke these words to His followers:<br><br><i>Ye yourselves</i>[are]<i>like unto men that wait for their lord, when he will return from the wedding; that when he cometh and knocketh, they may open unto him immediately.</i><br><br><i>Blessed are those servants, whom the lord when he cometh shall find watching: verily I say unto you, that he shall gird himself, and make them to sit down to meat, and will come forth and serve them.</i>[Luke 12:36–37]<br><br>I draw attention to the promise that rests within Jesus' words. In what can only be considered a major reversal of ancient custom, it is the lord who will serve his servants, even after the late hour of his arrival. Jesus, of course, had made the points elsewhere that, even though He was Lord, He had come as a servant and that His disciples were to follow His example. But this is one of the few passages that I can think of wherein Jesus effectively promised that He would continue His role as servant at His Second Coming.<sup>12</sup>And His words here are vivid with meaning: "I say unto you, that he shall gird himself, and make them to sit down to meat, and will come forth and serve them" (Luke 12:37). Will such a scene transpire at Jesus' coming? I believe so. The JST version of Luke makes the case, as it were, by adding the following words directly after this promise: "And now, verily I say these things unto you, that ye may know this, that the coming of the Lord is as a thief in the night" (JST Luke 12:44).<sup>13</sup><br><br>These words make firm the connection between Jesus' unusual promise and His Second Coming. Jesus, of course, did not repeat this promise on the Mount of Olives. But His contrasting illustrations spoken there about the faithful and unfaithful servants, it seems to me, would have recalled to the minds of the four apostles the earlier occasion when Jesus rehearsed these same illustrations and tied them to this unusually vivid promise of His continuing service in the last days.<br><h2><b>Conclusion</b></h2><br>As we all know, the topic of the last days invites speculation as no other. And speculation leads one onto unsettled ground. For myself, I have appealed to Jesus' sermon not only because it stands so prominently within our scriptures but because we have assurance that it will be fulfilled. Why? Because the part about the fall of the temple was fulfilled to the last measure. And if that part came to pass as Jesus had prophesied, there can be little doubt--at least in my mind--that the other parts having to do with our day will also come to pass.<br><br>How shall we know about the approach of the end? Jesus offered one clue that is recorded in all of the sources, that of the budding fig tree. He declared:<br><br><i>Now learn a parable of the fig-tree--When its branches are yet tender, and it begins to put forth leaves, you know that summer is nigh at hand;</i><br><br><i>So likewise, mine elect, when they shall see all these things, they shall know that he is near, even at the doors;</i><br><br><i>But of that day, and hour, no man knoweth.</i>[JS--M 1:38–40]<sup>14</sup><br><br>We note with interest the image of the budding fig tree. It is an image of hope, of the promise of new growth, of renewed life after winter. Jesus' caution, as we can also see in other passages, is that we do not know the hour of His arrival.<br><br>The uniform picture that Jesus sketched for our era was dark and troubling. But throughout there run bright threads of hope, of expectations fulfilled, if we ourselves are true and faithful. And those threads are illumined particularly in parts of the discourse revealed to the Prophet Joseph Smith, an observation underscoring that this sermon is for our day. Will our faith be tested? I believe so. Might we see disappointment and heartache and calamity? Again, I believe so. But we live with the ringing reassurance from the Savior both in this sermon and elsewhere that He is in charge. It is that reassurance which allows us to face an uncertain future and to know that He will see us through.<br><br>It is my testimony that He is in charge and that He will indeed see us through events ahead, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>S. Kent Brown was a BYU professor of ancient scripture and director of Ancient Studies when this devotional address was given on 2 November 1999.</i><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>1. To be sure, the Mishnah records that a causeway crossed the Kidron Valley, allowing the priests to perform the rite associated with the red heifer as outlined in Numbers, chapter 19 (Mishnah Parah 3.6). But there has been no archaeological confirmation of such a structure. Moreover, this written source speaks of events more than 150 years in the past and may therefore be inaccurate.<br><br>2. Josephus,<i>Antiquities</i>15.11.1–6 (§§ 380–425), and<i>Jewish War</i>5.5.1–8 (§§ 184–247); see Alfred Edersheim,<i>The Temple</i>(Grand Rapids, MI: Eerdmans, 1983 reprint), 39, 57.<br><br>3. Socrates,<i>Ecclesiastical History,</i>1.17; Sozomen,<i>Ecclesiastical History,</i>2.2. See also John Wilkinson,<i>Jerusalem as Jesus Knew It</i>(London: Thames and Hudson, 1978), 118–22, 173–75; Jerome Murphy-O'Connor,<i>The Holy Land: An Archaeological Guide from Earliest Times to 1700,</i>3d ed. (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1992), 128–30.<br><br>4. F. F. Bruce,<i>New Testament History</i>(New York: Doubleday, 1971), 376–77. Eusebius repeated a story that, before the attack on Jerusalem, church leaders received a revelation that members were to flee (<i>Ecclesiastical History</i>3.5.3).<br><br>5. Murphy-O'Connor,<i>The Holy Land,</i>129.<br><br>6. Luke 12:40, JST Luke 12:44. This latter statement also appears in 1 Thessalonians 5:2.<br><br>7. Luke 12 and 17 both record prophecies of Jesus about the end of time, at times focusing on events and at others dealing with resurrection or judgment. See Luke 12:4–5, 8–9, 21, 33–34, 40, 44, 46–48; 17:20–24, 30; cf. Luke 12:54–56, JST Luke 12:41–44, and JST Luke 17:24, 37–40.<br><br>8. Matthew 24:4, Mark 13:5, JST Matthew 24:5, JST Mark 13:10; cf. Luke 21:8, JST Luke 21:8. D&amp;amp;C 45 does not have an equivalent expression.<br><br>9. Other passages include Moses 8:4, 22; 1 Nephi 18:20, 19:11; D&amp;amp;C 45:33.<br><br>10. Reference to "the nations" in scripture almost always points to Gentiles; see Genesis 10:32, where the term<i>nations</i>translates the Hebrew<i>gôyž¯m.</i>Cf. D&amp;amp;C 43:23–24, etc.<br><br>11. See, for instance, John 4:26 (Greek text); 6:35, 48, 51; 8:12, 18, 23–24, 28, 58; 3 Ne. 11:10–11, 14; 15:5, 9; 27:27.<br><br>12. There is a hint that Jesus will be the host and, possibly, servant in His promise to drink with His apostles in the coming kingdom (Matthew 26:29, Mark 14:25, Luke 22:18). Cf. also John 6:53–58 and Isaiah 58:8–9.<br><br>13. Cf. "the Son of man cometh at an hour when ye think not" (JST Luke 12:47).<br><br>14.

<h1>Learned in the Journey of Life - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
It is a pleasure to be with you this evening. As I look over this vast audience, I notice one common denominator. You're all so young. Really young.<br><br>Of course, my noticing how young you are is like a shuttle astronaut noticing that the runway is really, really far down there.<br><br>But even though a few years separate me from the time I was your age, it is not hard for me to remember when I was in college. I attended a university just north of here. I could tell you the name of this university, but since I intend to talk about football, discretion may be the better part of valor.<br><br>I loved many things about college life. Iloved learning. I loved the comradery. And Iloved football.<br><br>I had always dreamed of playing football at the university level, and during my freshman, sophomore, and junior years, I wore a crimson uniform and played running back.<br><br>When I was your age, the world tottered on the brink of chaos. Opposing political forces roiled and ground against each other. Tension mushroomed. Nations chafed against each other. It was as though the entire world groaned in a burgeoning rumble, a volcano that had to erupt, that ultimately would erupt. Before it was over, every nation, every people felt the effects of those dark days.<br><br>I remember the day my father came to me. It was just after the 1936 football season had ended.<br><br>"Joseph," he said, "Do you want to go on a mission?"<br><br>I told him I did.<br><br>"Then you must go now," he said. "If you wait any longer, you'll never go."<br><br>I didn't want to believe him. I wanted to pursue my dream of continuing to play football and to graduate from the university. If I were to accept a mission call, I would have to give up everything. In those days a mission call was 30 months long, and I knew if I accepted, there was a good chance I would never play football again--perhaps I would not even be able to graduate.<br><br>But I also knew what my father had said was true. My bishop was Marion G. Romney, who later became a member of the First Presidency of the Church. He had spoken with me before about serving a mission, and I went to tell him that now was the time.<br><br>A few months later I stepped aboard the SS<i>Manhattan</i>and began a long voyage that would take me into the heart of the world crisis. My mission call was to the German/Austrian Mission.<br><br>My first field of labor was in Salzburg, Austria. The mission was shorthanded, and not long after I arrived, my companion was transferred to another district in the mission. Soon I found myself alone in Salzburg, a young missionary in a strange, new country.<br><br>One other thing was happening that I haven't mentioned: a large army of Hitler's Third Reich was gathering just over the border, not 20 miles from Salzburg. Everywhere you went you could sense a mounting tension in the air. No one knew if tomorrow would be the day the panzer tanks would flood across the border.<br><br>I remember those days well. I don't suppose there has been a time in my life when I felt more discouraged, more lost. The mission was a difficult one; no one seemed to have time for me or the message I brought. I wondered if there would ever be enough members in that city to make a ward.<br><br>Six weeks I was alone. Six weeks I waited for a companion. Six weeks I wondered about what I might be doing had I stayed in Salt Lake City and continued my studies.<br><br>Even though the days and nights seemed at the time to be never ending, they eventually passed. A senior companion arrived, and we did the best we could under the circumstances to serve the Lord.<br><br>That year as Christmas Day approached, my companion and I decided we would walk to Oberndorf, a little village nestled in the beautiful Bavarian Alps. You may know that the beauty and majesty of this little village is what inspired Joseph Mohr in 1818 to write the wonderful hymn "Silent Night."<br><br>On Christmas Eve we walked to the village and sat quietly for a while in a small, humble church, listening to the beautiful organ music. A crisp, clear winter night enveloped us as we began our return trip. We walked under a canopy of stars and across the smooth stillness of new-fallen snow. Perhaps it was a night not unlike the one that inspired an assistant pastor to write the lyrics to one of the most beloved hymns in all of Christendom more than a hundred years earlier.<br><br>As we walked, my companion and I talked of our hopes and dreams. We talked of our goals and what we wanted to happen in our lives. The more we talked, the more serious we became about achieving the things we talked about. As we walked under the light of a full moon, we both made serious resolutions.<br><br>I committed that night that I would not waste my time. I would renew my efforts to serve the Lord. I made up my mind that I would magnify any callings I received in the Lord's kingdom.<br><br>That was also the evening I made up my mind about whom I would marry. I didn't know her name, but I had in my mind that type of a companion--one who lived the gospel and who was strong spiritually. I even described her to my companion--that she would be five feet five, that she would have blue eyes, and that she would have blonde hair. Here she sits tonight, fitting all of the description that I made of her at that time without knowing her. And so that night was important to me.<br><br>Two and one-half years passed, and before Iknew it, I was home again. I remember hearing someone mention a name: Elisa Rogers, ayoung woman who was in charge of a university dance at the Hotel Utah. There was something special about that name. I decided Iought to meet her.<br><br>I remember the first time I saw her. As a favor for a friend of mine, I had gone to her home to pick up her sister. Elisa opened the door and I stared. There she was, beautiful, five feet five, blue eyes, blonde hair.<br><br>She must have had a feeling also, because she said to me, "I know who you was."<br><br>She quickly realized she had made a grammatical error. To fully appreciate that, you have to remember that she was an English major.<br><br>Even after all of these years, she has remembered the embarrassment of that moment. Of course, my retelling this story doesn't make matters better, but I trust she will forgive me.<br><br>Six decades have intervened since that Christmas Eve in Oberndorf when I made those resolutions. Much has happened in the intervening years. My premonitions about playing football were right. I never played again. But I did graduate from the university. Even so, I've never regretted serving a mission and committing myself to serving the Lord. By doing so, my life has been filled with adventure, spiritual experiences, and joy that surpasses understanding.<br><br>Many of you here tonight may be at a time in your lives when perhaps you are feeling a little discouraged or alone. Perhaps you feel a little lost, maybe even a little afraid. Everyone has felt this way at one time or another. Everyone has wondered if their life will ultimately be a happy one.<br><br>More than two millennia ago, Aristotle suggested that everyone who lives has the same basic objective: to be happy (see<i>Nicomachean Ethics,</i>bk. 1, chaps. 4, 7). After 80 years of living, I've begun to pick up a few ideas about what it is that makes people happy and successful. Tonight I'd like to tell you five things that, if you will take them seriously and apply them to your own life, will bring you happiness, success, fulfillment, and the obtaining of the celestial kingdom.<br><h2><b>Have Faith in Heavenly Father</b></h2><br>First, have faith in your Heavenly Father. Heknows who you are. He listens to you when you pray. He loves you. He is mindful of you. He wants the best for you.<br><br>After serving for a time in Salzburg, I was transferred to Zurich, Switzerland. While I was there, Brother Julius Billeter, a member of the Church, approached me. He was a professional genealogist, and he told me he had seen quite a few Wirthlin names in his work. He offered to research my family lines. I wrote home, and my father thought it was a wonderful opportunity, so we hired him to begin.<br><br>A year later he handed me a book. It was 14inches long, 18 inches wide, and weighed 13and one-half pounds. It was filled with nearly 6,000 names of my ancestors. It was a priceless volume that I treasured. Just before my missionary release, I packed the precious book in a steamer trunk along with some of my other possessions and shipped it home. Iprayed that it would arrive safely and that theprecious family history would not be lost.<br><br>I arrived home before the trunk. Weeks passed. Still no trunk. I began to worry that the irreplaceable book had been lost. Six months after I had arrived in Salt Lake City, Ireceived a call from the Union Pacific depot. A trunk had arrived for me. I rushed down to retrieve it, but when I saw it, my heart sank. The lock on the trunk had been broken.<br><br>I pried up the lid, and when I looked inside, my heart fell further. Everything had been soaked with seawater. What is more, I could tell someone had rifled through my belongings. Some things were missing.<br><br>I gingerly removed the layers of clothing, searching for my precious book. When Ireached it, my heart overflowed with joy. Not only was it there, but the papers were completely dry! I know the book was preserved through divine intervention.<br><br>The Savior asked:<br><br><i>Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing? and one of them shall not fall on the ground without your Father.</i><br><br><i>But the very hairs of your head are all numbered.</i><br><br><i>Fear ye not therefore, ye are of more value than many sparrows.</i>[Matthew 10:29–31]<br><br>By the same token, if saving a book from seawater can be worthy of heavenly attention, how much more will your Heavenly Father be aware of your life and your needs?<br><br>On one occasion President Thomas S. Monson made this statement to me:<br><br><i>There is a guiding hand above all things. Often when things happen, it's not by accident. One day, when we look back at seeming coincidences of our lives, we will realize that perhaps they weren't so coincidental after all.</i><br><br>The Lord knows your trials. He knows your victories. And if you will "trust in the Lord with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding [but] In all thy ways acknowledge him, . . . he shall direct thy paths" (Proverbs 3:5–6).<br><h2><b>Set Righteous Goals</b></h2><br>Second, set righteous goals. Many things will compete for your attention as you pursue your course through life. There will be endless distractions. People and things will call to you, singing the siren songs of wealth, pleasure, and power.<br><br>Success is a seductive word. Thousands of books have been written on the subject. They promise money, freedom, leisure, and luxury. Thousands of people have provided as many surefire formulas for building wealth. For example, a three-step process for getting rich isattributed to J. Paul Getty: Get up early. Work hard. Strike oil.<br><br>Other perhaps more utilitarian formulas advocate variations on a singular theme: You must focus all your thoughts, feelings, and actions on your goals. You must want your goal with all the passion of your heart. You must focus every thought on your goal. You must concentrate all your energy into achieving your goal.<br><br>Of course, when applied to righteous ends, these methods may be of great worth. The problem is that in most cases the search for wealth, pleasure, and power leads to a place that may seem at first glance to be desirable, but the closer you get, the more you see it for what it is. The price for worldly success too often comes at the price of your birthright. Those who make that bargain will one day feel as Esau, who after realizing what he had lost, "cried with a great and exceeding bitter cry" (Genesis 27:34).<br><br>Another trap we often fall into when we become obsessed with success is that we credit the strength of our arm and power of our thought and forget the Lord, who has blessed and prospered us.<br><br>Moses told the children of Israel that one day,<br><br><i>when thou hast eaten and art full, and hast built goodly houses . . . ;</i><br><br><i>And when thy herds and thy flocks multiply, and thy silver and thy gold is multiplied, and all that thou hast is multiplied. . . .</i><br><br><i>And thou say in thine heart, My power and the might of mine hand hath gotten me this wealth. . . .</i><br><br><i>And it shall be, if thou do at all forget the Lord thy God, and walk after other gods, and serve them, and worship them, I testify against you this day that ye shall surely perish.</i>[Deuteronomy 8:12–13, 17,19]<br><br>Do you think you can use the money you have earned in this life as currency in the next? Put your Heavenly Father first in your life. Commit to follow Him and obey His commandments and strive every day to become more Christlike. Focus your efforts on obtaining heavenly riches. To do otherwise will ultimately end in disappointment and sorrow.<br><br>I am reminded of the Savior's parable of the man who worked hard to build wealth. He had so many goods that he did not have a place big enough to hold them. So he built great barns that could store them. His idea was that as soon as he had a safe place for all his resources, he could then retire and lead a life of leisure--eating, drinking, and being merry.<br><br>But just as he finished his buildings, "God said unto him, Thou fool, this night thy soul shall be required of thee: then whose shall those things be, which thou hast provided?" (Luke 12:20).<br><br>A sobering question the Savior asked those of His day echoes through the centuries to ours: "For what is a man profited, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?" (Matthew 16:26).<br><br>Is money necessarily evil? The Book of Mormon prophet Jacob answered this question. He taught his people to<br><br><i>think of your brethren like unto yourselves, and be familiar with all and free with your substance, that they may be rich like unto you.</i><br><br><i>But before ye seek for riches, seek ye for the kingdom of God.</i><br><br><i>And after ye have obtained a hope in Christ ye shall obtain riches, if ye seek them; and ye will seek them for the intent to do good--to clothe the naked, and to feed the hungry, and to liberate the captive, and administer relief to the sick and the afflicted.</i>[Jacob 2:17–19]<br><br>Moses told people of his day:<br><br><i>If there be among you a poor man of one of thy brethren within any of thy gates in thy land . . . , thou shalt not harden thine heart, nor shut thine hand from thy poor brother.</i>[Deuteronomy 15:7]<br><h2><b>Work to Accomplish Your Goals</b></h2><br>Third, once you have established righteous goals, work with all your might to accomplish them. In the words of Elder David O. McKay, when he was in the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles: "Let us . . . realize that the<i>privilege to work</i>is a gift, that<i>power</i>to work is a blessing, that<i>love</i>to work is success" (in<i>CR,</i>October 1909, 94; emphasis in original).<br><br>Work is therapy for the soul. The gospel of Jesus Christ is the gospel of work. I believe that much idleness we experience comes from misunderstanding the Atonement of the Lord. We cannot simply sit around and do nothing and expect to be successful in spiritual or temporal things. We need to do all that is in our power to accomplish our goals, and the Lord will make up the difference.<br><br>Remember the words of President Gordon B. Hinckley: "The major work of the world is not done by geniuses. It is done by ordinary people, with balance in their lives, who have learned to work in an extraordinary manner" ("Our Fading Civility," BYU commencement address, 25 April 1996, 15).<br><br>Let me tell you about a remarkable individual who took responsibility for his life and made something of himself, despite humble beginnings. His name is Doctor Ben Carson. Doctor Carson was born and raised in the poor slums of Detroit. He grew up in a home that had no father. His mother took the responsibility on her shoulders of raising a family, and she passed this sense of responsibility on to her son.<br><br>Doctor Carson said his mother would often say to her children, "Do you have a brain?" If they answered yes, she would follow up with, "Then you could have thought your way out of that situation. It doesn't matter what Johnny or Mary or anybody else did. You have a brain, so think your way out of problems" (in Mark Tipton, "Seeing the Big Picture: An Interview with Ben Carson, M.D.,"<i>Saturday Evening Post,</i>July/August 1999, 50).<br><br>Doctor Carson related:<br><br><i>I began to understand that I was in control, that I could go anywhere I wanted to go, and that I could do anything I wanted to do. The only person who really determined or limited my success was me. Once I understood that, the whole victim mentality went right out the window. I realized I didn't have to sit around and wait for anybody to do anything for me.</i>["Seeing the Big Picture," 50–51]<br><br>Doctor Carson didn't sit around and wait for somebody else to do something for him. He took control of his life. He studied hard in school and did well--well enough to go on and become a doctor. He eventually rose to become the director of pediatric neurosurgery at Johns Hopkins Children's Center in Baltimore, a world-famous hospital. In 1987 Doctor Carson performed the first successful operation to separate Siamese twins who were attached at the back of the head.<br><br>Socrates said, "The gods sell us all good things at the price of our labor" (Xenophon,<i>Recollections of Socrates,</i>bk. 2, chap. 1, sec. 20).<br><br>President Gordon B. Hinckley echoed that sentiment:<br><br><i>There is no substitute under the heavens for productive labor. It is the process by which dreams become realities. It is the process by which idle visions become dynamic achievements.</i><br><br><i>It is work that spells the difference in life. It is stretching our minds and utilizing the skills of our hands that lift us from mediocrity.</i>["Pres. Hinckley Shares 10 Beliefs with Chamber,"<i>Church News,</i>31 January 1998, 3; also see Gordon B. Hinckley, "I Believe,"<i>Ensign,</i>August 1992, 4]<br><h2><b>Magnify Your Callings</b></h2><br>Fourth, magnify your callings and be faithful members of the Church. When we go to church, we surround ourselves with others who share our commitment to obey the commandments and follow the Savior.<br><br>Some mistake the Church for a place where perfect people gather to say perfect things, think perfect thoughts, and feel perfect feelings. May I quickly dispel such a thought? The Church is a place where imperfect people gather to help and strengthen each other as we strive to return to our Heavenly Father. Every one of us will travel a different road in mortality. We will each progress at different rates. Temptations that afflict your brother may not trouble you at all.<br><br>Never look down on those who are less perfect than you. Never be upset because someone can't speak as well as you, can't lead as well as you, can't serve as well as you, can't sew or hoe or glow as well as you.<br><br>The Church is a mutual improvement society with the goal to help every son and daughter of God to return to His presence. One way you can measure your value in the kingdom of God is to ask yourself, "How well am Idoing in helping others reach their potential? Do I support others in the Church, or do I tear them down?" If you're tearing others down, you are tearing down the kingdom of God. If you are building others, you are building the kingdom.<br><br>Another test of your worth in the kingdom is to ask yourself if you are actively engaged in magnifying your calling in the Church. When you magnify your calling, you don't merely go through the motions; you challenge yourself to serve in the place you are called with all your heart, might, mind, and strength.<br><br>If you do not have a calling in the Church, will you go to your bishop and tell him you are anxious to serve, willing to put your shoulder to the wheel?<br><br>As you faithfully serve, the Lord will be with you, and you will feel His spirit and sense His guiding hand.<br><br>A number of years ago in general conference, President Boyd K. Packer of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles told the story of Joseph Millett, a little-known member of the Church.<br><br>He lived in the early days of the Church and came across the plains with other faithful members to tame a desert and to find a new home. In those first years, food was often scarce. Winters were particularly difficult, and often the days stretched further than the food that was stored. Joseph Millett<br><br><i>wrote in his journal:</i><br><br><i>"One of my children came in and said that Brother Newton Hall's folks was out of bread, had none that day.</i><br><br><i>"I divided our flour in a sack to send up to Brother Hall. Just then Brother Hall came.</i><br><br><i>"Says I, 'Brother Hall, are you out of flour?'</i><br><br><i>"'Brother Millett, we have none.'</i><br><br><i>"'Well, Brother Hall, there is some in that sack. Ihave divided and was going to send it to you. Your children told mine that you was out.'</i><br><br><i>"Brother Hall began to cry. He said he had tried others, but could not get any. He went to the cedars and prayed to the Lord, and the Lord told him to go to Joseph Millett.</i><br><br><i>"'Well Brother Hall, you needn't bring this back. If the Lord sent you for it you don't owe me for it.'"</i><br><br><i>That night Joseph Millett recorded a remarkable sentence in his journal:</i><br><br><i>"You can't tell me how good it made me feel to know that the Lord knew there was such a person as Joseph Millett."</i>[Diary of Joseph Millett, holograph, Archives of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Salt Lake City; cited in Boyd K. Packer,<i>CR,</i>April 1980, 84; or "A Tribute to the Rank and File of the Church,"<i>Ensign,</i>May 1980, 63]<br><br>This is a wonderful feeling--to know that the Lord trusts and loves you enough to want to use you in blessing the lives of others. Brothers and sisters, your Heavenly Father wants to use you for the same purpose. As you magnify your callings and go about doing good, I promise you the Lord will shower upon your heads blessings of satisfaction and joy so great that you will not have room enough to receive them.<br><h2><b>Enjoy the Journey</b></h2><br>Fifth, enjoy the journey. The people of God are a joyful people. We understand there are times for sobriety, reverence, and devotion; we also understand that we possess the joyful principles of eternal life.<br><br>We have so much to smile about, be happy about, yes, even to laugh about.<br><br>So many of us are always waiting to be happy. "If only I could graduate, if only I could afford a car, if only I could get married . . ." For too many, happiness is just over the horizon, never reachable. Every time we climb one hill, happiness beckons just beyond the next.<br><br>It is a terrible thing always to be waiting for tomorrow, always depending on tomorrow, always excusing our todays because we are sure that only in the future will we possess the things that will fulfill us.<br><br>Don't wait for tomorrow. Don't wait for the right job, the right house, the right salary, the right dress size. Be happy today. Be happy now.<br><br>Abraham Lincoln said, "Most folks are about as happy as they make their minds up to be" (in John Cook, comp.<i>The Book of Positive Quotations</i>[1997], 7).<br><br>Make up your mind to be happy--even when you don't have money, even when you don't have a clear complexion, even when you don't have the Nobel Prize. Some of the happiest people I know have none of these things the world insists are necessary for satisfaction and joy. Why are they happy? I suppose it is because they don't listen very well. Or they listen too well--to the things their hearts tell them. They glory in the beauty of the earth. They glory in the rivers and the canyons and the call of the meadowlark. They glory in the love of their families, the stumbling steps of a toddler, the wise and tender smile of the elderly.<br><br>They glory in honest labor. They glory in the scriptures. They glory in the presence of the Holy Ghost.<br><br>One thing I know for certain: the time we have here goes by far too quickly. Don't waste any more time sitting on the bench watching life pass you by.<br><br>Can I give you one other piece of advice? Be willing to laugh at yourself. When Elder Matthew Cowley was first called into the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, President J. Reuben Clark invited him into his office and counseled with him about his new assignment. President Clark was one of the great leaders and thinkers of the Church. He left a post as the United States ambassador to Mexico to accept a position in the First Presidency of the Church. He was a man long accustomed to bearing the weight of heavy responsibility.<br><br>As the meeting between Elder Cowley and President Clark drew to a close, President Clark said, "Now, my boy, kid"--[President Clark called all the members of the Quorum of the Twelve kid]--"Now, kid, don't forget rule six." [Elder Cowley asked,] "What's rule six?" [President Clark said,] "Don't take yourself too darn seriously." [Elder Cowley asked,] "What are the other five?" [President Clark said,] "There aren't any" (<i>Matthew Cowley Speaks</i>[1954], 132–33).<br><br>Some people take themselves so seriously that they think they cannot feel complete until they "find themselves." Some abandon family, occupation, and education in this quest to discover who they are.<br><br>George Bernard Shaw said, "Life isn't about finding yourself. Life is about creating yourself." Don't worry about searching for who you are; focus your energies on creating the kind of person you want to be! You will discover that as you pursue that journey you will not only "find yourself," but chances are you will be pleasantly surprised and proud of the person you find along the way.<br><br>Do not procrastinate a minute longer. Every moment is precious. Determine tonight that you will make of your lives something remarkable!<br><br>Not long ago I had the opportunity to return with Sister Wirthlin to the place where I began my mission. My assignment was to organize the Salzburg Austria Stake. In a way it was a coming home for me. I remembered the days that I walked those cobblestone streets and wondered if there ever would be enough members to form a small ward. And here I was, years later, organizing a stake. My heart filled to overflowing as I looked over that congregation of faithful members and as Iremembered the time I spent there.<br><br>As I look back on it now, I wonder if those times of trial and loneliness weren't instrumental in strengthening my character and heightening my desire to succeed. Those times of seeming failure may have been some of the most instrumental of my life, because they prepared me for greater things to come.<br><br>While there, I traveled with my wife to Oberndorf. We walked the same road my companion and I had walked so many years before. And there, before the majestic mountains and pristine beauty of that small Bavarian village, I related to her once again of the silent night when I described to my companion the woman I would marry.<br><br>The resolutions I made on that holy night in Oberndorf, Austria, have been a guiding force throughout my life. Although I still have much to learn and to accomplish, I've done my best to have faith in God; I've done my best to focus on the things that are important in life; I've done my best to work hard at righteous tasks; I've done my best to magnify the callings I've received in the Church; and I've done my best to enjoy the journey.<br><br>May you do the same as you create of your lives something worthy of your divine heritage.<br><br>My young friends, I testify that the purpose of my mission in far-off Europe is the same now as it was then: to testify that we have a loving Heavenly Father and also His Beloved Son, Jesus Christ, who gave us the great Atonement. I testify that Joseph Smith was a prophet of God who received the fulness of the everlasting gospel and who established the Lord's Church on the earth in these latter days. I bear witness that Gordon B. Hinckley is our prophet, seer, and revelator today. He loves the youth of the Church and has great hopes for you.<br><br>I share his optimism. As you pursue righteous desires, the Lord will be with you and will direct your paths. He wants you to be happy and successful. He wants you to come unto Him. May you find peace and joy in your journey throughout life is my prayer, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Joseph B.

<h1>ies, and the Power of the Word - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I would like to speak about a wonderful gift that we all share, without which we could not fulfill our purpose on earth. It is the gift of language. To place this topic in proper perspective, I will start at the very beginning--a very good place to start. When God placed Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden, He made it clear that they and their descendants were to have "dominion" over all the earth (Moses 2:26)--or, in other words, they were to have presiding and governing power in the earth. It was surely not their physical strength that would give them dominion--because many animals were larger and stronger than they were. It would be by other means, among which language was paramount, because with it Adam and Eve could commune with God and establish relationships in their new world. It is significant that after Adam was placed in the garden, his first task was to name things (Moses 3:19), for it is by naming and defining relationships that we establish order and dominion. Ever since that first linguistic exercise, the use of language has made it possible for us to record and transmit information from generation to generation, thereby allowing us to maintain dominion (Moses 6:5–6). To this day the power of words remains the primary means by which men and women try to exercise dominion or influence in the world. Sometimes that dominion or influence is economic, sometimes political, often emotional, and, fortunately, in its finest manifestation, spiritual. I would like to share a few examples of how we use and how we are influenced by language in each of these spheres: the economic, the political, the emotional, and the spiritual.<br><h2><b>Economic Power of Words</b></h2><br>Let's first consider how words affect us economically. Millions of dollars are spent each year in carefully crafting the messages we see and hear in advertising, from the self-indulgent "I'm worth it" to the clever "Yo quiero Taco Bell." I have always been amused by commercials that say, "Nothing tastes better (or washes better) than brand X." If that's the case, I should buy nothing. Companies recognize the power of words when they name products. If the product has an appealing or special name, it can be sold for a higher price--hence designer labels.<br><br>Of course, if a name becomes associated with negative feelings, it can keep people from buying a product. When General Motors introduced its Chevy Nova to Latin America, it was embarrassed to learn that in Spanish "no va" meant "it doesn't go." A slightly older generation among us will remember how the Edsel automobile was a sales failure, and someone quipped that it "looks like an Oldsmobile sucking a lemon."<sup>1</sup>The name Edsel could never sell automobiles successfully.<br><br>In the years that followed, automobile manufacturers became very cautious in naming cars. For a time they used animal names: cougar, lynx, mustang, cobra, etc. Then they cautiously settled for two- or three-syllable names that ended in the vowel<i>a</i>and sounded a little Japanese. Consider Acura, Sentra, Mazda, Aurora, Festiva, Integra, Maxima, Corsica, and Corolla. These similarities are not coincidental. Likewise, some time ago pharmaceutical companies found that if the names of their products ended in "-in" they would sell well. Consider aspirin, penicillin, Coracidin, Pamprin, and Cholestin, to mention a few.<sup>2</sup><br><br>With modern information technologies, we are being bombarded more than any previous generation with linguistic messages designed to influence us economically. Consider how many credit card and loan offers you receive in a month or how many ads you see as you search the Internet. As a new millennium approaches, this bombardment will only increase. Our business world is very much aware of the economic power of words. Perhaps we all should be also, so we can recognize how we are being influenced by them.<br><h2><b>Political Power of Words</b></h2><br>And what would politics be without the power of words--words that inform, persuade; words that manipulate; words that tell half-truths; words that inspire; and words that speak truth. With the passage of time through earlier millennia, some sacred uses of language undoubtedly became corrupted and used not only for sacred purposes but also for political purposes. For example, in some preliterate cultures a shaman or other leader maintains political power by relying on incantations and the "power" of secret or special words to accomplish certain tasks. I have found it intriguing to study the shaman heroes in early Finnish oral traditions, in which social position and power were determined by one's ability to recite the right words.<br><br>In modern society the shaman has been replaced by such persons as advertisers, spin doctors, televangelists, and sometimes demagogues. Hitler's use of language was successful in mobilizing a nation and gaining the allegiance of many to do things they would never do of their own initiative. We have seen in recent decades the use of language by totalitarian regimes to misinform and to withhold information in an attempt to control people. Our own nation is guilty of what has been called "doublespeak"<sup>3</sup>in using euphemistic terms and dense jargon to mask unpleasant realities and to control public opinion. One wonders what Nephi, who delighted in plainness, would think of this scene (see 2 Nephi 25:4).<br><br>Sometimes zeal for a political cause motivates people to misrepresent the truth with shocking words to achieve their ends. Such misrepresentations seem obvious, often ludicrous, when directed at this country by a hostile foreign government that wants to depict this country as totally evil, but such misrepresentations are not so obvious when they occur within our own borders. Our fast-paced world has given rise to a sound-bite culture in which half-truths can be easily disseminated without adequate discussion or rebuttal to gain a good understanding of a person or an issue. Misuse of the power of words to achieve political ends can cause many problems before it is exposed. In our own recorded history it has contributed to wars, martyrdoms, and character assassinations. Fortunately, we also have men and women of integrity who, like Nephi of old, speak truth with plainness and deserve our admiration. They carry our trust and our hopes for a better tomorrow. We are grateful they use the power of words righteously.<br><br>Our First Amendment right to freedom of speech must carry with it a responsibility for speakers to be ethical and for listeners to be discerning. Too often zeal for a particular cause overrides one of these responsibilities. Recently, when our Church leaders were encouraging members in California to uphold the sanctity of marriage between a man and a woman, some accused the Church of "export[ing] the politics of division and hatred."<sup>4</sup>Most who read that phrase recognized it as political posturing, but the use of this phrase points out the need for us to agree at least on the meanings of words. In fact, one of the most necessary parts of our language is the notion of the "definition." We must agree on definitions of words if discourse is to be civil and productive. When special interests are at stake, disagreements arise and definitions become critical lines of defense. In legal cases, personal fortunes, careers, and life-and-death decisions can turn on the definition of a single word. Even as we speak, billions of dollars are at stake in a linguistic dance that a tobacco company is doing to defend its actions, using one definition of the word<i>addictive</i>before Congress and in the courts and another definition of the word when it speaks to you and me.<sup>5</sup><br><br>Definitions have been used throughout history to justify horrible things. In wartime, enemies are labeled with terms that make them seem less than human so that killing them is more tolerable. Slavery in the United States and the atrocities of the Holocaust were perpetuated by defining African Blacks and Jews as something less than human. Some modern uses of racist language are not far from the same abuses.<br><br>Some, in an attempt to discredit or marginalize the Church, have developed a definition of<i>Christian</i>that conveniently and ironically excludes The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.<sup>6</sup>As some strain to define words to justify their actions, the results can be self-contradictory, as we have seen with our society's attempt to define a fetus as something with potential but not really a person--that is, if it is aborted.<sup>7</sup>But if someone kills the fetus in an act of violence against a pregnant woman, the fetus may be defined as a person and the perpetrator may be charged with a crime.<sup>8</sup>Sometimes a society weaves a tangled web to justify its actions. History has shown that as definitions change, so do perceptions, and changes in behavior do not lag far behind. We must be on guard to keep our own thinking straight.<br><br>Linguists know that definitions have a way of changing through time and in response to social pressures, but eternal verities do not change through time, nor do they change in response to social pressures. This fact alone, in any age, cries out for living prophets whose words can keep the doctrine pure and the path straight. In his day Paul was very much aware of this power of words when he cautioned, "There are . . . many kinds of voices in the world, and none of them is without signification" (1 Corinthians 14:10). With these many voices in our world, we truly need an "iron rod" that "will safely guide us through" ("The Iron Rod,"<i>Hymns,</i>1985, no. 274).<br><h2><b>Emotional Power of Words</b></h2><br>We may begin to think that language use or abuse is mainly an economic or political issue, but it is also a very personal and emotional one. The power of language does not stop at what or whom we can control with it. In fact, one of the most significant functions of language is quite beyond our conscious control. We might even say it controls us. It is the function of establishing our identities. Few things are closer to our personal, group, or national identities than is our language. Few things affect us more emotionally than hearing comments about our language. Consider how we feel when we have a term paper returned with negative comments about our use of language. Many immigrants to this country feel discriminated against because they speak with an accent. Persons from different dialect areas find others' speech amusing, whereas their own is perfectly normal. Children moving to a new neighborhood will rapidly learn the vocabulary and pronunciation of the new area in order to be part of the group. Even on a national level our language defines our identities. Consider the French-speaking Canadians who have agitated for the creation of their own country or the Estonian World War II refugees who continued to teach Estonian to their children for more than 50 years in the hope of returning to their homeland when it would be free once again.<br><br>Every country and every region has its own linguistic pride and idiosyncracies that define it for good or ill. Residents of Utah Valley joke good-naturedly about the pronunciation of Spanish "Fark" for Spanish "Fork." In my own dialect the words that most of you pronounce [wor] and [word] are pronounced [war] and [ward], and there is no difference between the pronunciation of "pitcher" and "picture." They are both "pitcher." Slight differences in pronunciation have sometimes had serious consequences. We read in Judges 12 that the Ephraimites and Gileadites were at war, and when many Ephraimites tried to cross over Gileadite territory, pretending to be Gileadites, the Gileadite men would stop them and ask whether they were Ephraimites. If they answered no, the Gileadites would ask them to say the word<i>shibboleth,</i>a Hebrew word meaning "stream." Ephraimites would pronounce the word with an ess sound, "sibboleth," because they had difficulty pronouncing the "sh" sound. When they pronounced it this way, their true identities were revealed and they were killed. We read that 42,000 Ephraimites were killed at that time (see Judges 12:6). To this day we refer to any characteristic of one's speech that distinguishes him or her as a member of a particular group as a "shibboleth." The Ephraimites learned then what Peter was to learn later, that our speech betrays us (see Matthew 26:73). (As far as we know, the Spanish "Fark" pronunciation has not resulted in a single death, although it may produce some mayhem against me after today!)<br><br>Even the names by which we are known influence our hopes, our aspirations, and our behaviors. What young man would not think twice about how he behaves if he had been given the name Gordon B.? Surely Abram, Sarai, and Jacob reflected often on the significance of their new names, after the Lord had changed them to Abraham, Sarah, and Israel (see Genesis 17:5, 15; 32:28). Personal names carry power. We have all been lifted by hearing our names mentioned in a positive context.<br><br>On the other hand, many of us have been hurt by being called names, and we have hurt others by using unkind or unwise words. As children we heard, "Sticks and stones will break my bones, but names will never hurt me." We all know that is false, especially those among us who have been called names when we were young, who were told we were stupid or ugly or always doing dumb things. Often the damage done by words is worse than damage done by physical violence. In reality we should handle our words as carefully as we would handle a gun, because both can have devastating effects and bring long-lasting pain to others and to ourselves.<br><br>Brigham Young taught an interesting principle, that by controlling our words we gain control of our thoughts. The Epistle of James teaches us that small things like the bit in a horse's mouth or the rudder on a ship can control the larger body (James 3:1–4). So also, by the small matter of controlling our tongues, we gain control over our bodies.<br><br>We need to fortify ourselves against others' use of language that influences us emotionally, whether it be vulgar or hurtful language. We are children of a loving Father in Heaven, and regardless of what may be said of us, we should know who we are and what our potential is and what the Atonement can do for us. Not everyone has the blessing of this knowledge. Consider the experience related by the late Isaac Asimov, the author and editor of 470 books and considered by many as one of America's greatest intellects. Asimov was not shy about his abilities. In his memoirs he wrote, "I have always thought of myself as a remarkable fellow, even from childhood, and I have never wavered in that opinion."<sup>9</sup>If anyone had what modern society calls high self-esteem, Asimov seems to have had it. Yet in his memoirs he recounts an incident that he could never forget.<br><br>As a 15-year-old high school student, Asimov had enrolled in a writing class. The teacher's first assignment was to have the students write an essay. When the teacher asked for volunteers to read their efforts before the class, Asimov raised his hand. In his memoirs he recalled:<br><br><i>I had read only about a quarter of it when</i>[the teacher]<i>stopped me and used an opprobrious barnyard term to describe my writing. (I had never heard a teacher use a "dirty word" before and I was shocked.) The class wasn't, however. They laughed at me very uproariously and I took my seat in bitter shame.</i><sup>10</sup><br><br>Although humiliated, Asimov conceded in his memoirs that his teacher's assessment was correct. He himself explained that he had tried to affect a literary style, but what emerged was "rotten."<sup>11</sup>He took his teacher's criticism to heart and wrote a lighthearted piece that the same teacher had printed in the school's literary journal. It was his first significant publication. But when he thanked the teacher for including it in the journal, his teacher hurt him further by saying that he had only published it because he needed a light piece to complete the issue and all the other pieces were serious.<sup>12</sup><br><br>At the age of 70, two years before his death, and 55 years after the incident, Asimov wrote of that teacher:<br><br><i>I hate very few people, but I hate</i>him. . . .<br><br><i>. . . I wish I had a time machine and could go back to 1934 with some of my books and some of the articles that have been written about me and say to him, "How do you like that, you rotten louse? You didn't know whom you had in your class. If you had treated me right, I could have recorded you as my discoverer, instead of branding you a rotten louse."</i><sup>13</sup><br><br>Now we could discuss Asimov's ego and with gospel insight how he could have (should have) risen from bitterness to forgiveness. Still, if one so confident in his own abilities can be hurt for so long, we must recognize the long-lasting power of our own unkind words. We can imagine how very different this scenario would have been if his teacher had shown genuine caring and had discussed Asimov's writing in a private, friendly setting. Perhaps it would have been different, too, if he had attended Primary and had learned a sweet song: "I am a child of God." Rabbi Milton Steinberg is quoted as saying, "When I was young, I admired clever people. Now that I am older, I admire kind people."<sup>14</sup>And his colleague Joseph Telushkin added, "It's a greater accomplishment to be kind than to be brilliant."<sup>15</sup>From Proverbs we read: "A word fitly spoken is like apples of gold in pictures of silver" (Proverbs 25:11).<br><h2><b>Spiritual Power of Words</b></h2><br>I have tried to illustrate ever so briefly some of the economic, political, and emotional power of words. I am sure you can add more examples. Let us now consider the spiritual power of words. The Church, of course, is very concerned with the power of language--not to promote nationalism, because the gospel must always be international or nonnational, nor to impose political control through linguistic manipulation, because the Spirit must always be free. But the power of language can bring the Church out of obscurity, unite a Zion people, spread the gospel message, inspire people to good works, maintain the efficacy of sacred ordinances, and preserve respect for deity and for each other. From time to time the names of Church programs have been changed to more accurately communicate intent. Thus ward teaching has become home teaching and the Mutual Improvement Association has become the Young Men and Young Women organizations or simply Mutual.<br><br>The Church has a significant commitment to the learning of foreign languages and the translating of Church materials into those languages with as much dispatch and accuracy as means will allow. Every young priesthood holder learns that the prayers offered at the sacrament table are to be spoken exactly as directed in the scriptures (see D&amp;amp;C 20:76–79, Moroni 4, 5). It goes without saying that the Church frowns on the use of vulgar language. The taking of the name of God in vain is a serious offense, and English-speaking members are encouraged to use the "thee, thou, and thy" pronouns when giving prayers.<br><br>As many others were abandoning Him, the Savior asked Peter whether he, too, would leave him. "Where would I go?" Peter answered: "Thou hast the words of eternal life" (John 6:67–68). The words of eternal life are words that teach us who we are, what our condition is, who our Redeemer is, why we can trust in Him, and how we can return to enjoy eternal life with our Father in Heaven. While we are in mortality, such words also invoke the power of the priesthood, pronounce blessings on the sick, and heal hearts and minds through kind expressions and wise counseling. Words of confession lift the burdens of sin from us; words place us under covenants so we can lift and be lifted; they bind us to eternal blessings; they give us confidence in the future, for we know that God does not lie.<br><br>It is interesting that after Peter had told the Savior who others thought He was, the Savior asked, "Whom say ye that I am?" (Matthew 16:15). Surely the Savior was not asking for information that He didn't already have, but rather was asking to have Peter testify verbally, as he did: "Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God" (Matthew 16:16). There is something very powerful about giving testimony of the Savior in our own words, for it binds us to Him and makes us receptive to additional light. Alma knew well the power of testimony when he gave up the judgment seat to go among the people of Nephi,<br><br><i>that he might preach the word of God unto them, to stir them up in remembrance of their duty, and that he might pull down, by the word of God, all the pride and craftiness and all the contentions which were among his people, seeing no way that he might reclaim them save it were in bearing down in pure testimony against them.</i>[Alma 4:19]<br><br>President Packer has taught that "a testimony is to be<i>found</i>in the<i>bearing</i>of it!"<sup>16</sup>This gaining of testimony happens in a way that the world doesn't understand, because it involves the power of words in another dimension. Paul spoke of this dimension when he taught that "the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned" (1 Corinthians 2:14). The "words of eternal life" that Peter referred to are spiritually discerned. Such words strike a chord in our souls, and we receive a testimony of their truth. The Prophet Joseph Smith experienced this when he read in the Epistle of James: "If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him" (James 1:5). Joseph recalled: "Never did any passage of scripture come with more power to the heart of man than this did at this time to mine. It seemed to enter with great force into every feeling of my heart" (JS--H 1:12).<br><br>Let me share just one passage of scripture that speaks very loudly to my heart of its truth. Consider the words in section 13 of the Doctrine and Covenants that report the visit of John the Baptist to restore the Aaronic Priesthood on the heads of Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery. If one were to invent such a story and hope to make others believe it were true, I suspect that person could embellish it with descriptions of remarkable signs from the heavens and impressive displays of power and authority. Instead, what we read is a humble statement by John the Baptist of what he was about. He spoke:<br><br><i>Upon you my fellow servants, in the name of Messiah I confer the Priesthood of Aaron, which holds the keys of the ministering of angels, and of the gospel of repentance, and of baptism by immersion for the remission of sins.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 13:1]<br><br>Why don't we see John saying something more attention-getting with a loud voice and with a clap of thunder? Could it be that he knew Joseph and Oliver from before? Could it be that he had great respect for the prophet of this dispensation as one who was truly a great fellow servant in this work? Have you noticed that great souls behave mildly when they perform spiritual deeds? The fact is that truth does not need embellishment. Finally, could it be that, unlike others of Joseph Smith's time who would have said "in the name of Jesus Christ," John used the word<i>Messiah,</i>the name by which he knew the Savior during his time on earth? I submit to you that this straightforward language is powerful and bespeaks truth.<br><br>Such is the power of the language in Joseph Smith's own story and of the language in the Book of Mormon and the other scriptures that testify of Christ and His mission. When I read the words aloud, I feel their power even more. It is language that is not always pleasing to the carnal mind and causes many to kick against the pricks, but when accepted and lived, it rings true with the Spirit and enlarges the soul.<br><br>It is clear that the way we use language is an important concern in all our relationships. It is especially so in our spiritual lives. It has been so throughout time, from the words "Let there be light" to the words "It is finished" (Genesis 1:3, John 19:30). In the case of the Ephraimites, the mispronunciation of<i>shibboleth</i>meant certain death, but in the case of Christ, the declarations "Lazarus, come forth" or "go, and sin no more" meant life and restoration (John 11:43, John 8:11).<br><br>The Savior underscored the importance of using the gift of language in ethical ways when He taught, "Let your communication be, Yea, yea; Nay, nay: for whatsoever is more than these cometh of evil (Matthew 5:37). Paul, in a letter to the Romans, also noted the importance of language in bringing the gospel to the world when he wrote, "How shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard? and how shall they hear without a preacher?" (Romans 10:14). In other words, missionaries and their message are critical to accomplishing the task. The Lord has decreed that everyone will "hear the fulness of the gospel in his own tongue" (D&amp;amp;C 90:11). When we understand how our deeply felt emotions are evoked more accurately and meaningfully by words in our native languages than they are by the words of languages we have learned as foreign languages, we begin to understand why it is important for us to hear the gospel in our own tongue so we can feel the full significance of the words and be receptive to the "workings of the Spirit." Such realization, combined with an awareness of the other influences of language we have discussed, should lead us to a reverence for the considerate, careful, truthful, and ethical use of language, for the very words we speak shape our beliefs, define our dominions, and create the emotional, intellectual, and spiritual worlds in which we live.<br><br>I leave you to ponder the significance of the Savior Himself being called the Word. In the King James Version of the Bible, the Gospel of John begins:<br><br><i>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. . . .</i><br><br><i>And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us . . . , full of grace and truth.</i>[John 1:1, 14]<br><br>The Joseph Smith translation equates "the Word" with both the gospel and the Son of God.<br><br>This<i>Word</i>has endowed us with power to receive all that the Father has, but none of it can be received without words. I testify that Jesus Christ is our Savior and Redeemer and that the "words of eternal life" revealed through modern prophets are true, that the Church of Jesus Christ is restored with all authority, keys, and added scripture, and that "as the stone which is cut out of the mountain without hands," it is rolling forth to fill the whole earth (D&amp;amp;C 65:2; see also Daniel 2:35). It is a wonderful blessing to be fellow servants in such a great work.<br><br>I end where I began, calling your attention to the connection between language and dominion. As we have seen, there are many kinds of dominion in our world, but only one kind will last forever. May we be discerning of the language used in the world today, and may our own language be ever in harmony with His will. May "virtue garnish [our] thoughts" so that, as He has promised, our "dominion shall be an everlasting dominion, and without compulsory means it shall flow unto [us] forever and ever" (D&amp;amp;C 121:45–46). In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Melvin J. Luthy was a BYU professor of linguistics, associate dean of humanities, and director of the Center for Language Studies when this devotional address was given on 9 November 1999.</i><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>1.

This term has been used widely at least since the 1960s to characterize this type of speech.

This issue has been raised in many quarters in recent years. At this writing, a bill has just passed the House (254 to 172), over the objections of abortion rights lawmakers, "that would make it a crime to harm a fetus during a violent act against a pregnant woman."

<h1>ing and Gratitude - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
It is common for faculty who occupy this pulpit to integrate insights obtained from their academic disciplines into their devotional talks. However, I am at a distinct disadvantage: I am an economist. In spite of these trepidations, I will on occasion resort to personal experiences and observations, a few of which are colored by my chosen academic field. However, you shouldn't expect much. An old joke goes like this: "There are three kinds of economists: those who can count and those who can't." I feel that way sometimes, but today I am actually going to talk in a general way about counting.<br><br>It seems that many of the most important experiences in life are very subtle and inward. The Apostle Paul said: "We look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen: for the things which are seen are temporal; but the things which are not seen are eternal" (2 Corinthians 4:18). Love, for all of its power and importance in our lives, is most difficult to describe. Perhaps I am not the only husband who gets a glimpse of God's grace when I look into the eyes of my dear wife and exclaim, "How could this wonderful thing have happened to such as I?" Love does not lend itself well to direct observation, but it is revealed and nourished in many subtle ways. For those of us who have embraced the great plan of happiness, we know that the love of God and of man is the ultimate distillation of that great plan. It is of one of these very subtle manifestations of and strengthenings of love that I wish to talk about today: gratitude, both as a spiritual feeling and as an ensuing expression.<br><br>Some months ago I was driving somewhere with my son Cameron. Cameron is 11 years old, and he likes to talk. In spite of wonderful Mormon ads on parental listening, unfortunately I am often more aware that Cameron is talking than I actually understand what he is saying. As I tried to refocus on what he was saying, he mentioned a name. I asked, "Who is that?" He replied with considerable emphasis and surprise, "He is my Primary teacher." I felt that I was thankful for this man's help in teaching my son, yet I hadn't revealed it by my behavior. How easy it would have been to have previously asked my son about his Primary class and learned his teacher's name. I clearly failed the implicit quiz given to me by my son.<br><br>It is not always immediately apparent to us or to others what is in our hearts. There can be insensitivities even when our hearts are in the right place, not to mention those that are truly born of ingratitude. Neither are particularly pretty. As I reflected on which of these was correct regarding Cameron's teacher, my mind was drawn to an experience that looms large in my early married life. When I was in graduate school, my wife, Sue, was in a fairly serious car accident. A young man stole his aunt's car and drove it through a red light, hitting my wife and our two small daughters in our Volkswagen bug. My wife can verify that I was a little too anxious, after hearing that they were all well, to move on to inquire about the condition of the car, which was only a few years old. As it turned out, it was totaled.<br><br>Those who know me well are probably amused or even a little concerned at hearing this story, because I have always been a bit too captivated by machinery. Perhaps this is a legacy of my rural heritage. However, this experience gave me a vivid insight: one can build relationships by expressing love and gratitude or one can diminish them by silence or by expressing ingratitude.<br><br>Reflecting on both of these incidents caused me to evaluate my own sensitivities to the gracious service of others and how I valued it. More important, was I aware and grateful for the blessings given to me by God? I wondered whether it is enough to feel gratitude but not express it. Or is gratitude too abstract and impotent if it is not expressed? Because gratitude is a feeling of thankful appreciation for favors or benefits received, my mind was drawn to a principle in economics called "free-riding," which is simply the possibility that self-interested individuals can on occasion receive a benefit from consuming a good or service without paying a commensurate cost. This phrase arose during the 19th century in the vicinity of Dodge City, when ranchers who didn't ride with the community posse received the benefits of others catching the rustlers (see Heinz Kohler,<i>Intermediate Microeconomics,</i>2nd ed. [Glenview, Illinois: Scott, Foresman and Company, 1986], 561). Free-riding in economics arises when it is very costly to exclude a person from receiving a benefit such as national defense. Free riders consume the benefits but rely on others to bear the cost of producing the goods or services. I mused whether I wasn't in a sense guilty of free-riding in my relationships to God and to my family, in the community of Saints and elsewhere, when I didn't feel or express a proper sense of gratitude for favors, services, or benefits received.<br><br>Perhaps one of the more prominent and familiar events in the Savior's life is one devoted to gratitude, as found in Luke 17:<br><br><i>And it came to pass, as he went to Jerusalem, that he passed through the midst of Samaria and Galilee.</i><br><br><i>And as he entered into a certain village, there met him ten men that were lepers, which stood afar off:</i><br><br><i>And they lifted up their voices, and said, Jesus, Master, have mercy on us.</i><br><br><i>And when he saw them, he said unto them, Go shew yourselves unto the priests. And it came to pass, that, as they went, they were cleansed.</i><br><br><i>And one of them, when he saw that he was healed, turned back, and with a loud voice glorified God,</i><br><br><i>And fell down on his face at his feet, giving him thanks: and he was a Samaritan.</i><br><br><i>And Jesus answering said, Were there not ten cleansed? but where are the nine?</i><br><br><i>There are not found that returned to give glory to God, save this stranger.</i><br><br><i>And he said unto him, Arise, go thy way: thy faith hath made thee whole.</i>[Luke 17:11–19]<br><br>Leprosy, a dreaded and deadly disease, was cured by the Savior in these 10 men when they asked to be cleansed. The Savior asked them to do the customary showing of themselves to the priest to verify that they were cleansed. One returned upon being cleansed to give thanks. This was not a perfunctory thank you. He fell down on his face at the Savior's feet and glorified God. We are not told much about the other nine, but the fact that they didn't return to give thanks seems to have displeased Jesus, and hence His question: "But where are the nine?" They appear to have been free riders. They received a wonderful benefit at their own request, and yet they were not willing to bear the simple cost of thanking the Savior or His Father. They might have been very thankful in their hearts. They might have said, "The Lord knows my heart; there is no need to express thanks." Any rational explanation for their behavior does not alter the fact that Jesus makes it clear that more was expected of them.<br><br>We can surmise more about the Samaritan who returned. We might have expected that he had less understanding of God than did the Jews, in a doctrinal sense, but this one Samaritan clearly had great spiritual understanding. He knew the great blessing that had been given to him, and he knew the source of it. And he likely not only wanted to give thanks but wanted to commune with the Savior. Though he was called a stranger in the usual sense of that word, he was no stranger to God. Through his faith and gratitude, he not only was cleansed of his physical ailments, but it seems very likely that he was made whole in a larger sense.<br><br>I draw two conclusions from this historical event. First,<i>having faith in and acknowledging God and His goodness is required for us to be spiritually whole.</i>For our own spiritual success and joy we must feel of His goodness and love, and thus we are motivated to offer a grateful heart. Gratitude and the expression of gratitude are the natural offspring of our love for our Father in Heaven, of our following the first great commandment. The fruits of a thankful heart were explained clearly by President Hinckley:<br><br><i>Gratitude is of the very essence of worship. . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . When you walk with gratitude, you do not walk with arrogance and conceit and egotism, you walk with a spirit of thanksgiving that is becoming to you and will bless your lives.</i>[<i>TGBH,</i>250]<br><br>Genuinely feeling and expressing that gratitude, whether difficult or easy, is a minimal expected cost or effort from those blessed. The expression of gratitude means that we recognize the value of what we have received and we are willing to bear a small cost to reveal this to God. Perhaps this is why some mistakenly say, "Gratitude is the least of virtues, but ingratitude is the worst of vices" (Thomas Fuller,<i>Gnomologia</i>[1732], no. 1749). The expression of gratitude provides a more lasting impression--and thus perspective--to our own souls. I can attest that a valuable lesson learned by all teachers is that utterance brings focus, understanding, and greater life to a concept. Similarly, a testimony or grateful prayer professed is more purifying and powerful to the person speaking than those thoughts that are merely felt.<br><br>This leads me to the second conclusion from the events in Luke:<i>It is particularly offensive when we are given much and remain insensitive to God's goodness.</i>Perhaps free-riding is an apt term for such behavior. Indeed, isn't this what we would call rude or offensive behavior in other settings? Let me read from section 59 of the Doctrine and Covenants:<br><br><i>Thou shalt thank the Lord thy God in all things. . . .</i><br><br><i>And in nothing doth man offend God, or against none is his wrath kindled, save those who confess not his hand in all things, and obey not his commandments.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 59:7, 21]<br><br>And Elder Maxwell said:<br><br>[God]<i>experiences a deep, divine disappointment in us when we are ungrateful and when we are unwilling to confess God's hand in all things. (D&amp;amp;C 59:21.) But it is because of what our sustained ingratitude does to us, not to Him.</i>[Neal A. Maxwell,<i>Sermons Not Spoken</i>(Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1985), 85]<br><br>Like the nine, I have found that it is not always easy in my life to recognize, remember, and acknowledge His blessings. It can be difficult in the day-to-day routine, and it can even be difficult in momentous times, such as those of great stress. In difficult times, often optimism disappears, and found in its place is despair, anger, self-pity, and even self-loathing. In this setting it often requires real and purposeful effort to feel hope and gratitude. Yet we surely lack perspective if we do not.<br><br>A wonderfully instructive story of the power of the gospel of Jesus Christ to lift mankind is found in<i>The Hiding Place</i>by Corrie ten Boom. You might recall that Corrie and her sister Betsie were Dutch Christians hiding Jews during World War II. They were caught and taken to a German concentration camp, where they were moved to dreadful flea-infested barracks in a place called Ravensbruck. In the depths of this human tragedy, some very profound truths emerged. In Corrie's retelling of the story, she asked her sister,<br><br><i>"Betsie, how can we live in such a place!"</i><br><br><i>"Show us. Show us how." It was said so matter of factly it took me a second to realize she was praying. More and more the distinction between prayer and the rest of life seemed to be vanishing for Betsie.</i><br><br><i>"Corrie!" she said excitedly. "He's given us the answer! Before we asked, as He always does! In the Bible this morning. Where was it? Read that part again!"</i><br><br><i>I glanced down the long dim aisle to make sure no guard was in sight, then drew the Bible from its pouch. "It was in First Thessalonians," I said. We were on our third complete reading of the New Testament since leaving Scheveningen. In the feeble light I turned the pages. "Here it is: 'Comfort the frightened, help the weak, be patient with everyone. See that none of you repays evil for evil, but always seek to do good to one another and to all. . . .'" It seemed written expressly to Ravensbruck.</i><br><br><i>"Go on," said Betsie. "That wasn't all."</i><br><br><i>"Oh yes: '. . . to one another and to all. Rejoice always, pray constantly, give thanks in all circumstances; for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus--'"</i><br><br><i>"That's it, Corrie! That's His answer. 'Give thanks in all circumstances!' That's what we can do. We can start right now to thank God for every single thing about this new barracks!"</i><br><br><i>I stared at her, then around me at the dark, foul-aired room.</i><br><br><i>"Such as?" I said.</i><br><br><i>"Such as being assigned here together."</i><br><br><i>I bit my lip. "Oh yes, Lord Jesus!"</i><br><br><i>"Such as what you're holding in your hands."</i><br><br><i>I looked down at the Bible. . . .</i><br><br>[Betsie proceeded to thank God for all of their blessings, even the fleas.]<br><br><i>"'Give thanks in</i>all<i>circumstances,'" she quoted. "It doesn't say, 'in pleasant circumstances.' Fleas are part of this place where God has put us."</i><br><br><i>And so we stood between piers of bunks and gave thanks for fleas. But this time I was sure Betsie was wrong.</i>[Corrie ten Boom,<i>The Hiding Place</i>(Old Tappan, New Jersey: Bantam, 1971), 197–99; emphasis in original]<br><br>Surely this story of Betsie and Corrie can be an inspirational model to each of us. Betsie's thanksgiving and ministry changed Corrie's life and the lives of others around her. But who was right? Is it important to give thanks in all circumstances? Our natural tendency is to not give thanks but to complain when circumstances are perceived as unfavorable. In doing so, our complaining spirit dims not only our light but that of others. President Lorenzo Snow said:<br><br><i>If a person wants to enjoy the Spirit of the Lord, let him, when something of a very disagreeable nature comes along, think how worse the circumstance might be. . . . Always cultivate a spirit of gratitude. It is actually the duty of every Latter-day Saint to cultivate a spirit of gratitude.</i>[<i>Teachings of Lorenzo Snow,</i>comp. Clyde J. Williams (Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1984), 61–62]<br><br>Many times I have felt weighed down by a circumstance only to reflect later that I had diminished the moment by lacking perspective. We simply cannot understand the ultimate consequences of any trying situation. The irony of Corrie's circumstances was that those fleas were indeed an ultimate blessing of freedom as they kept the guards from entering the barracks. This allowed Betsie and Corrie to hold group Bible study and to give and receive many other blessings that would not have been allowed with regular inspections by the guards. Perhaps we get so focused on the fleas of our lives that we fail to recognize blessings. Generally, with hindsight, we see the wisdom of optimism in the face of previous trials. And, sometimes like Betsie and Corrie, it doesn't take long for our perspective to change and perhaps see fleas as net blessings. For example, though the pains of loneliness, self-doubt, and rejection in social situations hurt terribly when we are young, I can see now how these experiences mold us into more empathetic, self-reliant, and successful older adults. Wouldn't it be more constructive if we could embrace life more positively and be humbly grateful for our circumstances without the need for hindsight?<br><br>If we expect too much comfort, we rob ourselves of joy, and we are seldom in the state of mind and spirit to learn and progress. While serving in BYU wards, I have occasionally seen this tendency in marriages. Often we thoughtlessly assign rigid roles to others. In these roles that we erroneously assign, we come to expect service from others. I might have concluded that Cameron's Primary teacher had a role, a calling, and I should expect the selfless service of teaching my son just as he should expect that I magnify my Church callings. What could be wrong with that? Shouldn't I expect similar things from God, my spouse, the bishop, my home teacher, and so on? It is easy to convince ourselves of the rightness of such thinking, but it is nevertheless perilous. We live in an age and society where hope becomes expectation, and expectation turns quickly into entitlement. When we feel "entitled" to much, there is little room for gratitude to God or to anyone else. As attributed to Richard Whately, an English theologian from the 19th century, "It is generally true that all that is required to make men unmindful of what they owe God for any blessing is that they should receive that blessing often and regularly." If I expect service from others, soon it will be taken for granted. And this service, if regularly given, will be viewed as our due.<br><br>President Hinckley has, as always, expressed these concerns very clearly:<br><br><i>Our society is afflicted by a spirit of thoughtless arrogance unbecoming to those who have been so magnificently blessed. How grateful we should be for the bounties we enjoy. Absence of gratitude is the mark of the narrow, uneducated mind. It bespeaks a lack of knowledge and the ignorance of self-sufficiency.</i>[Gordon B. Hinckley,<i>Faith, Essence of True Religion</i>(Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Company, 1989), 81–82]<br><br>Lack of perspective, selfishness, and pride have always led people ultimately to sorrow. Yet society today often seems to embrace these traits as virtues. Christ-centered gratitude never focuses on reciprocity. When we feel and express gratitude, expecting others to have similar feelings and forms of expression, we are bound to be disappointed. This might lead us to be angry with or alienated from God or man because their actions do not match our expectations. President Joseph F. Smith said:<br><br><i>It is always safer and better to enjoy the gratitude which we feel to others than to set store upon the gratitude which we think others should have toward us. The grateful man sees so much in the world to be thankful for, and with him the good outweighs the evil. Love overpowers jealousy, and light drives darkness out of his life. Pride destroys our gratitude and sets up selfishness in its place. How much happier we are in the presence of a grateful and loving soul; and how careful we should be to cultivate, through the medium of a prayerful life, a thankful attitude toward God and man!</i>[Joseph F. Smith, Editorial Thoughts, "Shall We Make Gratitude a Debt?"<i>Juvenile Instructor</i>38, no. 8 (15 April 1903): 243]<br><br>God is the Creator, and from Him all blessings flow. When we do as the song counsels, "Count your many blessings" ("Count Your Blessings,"<i>Hymns,</i>1985, no. 241), it is not only great therapy, it draws us closer to our Father in Heaven. I would like to mention just a few of these general blessings that most of us enjoy.<br><br>First, we are blessed with sound minds. Students, this is true notwithstanding that grade you got on an exam this semester. Most of you expect to graduate from BYU. Many of you expect to live in economic environments where education is extremely valued in the marketplace. For example, the median income in the U.S. for college graduates is approximately $20,000 per year higher than for those with a 12th-grade education (<i>Current Population Survey</i>[Washington, D.C.: U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics and the Bureau of the Census, 1997], P-60). The 50 lowest-ranking countries in the world have per capita incomes that are approximately one-fiftieth of per capita incomes in North America and Western Europe (<i>International Financial Statistics Yearbook</i>[Washington, D.C.: International Monetary Fund, 1999). Even struggling BYU students have much to be thankful for economically compared to those beset by starvation, inadequate shelter, and little or no access to health services throughout much of the world.<br><br>Second, many, if not most of us, have had great family support. Like Nephi, we were born of goodly parents and have siblings and others close to us who have taught us right from wrong, civility, the good news of the gospel, and the value of hard work. They have modeled these correct choices for us. We have seen in their countenances the joy that comes from making good choices consistent with the gospel. We are awed by the cumulative effect of these wise choices in their lives. On a personal note, I want to thank my wife, my parents, my brothers and sister, my children, and others in my family and heritage for being such vivid models of the benefits of righteous living.<br><br>Third, we belong to a strong community. I'm speaking here particularly of the Church and of all the opportunities, friendships, and connections that it brings. It gives opportunities to belong, to learn, and to serve. The Church works a mighty miracle in our lives as we interact with, listen to, and follow the counsel of inspired leaders. Coarse, selfish behavior is replaced by an enlightened knowledge of the joy that service and kindness to others bring. For me, I have the unusual and wonderful opportunity to work each day among students, staff, and faculty who exemplify these Christian attributes.<br><br>Fourth, and most important, we know who we are in relationship to our Father in Heaven. We know what He has put in place and what is expected of us. We have an abiding understanding that "all things shall work together for [our] good" (D&amp;amp;C 90:24) because there is guidance and there is a plan for our eternal happiness. We have a knowledge of the loving sacrifice of the Savior, who "suffered these things for all, that they might not suffer if they would repent" (D&amp;amp;C 19:16). We understand the peace and happiness that come from humble obedience and faith.<br><br>Returning again to the central theme of my talk, is it required that we be similarly sensitive to those blessings given by others? By sensitive, I mean to feel gratitude and to express thanks through word or deed or both. Do we free ride in our relationships to others when we aren't gracious in this sense? President Hinckley has addressed directly how I should react and feel, especially to those who serve me and my children in the Church:<br><br><i>Brethren and sisters of the Church, there must be warmth in the work of the Lord. There must be friendship. There must be love unfeigned. There must be appreciation and thanks expressed. There must be constant nurturing with the good word of God. All of these are small things, so easy to do, and they make so great a difference.</i>[Gordon B. Hinckley, "There Must Be Messengers,"<i>Ensign,</i>October 1987, 5]<br><br>And Elder James E. Talmage told us:<br><br><i>The capacity to feel and the ability to express gratitude or thanks not only reaches below man's mentality and spiritual conception, but exists beyond and above him, for its source is divine.</i>[James E. Talmage,<i>Sunday Night Talks: A Series of Radio Addresses</i>(Salt Lake City: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 1931), 483]<br><br>The answer to my question is clear: The expression of gratitude to others is itself a blessing.<br><br>This does not mean that we have a different standard toward anyone, particularly strangers. Just as the Savior taught that there are two great commandments--to love God and our neighbor--proper relationships and gratitude both felt and expressed to others is central to building bonds between individuals. If I may, I'd like to demonstrate this with a personal example.<br><br>My father passed away in an untimely accident when I was a young man. It was a great loss to our family and to others who loved him. He was very devoted to his work as foreman of a large orchard, to Church service, and to his family and mankind. Sometimes it was hard for me to share him with others, and it was difficult to understand the impact of his life on others. At his passing, many in the Church and in the rest of the community graciously expressed their gratitude for his good life of service. But none had greater impact than the humble Hispanic migrant farm worker who knocked on our door. None of the family really knew him. Many of his circumstances, beliefs, and choices in life were very different from ours. However, he forcefully yet humbly expressed that my father had treated him unusually--with dignity, respect, concern, and love. This man talked about how much he had loved my father in return. I only wish this man could know how much this simple expression of appreciation and gratitude has meant and continues to mean to me and my family.<br><br>For me, one of the most profound questions in the scriptures is found in the Sermon on the Mount, when the Savior asked: "For if ye love them which love you, what reward have ye? do not even the publicans the same?" (Matthew 5:46). If we truly recognize the divine origins of those around us, we will reach out to those who are not friends or even friendly. And certainly we will be grateful for the kindnesses and service given to us by others, as was the migrant worker for my father's service.<br><br>Well, in closing, what might we do to more fully develop and express gratitude? I will mention only a few suggestions. They may be conceptually very simple, but I feel they are behaviorally deep.<br><br><b>First,</b>let us see the world as a better place where gratitude is expressed. This implies that we graciously receive the gratitude expressed to us. Let us not subscribe to the convenient rationalization that "next to ingratitude, the most painful thing to bear is gratitude" (Henry Ward Beecher,<i>Proverbs from Plymouth Pulpit</i>[New York: D. Appleton and Company, 1887], 229).<br><br><b>Second,</b>let each of us reflect thoughtfully on our life and on God's goodness to us. If we do this more regularly and intently, understanding the spiritual dimension of gratitude, we will be able to gain greater perspective. Perhaps more fleas become counted as blessings. A quote that nicely sums up this process is from the English religious writer Hannah More:<br><br><i>There are three requisites to our proper enjoyment of every earthly blessing which God bestows on us;--a thankful reflection on the goodness of the giver, a deep sense of the unworthiness of the receiver, and a sober recollection of the precarious tenure by which we hold it. The first would make us grateful, the second humble, the last moderate.</i>[Hannah More, in "The Love of God," chapter 7 of<i>Practical Piety,</i>in<i>The Complete Works of Hannah More,</i>vol. 1 (New York: Harper and Brothers, 1835), 441]<br><br>Let's express heartfelt gratitude to our Father in Heaven. As with the healed Samaritan leper in Luke, expression will bring clarity, purity, and spiritual power.<br><br><b>Third,</b>an important way we can show gratitude to God and to our families is by being as Christlike as we can be. President Hunter said:<br><br><i>We pay our debt of gratitude by living in such a way as to bring credit to our parents and the name we bear, by doing good to others, by being of service, by being willing to share the light and knowledge we have received.</i>[<i>Teachings of Howard W. Hunter,</i>ed. Clyde J. Williams (Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1997), 93]<br><br><b>Fourth,</b>assuming that we feel gratitude toward those close to us, especially our families, let's express it. I recently heard a noted television commentator discussing personal and family relationships. I cannot quote her, but she said essentially that we should not expect gratitude from our children. Gratitude proceeds from generation to subsequent generations. That is, parents should feel gratitude and thanks for their children, but the parents are in for a big disappointment if they expect gratitude from their children. However, the very purpose of the gospel is to change us and improve our relationships with one another. God gave us the fifth of the 10 commandments, to "Honour thy father and thy mother" (Exodus 20:12), for this reason. It would probably be a good idea for us to reflect often about those things that we admire in each of our loved ones and let those thoughts find greater expression.<br><br><b>Fifth,</b>let us take inventory of how others beyond our families bless our lives. Heartfelt expressions of gratitude show that we value these individuals and their service. It is the<i>very least</i>that we can do to avoid being a free rider, a taker only. More positively, expressions of gratitude will strengthen bonds between people and improve the welfare of both the giver and receiver. Economists naturally like such exchanges and sometimes refer to them as mutually beneficial exchanges.<br><br>The Book of Mormon opens with Nephi's hymn of gratitude to others, as noted by "born of goodly parents" and "having been highly favored of the Lord in all my days" (1 Nephi 1:1). May we in all things follow this example. And let us help others reach their divine potential and thereby increase our joy and the joy of our Father in Heaven. This is my prayer in the name of His Beloved Son and the Exemplar to us all, even Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Rulon D.

<h1> Chain of Generations Unbroken - Gordon B. Hinckley - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
My dear young friends, it is a great honor to be with you this morning. How very much I love you. How I honor you and respect you. You do great credit to this church. You are not everything you ought to be, but by and large you are very good, and you can become what you ought to be. You are very fortunate to be here. What a blessing to mingle with thousands of your own kind, to establish friendships that will endure, to be engaged in a great and challenging pursuit of knowledge.<br><br>This is a marvelous time in the history of the world. How exciting it is to be on the stage of life when one millennium rolls into another. That happens only every thousand years. It has happened only twice since the birth of the Son of God. We speak of this sick old world that has seen so much of tragedy--almost all of it caused by man's inhumanity to man. It is the result of greed and ambition, of selfishness and brutality.<br><br>In the first millennium the world lapsed into an age of darkness. It was a fulfillment of Isaiah's prophecy: "Darkness shall cover the earth, and gross darkness the people" (Isaiah 60:2).<br><br>Men did not live long at that time. There was so much of disease, of pestilence, that raged over many parts of the earth. The great plague took the lives of one-third of the people of Europe. With all of the disease, with wars and conflict, with accidents and hunger and cold so widely prevalent, I sometimes wonder how enough people survived to provide you and me with ancestors. Then the Renaissance began to dawn. It flowered, and I believe it is still flowering with magnificence.<br><br>As we close this great and remarkable century, I stand in awe of the blessings we have. I have now lived through 90 years of this century. When I think of the wonders that have come to pass in my lifetime--more than during all the rest of human history together--I stand in reverence and gratitude. I think of the automobile and the airplane, of computers, fax machines, e-mail, and the Internet. It is all so miraculous and wonderful. I think of the giant steps made in medicine and sanitation. I think that all of the great medicines we use, with the possible exception of aspirin, have come forth in this century, including the antibiotics that have healed and made well generations of beneficiaries. When I was born, the life expectancy of a man in the United States was 50 years. Today it is more than 75. To think that 25 years have been added to the life of an average man in North America and western Europe is miraculous.<br><br>I am led to exclaim with the words to the hymn:<br><br><i>We are living, we are dwelling</i><br><i>In a grand and awful time,</i><br><i>In an age on ages telling;</i><br><i>To be living is sublime.</i><br>[Arthur Cleveland Coxe, "We Are Living, We Are Dwelling" (1840), in<i>The Hymnbook</i>(Richmond: Presbyterian Church in the United States, United Presbyterian Church in the U.S.A., and Reformed Church in America, 1955), no. 356]<br><br>And with all of this there has been the restoration of the pure gospel of Jesus Christ. You and I are a part of the miracle and wonder of this great cause and kingdom that is sweeping over the earth blessing the lives of people wherever it reaches. How profoundly thankful I feel.<br><br>No generation that ever walked the earth is as fortunate as are you. I believe that it was of this day that the prophet Joel spoke when he said: "And your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, your old men shall dream dreams, your young men shall see visions" (Joel 2:28).<br><br>We are the beneficiaries of the visions and the dreams, the labors and the sacrifices of all who have gone before us.<br><br>They are gone, and we are here.<br><br>Recently, at the dedication of the Columbus Temple in Ohio, I had an interesting experience. My wife and daughter were with me. A granddaughter and her husband and children drove up from St. Louis.<br><br>As I sat in the celestial room, I thought of my great-grandfather, the first in my family to join the Church. I had recently visited his place of burial in Canada just to the north of the New York boundary line. He accepted the gospel when the first missionaries came there from Kirtland. His children were too young for baptism. He died at the young age of 38. Tradition has it that he was the victim of a smallpox epidemic that raged through that part of the country. I do not know of anything of significance that he did in the Church other than he kept the faith.<br><br>Then there was my grandfather, who was baptized in Nauvoo and who subsequently crossed the plains in the migration of our people. His young wife and his brother-in-law both died on the same day. He made rough coffins and buried them and picked up his infant child and carried her to this valley.<br><br>At the request of Brigham Young he built Cove Fort, was the first president of the stake in Fillmore, and did a thousand other things to move this work forward.<br><br>Then came my father. He came here to the BY Academy as a very young man and was taught by President Karl G. Maeser. He went east to school, and then he taught here in the business department until the Brethren asked him to move to Salt Lake City and take over responsibilities there. He became president of the largest stake in the Church with more than 15,000 members.<br><br>These three good men represent the three generations of my forebears who have been faithful in the Church. Reflecting on the lives of these three men while I was seated in the temple, I looked down at my daughter, at her daughter, who is my grandchild, and at her children, my great-grandchildren. I suddenly realized that I stood right in the middle of these seven generations--three before me and three after me.<br><br>In that sacred and hallowed house there passed through my mind a sense of the tremendous obligation that was mine to pass on all that I had received as an inheritance from my forebears to the generations who have now come after me.<br><br>I thought of an experience I had long, long ago. In the summer we lived on a farm. We had a little old tractor. There was a dead tree I wished to pull. I fastened one end of a chain to the tractor and the other end to the tree. As the tractor began to move, the tree shook a little, and then the chain broke.<br><br>I looked at that broken link and wondered how it could have given way. I went to the hardware store and bought a repair link. I put it together again, but it was an awkward and ugly connection. The chain was never, never the same.<br><br>As I sat in the celestial room of the temple pondering these things, I said to myself, "Never permit yourself to become a weak link in the chain of your generations." It is so important that we pass on without a blemish our inheritance of body and brain and, if you please, faith and virtue untarnished to the generations who will come after us.<br><br>You young men and you young women, most of you will marry and have children. Your children will have children, as will the children who come after them. Life is a great chain of generations that we in the Church believe must be linked together.<br><br>I fear there will be some broken links. Do not let yourself become such, I pray.<br><br>Stay close to the Church. Stay close all of your lives. It really does not matter where you serve, what office you fill. There is no small or unimportant duty in this Church and in the kingdom of God.<br><br>One does not have to be a General Authority, a stake president, a member of the high council, a bishop, or a leader in the auxiliary organizations to serve in an acceptable way before the Lord. What matters is the spirit in which we serve and the manner in which we apply our talents and our resources.<br><br>What is an acceptable offering unto the Lord in terms of our callings? The first requisite, as is noted in the scripture, is cleanliness of hands and heart.<br><br>The Psalmist wrote:<br><br><i>He that hath clean hands, and a pure heart; who hath not lifted up his soul unto vanity, nor sworn deceitfully.</i><br><br><i>He shall receive the blessing from the Lord, and righteousness from the God of his salvation.</i>[Psalm 24:4]<br><br>It is not the calling we have, it is not the office in which we serve, but rather the manner in which we serve.<br><br>It is the attitude with which we pay our tithes and offerings. Do we pay them begrudgingly as a duty? Or do we give the Lord our offerings with thanksgiving for the opportunity, with a cheerful heart and a pleasant way? Are we inclined to hold to the last penny, or do we add a little on the assumption that we may have forgotten some item that came to us during the year?<br><br>When one of our newer temples was being built, I received a letter from a boy who said, "I am eight years old. I am sending $100 to help build the temple. I do not like to do this. It was very hard to earn. But I want to give this for the construction of the Lord's house."<br><br>I later received a phone call from a well-to-do man who said, "I desire to give a million dollars to the construction of that temple." Whose gift was the more acceptable? Both of them were, the boy's $100 as well as the man's million.<br><br>The Lord made it clear that the widow's mite is received with great appreciation because of the spirit in which it is given. But I am satisfied that He also would have thanked the man who was well-to-do for his generosity in giving with that same spirit.<br><br>Sometimes men and women in the Church aspire for office. This is unfortunate. It becomes the very reason why they should not be granted such office.<br><br>I think of a bishop whom I had to call one day to report that a missionary he had sent into the field was failing and was determined to come home. The mission president had done all he could with him. The bishop at his own expense in time and money went to the place where the young man was laboring. He talked with him. He cried with him. He prayed with him and blessed him. And then he went out and worked with him. The missionary was saved. He finished honorably. All of his future life will be blessed by reason of the love and kindness of a great bishop.<br><br>The other evening I looked at a video a man had sent me. It is the story of his mother. It is titled<i>Morning Will Come.</i><br><br>It is the story of Misao Toma, whom I first met on Okinawa almost 30 years ago. She was married not long before the Second World War broke out. During the war she, her husband, and their two little children suffered unspeakable misery. They lived in a cave hiding from the soldiers--both American and Japanese--as that area of the world was devastated with gunfire, cannon fire, and bombs, with tens of thousands of casualties. Her husband suffered a collapse. He wanted to die. He cried out that he wanted to be killed. She felt utterly helpless and broken.<br><br>A vision came to her in the night when her family was hungry to the point of death. There came into her being a sense of the reality of God. It gave her strength to carry on. This little woman literally saved her family. She fed them leaves and little creatures from the river. She found a hive of wild honey that revived her husband. After the night of awful darkness the morning came. Somehow they survived.<br><br>Two sister missionaries later called on her. Their message touched her heart. She and her husband and their children were eventually baptized. He became the first native branch president on Okinawa. That is when I met them. They were beginning to prosper, had a nice home that had come of their industry, and were faithful and active in the Church. Then the husband suffered a stroke and died. That was in 1962. Because of the unconscionable actions of another man, she was left with terrible debts for the business and for her husband's medical care.<br><br>For long years she worked from 5 o'clock in the morning until 11 o'clock each night. To get food for her children she asked the grocer to give her the tops, the green leaves, from the bunches of carrots and radishes. Sometimes she would come home and say to her children, "We will sing hymns tonight." That meant to the children that there was no food to eat that night or the next morning.<br><br>Her children grew. They received scholarships to the Hawaii campus and later came here to BYU. They served missions. They became involved in business and were highly successful. They wrote to their mother and told her to sell the house and pay the debts and come and live with them. They bought for her a beautiful home in Tokyo.<br><br>So far as I know she held no office in the Church except that of a worker in the Tokyo Temple. She may have taught a class or two, but she did not preside over any organization.<br><br>Was her offering acceptable to the Lord? She gave her children, having nurtured them in faith with prayer and love. She did whatever she was asked to do.<br><br>She died here in Provo three years ago. But today, as I think of her family, I think of her great offering and of its acceptability before the Lord.<br><br>Brothers and sisters, as President Clark said: "In the service of the Lord, it is not where you serve but how" (J. Reuben Clark, Jr.,<i>CR,</i>April 1951, 154). Is there gladness in our hearts and joy in our lives as we reach out to bless others?<br><br>At the close of each day can we quietly sing:<br><br><i>Have I done any good in the world today?</i><br><i>Have I helped anyone in need?</i><br><i>Have I cheered up the sad and made someone feel glad?</i><br><i>If not, I have failed indeed.</i><br>["Have I Done Any Good?"<i>Hymns,</i>1985, no. 223]<br><br>God bless you, my dear friends. Be faithful. Be true. Be loyal to the great cause of which you are a part. Never become a weak link in the chain of your family's generations. Do whatever you are asked to do, and do it with a glad heart. Do not worry about office or position in the Church. Simply do whatever your calling requires, and do it with joy and gladness.<br><br>May the Lord bless you as you strive to serve Him in righteousness and with faith. I leave my love and my blessing with you in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Gordon B.
