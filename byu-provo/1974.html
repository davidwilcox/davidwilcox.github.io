<h1>sey to Happiness - James E. Faust - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
My beloved brothers and sisters, it's a great thrill to be here and to see you all and to have heard these lovely musical numbers. I remember some years ago traveling along a street where there was a church. In front of the church was advertised what would take place the coming Sunday, and the sign on this particular day said, "What hell is like"; then written below was "Come and hear our choir."<br><br>This evening we've heard a heavenly choir. And if you could have seen the charm and the grace and the enthusiasm on Sister Troub's face as she led this group, you would have beheld something which was as magnificent as the sound which the choir produced. I was thrilled to hear Sister Joan Larsen Lundt play so beautifully on the violin. I claim her. She is one of my girls. Her family lived in my stake when I was stake president. I also claim her husband because I was blessed to perform the sealing at the time they were married.<br><br>President Oaks and members of the presidencies of the ten stakes, it is a great thrill and honor and a delight to be with you this evening. I must confess that the responsibility of speaking to you has driven me to my knees several times. The burden has been heavy because I have never had the responsibility of speaking to so many young adults and special interests members under one roof. I also feel a burden because of the subject about which I have chosen to speak to you. I would speak to you this evening about the odyssey to happiness. I am immeasurably fortified because she who has made my own journey to happiness so complete and fulfilled is behind me giving me the same love and support she has every day and every hour of the more than thirty years that we have been married. Ours has been a happiness which, on my part, has exceeded my fondest hopes and expectations.<br><h2><b>The Pursuit of Happiness According to Philosophers</b></h2><br>Because you are and because you are here, I assume that you share with all mankind the desire to be happy. Most of you, being Americans, claim this as a God-given right to pursue, for our founding fathers said that among your inalienable rights is the right to pursue happiness. Early philosophers like Aristotle, Locke, Aquinas, and Mill declared that the most fundamental of all human searches was for happiness. Because most of you are single and because I am one of those assigned to have special concern for you, I must warn you about the conflict that always exists between feeling happy at a given moment and being happy for a lifetime--or, expressing this concept in another way, always living happily. It will often be necessary for all of us to choose between having a good time and leading a good life.<br><br>Aristotle chose to define a happy man as one who wants for nothing. Plato, in this regard, was wiser than Aristotle because he related happiness to spiritual well-being, producing a harmony in the soul. The Savior of the world taught us to seek the inner peace which results from a proper order of all of the soul's parts. In Plato's<i>Republic,</i>Socrates explains, "The just man does not permit several elements within him to interfere with one another. He sets in order his own inner life and is his own master and his own law and is at peace with himself." Tolstoy, speaking through Pierre Bezukhov in<i>War and Peace</i>, stated: "Man is created for happiness; that happiness lies in himself, is the satisfaction of his natural human cravings; that all unhappiness rises not from privation but from superfluity."<br><br>In the minds of some there is a question as to whether all normal human beings can achieve happiness or whether it can be achieved only by those gifted with very special talents. This questioning comes because the peace about which the Savior spoke, even "the peace ... which passeth all understanding" (Philippians 4:7), seems to have escaped so many of his followers. Spinoza says, "All noble things are as difficult as they are rare." One thoughtful man said, "Happiness is a wine of the rarest vintage and seems insipid to a vulgar taste" (Logan Smith,<i>Afterthoughts</i>, 1931). Some may feel that before we can learn to live well we must learn how to face death or to live being rid of the fear of death. The rationale of the ancient philosophers seems to have been that happiness is the possession of all good things and the satisfaction of all desires.<br><h2><b>The Pursuit of Happiness According to the Prophets</b></h2><br>Many years of listening to the tribulations of man have persuaded me that the satisfaction of all desires is completely counterproductive to happiness. Instant and unrestrained gratification is the shortest and most direct route to unhappiness. We have seen in the past years, especially in the most recent eighteen months, one of our leaders, President Harold B. Lee, pursue a most intense course in his efforts to help and bless. Common to both President McKay and President Lee, from my own observation, was the great capacity in each of them to love and to lift. Every contact with another of God's children was for these towering giants neither casual nor perfunctory. So sincere was President McKay's communication with me, even though brief and not frequent, that I was persuaded that President McKay loved me more than he loved anyone else in the whole world. In a foolish moment I told President Brown that I was so convinced of this transcending love that I could not quite understand why President McKay had chosen him and President Tanner to be his counselors, rather than myself. Now the interesting dimension of this feeling was that everyone else with whom I talked, member and nonmember alike, who had a similar contact with President McKay, got precisely the same feeling that I did: in particular, that he loved them more than anyone else in the whole world.<br><br>The radiance and the benevolence of President Kimball and his great capacity for personal relationships are matchless. No one could ever be in the presence of President Kimball and leave without being permanently complimented and strengthened and sustained. So does not the odyssey to happiness lie in a large measure in our capacity to have and be a friend?<br><br>The elusiveness of the "true peace of soul" spoken of by Spinoza lies in a discontent with things--things we have and things we wish we had. In a time when we are both obsessed and sated with the possession and the acquisition of objects, the counsel of Moses seems more needed than ever: "Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's wife, nor his manservant, nor his maidservant, nor his ox, ... nor any thing that is thy neighbor's" (Exodus 20:17). I no longer covet my brother-in-law's big, $10,000, many-horsepowered, gas-eating Cadillac.<br><h2><b>Individuals Who Have Achieved True Happiness</b></h2><br>May I share some experiences of people who have obtained a remarkable felicity in their lives. For well over fifty years our family has been close to little Ella Hoover, who sits down in front of me in a wheelchair with her red cape over her shoulders. She is presently living with a favorite aunt in Delta, Utah. Delta is quite a place. I was born there. It's near Hinckley. It takes Brother Gordon B. Hinckley and all his eloquence to do justice to either Delta or Hinckley. Brother Hinckley says he can't understand why certain Utah towns like Faust, Utah, and Hinckley, Utah, have not prospered as well as some others like Murray and Ogden.<br><br>Ella is a remarkably happy and outgoing woman who is only a little over two feet tall. While still an infant, she was playfully thrown in the air by someone who failed to catch her properly, so that she fell to the ground and suffered injuries which resulted in a permanent deformity to her back and her arms and her legs. Despite these crippling physical deformities, she grew up, went to school, and attended Brigham Young University for a time. Because of the sweetness of her spirit, her great personal charm, her fine intelligence, and her happy disposition, she won the love of and married a completely normal, full-sized man. Through a miracle as great as any miracle that ever happened, she was able to conceive and carry and bear a normal child, whom they named Billy, after his father, and who is also here with us tonight.<br><br>One day before Billy was three, the Bill Hoover family was riding in their car in west Salt Lake County and the tire went flat. The father, Bill Hoover, pulled his car over to the side of the road and got out to check the wheels. In the process, a driver drunk with wine came along and struck the Hoover car and killed Bill Hoover instantly. Somehow this young widow, who never walked a step in her life without pain and without a crutch, raised this son to be an exemplary man. He in turn married and in time became a father in his own right and raised up four grandchildren to the great joy and delight of little Ella Hoover. This remarkable woman, despite all these obstacles, difficulties, and heartaches, is and has been an extremely faithful, well-adjusted, noble woman. Now in her seventies, she blesses the lives of all who meet and know her because she gives so very much of one commodity--herself. Hers has been an odyssey of faith without bitterness, in which she has found great happiness through tears and pain and sorrow.<br><br>Recently, I had the blessing of meeting Patriarch James R. Boone and his wife Ruth in Jacksonville, Florida. Their odyssey to happiness has come through their faithfulness to the redeeming principles of the gospel of Jesus Christ and in being the parents of thirteen children. Four children--David, Elaine, Melinda, and Martha--presently attend this University and may be in this audience. Brother and Sister Boone's happiness was not complete with only thirteen children, so they adopted another one--Sammy, now age three, making fourteen. In their Christmas letter of this year, they said of Sammy, number fourteen, "He is very special, this boy." I was at a conference meeting when Sister Boone was released as president of the stake Relief Society after having served faithfully and well for twelve years. In this family, among the children in one generation, there have been eleven full-time missionaries, and nine of the boys have earned Eagle Scouts, which may be a national record. Patriarch and Sister Boone have great joy and rejoicing in their posterity, who at this point number an even fifty. Time, I am sure, will do much to increase the measure of their joy and rejoicing.<br><br>We are indebted to Dr. Homer Ellsworth for sharing with us two contrasting stories about the happiness of mothers. Often, expectant mothers are so set upon having a boy child or a girl child that when a baby comes with a different sex the mother is temporarily disappointed. Generally, this disappointment is forgotten as soon as the mother cuddles her newborn in her arms for the first time. A few new mothers demonstrate their immaturity for a day or two. One, who wanted a boy baby and happened to receive a girl baby, threw tantrums and objects all over her hospital room for a day or two to show her displeasure. One wise old nurse, when feeding time came, took a baby boy born with a harelip from the nursery and quietly slipped him into the disconsolate mother's arms. The immature mother replied, "This is not my child."<br><br>The wise old nurse said, "Well, it has the right sex. Maybe its mother will be willing to trade babies with you." There followed no more demonstrations of immaturity.<br><br>In contrast, some years ago there was born to a young mother a special child. This child was born without eyes. It was normal in all other respects except there was nothing to resemble eyes or sockets above the nose. This wise mother might in bitterness have said, "Why did this have to happen to my child?" or "Why did this have to happen to me?" Instead she said, "The Lord must really love us and have confidence in us. We really must be favored to have been given this child. To think the Lord picked out our home, knowing how much special love and care this child would need, is very humbling and comforting. We are grateful for this special child and for the blessings it will bring to our home."<br><br>The fox in the story<i>The Little Prince</i>was wiser than he knew when he said, "Now here is my secret, a very simple secret: It is only with the heart that one can see rightly; what is essential is invisible to the eye." The odyssey to happiness lies in the dimension of the heart. Such a journey is made on stepping-stones of selflessness, wisdom, contentment, and faith. The enemies of progress and fulfillment are self-doubt, a poor self-image, self-pity, bitterness, and despair. By substituting simple faith and humility for these enemies we can move rapidly in our journey to true felicity.<br><h2><b>Definitions of Happiness</b></h2><br>Nephi tells us that we must "come down in the depths of humility. ... The things of the wise and the prudent shall be hid ... forever--yea, that happiness which is prepared for the saints" (2 Nephi 9:42–43), which to me is the answer to Spinoza. The Lord, speaking through King Benjamin, reminds us:<br><br><i>I would desire that ye should consider on the blessed and happy state of those that keep the</i><br><br><i>commandments of God. For behold, they are blessed in all things, both temporal and spiritual; and if they hold out faithful to the end they are received into heaven, that thereby they may dwell with God in a state of never-ending happiness.</i>[Mosiah 2:41]<br><br>As one travels around this land and observes the many cultural and recreational activities as advertised on the marquees of the theaters, in the newspapers, and on the television screens, one turns to the meaningful statement of Alma: "They have gone contrary to the nature of God; therefore, they are in a state contrary to the nature of happiness" (Alma 41:11).<br><br>There is much talk these days about the rights of consumers to enjoy products free from defects. The problem is there are too many of us trying to consume happiness rather than generate it. Happiness is not unlike an atomic energy breeder reactor. Deliver to the breeder reactor the energy of three truckloads of coal, and it will return the energy of four or maybe five truckloads of coal. Shakespeare expressed a philosophy in<i>As You Like It</i>which seems commendable: "I am a true labourer: I earn that I eat, get that I wear; owe no man hate, envy no man's happiness; glad of other men's good" (<i>As You Like It</i>, 3.2.65–67). One wise man has said, "Happiness adds and multiplies as we divide it with others" (A. Nielen).<br><br>The relationship of money to happiness is at best questionable. Even the<i>Wall Street Journal</i>acknowledges, "Money is an article which may be used as a universal passport to everywhere except heaven, and as a universal provider of everything except happiness." Henrich Gibson reminds us, "Money may buy the husk of many things, but not the kernel. It brings you food, but not the appetite; medicine, but not health; acquaintances, but not friends; servants, but not faithfulness; days of joy, but not peace or happiness."<br><br>An unknown writer has said:<br><br><i>Success is speaking words of praise,</i><br><i>In cheering other people's ways,</i><br><i>In doing just the best you can</i><br><i>With every task and every plan.</i><br><br><i>It's silence when your speech would hurt,</i><br><i>Lightness when your neighbor's curt.</i><br><i>It's deafness when the scandal flows</i><br><i>And sympathy with others' woes.</i><br><br><i>It's loyalty when duty calls.</i><br><i>It's courage when disaster falls.</i><br><i>It's patience when the hours are long.</i><br><i>It's found in laughter and in song.</i><br><br><i>It's in the silent time of prayer,</i><br><i>In happiness and in despair.</i><br><i>In all of life and nothing less,</i><br><i>We find the thing called success.</i><br><br>The blind Helen Keller reminds us, "Your success and happiness lie in you. External conditions are accidents of life. The great enduring realities are love and service. Joy is the holy fire that keeps our purpose warm and our intelligence aglow. Resolve to keep happy and your joy and you will form an invincible host against difficulty."<br><h2><b>Marriage and Happiness</b></h2><br>It was Seneca who said, "Thou must live for another if thou wishest to live for thyself." Many of our single members of the Church feel that because they are not married they cannot be happy. One noted woman writer, Kathleen Norris, has said, "Marriage is a job. Happiness or unhappiness has nothing to do with it. There never was a marriage that could not be made a success, nor a marriage that could not have ended in bitterness and in failure."<br><br>An unknown author advises, "Success in love consists not so much in marrying the one person who can make you happy, as in escaping the many who could make you miserable." This may sound unkind, but it has a sufficient basis in fact when misery is related to being exposed to traits of selfishness, transgression, immaturity, inconsideration, and brutality in a marriage partner. (I am sure, President Oaks, there are none of these at BYU.)<br><br>Occasionally someone suggests it would be appropriate to have a computer dating program set up under Church auspices, or some kind of a marriage search committee set up so that the Church could more directly be involved in marriage partner selection. This institution is not without some reputation in that regard. My response to such suggestions is that the selection process for eternal companions is so sacred that no one can or should intrude into the making of these choices except the individuals themselves, who should assume and bear that responsibility with divine guidance, parental counsel, and in some cases if necessary the help of a wise bishop.<br><br>For those choice ones among us who think their chances for their odysseys to happiness through marriage are gliding past, I plead with you in the words of Elder Boyd K. Packer:<br><br><i>Now a word to those who want to love and to be loved who are slipping past the usual age for marriage. I am thinking of the many of these lovely, worthy sisters who feel that life is passing them by. Unfortunately, you sometimes feel that way when you are nineteen. These suggestions: Do not give up. Hold to your standards. It may well come to you as a September song and be twice more precious for the waiting.</i><br><br>We know a wonderful sister to whom marriage came as a September song. Her name is Freda Joan Lee.<br><br>Elder Packer continues:<br><br><i>Stay attractive--and I do not mean the cover girl appeal--but attractive in disposition and in attitude and in service. Stay available. Do not be so content with what you do that you cease to care. To some it may not come, but surely there is a compensation that the Lord has in store for the righteous who have held to his standards, but who remain unmarried through no choice of their own.</i><br><h2><b>Prerequisites for Happiness</b></h2><br>In summation, the odyssey to happiness seems to depend almost entirely upon the degree of righteousness to which we attain in terms of the degree of selflessness we acquire, the amount of service we render, and the inner peace which we enjoy. It also hangs to some degree on those loved ones and friends on whose smile and welfare our happiness so much depends--in my case, the members of my family who are here tonight. There are also a host of others, unknown to us personally, within and without the Church, to whose destinies we are bound by ties of common interest and sympathy.<br><br>President Kimball said in<i>The Miracle of Forgiveness</i>:<br><br><i>What is the price of happiness? One might be surprised at the simplicity of the answer. The treasurehouse of happiness is unlocked to those who live the gospel of Jesus Christ in its purity and in its simplicity. Like a mariner without stars, like a traveler without a compass, is the person who moves along through life without a plan. The assurance of supreme happiness, the certainty of a successful life here and of exaltation and eternal life hereafter, comes to those who plan to live their lives in complete harmony with the gospel of Jesus Christ and then consistently follow the course they have set.</i><br><br>I commend to you the 127th Psalm: "Except the Lord build the house, they labor in vain that built it: except the Lord keep the city, the watchman waketh but in vain" (Psalms 127:1).<br><br>Now some who have detoured from the road to peace and happiness have done so through transgression. With all my heart I urge you to see your bishop immediately and clear up any problem, that you may again enjoy a quiet and a peaceful conscience.<br><br>In conclusion, may I suggest even a further distillation or refinement of the elusive and endless quest of being able to live happily every hour, every day of every month, and every year of our lives. The golden pathway which is the most certain and direct route to the happiness which would enrich and bless your life and the lives of others who cross your pathway is your ability to love. The road to happiness is selfless giving of love, the kind of love that has concern and interest and some measure of charity for every living soul. It will require that you show love even for your enemies and seek to give a benediction to them that curse you. "Do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you" (Matthew 5:44). In so doing you will enjoy the love of God himself and be able to soar above and through the ill winds that blow, above the sordid, above the self-defeating and the bitter. You have the promise that "your whole bodies shall be filled with light, and there shall be no darkness in you; and that body which is filled with light comprehendeth all things" (D&amp;amp;C 88:67).<br><br>As a humble servant called to bear witness, I testify to you with all my being that Jesus of Nazareth is the Christ, the Redeemer, and the Savior of the world. Having sat last Thursday in the sacred rooms of the Salt Lake Temple in the presence of a new prophet of God, with the other Brethren, I leave with you the conviction of my soul that Spencer W. Kimball will lead us, if we willingly follow, in the odyssey to happiness and to eternal life. As faithful members of the Church, you are entitled to know that the General Authorities of this Church feel that the mantle of the prophet of God has fallen upon President Kimball, who did not seek it nor want it any more than any who have held that sacred calling. I sustain President Kimball and his stalwart counselors, President Tanner and President Romney, each of whom is so great in his own right and whom I love with all my soul. I also fully sustain President Ezra Taft Benson as the President of the Council of the Twelve, who as you know is a man of great leadership and dedication and who is filled with kindness and humility.<br><br>We all grieve in the loss of our great and beloved leader, President Harold B. Lee. We felt his presence with us and were comforted by it. The spirit of President Lee bears witness to us that we should support and sustain President Spencer W. Kimball and that everything that has been done is in accordance with the mind and the will of the Lord. We also felt in that meeting the spirits of the previous Presidents of the Church, including the Prophet Joseph, and of the Lord sustaining President Kimball in his great calling, to which I testify in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>James E.

<h1>on in the Presidency - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I am pleased and honored to have this privilege of meeting and worshiping with you in your devotional services as you commence the new year. I devoutly and sincerely desire the guidance and enlightenment that comes from the Holy Spirit--first for me, so that I may say what ought to be said and what the Lord would have said on this occasion; and secondly for you, so that your hearts may be open and receptive and so that you may feel the truth and verity of the expressions that will be made.<br><br>President Dallin Oaks has indicated, appropriately, the passing of President Harold B. Lee, one of the great spiritual giants of our dispensation. I would like, if I may properly be guided, to talk to you about succession in the presidency and to let you have a feeling and an understanding of what is involved when the Lord calls a prophet to other spheres of activity.<br><br>Let us begin with the sure and certain conviction in our souls that this is the Lord's work. This is the Lord's church and he is running it. There isn't any question at all about that. As President Oaks indicated, the Lord calls his prophets and the Lord releases his prophets. No prophet can be called by any other power, and no prophet can be released by any other power.<br><br>And so, for reasons that are not wholly and completely known to us, although we do have some vision and understanding of what is involved, on Wednesday, December 26, 1973, the Lord reached forth his hand and touched his servant, President Harold B. Lee. President Lee had been in good health; he had been vigorous and active up to that point in his life. But on that day the Lord said to him: "Come hither. I have other work for you to do in another sphere. I have greater labors and a greater work for you here than you've been doing in mortality."<br><h2>Callings to the Other Side of the Veil</h2><br>Difficult as it is for us to envision fully why President Lee was taken, we have no difficulty in accepting it and in understanding that he is going forward in the Lord's work in another sphere. I would like to read a statement by President Wilford Woodruff relative to the passing of the noble and good and faithful from this life into the labors that await them in the realms ahead. President Woodruff says:<br><br><i>The same Priesthood exists on the other side of the vail</i>[sic]<i>. Every man who is faithful in his quorum here will join his quorum there. When a man dies and his body is laid in the tomb, he does not lose his position. The Prophet Joseph Smith held the keys of this dispensation on this side of the vail, and he will hold them throughout the countless ages of eternity. He went into the spirit world to unlock the prison doors and to preach the Gospel to the millions of spirits who are in darkness, and every Apostle, every Seventy, every Elder, etc., who has died in the faith as soon as he passes to the other side of the vail, enters into the work of the ministry, and there is a thousand times more to preach there than there is here.</i><br><br>I think President Woodruff's next comment has particular application to President Lee's passing:<br><br><i>I have felt of late as if our brethren on the other side of the vail had held a council, and that they had said to this one, and that one, "Cease thy work on earth, come hence, we need help," and they have called this man and that man. It has appeared so to me in seeing the many men who have been called from our midst lately.</i>[<i>Journal of Discourses</i>, 22:333–34]<br><br>When President Lee passed he was attended by President Marion G. Romney, his second counselor, and President Spencer W. Kimball, the President of the Council of the Twelve. President N. Eldon Tanner was in Arizona at the time. Brother Romney, as the representative of and counselor to President Lee, was in complete and total charge at the hospital. He gave President Lee a blessing. He felt the spirit of peace and satisfaction, the calm assurance that whatever eventuated would be right. He did not promise President Lee that he would be healed. The President had become ill very rapidly, just in a matter of hours or moments. Shortly after this blessing, he passed away. At the moment he passed, Brother Romney, in harmony with the system and the established tradition and custom of the Church, stepped aside, and President Spencer W. Kimball was then in complete charge and had total direction. President Kimball was at that moment the senior apostle of God on earth. And as the last heartbeat of President Lee ceased, the mantle of leadership passed to President Kimball, whose next heartbeat was that of the living oracle and presiding authority of God on earth. From that moment the Church continued under the direction of President Kimball.<br><h2>The Established Procedure for Succession</h2><br>It was not required, nor was it requisite or needed, that the Lord give any revelation, that any special direction be given. The law was already ordained and established. God does not look down each morning and say, "The sun shall rise." He has already established the law, he has set the sun in the firmament, and the sun operates in harmony with established law in its rising. And so it was with the transfer of leadership from President Lee to President Kimball.<br><br>When the President of the Church passes on, the First Presidency is disorganized, and the mantle of leadership--the reins of presidency--go to the senior man left and to the Council of the Twelve as a body; in effect the Council of the Twelve then becomes the First Presidency of the Church and so continues unless and until a formal reorganization takes place. These words I read to you from President Joseph F. Smith:<br><br><i>There is always a head in the Church, and if the presidency of the Church are removed by death or another cause, then the next head of the Church is the Twelve Apostles, until a presidency is again organized of three presiding high priests who have the right to hold the office of First Presidency over the Church; and, according to the doctrine laid down by President Wilford Woodruff, who saw the necessity for it, and that of President Lorenzo Snow, if the President should die, his counselors are then released from that presidency, and it is the duty of the Twelve Apostles to proceed at once, in the manner that has been pointed out, to see that the First Presidency is reorganized, so that there may be no deficiency in the working and order of the priesthood in the Church of God.</i>[<i>Conference Report</i>, April 1913, pp. 4–5]<br><br>Harmonious with that policy, that counsel, and that instruction--which has been followed in previous instances--the Council of the Twelve met in the upper room of the Salt Lake Temple on Sunday, December 30, at 3:00 p.m. for the purpose of reorganizing the First Presidency of the Church. Normally in that upper room there are three chairs occupied by the First Presidency and twelve chairs in a semicircle in front of them occupied by the members of the Council of the Twelve. On this occasion, however, there were fourteen chairs in the semicircle, because there were fourteen Brethren present who had been sustained and ordained and set apart as members of the Council of the Twelve.<br><br>We took our places in those chairs, and President Kimball presided in the meeting, which lasted for about 31/2 hours. In the course of this meeting President Kimball explained the business to be transacted, the things that might be done if the Brethren felt so guided and led. He explained that when the Prophet Joseph Smith was martyred, 3 1/2 years went by before President Young was formally chosen and installed as President of the Church. He noted that almost that period went by between President Young and President John Taylor and between President Taylor and President Wilford Woodruff but that in each succeeding instance the time had varied from four to eleven days, and we were meeting on the fourth day after the passing of President Lee.<br><br>He expressed himself as to what should be done, and he said that the proposition to be first considered was whether the First Presidency should then be reorganized or whether the Church should continue to function with the Council of the Twelve as its presiding officers. He then invited each member of the Twelve, commencing with Elder Ezra Taft Benson and continuing around the circle to me, to arise in turn and express himself frankly and fully and freely as to what ought to be done. I'll tell you what in thought-content and substance was said by all of the Brethren on that occasion, but if may, let me preface my statement by reading an account of what happened in the meeting of the Council of the Twelve on the first occasion when they considered the problem of reorganizing the First Presidency of the Church. There have, of course, been eleven such meetings in this dispensation. These words I now read were spoken by Elder Orson Hyde of the Council of the Twelve as he told of the first meeting:<br><br><i>In the month of February, 1848, the Twelve Apostles met at Hyde Park, Pottawattamie County, Iowa, where a small Branch of the Church was established. . . . We were in prayer and council, communing together; and what took place on that occasion? The voice of God came from on high, and spake to the Council. Every latent feeling was aroused, and every heart melted. What did it say unto us? "Let my servant Brigham step forth and receive the full power of the presiding Priesthood in my Church and kingdom." This was the voice of the Almighty unto us at Council Bluffs, before I removed to what was called Kanesville. It has been said by some that Brigham was appointed by the people, and not by the voice of God. I do not know that this testimony has often, if ever, been given to the masses of the people before; but I am one that was present, and there are others here that were also present on that occasion, and did hear and feel the voice from heaven, and we were filled with the power of God. This is my testimony; these are my declarations unto the Saints--unto the members of the kingdom of God in the last days, and to all people.</i><br><br><i>. . . Men, women, and children came running together where we were, and asked us what was the matter. They said that their houses shook, and the ground trembled, and they did not know but that there was an earthquake. We told them that there was nothing the matter--not to be alarmed; the Lord was only whispering to us a little, and that he was probably not very far off. We felt no shaking of the earth or of the house, but were filled with the exceeding power and goodness of God. We knew and realized that we had the testimony of God within us. On the 6<sup>th</sup>day of April following, at our Annual Conference</i>[I might say that on the coming sixth day of April at our annual conference, we'll do precisely what they did here]<i>, held in the Log Tabernacle at Kanesville, the propriety of choosing a man to preside over the Church was investigated. In a very few minutes it was agreed to, and Brigham Young was chosen to fill that place without a dissenting voice, the people not knowing that there had been any revelation touching the matter. They ignorantly seconded the voice of the Lord from on high in his appointment</i>. (Voice from the stand: "That is,<i>Vox Dei, vox populi</i>.")<i>Yes, the voice of God was the voice of the people. Brigham went right ahead, silently, to do the work of the Lord, and to feed his sheep, and take care of them like a faithful shepherd, leaving all vain aspirants to quarrel and contend about lineal descent, right, power, and authority.</i>[<i>Journal of Discourses</i>, 8:233–34]<br><br>That is what transpired the first time that the Council of the Twelve met to reorganize the First Presidency of the Church. And in essence, thought-content, and certainly in spirit, precisely the same thing occurred on the thirtieth day of December last. Each member of the Council in turn, specifically and pointedly, expressed himself to the effect that now was the time to reorganize the First Presidency of the Church, that there should not be further delay, that the effective and proper operation of this great organization that we have from the Lord needed this administrative arrangement. Each one in turn expressed himself that President Spencer W. Kimball was the man whom the Lord wanted to preside over the Church; there was no question whatever about that. There was total and complete unity and harmony. The prayer that was in the heart of every person present was "Lord, show unto thy servants whom thou hast chosen to be President of the Church." We did not want to do anything other than what the Lord wanted done.<br><br>President Young is quoted as having said, following the death of the Prophet, "I don't care who presides in the Church. All I want to know is what the Lord thinks about it." The Lord made manifest his will in that day, and that's all we wanted to know for our day. And when we met for this most recent reorganization, the Lord made manifest his will to us. It was as though the voice of God had said to each one of us individually and to all of us collectively: "Let my servant Spencer step forth and receive the full power of the presiding priesthood in my Church and kingdom."<br><h2><b>The Ordination of President Kimball</b></h2><br>And so after there had been full expression and consideration, Elder Ezra Taft Benson, the next one in seniority to President Kimball, made the formal motion that the First Presidency of the Church be reorganized; that President Spencer W. Kimball be sustained, ordained, and set apart as the President of the Church; as the prophet, seer, and revelator to the Church; and as the Trustee-in-Trust. This motion was adopted unanimously.<br><br>At this point President Kimball made a speech of acceptance--a very sweet, humble, appropriate expression. In the course of our meeting he had explained, as he did at President Lee's funeral, that no man had prayed more sincerely and devoutly, with more feeling and desire, for the life, vigor, health, and continued spiritual and physical prosperity of President Lee than he had done. But President Kimball was willing to accept the will of the Lord and the mantle of leadership that had fallen upon him.<br><br>At this point, he chose his first counselor, President N. Eldon Tanner, who responded appropriately and sweetly; he then chose President Marion G. Romney to be the second, who similarly responded. Following these appointments, Brother Benson was sustained as the President of the Council of the Twelve. And then all those present placed their hands upon the head of President Kimball, and he was ordained and set apart, with President Benson being mouth, to serve as President of the Church and as the prophet, seer, and revelator for this time and this season.<br><br>Now President Lee has passed away. He was a great spiritual giant, a prince in Israel, someone to whom we looked with unbounded admiration. Few men have lived in our day who have had more direct contact with the Lord, who have felt the spirit of inspiration and who have been able to convey the mind and will of the Lord to his people as well as President Lee has done. We had supposed, not knowing the providences of the Lord, that President Lee would be with us for a long time. But there are two things we should note in his call to go elsewhere. One is that the Lord has another work for him to do, and it is a greater and more extensive work than what he was presently assigned to do. The Lord, in his infinite wisdom and goodness, knows what ought to be done with his servants. The other thing to note is that when the Lord calls a new prophet he does it because he has a work and a labor and a mission for the new man to perform.<br><br>I can suppose that when the Prophet Joseph Smith was taken from this life the Saints felt themselves in the depths of despair. To think that a leader of such spiritual magnitude had been taken from them! Our revelation says, "Joseph Smith, the Prophet and Seer of the Lord, has done more, save Jesus only, for the salvation of men in this world, than any other man that ever lived in it" (D&amp;amp;C 135:3). We do not have language or capacity or ability to extol the greatness and the glory of the ministry and mission of the Prophet Joseph Smith. And yet when he was taken the Lord had Brigham Young. Brigham Young stepped forth and wore the mantle of leadership. With all respect and admiration and every accolade of praise resting upon the Prophet Joseph, still Brigham Young came forward and did things that then had to be done in a better way than the Prophet Joseph himself could have done them.<br><br>Now, no one can say too emphatically or too strongly or praise too highly the leadership of President Lee, but this is a forward-looking Church. We do not look backward. We do not do other than go forward and onward. Our destiny is to proclaim the everlasting gospel into every ear. This Church will roll on until the knowledge of God covers the earth as the waters cover the sea. And so we look to the future. We now look to a new prophet who will wear the mantle of leadership and who will, with dignity and honor and inspiration and with the guidance of heaven, do things that are appointed for his time and his season that no one else could have done. The Lord's hand is in the work, and Spencer Kimball is the prophet of God, the mouthpiece of the Almighty for the time and the season that are appointed ahead. God grant that it may be extensive and long and that we may continue to get the inspiration and guidance that come through his newly appointed servant.<br><h2><b>Keys of Presidency</b></h2><br>Now, this is the pattern; this is the system. Succession in the presidency happens in an orderly and systematized way, because the Lord has conferred upon the members of the Council of the Twelve all of the keys and powers and authorities that have ever been held in any dispensation or any age of the past. Every key is given to each apostle who is set apart a member of the Council of the Twelve. But because keys are the right of presidency, they lie dormant, as it were, in each man unless and until he becomes the senior apostle and is thus in a position of presidency to direct the labors and the work of all others. Therefore succession occurs, as it were, automatically.<br><br>Let me turn again to Wilford Woodruff, who spoke so eloquently and accurately on this, and let you feel, as I read, the spirit of that great prophet and the message he gave:<br><br><i>We had had our endowments; we had had all the blessings sealed upon our heads that were ever given to the apostles or prophets on the face of the earth. On that occasion the Prophet Joseph rose up and said to us: "Brethren, I have desired to live to see this temple built. I shall never live to see it, but you will. I have sealed upon your heads all the keys of the kingdom of God. I have sealed upon you every key, power, principle that the God of heaven has revealed to me. Now, no matter where I may go or what I may do, the kingdom rests upon you."</i><br><br><i>. . . "But," he said, after having done this, "ye apostles of the Lamb of God, my brethren, upon your shoulders this kingdom rests; now you have got to round up your shoulders and bear off the kingdom." And he also made this very strange remark, "If you do not do it you will be damned.". . .</i><br><br><i>When the Lord gave the keys of the kingdom of God, the keys of the Melchizedek Priesthood, of the apostleship, and sealed them upon the head of Joseph Smith, he sealed them upon his head to stay here upon the earth until the coming of the Son of Man. Well might Brigham Young say, "The keys of the kingdom of God are here." They were with him to the day of his death. They then rested upon the head of another man--President John Taylor. He held those keys to the hour of his death. They then fell by turn, or in the providence of God, upon Wilford Woodruff.</i><br><br><i>I say to the Latter-day Saints, the keys of the kingdom of God are here, and they are going to stay here, too, until the coming of the Son of Man. Let all Israel understand that. They may not rest upon my head but a short time, but they will then rest on the head of another apostle, and another after him, and so continue until the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ in the clouds of heaven to "reward every man according to the deeds done in the body." . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . I say to all Israel at this day, I say to the whole world, that the God of Israel, who organized this Church and kingdom, never ordained any President or Presidency to lead it astray. Hear it, ye Israel, no man who has ever breathed the breath of life can hold these keys of the kingdom of God and lead the people astray.</i>[<i>Discourses of Wilford Woodruff</i>, ed. G. Homer Durham (Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1946), pp. 72–74]<br><h2><b>The Destiny of the Church</b></h2><br>And that conclusion of President Woodruff's is implicit in the eternal decree that the gospel is to roll forth, that the Church is to remain, that this time there will never be apostasy, but that we are preparing a people for the second coming of the Son of Man. Let me read you the words that the Lord said to Joshua when Moses was taken:<br><br><i>There shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life: as I was with Moses, so I will be with thee: I will not fail thee, nor forsake thee.</i><br><br><i>Be strong and of a good courage.</i>[Joshua 1:5–6]<br><br>Now, in effect, the Lord has said that to Spencer W. Kimball. And as the Lord was the President Harold B. Lee, so he will be with his newly called servant--that humble and sweet and gracious and wonderful man, President Spencer W. Kimball. The problem is not one of what happens where the Church is concerned. The destiny of the Church is guaranteed and assured. The only problem that ever can arise is with individuals--whether individuals will walk in the light and do the things that they must do to be in harmony with the Church and to reap and inherit its blessings.<br><br>I have attempted very simply and informally to recite to you what took place and to recount and set forth the principle that is involved. What I have said is true and accurate. It is proper and it is appropriate that these things should be known to us. Now I think every one of us needs to know in his heart of the truth and divinity of the work and have a testimony and assurance that what has gone forward is right and is the mind and will of the Lord. All of the Twelve have that. That is the beginning. It spreads forth from them to all Israel. I bear testimony because the Holy Spirit of God has revealed it to my soul that President Spencer W. Kimball is the Lord's anointed for the time and season ahead. And because God is no respecter of persons, everyone in the Church who will get on his knees and ask the Lord for guidance and direction will receive identically that same knowledge, that same assurance, and that same understanding. And those who have this assurance will have a foundation for continued righteousness and devotion and for that course of conduct which brings peace in this life and eternal life in the world to come, which may God grant for all of us in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Bruce R. McConkie was a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when this devotional address was given at Brigham Young University on 8 January 1974.</i></i><br><br><i>© Intellectual Reserve, Inc.

<h1>erspectives - Neal A. Maxwell - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I commend Brigham Young University for its special commitment to family life, reflected not only by this special week of substance and counsel, and not only by its continuing curricular concern and the nearly unique College of Family Living but also for the commitment to the family by this University expressed in so many other ways. Other universities and colleges teach about the family, but sometimes others view the family as a transitory, economic unit in human history--not as an eternal unit. Curricula elsewhere deal with the need for certain skills in family life (which none of us doubts) and with the interrelationships among humans who are temporarily collected as families--but not with individuals as eternal realities. This University and its College of Family Living act from an entirely different point of view and even though the form may parallel the academic form elsewhere, the operating assumptions and the theological foundations produce a deep and pervasive commitment to the family, making what happens on this campus unique.<br><br>I am grateful for the faculty and students alike at this University, who understand the tandem relationship between theology and identity, between family and eternity. At this University there is coequal concern with that nutrition pertaining to the body and that nutrition pertaining to the spirit. We certainly share with the secular world concern over diets required for our physical health, but we also assert to a sick and undernourished world that a divine diet has been prescribed for the soul of man, and further, that the primary source of his succor should be the family.<br><h2><b>Divine Revelation About the Family</b></h2><br>In 1902 President Joseph F. Smith said that it is "family life, on which the government of the Church is based and perpetuated" ("Editor's Table,"<i>Improvement Era</i>5 [February 1902]: 308–9). I know of no parallel institutional commitment to the family anywhere else in the world. The prophets of the Church have all drawn on the same divine well; therefore, their doctrines and teachings are the same. Seers see not only farther but deeper than other men, taking into account the relationships of truths and realities. Our late President, Harold B. Lee, counseled us with the same kind of specificity when he said, ". . . remember that the most important of the Lord's work that you will ever do will be the work you do in the walls of your own home" ("Strengthening the Home," p. 7). It is significant that the summation of his counsel focused, again, on the family and on the home.<br><br>President Spencer W. Kimball focused on the family as he offered this advice: "I like to compare the home evening, family prayer, and other associated activities of the Church for the saving of the family, when they are conscientiously carried out, with an umbrella. If the umbrella is not opened up, it is little more than a cane and can give little protection from the storms of nature. . . . The umbrella spread out makes the silken material taut. When the rain falls, it runs off; when the snow falls, it slides off; when the hail comes, it bounces off; when the wind blows, it is diverted around the umbrella" (<i>Conference Report</i>, October 1969, p. 23).<br><br>We are at a point in human history when, unfortunately, it is no longer merely sprinkling; the rains have begun to fall, and at this very point in history, ironically, many umbrellas are being folded up and put away.<br><h2><b>Secular Fallacies About the Family</b></h2><br>Isn't it ironical that some of those who are most vigorous in taking the American family apart are also among those who are the first to complain because, then, the family does not work? Isn't it ironical that in an age when we are learning almost feverishly about what is most ecologically sound, what are the most efficient and economic ways to produce energy or protein in order to help other human beings, that we should be so incredibly blind--because like ancient Judah, we are "looking beyond the mark"--when it comes to pursuing those processes which are best for the production of good human beings? The relative spiritual, as well as the physiological efficiencies of systems are a justifiable concern. Beef cattle foraging on a poor range require twenty pounds of food in order to produce one pound of gain. Chickens with a good balanced diet produce one pound of gain for every two pounds of feed. One approach is many times more efficient than the other, just as (so far as human goodness is concerned) the social and spiritual sum of our political, educational, and economic institutions is usually not sufficient to offset the deficits in the home.<br><br>Analogously, we have far too many lonely humans foraging on deficient "homesteads" and too many governmental programs which attempt abortively to substitute a less efficient system of helping humans than the home; it is the home that we must rescue, repair, and sustain. Only when homes are full of truth, warmth, and trust, can our other institutions perform their tasks, and when too many homes are defective, then the deterioration becomes contagiously interinstitutional, affecting schools and governments. If we are really concerned about the most economical way of achieving happiness for ourselves and/or our fellowmen and about those skills that are needed in successful human enterprises, then we should seek these gains through the family, with the help, of course, of other institutions. Otherwise, we shall always be investing dollars and hopes in less efficient ways of helping mankind. Just as the wheel does not have to be reinvented perpetually, we do not have to reinvent the family, a divine institution.<br><br>Yet so many fail to hear the crash of the surf of statistics generated by an abundance of research about the importance of early life and of family influence. There is in the secular world either a failure to generalize from the research or, when generalizations emerge, the generalizations are not acted upon. It is almost as if the secular world condemned itself to act like Sisyphus, who was condemned to roll a huge boulder to the edge of the mountain top only to have it come tumbling back down whereupon the process is repeated endlessly. Indeed, the sincere Sisyphus syndrome is all about us. The eternalism approach of the gospel of Jesus Christ lays great stress, for instance, on the innocence of the newborn and on the importance of helping that individual "streamlet," nearest its source, so it can achieve identity and maintain purity. Secularism, on the other hand, tends to become fascinated with building vast purification plants downstream; but, ironically, secularists have difficulty agreeing on what dirt is--on what is to be filtered out.<br><br>If you prefer a different analogy, we are witnesses to a rather bizarre game of human chess in which there is strange value placed on the various pieces on the chess game. The kings and queens, the parents, are thought of as being inconsequential; the castles, or homes, get traded off for pawns with great casualness; the bishops, which might represent religion, remain largely unused in responding to the challenge. Yet, in the midst of this strange pattern of play, the world wonders why it cannot checkmate human misery.<br><br>While more research and information are almost always desirable, how much more research do we need before we begin to accept the realities of how, almost relentlessly, parental patterns are projected into their posterity? How much more research do we need with regard to the sources and the importance of self-esteem? There is an ecology that pertains to the world of man's spirit and his self-esteem. We must begin to think about the deprivation of the individual storehouse of self-esteem as a vital community concern. We have a stake in each other's self-esteem.<br><br>How much more research does the world need before we can accept parents as pivotal and before we focus on the family without apology and half-heartedness? Of course, there are rogue parents just as there are rogue policemen. Of course, there are some people, through no fault of their own, who do not marry. Of course, there are some, who, through no fault of their own, experience defective and broken homes, but these exceptions are not reasons for abandoning this remarkable resource, the family. The family is the tilt point for a vast number of souls who can go either way--to alienation and anger or to sweetness and service.<br><h2><b>Latter-day Saints to Preserve Truths About the Family</b></h2><br>Alas, it may be true that those who do not believe in God, who is a loving parent and who is the Father of the human family, will also never be able to accept the eternal importance of the institution of the family, except as something that is socially useful--little wonder we arrive at different conclusions or that we have different priorities. How important, therefore, it is that we remain at our posts as sentries over doctrines and teachings like that concerning the family, even if the world in its mistaken, but sincere way, seems to be headed in entirely different directions. The Latter-day Saints ought to understand, for instance, that the wars of tomorrow are this day being forged in the overheated families of today. How many dictators or assassins do we need to study in order to understand the consequences of distortion in the home? How many more examples do we need, including the energy crisis, where a few control the resources needed by many, before realizing that food and fiber are not the real challenge? Rather, it is selfishness and our human delivery systems. And where, indeed, can one learn, first-hand, selflessness and sharing? In the home, where such skills and attitudes tend to be learned, if they are learned at all.<br><br>Many citizens today, for instance, are alarmed, and rightfully so, when they see a vast oil slick develop which may be headed for the habitat of wildlife or a culinary water resource. Isn't it interesting that only the seers seem to be able to see the approaching tide of effluence flowing from parental permissiveness that is now in the process of engulfing so many? So few other voices are raised in alarm. The ears of the secular world are attuned to the messages that come from the Paul Reveres, not the prophets. There appear to be so many Paul Reveres riding about, issuing so many jeremiads and warnings, that the crucial warnings are being drowned out.<br><br>Isn't it interesting that at a time when we ought to know better about the limitations of what legislation can do to change human behavior, that some women prefer legal power to righteous influence? Some may choose to ignore or to rechannel the maternal instinct, but they cannot rise above it. Isn't it interesting that the secular world now directs our attention (with certain justifications to be sure) to the unmet needs of women, when the most common tragedy in the modern home is the malfunctioning father who so often leaves his post untended and who is so often insensitive to the needs of his wife? Isn't it interesting with regard to the matter of individual fulfillment, a natural and basic human need, that some fail to observe that one of the great advantages of being fulfilled is that one does not have to spend all of his or her time thinking about being fulfilled? Those I know and admire, who have deep and abiding testimonies, do show differences in certain preferences and in some dimension of their life-styles, but on things that really matter, they are incredibly alike!<br><br>Isn't it interesting that at a time when patriotism is called into question, that some fail to realize that one cannot really have a sense of country without a sense of kinship, that one cannot have a sense of kinship without family, and one cannot have a sense of family without parents?<br><br>Isn't it interesting that in a time when we want to demand increasing accountability from each other that so many fail to realize that no deep-seated sense of accountability can exist without reference to absolute values and truths, such as the brotherhood of man?<br><br>Isn't it, of course, simply that the gospel of Jesus Christ contains all the correct principles for human conduct, but it is also the way in which these principles are interwoven with each other. Secularism so often seizes upon a single true principle and elevates it above all others. This act of isolation does not make the principle seized upon any less true, but to isolate any principle is to make it monastic. How many today live within the prison of just one principle? Elevating any correct principle to the plane of a religion is poor policy; just as one person makes a poor church, one principle makes a poor religion. Principles can become "prodigal" as well as people and can be estranged in "a far country" and be "spent" with little to show.<br><br>Most every secular cause about which I know anything at all usually focuses on a single principle or concern, but it is an act of isolation, not of correlation. It is the orthodox orchestration of the many principles found in the gospel of Jesus Christ that is necessary for human happiness. One would be amused at the so-called new "moral geometry" with its alien angles, fluid lines, and restless unfixed points, if the human consequences were not so tragic.<br><br>Insofar as he has it, where does man suppose he gets his inborn sense of righteous indignation anyway? And if our sense of righteous indignation does not rest on some divine moral absolutes, why should anyone pay any attention to us? When he sees the imperfections all around him, the disciple of Jesus sees such imperfections as an invitation to help. But for those who see life, man, and the universe (without looking through the lens of the gospel), imperfection means rejection. When we hate ourselves, the defects of others loom especially large. Where better can we learn how to forgive, how to love, and how to cope with our failures than at home? Strategically speaking, the choices are clear: family or anomie!<br><br>Isn't it ironical that those who have been described as the "new impuritans" in their iconoclasmania not only reject the existence of God but also the existence of Satan himself, and, in their celebration of sensual things, they end up in the employ of the very adversary whose existence they scoff at? The great trap is sprung because Satan's most powerful desire is that "all men might be miserable like unto himself." However few we may be, we must hold up to the world the true picture of mankind, "things as they really are" and "as they really are to come."<br><br>We can best learn that we are children of God by experiencing that kind of relationship and teaching in the home; we can best learn in the home that we are important, that we matter, and that there are at least some others who love us.<br><br>Those who have not known love are more likely to have a special struggle accepting the existence of a God whose greatest attribute is his love and all of whose laws hang on the first two commandments with their high requirement of love. Those who have not known forgiveness are more apt to have difficulty forgiving others. Those who have never had to be accountable will have greater difficulty learning to be accountable themselves and are apt to be more shrill in the demand about the accountability of others. Those who have not been trusted will find it more difficult to trust others. Those who have not known peace, both in their homes and in their souls, will find it more difficult to fashion a world in which there is peace, because conflict will seem so normal. Those who do not know specifically what the conditions of righteousness are as described by God will find it more difficult to become righteously indignant at the human conditions that do cry out for change. Those who have not known the rigors of repentance in family life are less apt to be able to cope with the stress of change.<br><br>Several years ago, an astute friend of mine, Dr. Jack Adamson, concluded a commencement address by recalling John Milton's phrase concerning England's legendary image about how St. Michael, the warrior, would appear off Cornwall to save England from her external menaces, chiefly Spain. Milton's counsel was that the angel, and England, had for too long been looking seaward, for England was soon to be engulfed in a civil war. Milton's poetic plea was: "Look homeward, angel, now and with pity and compassion." That counsel is appropriate for Americans, and others, today in yet another sense--for too long we have looked outside ourselves, and beyond our homes, in trying to improve the human conditions. But the message of poets, as well as prophets, is "Look homeward, now!" That we may do so I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Neal A.

<h1>r Great Days - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
As your great President and my very good friend was saying some of those very nice things, I thought about a man who once said to his wife, "How many really great men do you think there are in the world?"<br><br>She said, "I don't know. But I am sure of this: that there is one less than you think there is."<br><br>George Bernard Shaw said that he never made speeches for the speeches-dev. He made speeches for the introductions. Now, I'm not sure what kind of a speech you're about to get, but I think the introduction was well worth my coming down here to receive.<br><br>As I have been sitting here looking out into your faces, I have thought of something that probably most of you would not believe, and that is that fifty years ago I was as young as some of you are. If I'd like to frighten you a little bit, and I would like to frighten you a little bit, I would suggest that if you live for the next fifty years some of you may be as old as I am. But what I'd like to say to you today involves what is going to happen in your lives in between those two important periods.<br><br>While I am speaking of my antiquity, I would like to have you remember that when I was born the Wright brothers had not yet made their famous sixty-second flight from Kill Devil Hill in Kittyhawk, North Carolina. In those days, substantially, there were no automobiles or telephones or radios or atomic bombs or a great many other things that make up our present world. And then I'd like to point you in the other direction and see what kind of a world it is that you are going to have a part in just a few years from now and how you can best prepare to meet it.<br><br>Before I leave the subject of my old age, I would like to tell you a story I heard Brother Hugh B. Brown tell some time ago. His granddaughter had said to him, "Grandpa, were you in the ark?"<br><br>Brother Brown replied, "No, of course I wasn't in the ark."<br><br>And she said, "Well, then, why weren't you drowned?"<br><br>I thought that this morning I would like to discuss with you some of the life experiences that you might expect that involve the four most important days in your life. Somebody said the four most important days in your life are these: number one is the day you are born; number two is the day you are married; number three is the day you select your life's work; and number four is the day you die.<br><h2><b>The Day You Are Born</b></h2><br>I'd like to involve myself a little bit personally in each of these as we go along. The most important accomplishment in my life is that I was successful in getting myself born. I am just awfully pleased about that, and my pleasure increases a little each year as I go along. One of the most important things about the moment of birth is that it is an unconscious moment. Nobody knows at the time he is being born that this important event is actually taking place. And sometimes we don't find it out until quite a long time afterwards. Sometimes we never do find out that we have been born. The other day I heard someone say of his friend that he didn't know that he was alive. Actually, in many cases that is pretty close to the truth.<br><br>There are a lot of important things in life that happen which we are not aware of when they're actually taking place. Sometime after I was born, I discovered that I had inherited two wonderful people called parents. They were pretty poor, and we sometimes had a pretty hard time in getting along. But I discovered that there are some advantages even in that situation. Somebody said that one of the greatest disadvantages anyone can have in life is to have too many advantages. And there are some advantages in having some disadvantages. Somebody put this idea in verse under the title of "Adversity." He said:<br><br><i>The tree that never had to fight</i><br><i>For sun and sky and air and light,</i><br><i>But stood out in the open plain</i><br><i>And always got its share of rain,</i><br><i>Never became a forest king</i><br><i>But lived and died a scrubby thing.</i><br><br><i>The man who never had to toil</i><br><i>To gain and farm his patch of soil,</i><br><i>Who never had to win his share</i><br><i>Of sun and sky and light and air,</i><br><i>Never became a manly man</i><br><i>But lived and died as he began.</i><br><br><i>Good timber does not grow with ease.</i><br><i>The stronger wind, the stronger trees.</i><br><i>The further sky, the greater length.</i><br><i>The more the storm, the more the strength.</i><br><i>By sun and cold, by rain and snow,</i><br><i>In trees and men good timbers grow.</i><br><br><i>Where thickest lies the forest growth</i><br><i>We find the patriarchs of both.</i><br><i>And they hold counsel with the stars,</i><br><i>Whose broken branches show the scars</i><br><i>Of many winds and much of strife.</i><br><i>This is the common law of life.</i><br><br>[Author unknown]<br><br>It was some time after I was born that I discovered that I had been born an American. How grateful I am that I was born in this wonderful country, where God raised up wise men to write our Constitution and where we had such men as our founding fathers to stand in the forefront of our civilization and give our nation its start toward its destiny, instead of having men who use Stalin blood purges, Hitler gas ovens, and Castro indignities as instruments of government.<br><br>As Joshua was about to cross over the River Jordan to establish his people in their promised land, which was already in a full state of cultivation, the Lord said to the people: "And thou shalt inhabit cities which thou didst not build. And thou shalt eat from the vines which thou hast not planted. And thou shalt drink from wells which thou didst not dig" (see Deuteronomy 6:10–11). There isn't anyone in this audience who isn't in that same situation. All of you inhabit cities which you did not build. Every Latter-day Saint eats from vines which he did not plant. Every American drinks from wells which he did not dig. And every one of us shares in a million different blessings that he had no part in producing. The Lord said something else to the children of Israel that we ought to think about. He said, "When thou shalt have eaten and be full; then beware lest thou forget the Lord" (Deuteronomy 6:11–12). There are always great benefits in remembering the source of our blessings.<br><br>When I was nearly eight years old, someone taught me this great truth proclaimed by Jesus that everyone should be born again. And so, on August 27, 1911, I was born of the water and of the spirit in exactly the meaning of the term as indicated by Jesus. I was also confirmed a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.<br><h2><b>Intellectual Rebirth</b></h2><br>If we had two or three hours to talk about it, we might enumerate some of the tremendous advantages that we have in being members of the Church and in doing those things that the Lord has indicated would be for our benefit. We have a lot of other opportunities as well. I have discovered as I have gone along in life that you can be born again as many times as you would like to be born. Someone asked Phillips Brooks one time, "When were you born?"<br><br>He said, "I'll tell you about it. It was one Sunday afternoon about three-thirty when I was twenty-five years old, just after I had finished reading a great book." You are here at this great University for several purposes, but one of them is to involve yourselves in a love for and a knowledge of great books. And you ought to be born again a great many times as a consequence. You are involved with a large number of great teachers and important philosophies which will also help you to be born again.<br><br>I'd like to tell you about one of the most pleasant and most productive experiences of my life. 1n 1943, as the Japanese war was coming to an end, I heard Dr. Adam S. Bennion give a lecture on the value of great literature. You can sell the idea of the value of great ideas to anyone; that is, everyone believes that we should be acquainted with great human thought. But almost everyone gets away from its benefit by saying that he doesn't have time to read. To get away from this objection of not having time, Dr. Bennion said, "Suppose that you were going to be a prisoner in a Japanese concentration camp for the next four years and you could take with you the works of any ten authors. Which would you take and what would you expect to get out of them?" That is, what are the values of great ideas, of great literature? His idea was that you take the ten authors you would most like to resemble and then exhaust each one in turn. You would read every thought and consider every idea that each author had ever thought; you would rethink his every idea. The psychologists say that when you run an idea through your brain it makes a little groove or engram. If you run through your mind the kind of ideas that went through the mind of Shakespeare or Emerson or the apostle Paul or Moses or Jesus of Nazareth, then your brain would tend to respond as their brains did.<br><br>From someplace I got the courage to make the start. I guess Shakespeare comes fairly close to the top of most people's lists of great authors. So I got out Shakespeare's thirty-seven plays, his sonnets, and his poems and went to work. Reading them was pretty difficult at first. I read very slowly and perhaps not very comprehendingly. Shakespeare wrote a long time ago, and there were many things that I did not understand. I had to reread some things several times, look up their meanings, and ask people about them. But finally the clouds began to part, a little bit of the sunlight began to come through, and I had a tremendous experience with Shakespeare. Shakespeare looked with clearer insight into human life than do most men. He said his purpose in writing was to hold the mirror up to life, to show virtue her own image and scorn her own likeness. He said, "I your looking-glass will be and will modestly discover to yourself qualities which you yourself know not of." I had a great uplift as I read his great speeches and his great arguments for success. And as he pictured life in miniature with his great characters acting and reacting upon each other, I was born again--a great many times. Each time we discover some inspiring thought, we can be born again and we can be born better.<br><br>I always read with my pen, marking every idea, every phrase, every quote, and every other thing that I think will help me. And then I put these thoughts into my notebooks. One of my most valuable possessions in the world is my collection of twenty-five notebooks. They are just regular 8 1/2-by-11-inch page size, three-ring binders with about three hundred pages in each one, so I have seventy-five hundred pages of notes. I think of my reading as a combine harvester sweeping across a field of wheat. It cuts everything before it but throws out the weeds and the chaff and the straw and puts the wheat in the sack. If I were now going to read something that would be particularly exciting to me, it wouldn't be Shakespeare, it wouldn't be Emerson, it wouldn't even be the scriptures. It would be my notes, because I have selected for my notes those things that particularly inspire me.<br><br>I have always felt a little bit cheated in my life that no one has ever tried to talk me out of my faith. I have heard many people say that they got into the wrong crowd or listened to the wrong professor or were influenced by the wrong philosophy. But everywhere I have gone, people have encouraged me to live my religion more instead of less. Once I thought that maybe I believed as I do just because I didn't know any better, so I got the complete works of Robert G. Ingersoll. In my opinion, Robert G. Ingersoll was the "greatest" atheist, if you could use that term, that ever lived in the world. I don't know how convincing other people's atheism is, but Robert G. Ingersoll was a great salesman. He was a great orator. He was a great architect of speech. He knew how to put ideas together. If anybody could persuade me about something, I think maybe it would have been Robert G. Ingersoll. His complete works are made up of 19,900 pages. There are 214 pages in my New Testament, so I read 90 new testaments of atheism. I didn't read his works to try to outargue him or to find fault with them. I read them actually to try to help him persuade me that there was something better than those things that I believed. I read him very carefully. I don't skip read; I don't jump over things or just read things that I think would be interesting. If something is important enough for him to write down, it is important enough for me to study and to try to find out the right answer to the subject discussed. And in all of my experiences in reading his work, he hasn't shaken my faith in the smallest degree. Since that time, I have read 987 of the great books, and I have had some tremendous experiences in a lot of different directions with what I have read. These great new philosophies have enabled me to be born again.<br><h2><b>The Day You Are Married</b></h2><br>Then we come to the second important event, which takes place on the day you are married. We have the opportunity in our lives to enter into the covenant of marriage. Many years ago, I was very fortunate in finding a wonderful person who agreed to go to the temple of the Lord with me. We established a family relationship; we acquired some children and some grandchildren. We had a little dinner party last night, as we frequently do, where we had a wonderful time together. In all of the time of our marriage, I have never discovered one occasion when my wife ever tried to deceive me or to be unfair or to do any other thing that would be dishonorable. I am very grateful for her and for the fact that we have a relationship which hopefully will continue throughout all of eternity. You study a lot at this great University and elsewhere about the importance of marriage and how to make the most of it, so I will not take the time to discuss it further here except to say that you must not do or say anything that would cast any kind of limiting shadow over that all-important event.<br><h2><b>The Day You Select Your Life's Work</b></h2><br>Now we come to the third important day of your life--the day you choose your occupation. That is another of the reasons you live. That is another of the reasons you come here to school. The Church is a divine institution, but the government is also a divine institution. The scripture says, "governments were instituted of God for the benefit of man; and . . . he [the Lord] holds men accountable for their acts in relation to them" (D&amp;amp;C 134:1).<br><br>But your occupation is also a divine institution. When God was creating this earth, he covered it over with sixteen inches of a miraculous substance called topsoil, in which he put all of the elements necessary to provide our food, our clothing, our medicines, and all of the things necessary to provide for our needs. When the Lord did this, he was laying the foundation for our great agricultural industry. He himself planted the garden eastward in Eden, and he became the first horticulturist. The Lord also established the livestock industry. When he taught Adam and Eve how to make coats out of skins, he was founding the tailoring industry. When he loaded our earth with minerals and metals and oils, he was establishing our mining and manufacturing and transportation industries. There are many other sciences and services necessary for our welfare.<br><br>On one occasion, Elbert Hubbard said that business is the process of ministering to human needs. Therefore, said he, business is essentially a divine calling. When the farmer grew the tomatoes that helped to provide you with your breakfast this morning, he was ministering to a human need. Therefore, he's entitled to say that he is engaged in a divine occupation. I went to the hospital some few years ago and received nine blood transfusions. The hospital was ministering to a human need; therefore, it is entitled to say that it is engaged in a divine calling. As you prepare at this great University to take hold of your share of the work of the world, I would like to have you think of your studies in that way and do them in that spirit.<br><h2><b>The Day You Die</b></h2><br>Then we come to the final one of these great experiences, which takes place on the day you die. Someone said that the most important event in life is death. We live to die, and then we die to live. Death is our graduation day. It is the gateway to eternal life. We don't like to think about death because we think of it as unpleasant, and we don't like to think about unpleasant things. And so we close our minds and turn away our faces. But death does not cease to exist just because it is ignored. The ancient Egyptians had a much more logical way of handling this situation when on their great festive occasions they kept constantly on display before the revelers the skeleton of a dead man; that is, they wanted everybody to continually remember that someday he was going to die. I don't want to frighten any member of this student body unnecessarily, but I'd just like to point out to you as kindly and as gently as I can that someday every one of you is going to die. Somebody said, "Judging from the past, there are going to be very few of us who will get out of this world alive." One man, in preparing an inscription for his tombstone, said, "I knew it would happen!"<br><br>If we can understand far enough in advance that we will die, there are quite a lot of things that we can do to make the experience more favorable. The death hour is the key hour. It judges all of the other hours; that is, you could never have written the life story of Jesus of Nazareth or Judas Iscariot without knowing about his last hour. It is important that this graduation day should be a great day.<br><br>Some time ago, I reread the old Grecian tragedy written about the fall of Athens. You may remember that a Roman general had captured an Athenian philosopher and the Roman told the Athenian that he meant to put him to death. But the Athenian didn't seem very disturbed, so the Roman thought that probably he had not understood. The Roman said to the Athenian that maybe he did not know what it meant to die. But the Athenian said that he thought he understood it better than the Roman did. Then he said to the Roman, "Thou dost not know what it means to die, for thou dost not know what it means to live. To die is to begin to live. It is to end all stale and weary work, to begin a nobler and a better. It is to leave deceitful knaves for the society of gods and goodness."<br><br>Death is the time when we begin to live. One of the reasons that you are at this great University is to learn how to live--to learn how to live eternally. I do not know what it would be like if sometime we discovered that we had become telestial beings. I do know that it would be as far below the celestial as the twinkle of a tiny star is below the blaze of the noonday sun.<br><br>I thought I discovered up in western Canada the other day what it would be like to ride in a telestial automobile. A missionary took me to one of my appointments in an automobile that he had purchased two years previously for sixty dollars. Having driven it for two years, he was using it to take me to my appointment. We hadn't gone very far before I noticed that there was smoke coming out of both the front and the rear of this machine. I heard some noises that I had never identified before as those coming from an automobile, and when we were safely at our destination, I was very pleased that the experience had been completed satisfactorily. Then it occurred to me that it would probably not be too inconvenient if, every time throughout the rest of my life that I had need of an automobile, a telestial variety would be provided. But I would not like to have a telestial body, or a telestial mind, or telestial friends, or live on a telestial earth.<br><br>We know quite a bit about the celestial kingdom. Every principle and ordinance of the gospel has to do with the celestial kingdom. If we are interested only in becoming telestial or terrestrial beings, it is not necessary to be baptized. It is not necessary to be married in the temple. We can mess up our lives with a lot of dishonesties and disloyalties and immoralities and break the hearts of other people, and we can still qualify for some of the lower kingdoms. But if we want to qualify for the celestial kingdom, then we need to live the principles of the gospel.<br><h2><b>Celestial Afterlife</b></h2><br>We know quite a bit about the celestial kingdom. We have had quite a few celestial people appear to us upon this earth. And each time they have come, those who have received them have said they are impossible to describe. We remember, when the Prophet Joseph Smith had his vision of the Father and the Son, he said their "brightness and glory defy all description" (Joseph Smith 2:17). You do not have any background of understanding or any words to describe a celestial accomplishment. There are some things that we can't describe even in this life. For example, if you were going to try to describe to me the look on your little sister's face on Christmas morning when she's radiant and expectant, with something shining out through her face that you may be able to identify, you might have difficulty explaining how she looks to somebody who had never had that experience. You might try by saying, "She has a light in her eye," or "Her face beams," or "Her countenance glows." None of these things is true actually. Her eyes are the same color, the same shape, the same size as they were before and yet there is something shining out of her face that is indescribable.<br><br>The other day, I married a young couple. After the marriage ceremony was over they just stood there looking at each other. Something was going back and forth between them that almost frightened me. Inasmuch as they were not paying any attention to what I was doing and inasmuch as I generally don't like to miss anything, I decided that I would just stand there and watch. I wanted to see what was going to happen. Somebody tried to describe this situation by saying, "She looked at him as if he were a piece of fried chicken." And that is just about as good a description as I could make.<br><br>If we're delighted by seeing this radiance and light and righteousness and love shining out through the face of our friends here, what do you thing it would be like sometime when--with quickened senses, amplified powers of perception, and vastly increased capacity for love, happiness, and understanding--we become resurrected, celestialized, glorified beings, made beautiful beyond all comprehension?<br><br>We remember when the resurrected Jesus appeared to Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdrey in the Kirtland Temple on April 3, 1836, and the Prophet said it was impossible to describe him as he then appeared. But he tried, and here are some of the phrases that he used. He said, "His eyes were as a flame of fire" (D&amp;amp;C 110:3). It isn't a twinkle any more; it is now magnified a few million times. I suppose there wasn't any flame there at all, any more than there is a light in your sister's eyes, but the Prophet was trying to describe something which is indescribable. He said, "His countenance shone above the brightness of the sun" (D&amp;amp;C 110:3). That is pretty bright.<br><br>We might imagine that Jesus was a little different from us, but the Prophet also tried to describe his some fifteen or sixteen visits with the angel Moroni. Moroni was a soldier who lived upon our continent. At the time of the destruction of his civilization and the death of his people, he was approximately forty-four years of age. He alone was spared to take custody of their records to see that they were transmitted safely into our hands.<br><br>Then for the next thirty-seven what must have been long and lonely years, Moroni lived on alone, hiding from his enemies, seeking his food where he could. He said, "My father hath been slain in battle, and all my kinsfolk, and I have not friends nor whither to go" (Mormon 8:5). "Wherefore," said he, "I wander whithersoever I can for the safety of mine own life" (Moroni 1:3). He didn't have a warm bathroom to go into each morning, or someone to provide him a clean shirt or a nutritious breakfast, and we might imagine that he had allowed his personality to run down a little bit. We might now picture this old man, eighty-one years of age, as we see him for the last time, standing there on the edge of his grave. From this position he wrote us his last paragraph, in which he said:<br><br><i>And now I bid unto all, farewell. I soon go to rest in the paradise of God, until my spirit and body shall again reunite, and I am brought forth triumphant through the air, to meet you before the pleasing bar of the great Jehovah, the Eternal Judge of both quick and dead.</i>[Moroni 10:34]<br><br>Then there followed a long silence of fourteen centuries. For 1,403 years we heard nothing more until--on the night of September 21, 1823--this same old man, now resurrected and glorified, stood by the bedside of Joseph Smith. The Prophet tried to describe him as he now appeared. And while he said that was impossible, yet he tried. And again, here are some phrases that he used. He said, "His whole person was glorious beyond description, and his countenance truly like lightning" (Joseph Smith 2:32). Not only was his person glorious, but even his clothing was brilliant: "Beyond anything earthly I had ever seen," said the Prophet, "nor do I believe that any earthly thing could be made to appear so exceedingly white and brilliant" (Joseph Smith 2:31).<br><br>We all know the things that we do to make this body a pleasant habitation. We bathe it, keep it clean, dress it in the most appropriate clothing; sometimes we ornament it with jewelry, or--if we are very wealthy--we buy bracelets and necklaces to make our bodies sparkle and shine and to make them pleasant places to be. Sometimes we work on them with cosmetics and eyebrow tweezers. Usually we don't help them very much but we keep working on them all the time. If you think it would be pleasant to be dressed in expensive clothing, what do you think it would be like sometime to be dressed in an expensive body--one that shines like the sun, one that is beautiful beyond all comprehension? And we ought to remember that God runs the most effective beauty parlor ever known in the world.<br><br>But a celestial being is not just one who has a celestial body. He also has a celestial mind. Edwin Dyer said something about this in his poem:<br><br><i>My mind to me a kingdom is.</i><br><i>Such pleasant joys therein I find</i><br><i>That it excels all other bliss</i><br><i>That earth affords or grows by kind.</i><br><br>If we do the right things, each of us may sometime have a celestial personality, a celestial family, and live with God, who is a member of this highest order of the celestial kingdom.<br><br>Socrates was a very homely man. On one occasion he prayed and said to the Lord, "Make me beautiful within." We have all seen plain people who have been made beautiful by the working of a radiant spirituality. A godly spirit will make the plainest body beautiful. Great mental and spiritual qualities form our bodies into their likenesses. As you come here to this great University and as you enjoy this tremendous opportunity, I am sure that most of you do not understand the importance of your experiences. You will discover their importance years later--maybe when it is too late--for this opportunity that you are presently experiencing may be in one way at least a partially unconscious experience. Most of the important events in our lives we do not appreciate at the time.<br><br>May the Lord bless you in this important activity that you are presently enjoying in this very pleasant relationship you have with these great instructors, with these great books, and in this great institution, where you have a chance for the direction and guidance of the Spirit of the Lord. May you be born again a great many times and may you be born better each time is my prayer, which I ask in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Sterling W.

<h1> Diamonds - Vaughn J. Featherstone - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I am very pleased to be with you tonight. When I was invited to accept this assignment, I looked to it as a great honor and one to which hopefully I can contribute something. I do feel very keenly about young people, and I guess these are the thoughts that went through my heart as I thought about this assignment for the past weeks.<br><br>Not too long ago a news item came over from Scotland. Apparently, at the funeral of Donald Graham, one of the pallbearers, Blackey McGregor, as he rounded the open grave, fell in and broke his arm. A newspaper reporter covering the incident wanted to put it in the newspaper in a certain way, and so he simply had a little article there that said, "Yesterday at Donald Graham's funeral, Blackey McGregor, one of the pallbearers, slipped into the open grave, fracturing a limb, bringing a gloom over the whole occasion." I hope we won't do that tonight.<br><br>I also recall an incident that ties into the subject I'd like to lead into in a minute. The story concerns the fellow who was in a nice big automobile. He pulled up to a red light and waited. Then a Volkswagen pulled in behind him. The light turned green, but the fellow was preoccupied and didn't notice it. So the fellow behind him shouted out the window, "Move the trash can, pilgrim!"<br><br>This fellow was just a little incensed at this, and so he got out of his car, walked back to the Volkswagen and said, "I don't take that kind of guff out of nobody." The door opened, and the other fellow started getting out, and he kept getting out and kept getting out, and when he was all the way out he was six feet five inches and 240 pounds.<br><br>Then the little fellow said to him, "Isn't there some kind of guff you<i>do</i>give that I<i>can</i>take?"<br><br>Then I also recall the Scotchman who bought his wife an X ray of his chest for their anniversary. He couldn't afford a gift, but he wanted her to know that his heart was in the right place.<br><br>In our day we have many things that come into our lives that seem to be great obstacles and great handicaps. Someone who had such an obstacle was a young man by the name of Timmy. Timmy was a moron--at least that's what his teacher told him--so she had him transferred out of her class into a class where they did teach morons. When he got into the new class, he said to his teacher, "Well, what is a moron?"<br><br>His teacher said, "Well, Timmy, I guess a moron is someone who doesn't know quite as much about something as someone else."<br><br>He said, "Oh, I'm in the right place then. I surely don't know as much as all those people in that other class. All year long that teacher told me things I didn't know a thing about." But he also said, "There are a lot of things I do know about. You know, I just love my Dad because we sit around the dinner table, and after we finish eating dinner, Dad will say to me, 'Well, Timmy, what do you think?' Then I can tell my Dad what I think."<br><br>And his teacher said, "Well, Timmy, what do you think?"<br><br>"Oh, I think about birds all the time," he answered. "I know every bird in the forest. I can name every single one, and there are hundreds of them in the woods around our house. I can spot any bird that flies, and I can tell you what it is, and I can tell you what color it is. All I have to do is hear one note of a song of any bird, and I can tell you what bird it is and finish the song of the bird for you. I can tell you when the eggs are laid, and when they hatch, what color they are, and the different varieties--." He went on and on.<br><br>His teacher said, "Well, my goodness, Timmy, you're a genius!"<br><br>And he said, "What's a genius?"<br><br>"A genius is someone who knows a great deal about one thing."<br><br>Timmy said, "You know, I've only been in your class just a little while, and you already know more about me than that other teacher did all year. She doesn't know very much; she must be a moron!" I think that's a great story, and I believe it will lead into what I'm going to tell you tonight.<br><h2><b>Finding Treasures at Home</b></h2><br>Several years ago, a man by the name of Russell Conwell wrote a great book,<i>Acres of Diamonds</i>, taken from his lectures. He tells of being in Baghdad and hiring an old Arab guide. With a camel train they went down the Tigris and Euphrates rivers. As they walked along the banks of these rivers, they saw beautiful white sands and the old Arab guide told story after story, kind of like a modern-day barber. "Finally, instead of acting as if I weren't listening," Conwell said, "I'd act as if I were listening and then just turn him off. I guess he noticed this, because all of a sudden he took his turban off and waved it around to get my attention, but I just ignored him. He kept waving, and pretty soon I succumbed to the temptation and looked over at him. As soon as I did, he started into a story. He said, 'This story I save for my particular friends.' Then he told me this story":<br><br><i>In ancient Persia there was a man by the name of Ali Hafid who owned orchards, gardens, and fields of grain. Ali Hafid was rich. He was contented because he was wealthy, and he was wealthy because he was contented. One day a Buddhist priest came by Ali Hafid's home, and together they sat by the fire. This Buddhist priest told how the Almighty put his finger in a bank of fog and started whirling it around faster and faster until it burst into a solid mass of flame. And then it went rolling off through the universe. As it did, it went through other fog banks, and the dew settled on the earth, and the crust began to form. As it formed, after it had gone through fog bank after fog bank, some of the inner eruption came forth. The priest said, "This is where we got our mountains and hills and our valleys and our deep gorges. This is the thing that beautified the earth. As the earth's crust cooled, that which cooled most rapidly was granite; less rapidly, copper; then silver, gold, and last of all diamonds." And the priest said to Ali Hafid, "If you had a diamond as big as your thumb, you could buy this whole country. If you had a diamond mine, you could place your children on thrones throughout the world."</i><br><br><i>After the Buddhist priest had left, Ali Hafid went to bed. He was a poor man. He was poor because he was discontented, and he was discontented because he felt and feared that he was poor. He didn't sleep all that night, and when the morning came, he arose early and went over to the Buddhist priest's home and said to him, "I must find a diamond mine. Where should I look for one?"</i><br><br><i>The Buddhist priest, having been awakened early in the morning and not feeling too pleasant, said, "You look for a river between high mountains, and the river will flow on white sands, and there you will find diamonds."</i><br><br><i>"There isn't any such place."</i><br><br><i>"There is," replied the priest, "and there are many of them, and you will find them. You will always find diamonds."</i><br><br><i>Ali Hafid answered, "Then I will go." And he went home and sold his farm and collected the money. Then he left his family with a nearby neighbor and went on this search for diamonds. He started in the Mountains of the Moon, and then he went down into Palestine, and finally over into Europe. Many years later--in wretched poverty, having been driven all the way across Europe, not a penny left, in rags, heartsick, weary, tired--he stood on the bay of Barcelona. As a giant tide came in between the Pillars of Hercules, unable to resist the terrible temptation, he threw himself into the incoming tide and sank beneath the crest</i>--<i>never to rise again in this life.</i><br><br>And then the old Arab stopped telling the story and went back to straighten the pack on the camel's back. Then he came forward and went right on with the next chapter.<br><br><i>The man who bought the farm from Ali Hafid went out to water his camel one day in the little stream that ran through the white sands of the farm. As he did, he saw something glistening in the sand. He reached down into the water and pulled a huge stone out. As he pulled it out, he noticed that it caught all the different hues of the rainbow, so he took it in the house and set it on his mantel. Three or four weeks later, the old Buddhist priest came by, entered the house, and soon spotted this rock on the mantel. He walked over and said, "Well, that's a diamond! Has Ali Hafid returned?"</i><br><br><i>"No, Ali Hafid has not returned, and that's not a diamond. It's just a rock that I found out in my stream here."</i><br><br><i>"That's a diamond! I know diamonds!" the priest replied. So they went out and dug in the sands nearby, and with almost every shovelful of sand, they turned up more diamonds.</i><br><br>The Arab concluded his story by saying that Ali Hafid's farm was the Golconda mine, the richest diamond mine in all the history of the world. If Ali Hafid had stayed home and dug in his own fields, he would have had acres of diamonds.<br><br>That's a great story relating to what I would like to talk to you about tonight: the acres of diamonds each of you has as an individual. I had lunch this past Tuesday with a man I admire very much. I have come to love him just because of his story. I had heard about him and admired him for a long time. To have the privilege of having lunch with him was something very exciting to me, and we arranged to have dinner a week from this Friday, so my wife and I are going to have the privilege of spending more time with him and finding out more about him. His name is Douglas Snarr. Have you ever heard of Snarr Advertising Agency? Possibly you have seen many of his billboards. This is Douglas Snarr's business. He told me this story, and I asked him if I could lift part of it because I think it might help you understand the message I have for you.<br><h2><b>Overcoming Handicaps</b></h2><br>As a young man, Douglas Snarr developed a serious problem with stuttering and stammering. He said that, when he got into high school (I think his junior and senior years), the stuttering became more intense, until finally he withdrew into a shell and would hardly speak in any of his classes. He remembered in particular one summer night when he went up to his girlfriend's house. She lived on a knoll in a beautiful colonial home. He went to the door and knocked. Her father came to the door and said, "What do you want, young man?"<br><br>Douglas explained how he felt at the time: "I tried to say what I wanted, but I couldn't. The words wouldn't come. The perspiration started pouring off my face, and I wanted to say something, but I still couldn't, so I just stood there. All of a sudden Carol came down the spiral staircase in a beautiful dress and said, 'Well, Daddy, that's Douglas Snarr. He's come to take me out tonight.' And with those words she took all the pressure off and alleviated the problem."<br><br>Despite his problem, Douglas decided that he had a great talent--a great artistic talent, as some of you here might know--and so he developed a business. After his senior year, he had earned enough money in that business to come to BYU. He came to a class, a very large class, and sat in the middle of the back row, where surely no one would call him to answer questions or do anything. The professor went down the whole list and said, "We'd like to have Douglas Snarr come up and give the opening prayer."<br><br>Doug said, "I made my way out and walked down, and I stood in front with my head bowed. I wanted to pray, but the words wouldn't come. I'd have given anything, but they still wouldn't come. Then the pressure got more intense. The perspiration ran down my face. I could feel it under my arms. The pressure was absolutely intense. Finally the professor got up, came over and stood by me, put his arm around me, and said, 'I will give the prayer.' And he gave the prayer. As I made my way back to my seat, no one wanted to look at me because they didn't want to embarrass me. But it was irresistible; they had to look. I felt like a freak. After class this kind professor came to me and said, 'Doug, if you will continue to come to class, I'll make it worth your while. We think we've got something that will be worthwhile in this class, and I promise you that I'll never call on you again.' The teacher's comment was worse because it made me feel like a spectacle."<br><br>Doug wanted to do something about his stuttering, but that just accentuated the problem. He decided he would try to find a speech correction school. He finally found one, and after he had taken a battery of tests, the speech therapist told him, "You have a severe case of stammering and stuttering." I guess the teacher didn't have to be a genius to tell him that. The man who conducted the tests said to him, "We really don't know all that much about stammering and stuttering when the case is as severe as yours. We don't know what we can really do for you, Doug, but I will tell you this: we can teach you how to live with the problem."<br><br>Doug described his reaction: "Something welled up inside of me that made me so mad I could hardly stand it. I didn't want to<i>live with</i>the problem! I turned to the man and said, 'You're no good!' Then I turned and left. I was heartsick.<br><br>"I went through school that year, and then one day when I was sitting in a barber chair, I saw a little ad in the paper about a man back in Chicago who would guarantee speech correction in a course costing one thousand dollars. I went back home that summer and, although there was a girl I was interested in [apparently the same little gal], I didn't go on one date. I worked that whole summer and finally earned enough. I had told my dad I would like to go to this speech school in Chicago. He had had BYU and Utah State University and the University of Utah check it out. They had all told him that the teacher was a quack, and that he really couldn't do anything, and that the course was just a waste of money. So I had decided I would pay for the course myself.<br><br>"When I went back East, I found the school, went in, and was met by a seventy-four-year-old, white-haired man. He said, 'Your name is Douglas Snarr. When I was your age I had a problem very similar to yours. You can overcome the problem and someday you'll speak as I am speaking.' I started to cry because somebody had told me I didn't have to live with the problem I had.<br><br>"For the first ten days of that course, we could not say one word. We didn't say anything for ten days. (I should mention that we met in a little shabby room--gray, dull, dingy--and one of the women who taught us was about the same age as the man and was blind.) At the end of the ten days, they taught me to move my arm back and forth slowly while saying, "My name is Doug Snarr.' I want to tell you what that was to be able to speak! I didn't mind moving my arm because I was finally communicating. I was saying something, and it was coming out! We started speaking slowly, but then we picked up pace. I used to go out and sit in the park with a newspaper. There would be drunks and others lying on benches out in the park, but I'd go out and put the newspaper over my arm while reading or talking to myself, with my arm moving back and forth under the paper with every syllable--practicing!<br><br>"Then, one Sunday about nine weeks later, I had a regression. I didn't know what to do, so I knelt down. I have prayed most of my life, but this day I really prayed: 'Dear God, help me to know what to do.' Then the message came, so I got up, called a taxi, and went down to the LDS chapel. It was too late; church was out; the building was all locked up. In a little note on the front door, the branch president had left his name and address. I went back to the taxi and told the driver to take me to that address. When I arrived, I rang the doorbell, and a man came to the door with his little girl right behind him. Then I said, 'My-name-is-Doug-Snarr. I've-prayed-and-God-has-sent-me-to-you.'<br><br>"The little girl went running to her mother and said, 'Mother, come quick. There's a crazy man at the door talking to our father.' (I was eighteen at the time.) You can imagine how I felt. Anyway, the branch president invited me in, we talked for a while, and he said, 'Go out and send the taxi away. We will take you home tonight. Tomorrow, you pack your things and come and live with us the whole time you are in Chicago.'<br><br>"A short time later, this family took me on a trip down to southern Illinois. I was talking to one of the members of the Church down there, waving my arm but carrying on a regular conversation. The woman I was talking to said, 'You know, Doug, you've got a great story to tell. I think you ought to tell it at church.' Although I said I didn't think I could do it, she continued, 'Do it, Douglas. You come and speak to our people. They need to hear it.'"<br><br>Charity is the pure love of Christ, when you don't mind being embarrassed, when all you can think about is the good of the people. And so this sweet fellow said, "All right, I'll speak at your sacrament meeting." The whole night before his talk, Doug hardly slept at all. Then at the meeting he was just as nervous as he could possibly be until they finally called on him to speak. He stood up, put his arm out, and then he put it down. He gave the whole talk without moving his arm. His problem was solved. If you could hear Douglas Snarr talk today, you would find that he speaks about as fast as I do, and I speak very fast. He has an exciting way of speaking, without the slightest trace of a problem.<br><h2><b>Showing Concern for Others</b></h2><br>Let me tell you just one other thing about Douglas Snarr, because I know that his ability to speak is a miracle. He is very successful, and he's been a pusher--a driver. He just cannot believe that anyone can't succeed if he wants to succeed. All he has to do is make his own rules and then live by them, and he will succeed. Doug was in Washington, D.C., not too long ago, riding in a taxicab. The driver, who was black, pulled in beside a bus. The bus driver looked down, saw this black driver, and started trying to force him off the road. Doug asked, "What's going on here?"<br><br>The driver answered, "I guess this guy doesn't like blacks." The taxi driver slowed down, and the bus went on down the street. When the taxi tried to pass the bus again, the bus driver swerved right over in front of the taxi. Doug said, "I can't believe this." Finally both vehicles pulled up to a red light. Doug jumped out of the back seat of the taxi and ran around to the window of the bus. He reached in, grabbed the bus driver, and started pulling him down. The bus driver slammed the window shut on Doug's arm, and when he pulled it out it was bleeding down his white shirt and his suit. Doug ran around to the door and saw it was locked. Then he stood about six inches in front of the bus. When the light turned green, the driver started inching up until the bus window was right against Doug's nose. Doug wouldn't move, so the bus driver stopped. Horns were honking in back, and pretty soon a policeman came over and said, "What's going on here?"<br><br>Doug answered, "This man tried to force that black driver off the road. He tried to cause an accident. He didn't care; he's just prejudiced. I want to talk to him." Finally the bus driver opened the door, and the policeman went in to talk to the driver and the people on the bus. The passengers agreed that the driver had been trying to force the black cabbie off the road. Then the policeman said to the driver, "We will report this to your company and take appropriate action."<br><br>The bus driver started to cry. He said, "I have a family. This is all I've done all my life. If I'm fired from this, I don't know what I'll do."<br><br>And then big, old, soft-hearted Doug said, "If you'll go over and apologize to that black driver, it will all be forgotten." So the bus driver went over and apologized to the black driver and got back in his bus, and it was all forgotten. Then Doug climbed into the back of the taxi, and the black driver turned around--tears streaming down his cheeks--and said, "That's the first time in my life that anyone has ever stuck up for me."<br><br>I wanted to tell you that little incident just to give you some background about the kind of man Douglas Snarr is.<br><br>Someone said:<br><br><i>When any man holds 'twixt hand and chin a violin of mine, he will be glad that Stradivari lived, made violins, and made them of the best. The masters only know whose work is good, and they will choose mine. For while God gives them skill, I give them instruments to play upon, God choosing me to help him. For God could not make Antonio Stradivari's violins without Antonio.</i><br><br>Isn't that great? I really like it.<br><h2><b>Developing Personal Attractiveness</b></h2><br>What I am trying to do is help you to realize that you have your own acres of diamonds. I don't care what the problem is. I told some seminary students the other day about an experience I had after getting glasses. I hadn't worn them all my life, so they changed my appearance a little bit. I was in a store, and one of our neighbors came in--a good LDS gal about our age (young). (As you can see, we're still going on with having our family. My wife is expecting. It's great! We're proud. We're really excited about it.) Anyway, this little gal came in, looked at me, and said, "Is that you? Is that really you? Vaughn Featherstone, is that you?<br><br>I said, "Yes, why?"<br><br>"Well, I thought you had on horn-rimmed glasses and a plastic nose!"<br><br>I said, "No, that's my nose." And then I said, "I have one advantage over you: I take one breath and it lasts me all day."<br><br>After hearing that story, quite a few of the seminary leaders came up to shake hands. We were talking for just a few minutes with each one--"Thanks for coming. We appreciated your talk"--and so forth. And then one little gal came up, stood back and looked at me, and said, "You know, you really don't have a big nose."<br><br>I answered, "You're a sweetheart." There are those kinds of people that help others feel as if their idiosyncrasies really aren't all that much of a problem. I can't do anything about my nose, and I think if we would look around here we'd find people who think their legs are bigger than they ought to be, or smaller than they ought to be. Maybe their shoulders are slumped instead of squared--I don't know. Maybe their noses are bigger, or maybe their ears are a little bigger. I think that if we went through this audience every single person would think of something he'd change if he could. Many things can't be changed, and we have to live with them. It doesn't matter what the problems are; we can overcome any of them if we just understand that we are creations of God, and each of us is somebody. We're going someplace, and we can make real contributions to the kingdom as soon as we start looking outside of ourselves instead of thinking only about ourselves and all the problems we have.<br><br>I heard a while ago of a contest to find the ugliest girl in America. I think it's mentioned in Dr. Carlton Maltz's book<i>The Power of Self-Image Psychology</i>. I guess quite a few people sent in snapshots of what they thought were the ugliest girls in America, and there was a big promotion. Finally the judges chose the girl that everybody agreed was the ugliest girl in America. Then they took this girl, after they had the picture of her "before," and obtained the finest clothes that money could buy for her. They found others who were artists and could see the shape of her face and its contours. Her hair was done appropriately, and they did whatever else it took to make her more attractive. If she needed braces, I guess they did this. Finally they even operated a little bit, did some plastic surgery, and may have taken a hump out of a place or two. Anyway, when they finally finished, they had a picture. She was absolutely a beautiful person. A few months after the contest, this girl was married, and a short time later she had five children. I think what I'm trying to say is that even if we have problems we can be attractive.<br><br>Others can help us be attractive on the surface, and I think it's important to look attractive. I think we need to keep our teeth sparkling white, and I think we need to groom ourselves so that at least someone will take a second look at us. But the most important thing is the inner beauty that starts to shine forth. It really does come forth when you start serving people. It's something that bubbles inside and starts moving out. Someone said that when a person is really enthusiastic he gives off measurable wavelengths that leave his body for four or five feet. When I find somebody who isn't enthusiastic, I try to get within four or five feet of him so some of those wavelengths will carry right on through. I think that's what happens when someone begins to have an inner beauty. It shines through and makes him beautiful from within and without.<br><br>I came across a letter that I thought would interest you. It was found in a baking powder can wired to the handle of an old pump that offered the only hope of drinking water in a very long, seldom-used trail across the Armagosa Desert. This is the letter:<br><br><i>This pump was all right as of June 1932. I put a new sucker washer into it, and it ought to last for five years. But the washer dries out, and the pump has got to be primed. Under the white rock I buried a bottle of water--out of the sun and cork end up. There is enough water in it to prime the pump, but not if you drink some first. Pour out about one-fourth and let 'er soak to wet the leather. Then pour in the rest medium-fast and pump like crazy! You'll git water; the well has never run dry. Have faith! When you git watered up, fill the bottle and put it back like you found it for the next feller.</i><br><br><i>Signed, Desert Pete.</i><br><br><i>P.S. Don't go drinking up the water first. Prime the pump with it, and you'll git all you can hold.</i><br><br>I guess if you had finally crawled that last few yards and found this pump with the letter, your faith would really be tested. Do you drink the bottle of water you've got in your hand, or do you pour it over the sucker washer to see if maybe this once the well did run dry? I think you're getting the message. You have to have a lot of faith because each of you is someone special. You are a person of worth.<br><h2><b>Achieving Success</b></h2><br>I have a formula for success that I quote quite often, and some of you might have heard it, but let me, for those few who haven't heard it, go back through it again. It goes like this:<br><br><i>When you want a thing bad enough to go out and fight for it,</i><br><i>To work day and night for it,</i><br><i>To give up your peace and your sleep and your time for it;</i><br><i>If only the desire of it makes your aim strong enough never to tire of it;</i><br><i>If life seems all empty and useless without it,</i><br><i>And all that you dream and you scheme is about it;</i><br><i>If gladly you'll sweat for it, fret for it, plan for it,</i><br><i>Pray with all your strength for it;</i><br><i>If you'll simply go after the thing that you want with all your capacity,</i><br><i>Strength and sagacity; faith, hope, and confidence, stern pertinacity;</i><br><i>If neither poverty nor cold nor famish nor gaunt</i><br><i>Nor sickness of pain to body or brain can turn you away from the aim</i><br><i>That you want;</i><br><i>If dogged and grim, you besiege and beset it, you'll get it!</i><br>[Author unknown]<br><br>Isn't that easy? That's all you have to do if you want to be a success!<br><br>I have picked up several quotes of successful men concerning what they think the secrets of achievement are. Thomas Edison said, "Geniuses themselves don't talk about the gift of genius. They talk about hard work and long hours." He also said, "Genius is 1 percent inspiration and 99 percent perspiration." Michelangelo said, "If people knew how hard I work to get my mastery, it wouldn't seem so wonderful at all." And Paderewski said, "A genius? Perhaps, but before I was a genius I was a drudge." Alexander Hamilton said, "All the genius I may have is merely the fruit of labor and thought." Dorothea Brand wrote a whole book,<i>Wake Up and Live</i>, to get across one simple formula for success: "Act as though it were impossible to fail." Shouldn't we in God's kingdom act as though it were impossible to fail? There is no reason we need to fail.<br><br>I picked up another interesting quote from a fellow who was also a stutterer. His idea kind of wraps up what Doug said about his experience: "You see, I'm a stutterer, and I've spent twenty-five years of my life doing a pretty good job of it. During that time I learned a great many tricks to avoid speaking. I even avoided trying to speak or taking a chance. I was afraid of failure, which could compound itself eventually into total retreat from reality. Failure can be overcome, but a failure can suck the lifeblood from a person's ego and leave him useless to himself, his family, and his company."<br><br>The woods are filled with losers, and they have a hundred different excuses why they lose, but I'm not interested in talking to you at all about that today. I think if you'll be a trainer of people, or a teacher, or a philosopher, you need to plant the sweet smell of success in the nostrils of those you would inspire. I think that's a great concept: others must be able to see some vision out ahead. I could tell you about some great men who have had that kind of impact and influence on my life. We need to remember a great phrase by President Hugh B. Brown: "No matter how dark the night, the dawn is irresistible." I want to tell you there are times when that gives me a great deal of hope, because the dawn must come. Somebody else said, "Nighttime demands from the overburdened soul the things that daylight denies."<br><br>Isn't there something splendid about light? In the gospel, as we gain a great deal of light, we can then judge good and evil. But as we start doing the things which cause the Spirit to withdraw from us, then we lose our ability to judge. I have heard very intelligent people--people who hold temple recommends, but who have been involved in serious error--say, "Is that really wrong?" There isn't any question about it. It is totally wrong, and I can't imagine that they couldn't see that themselves. But I can understand that the light has withdrawn from them, and it's hard to discern when you don't have that light.<br><br>I think you'd be interested in a quote I oftentimes use to tell how I feel about my wife, but I want to use it to make a different point tonight. Would you look at this lovely wife of mine and think about two points? This quote is taken from<i>Camelot</i>. You recall the scene where King Arthur finally, after many months, received reports and innuendos and whatever that Lancelot and King Arthur's wife, Guinevere, had had an affair and were having an affair at that time. King Arthur didn't want to believe it, so he kept it submerged and wouldn't believe it. But finally the facts were out, and he knew they were true. He retreated to a lonely room where he did some great mental struggling within himself. Finally he said this (and this is the way I feel about my wife; the other point, about the suffering even kings go through, I will make later):<br><br><i>Proposition: If I could choose, from every woman who breathes on this earth, the face I would most love, the smile, the touch, the voice, the heart, the laugh, the soul itself, every detail and feature to the smallest strand of hair--they would all be Jenny's.</i><br><br><i>Proposition</i>[and I feel this way about my sons]<i>: If I could choose from every man who breathes on this earth a man for my brother and a man for my son, a man for my friend, they would all be Lance.</i><br><br><i>Yes, I love them. I love them, and they answer me with pain and torment. Be it sin or not sin, they betray me in their hearts, and that's far sin enough. I see it in their eyes and feel it when they speak, and they must pay for it and be punished. I shan't be wounded and not return it in kind. I'm done with feeble hoping. I demand a man's vengeance!</i><br><br><i>Proposition: I'm a king, not a man. And a civilized king. Could it possibly be civilized to destroy what I love? Could it possibly be civilized to love myself above all? What of their pain and their torment? Did they ask for this calamity? Can passion be selected?</i><br><br><i>Is there any doubt of their devotion ... to me, or to our Table?</i><br><br><i>By God, Excalibur, I shall be a King! This is the time of King Arthur, and we reach for the stars! This is the time of King Arthur, and violence is not strength and compassion is not weakness. We are civilized! Resolved: We shall live through this together, Excalibur: They, you and I! And God have mercy on us all</i>. [Alan Jay Lerner,<i>Camelot</i>, 1.11.11–37]<br><h2><b>Meeting Challenges</b></h2><br>Each of us oftentimes thinks: "I have problems. I am nobody." The competition is so keen here at BYU. You know, there are those few people who just seem to lift right up to the top, above everyone else, and you think, "If only I had their talent. If only I had their skill." We wouldn't suppose that a king would have problems, but do you suppose that any physical ailment could be near the hurt of having the one you love most dearly on this earth be unfaithful to you? I'd ten times rather be stripped of all of my limbs than have that happen to me. I believe, you see, that what King Arthur went through was a terrible thing. Every man must be tested. Every man must be tried. President Lee said, "The greatest test we have in this life is the loss of a loved one, and the greatest burden we carry [and I repeat for emphasis], the<i>greatest</i>burden we carry, is sin." You may have a problem like that. You may feel like what we talked about earlier, or you may have a physical ailment of some kind that causes you not to be all that you think you ought to be. If you only knew some of the great people of the earth and what they have accomplished. If you could look back and see the obstacles they had, I want to tell you that you would be so grateful to have all that you have. No matter what the problems are--physically, mentally, or in any way--you'd say, "I am grateful, dear God, that I am what I am and that I have all these things." We ought to start looking for the positives in our lives instead of the negatives.<br><br>I remember the story of a famous artist who painted a beautiful portrait. He stood in front of it, looked at it for a long time, and then started to weep. A person nearby saw him and asked, "What's the matter? Why are you weeping? Isn't it satisfactory? Aren't you satisfied with it?"<br><br>The artist replied, "That is the problem. I am satisfied with it." What the artist had just discovered was that, if he was satisfied with the picture, he didn't know how to improve. He didn't have enough concept, skill, or ability to increase and improve that painting. I think it was Michelangelo, blind and reaching his ninetieth year, who said as he felt a sculpture that someone else had done, "Even at ninety I continue to learn."<br><br>I heard President Brown make a statement a long time ago: "If I could choose from all the times in the history of the earth to live, it would be about fifty years later than I was born." Do you know what that means? It means that those of us who are here were born precisely in the time when President Brown, if he could have chosen, would have chosen to be born. We're here on the earth, and we're going to have the benefit of all those great things that President Brown--as a prophet, seer, and revelator in the First Presidency--could probably see were ahead for us. This is a great life, and it is a marvelous time to live. I don't care whether there are truck strikes or food shortages, or whatever there might be. The Lord has said, "If ye are prepared ye shall not fear" (D&amp;amp;C 38:30).<br><br>I am just so excited to live in this day and to be part of the wrapping-up process. I can't tell you what it means to me to be on the Savior's team in this very critical day. I guess, if I had my druthers, I would hope that my family could be spared from all the filth and pornography and all the garbage on the newsstands and the things we see in the movies. They can if they're trained properly and if they have self-discipline. We are all going to be subjected to these things, but we can live the kind of lives that would draw us close to the Savior and help us to be the kind of people we ought to be--once we make the decision to do it.<br><br>I would imagine there are many young women here today who are concerned that "I'm twenty-two and I'm not married yet" or "I'm twenty-five and not married." That isn't all that serious. Just keep serving, and in due time things will take place. I wouldn't dare tell you, "I'll teach you how to live with it," because you would say, as Doug Snarr did, "You're no good!" I don't like that answer. No one likes that answer, and I don't think that's the right answer to give. I think the answer is just to bide your time the way you should, and the Lord will do for you that which is best for you. I have absolute confidence in that statement. So I think we ought to stop worrying and being concerned about those things. Then I think we ought to remember that no one else in all the world is like any of us.<br><h2><b>Developing Patience</b></h2><br>I guess I could share with you a personal story. I would like to change it just enough so that it won't possibly be recognized, but the facts are true. A bishop from a ward in a distant city came to see me one day and said, "We've got a woman in our ward who would like to be excommunicated."<br><br>I said, "All right. What's the problem? Have you talked to her?"<br><br>"Yes, we've tried to talk her out of it many times."<br><br>"Has the stake president talked to her?"<br><br>"Yes."<br><br>"What do you recommend?"<br><br>He said, "Well, I hate to tell you this, but we told her that, if she would come to see you and talk to you, and if she still wanted to be excommunicated after she had the interview with you, we'd let her be excommunicated."<br><br>I answered, "Thanks." Then I got humble inside and said, "Of course I'll see her." We made an appointment, and I want to tell you that I came to that interview with a great deal of prayer and a very humble heart. The woman came in, and I asked, "You are so-and-so?"<br><br>And she said, "Yes."<br><br>I said, "I have been expecting you."<br><br>She responded, "The only reason I am here is that my bishop said if I would come and talk to you I could be excommunicated after the interview. That's the only reason I am here."<br><br>I said, "Would you just take a few minutes and explain the story to me?"<br><br>Then she told me some of her experiences. "When I was eighteen my mother died, and I had four younger brothers and sisters. I knew I couldn't start dating and getting serious about a fellow, and so I didn't even look. Anything that started developing I just cut off. I took care of the family at home, and when the older of my young brothers was ready to go on a mission, I supported him. Then my second brother came along, and I supported him on his mission. They came back and eventually found companions and got married. My two sisters got married, and then all the family was raised. I was about thirty and I thought, 'Now I can get married.' A short time later I found the fellow, and we fell in love and got married.<br><br>"You know," she continued, "I believed that prayer was a one-way street. You just reported in, but you didn't dare ask for anything. All those years that I took care of and supported my brothers and sisters, I had a health problem. I had a good job, but I had this serious health problem. After I was married, my husband was called to be a seventy. We went to one of the seven presidents of the First Council of the Seventy, and he gave my husband a blessing as he ordained him. Then he said, 'I'd like to give you a blessing also.' I didn't ask for the blessing; he just volunteered it. Then he laid his hands on my head, and he told me something that I didn't know until that day. He opened up a whole new dimension of life because he said, 'Do you know that when you pray you can ask God for things, and he will answer those prayers?' I hadn't known that before. When he finished, I couldn't believe it. I went home, and for the first time in my life I got down on my knees and started asking God for something.<br><br>"Then I decided that before I did that I had better be worthy. I was working at a place making more money than my husband, and I started looking at myself and thinking my skirts were a little shorter than they ought to be. So I voluntarily lengthened my skirts. Then I thought that maybe I shouldn't be working. I didn't think the Lord would be pleased with my working, and we really didn't need both incomes, so I stopped working. We lived off my husband's income, and I managed his affairs for him at home. We paid our tithing all those years. At one time the bishop felt impressed to give me a blessing, and he promised me that I would have a man child, that he would be a priesthood holder, and that he would do a great service for the Church. I didn't ask for the blessing; he volunteered it and gave it to me. So I expected that his promises would take place. We've been married five years, but we have no children.<br><br>"Later on a member of the stake presidency gave me a blessing and promised me that my health would be increased, but my health isn't any better. Do you know what it's like to have someone throw a lifebuoy out to you if you're drowning in the middle of the ocean? You swim and swim and finally get there, but when you reach out to take hold of it he pulls it away from you again. You swim and you swim farther, and you finally get there, but he always pulls it away. I don't believe in a God like that. I believe my bishop, and he's a great man, and I believe in the stake presidency and the president of the First Council of the Seventy. I know they are honest and upright men, but I don't believe in a God who would not keep his promises. I want to be excommunicated from the Church."<br><br>When I heard this sweet soul tell me that story, I want to tell you I sat there and wept with her. I've never been through that. I've never had the Lord throw out a lifebuoy to me, let me swim toward it, and just as I got there pull it away from me. I haven't been through that kind of a test. As I heard this story, I thought in my heart, "Dear God, please, everything is riding on this interview. Help me to say the right thing today." After she had finished, I said, "You know, I really don't think you want to be excommunicated. You just want God to know that you're really serious. You want to let him know that you just can't take any more, that you've had your limit of pressure."<br><br>She replied, "Yes, that's part of it."<br><br>Then I said, "But you know, you need to develop a Job-like attitude. Job was a great soul, and he said, 'Though he [God] slay me, yet will I trust in him' (Job 13:15). If we have that kind of attitude it doesn't matter what we go through, our reward is certain in the next life. You've put a time limit on the Lord. You've been married five years. What if in five years and six months you get pregnant, and then you have this child? What if a short time later your health comes? These things haven't happened, so you expect them now. What if it isn't for five years and nine months? It might be seven years, or fifteen years, or maybe not in this life. But I promise you, as surely as God is in heaven, that those promises made by righteous priesthood bearers will take place in your life. Now you don't want to be excommunicated, do you?" I was teary-eyed.<br><br>She answered, "No, I really don't." The tears came a little faster then, and I wanted to say, "Would you like me to give you a blessing?" but I dared not do it.<br><br>She asked, "Bishop Featherstone, before I leave, would you please give me a blessing?" And so I gave her a blessing, and she left. I closed the door, went over and sat at the desk, and cried. Everything had hinged on that one interview, and God had been there. Why, at that very instant God had been answering her prayer, but she didn't even know it. He would continue to do so all through her life. You see, the God I worship has a thousand times more compassion than I have. If in my limited way I could see all that she had gone through and feel all that she had suffered enough, God would know much more than I ever could what suffering she should go through, the depth of it, and then at the right time he would not withhold those blessings from her. I hope you feel about that story the way I am trying to convey it to you. I think sometimes you feel as if God had thrown out the lifebuoy and then pulled it away from you. That isn't so. You must simply trust in him as Job did. "Though he slay me, yet will I trust in him."<br><h2><b>Trusting in the Lord Despite Hardships</b></h2><br>I am going to tell you something I would rather not tell you--something I've told just a few people, a select group. I have told it in the temple to the General Authorities one time and a few other places. The reason I tell it in the temple is that the General Authorities can see right into me. Lord Byron Buckingham said, "Make my heart like transparent crystals so that others may look into my heart and see the foulest deed my heart does hold." When I am in the presence of the Brethren I feel as if they can see inside of me anyway, and so there's nothing to hide. If I really had my druthers, I'd rather not tell you this, but I am going to tell you. I know this speech is on TV and will be on tape, and I thought about this at the time I prepared what I would say. I'm telling you because I hope that in some small way you will get the message that I'm going to leave with you in this story.<br><br>I didn't have a college education, and I have been embarrassed about it. I've tried to compensate for it. Here are all of you wonderful young people at BYU--all getting the thing that I've longed for and hungered for. I tried to compensate by buying books, and I have thousands--I don't know how many books. I've got them on all my walls, and I've tried to read every one of them to educate myself, because when I was younger I couldn't go through school--at least I thought I couldn't. Many of you have it much harder and have attended college. But I haven't, and so I have been embarrassed.<br><br>When I was 19 1/2, I went to the bishop and asked, "Bishop, can I go on a mission?"<br><br>He answered, "Well, we're only taking one per year per ward." I guess we had fifteen or eighteen boys of mission age, and I couldn't afford to go. He said, "I just suggest you get married." So I did, and we have this lovely family.<br><br>When I was about seven or eight years old, a friend of mine, Spike Herzog, said to me as I was coming home from school one day, "Why don't you come to Primary with me?"<br><br>And so I said, "Very good, Spike, I'd like to." So I went over to Primary with him, and after I had been there a short time, a year or so, I remember noticing a little box the Primary leaders checked off to show whether you were baptized or not. I hadn't been baptized, and I was nine years old by this time. I didn't know what baptism was, but I wanted that little box checked off. So I asked if I could be baptized. They said yes, and I was baptized.<br><br>During that time (and this is the part I would rather not tell), my dad was an alcoholic, and my mother wasn't a member of the Church. She has since joined and been through the temple, but then she wasn't even a member of the Church. I remember that on payday my mother would go over and stand against the mantel and look out the window up the street. She'd look and wait for the bus to come by that would drop Father off. I have seen her stand there from four-thirty to six-thirty, nine-thirty, and ten-thirty at night. She never moved; she just stared out that window waiting for Dad to come. No food in the house, nothing. The family would gather together and say, "Let's go to bed. We can't add one featherweight of burden to our mother's heart." And so we'd go to bed hungry.<br><br>The next morning I would get up, and I couldn't tell but that she had been up all night. Mother would come to me, hand me a list, and say, "Vaughn, would you take this up to the store? Ask Mr. Parsons, the neighborhood grocer, if we could charge these groceries, and tell him we don't have any food. Would you please do that?"<br><br>I would look up at her, and I'd say, "Mother, why do I always have to go? Can't you ask one of the other kids? Does it always have to be me?" But when I looked into her face and saw the heavy heart she had, I'd say, "I'll go." So I'd take the list, and I'd go out and get our old red wagon with the tires worn off and the rims worn flat. I would drag that wagon as slow as a human being could possibly walk up the street. I'd get to the store and go in and walk around the aisles trying to avoid Mr. Parsons, who by the way (I didn't know at the time) was a high priest in our ward. Finally I'd walk up to him and hand him this note, and he'd read it: "Dear Mr. Parsons, We don't have any food in the house. Would you mind charging fifty pounds of flour, a bucket of lard, some side pork, and a few things? We promise to pay back every penny when we get some money. Thanks. [Signed] Mrs. Featherstone."<br><br>I'd see that great high priest and store owner look at the letter, then look down at me, and tears would come to his eyes. He'd go get a big grocery cart, and then he would push it around the store and fill it up with all those things. He'd make out a charge slip and put it in the wagon, and then I'd drag it home. I've done that more times than I can tell you--embarrassed, bitterly embarrassed, every single time. I give the credit to my mother and older brothers in the family that we paid back every single penny that we ever borrowed from Mr. Parsons and from another grocer that gave us a charge account.<br><br>At about that same time we couldn't afford much clothing either. I had a pair of shoes that I'd wear to church. They weren't the best shoes. They had holes in the bottom sole, so I'd cut out pieces of cardboard and slide them in as an insole. When I went to church I would sit with both feet flat on the floor; I didn't want to raise one leg and have someone see "Quaker Oats" across the bottom of my shoe. I'd go off to church that way, and everything was fine until those shoes wore out. Then I didn't know what to do. I remember it was Saturday, and I thought, "I've got to go to church. Over at church I am somebody. They really care about me." I remember thinking that through, and I went to a little box of shoes some neighbors had given us. I went through them, but I could find only one pair of shoes that would fit me. (This is the part I am embarrassed even to tell you.) They were a pair of women's nurses' shoes. I thought, "How can I wear those? They'll laugh me to scorn over at church." And so I decided I wouldn't wear them, and I wouldn't go to church.<br><br>I went through that night, and the next morning--you know how your mind works--I knew I had to go! There was that terrible attraction over at church. I had to go. I decided what to do. I would run over there very early and sit down close to the front before anybody got there. I thought, "I'll put my feet back under the pew so no one can see them, and then I'll wait till everyone leaves. After they're gone I'll come running home half an hour later or something." That was my plan. I dashed over to church half an hour early, and it worked. Nobody was there. I put my feet back under the bench. Pretty soon everyone came in, and then all of a sudden someone announced: "We will now be separated for classes." I had forgotten you had to go to class. I want to tell you I was terrified. The ushers started coming down the aisle, they got to our row, and everybody got up and left. But I just sat there. I couldn't move. I knew I couldn't for fear that someone would see my shoes. But the social pressure was intense. That whole meeting just seemed to stop and wait until I moved, so I had to move. I got up and just followed the class downstairs.<br><br>I think I learned the greatest lesson I have ever learned in my life that day. I went downstairs, and the teacher had us sit in a big half-circle. Each of my shoes felt two feet in diameter. I can't tell you how embarrassed I was. I watched, but, do you know, not one of those eight-and nine-year-old children in that class laughed at me. Not one of them looked at me. No one pointed at my shoes. My teacher didn't look. I was looking all the time. I was watching everybody to see if anyone was looking at me. I didn't hear a word of the lesson. When it was finally over I dashed home, went in the house and thought to myself, "Thank goodness nobody saw them." How ridiculous! Of course they saw those nurses' shoes that I had to wear to church. But they had the fine instinct not to laugh. I guess the Lord knew that I had had all the pressure I could possibly take, that I couldn't take one particle more of pressure. I believe that all of us will find in our lives that some of our obstacles turn into advantages and great blessings.<br><br>My father was a great man when he was sober. Later on my mother and father were divorced. A short time after that I went one day to see my sweet mother. It was on the day Merlene and I were married. My older brother was the only one at the wedding from our side of the family. After the marriage, we went out to see my mother. I threw my arms around her and said, "I'd give anything in the world to have had you there with us this morning." She just couldn't make it. But I want to tell you she was there the next time, when the next brother got married. But bless that great champion's heart. She stood by us and was our great defender in those bitter years. She didn't give up on us; she stuck with us. Can you begin to understand how I feel about her?<br><br>What I am saying is that if the Lord will take a scroungy little kid like that, who had to wear nurses' shoes to church and had to go and beg for groceries, and if he will make him a high councilor or a stake president or the second counselor in the Presiding Bishopric, can you believe what he would do for you? Many of you are covenant children. Your parents were married in the temple, and so you are born in the covenant. The rest of you are going to this great institution, BYU, where the greatest learning process in the world can take place. God bless each one of you that you'll feel your sense of worth, that you'll understand who you really are. You are a royal generation. You have a great deal to offer. I don't care what the handicaps are that you think are so severe; you can overcome them. God bless each one of you, I pray from the depths of my soul as I ask a blessing upon you, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Vaughn J.

<h1>r Burden upon the Lord - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
My wonderful young friends of Brigham Young University, I greet you this morning in the attitude of love. I am grateful for this opportunity. I feel lifted up in your presence, and I pray that the Lord will bless us that we might communicate well here for these few moments. I am always pleased to see Women's Week come to BYU, and I want to promise you that there are no finer women in all the world than attend this University. During this past week I have had repeated in my mind very forcibly the wonderful admonition of the Lord--you see, Sister Simpson is now in New Zealand, eight thousand miles away--and I declare to all of you young men that it is not good for man to be alone.<br><h2><b>Importance of Eternal Companionship</b></h2><br>I don't know what I would do without my sweetheart and companion, and certainly in terms of eternity this companionship is what the gospel of Jesus Christ is all about. I had something happen a few years ago that was quite important to me. Sitting at my desk in southern California, I heard the telephone ring. I reached over to pick up what I thought was another routine telephone call, when the voice on the other end of the line said, "Brother Simpson, this is President David O. McKay speaking." I couldn't believe my ears; I couldn't believe that a prophet would be calling an ordinary member of the Church seven hundred miles away. During the next couple of minutes, he proceeded to call Sister Simpson and me to preside over the New Zealand Mission.<br><br>As I hung up the telephone in total shock, my first thought was the same as most of you have had as you have been called to Church positions--"Why me?" I then proceeded to think of dozens of others who might have been called instead. I thought to myself, "The prophet probably looked for someone who knew the Maori language," but immediately I jotted down a dozen names of other missionaries who knew how to speak the Maori language as well as or better than I. Then I thought to myself, "He probably needs someone who has had administrative experience in the Church, such as in a bishopric or high council." Then I proceeded to jot down another list of returned New Zealand missionaries who had had this experience. Then this thought came to my mind--indelible, sharp, and clear--"But of all these men, you're the only one married to Jelaire Chandler, and that's why the Lord has called you." Now, young people, that's how important it is to find a sweetheart and companion to be at your side who can supplement you in your priesthood and share with you the dream of exaltation and eternal life together.<br><br>You young men who are over twenty-five, you young bachelors, this should be a great week for you! I am sure you feel very comfortable in your life-style of peanut butter, TV dinners, and another young lady to date next Friday night. This syndrome of peanut butter, TV dinners, and another date next Friday night sounds like going around in circles. I want to promise you that too much circling can be a deterrent to eternal progression. Don't allow yourselves to fall into a "convenient" rut or to become involved in a life-style that is too easy and brings you only momentary happiness. I want to encourage you to reach out and think seriously about all that the Lord has in store for you, but those things must be done in proper sequence and in proper time in order for you to remain on schedule for the maximum blessing.<br><br>I was so grateful to hear this lovely women's chorus sing today. Their song, "Cast Thy Burden upon the Lord," fits exactly into what I'd like to say this morning. How many people we have who attempt to struggle through life with great problems, unable to do all that the Lord has in mind for them, simply because they refuse to cast their burdens upon the Lord through his appointed representatives.<br><h2><b>Motivations for Doing Right</b></h2><br>We do right for various reasons. Some people do right simply because they don't want to be punished for doing wrong. When we do right for fear of retribution, I think our foundation is very shaky. Another might say, "I want to do right because I have always been taught that this is the thing to do." Well, such reasoning is based on hearsay, on the testimony of others, and I think we need to mature beyond that point. I think we need to have our own testimonies instead of the advice of others on a perpetual basis. Others have been heard to say, "I want to do right just to please my parents," and although we all should have a desire to please our parents, that reason alone is not sufficient to sustain us throughout eternity. Perhaps you have heard people who have indicated that they are doing the right thing simply because they want to be obedient to God's commands; this, too, is a very high and noble purpose--provided, of course, that that obedience is not blind obedience, without personal conviction. But to me the best reason of all is illustrated by the person who feels the desire to do right because he wants to add glory to his Father in heaven. Whatever stage of motivation we find ourselves in, I think we must eventually reinforce this with our own personal testimony which has been built on a foundation of gospel scholarship and understanding--a testimony which leads us to the life of unselfishness and service, one which finds its highest sanctification in the supreme thought that we are living gospel principles because we desire to glorify his great name.<br><br>"For behold, this is my work and my glory--to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man" (Moses 1:39). This tremendous scripture summarizes in one sentence the sum and substance, the purpose of all creation. When I was young, I always assumed it would be impossible for God to participate further in the great process of eternal progression. After all, he was perfect. All knowledge was his. He had indeed overcome all things. But understanding this scripture, I now know that he is capable of further glorification or exaltation. Indeed he is added upon through the success of his children. Your failure or my failure diminishes his possibilities. Our success in righteous endeavors adds further glory to his name. Should not that be the perfect motivation? It is perfect because it is without selfish interest.<br><h2><b>The Necessity of Repentance</b></h2><br>You and I have been taught all of our lives that this mortal span is to overcome--to overcome those attributes that would not be compatible with his presence. The thought has often crossed my mind that we will each be capable of our own judgment. We will want to seek our own kind, to be in the presence of that life-style that we have grown accustomed to. Wouldn't you like to feel at home in the presence of the father and the mother who gave birth to your spirit? To feel obligated to go someplace else would be the greatest disappointment of all time, in my opinion. The plan is clear. God the Father, whom you and I seek, is at the top, and our most urgent task here is to overcome every thought and every act that might prevent us from regaining his holy presence. Without the great principle of repentance, I doubt that any of us would have a chance to achieve exaltation or eternal life.<br><br>When the plan of salvation was formulated, when it was decided that there would be opposition in all things, and when it was further decided that free agency would be available to all men, God knew then and there that there would be of necessity a procedure by which corrections could be made, whereby the burdens of sin, bad habits, wrong choices could be compensated for. He called this procedure repentance and associated with it a companion piece called the miracle of forgiveness. Pride, arrogance, and selfishness are all tools of the adversary. Pride, arrogance, and selfishness are prime barriers to repentance and to our ability to forgive one another.<br><br>All great concepts have simple equations, something like Einstein's theory of relativity, which is simply stated<i>E=mc<sup>2</sup>.</i>the simple formula for repentance is found in the Doctrine and Covenants: "By this ye may know if a man repenteth of his sins--behold, he will confess them and forsake them" (D&amp;amp;C 58:43). "Confess and forsake"--both so difficult to achieve in the negative climate of pride, arrogance, selfishness, and fear; both so possible in the framework of faith, love, humility, and courage.<br><h2><b>The Process of Repentance</b></h2><br>I think you will find that the great majority of problems taken before a bishop are handled quietly, confidentially, and unobtrusively by the bishop alone. Most frequently he will not deem it necessary to convene a bishop's court. Of course, here on this campus we talk about branch presidents, but these brethren carry the same authority: they are common judges; they are your bishops.<br><br>Forgiveness would likely follow a period of probation, depending of course on the magnitude of the problem. Also, the bishop would likely request a periodic check to make certain that everything was proceeding as agreed. Then, eventually, the member finds new security in his new-found freedom, in his ability to put that problem behind him. Another burden has been unloaded; another barrier to exaltation has been removed. New peace of mind can now replace a troubled heart, and that old feeling of hypocrisy is replaced by a clear conscience. Where serious transgression requires a court hearing, may I promise you, my dear young friends, that the procedure is kind, and it is gentle. The Church court system is just. As has been stated on many occasions, these are courts of love with the singular objective of helping Church members to get back on a proper course. There is no plan in Heavenly Father's realm to put his children down. Everything is designed to aid our progress, not to impede it. I wish I could introduce you to scores of people that I know personally who have been excommunicated from this Church but who have come back through the waters of baptism, who have found their way and who have had a restoration of all their blessings. They now stand on more firm ground than they have ever been on during most of their lives. Without appropriate priesthood discipline, I am doubtful that they could ever achieve the position of renewed confidence they stand in today.<br><h2><b>The Church Court System</b></h2><br>Relatively few Church members really understand the Church court system, and that's why I have chosen to share with you this morning a few of these thoughts so that you might feel confidence in the Lord's way. There is an unjustified fear of Church courts in the hearts of many, and this is exactly the way the adversary wants it to be. Anytime he can keep someone from making things right, he scores a victory. He scores a victory for his cause. Unfortunately, many in the Church regard the bishop's court and the high council court as courts of retribution. Such is not the case; these courts provide a necessary procedure without which many will never really achieve the lofty and eternal goals that you and I have in mind.<br><br>Let us take a quick look at the bishop's court. If the initial confidential interview with the bishop reveals a serious irregularity, he many decide to convene a bishop's court. The court consists of the three members of the ward bishopric. They may consider the matter of excommunication for any member of the church living in the ward except for a member who holds the Melchizedek Priesthood. The bishop's court, however, may render a decision of disfellowshipment or probation for any member of the ward, including Melchizedek Priesthood holders. The high council court, on the other hand, is under the direction of the stake president and consists of the stake presidency and members of the high council. This court has the authority to conduct hearings for any member of the church residing in that stake, and they have jurisdiction over both Aaronic and Melchizedek Priesthood holders and may impose a decision of excommunication where appropriate.<br><br>All Church courts usually convene in the attitude of fasting and prayer. Total justice and harmony with the revealed word of the Lord become the prime objectives of a Church court. Judgment that is too light or too harsh often defeats the purposes of the Lord. No case should be prejudged. Only after hearing the facts and judging the spirit of the individual can proper justice be administered. A fair hearing and a final decision of the court, ratified by the gifts of the Spirit, will always be in the best interest of the member being tried.<br><br>It has been truly stated that far more important than the transgression is what is in the heart of the individual who seeks repentance. It is unfortunate indeed when people who have committed serious violation try to avoid confrontation with the priesthood authority in their ward or stake. Such people are seldom sorry for what they have done. They are only sorry that they have been caught. In the words of President Kimball, "Blessed are they who humble themselves without being compelled."<br><br>Even excommunication from the Church need not be the end of all hope. Although the mistake has been a grievous and serious violation of God's commandments, a person who really loves the Lord and has the desire and the fortitude to submit himself to priesthood authority can reestablish his life and in due process qualify himself for the lofty and ultimate blessings of eternity, including exaltation. Even the gross offender will be welcomed back by the Lord: "Though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow" (Isaiah 1:18)--what a great promise, what a great redemption! But this cannot happen without complete repentance, and complete repentance involves the formula we talked about before: that we confess, that we forsake.<br><h2><b>Causes of Excommunication</b></h2><br>There are very few reasons for excommunication in this Church. I can think of only about three. Let me enumerate for you. First, Church members can become candidates for excommunication as they involve themselves in gross iniquity. Second, Church members become candidates for excommunication as they become involved in or advocate plural marriage. There is no place for this doctrine in the Church today. Third, Church members become candidates for excommunication as they apostatize from the teachings of the Church.<br><br>What about this thing we call gross iniquity? In my opinion, gross iniquity would involve such transgressions as murder, adultery, sexual perversion, or any serious offense against society that has resulted in conviction by the civil courts. A good example would be a felony.<br><br>On the subject of apostasy, it should be made clear that an apostate is not an indifferent or an inactive member of the Church, but rather one who flatly denies the divine nature of the Church or who is antagonistic against or unresponsive to his priesthood authority. We do not excommunicate people from this Church for indifference or for inactivity. Some of the unhappiest people that I know are members of the church who are attempting to live with a habit that is contrary to their basic belief. They love the Lord and feel that they are betraying him. This is an untenable situation. Left unsolved, the conflict causes rationalization to set in. Satan lulls us into a sense of false security. We lie to ourselves as we attempt to justify rather than to change, and thus the adversary leads us quietly down to a life of unhappiness and regret.<br><br>I remember a prisoner whom I talked to on one occasion. This prisoner was deeply embarrassed about being in prison. I talked to him about repentance; and, not knowing what he was there for, I said, "My good brother, are you in here for stealing?"<br><br>"Oh, no. My mother taught me not to steal. I wouldn't steal anything from anybody. I am in here for forgery." Well, rationalization can do some odd things to people.<br><br>We talked about great concepts and simple formulas for solution. James had this to say to those in need of help: "Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you" (James 4:7). I believe this. I have seen it happen. The bishop is your advocate with God by ordination; and so, as you decide to submit yourselves to God, you must submit yourselves to his priesthood authority. For he has told us that whether it is spoken by his voice or by the voice of his servants, it is the same. And so it is.<br><h2><b>Need for Self-Control</b></h2><br>Have the courage to maintain control of your eternal destiny. There are no shortcuts, my wonderful young friends, no shortcuts in terms of exaltation and eternal life. President Kimball, in his great book<i>The Miracle of Forgiveness,</i>quotes the following:<br><br><i>The height of a man's success is gauged by his self-mastery; the depth of his failure, by his self-abandonment. There is no other limitation in either direction. And this law is the expression of eternal justice. He who cannot establish a dominion over himself will have no dominion over others. He who masters himself shall be king.</i>[Author unknown]<br><br>Has the thought ever occurred to you that God is depending on you, as a member of this Church, to take charge eventually, to have dominion? You'd better believe it. Shouldn't self-mastery come first? It can happen in no other way. We cannot have dominion, principality, and powers except we gain mastery over ourselves and have dominion over our own feelings and impulses. Why wait? Procrastination invites rationalization. It was Mark Twain who quipped, "I know I can quit smoking. Why, I've quit a thousand times." and don't we find ourselves saying, "Why, I can just turn it off just like that. When the time comes, I'll be able to stop"? And then there are those who contemplate a magic curtain out there in time and space, and as we pass through that magic curtain, we just automatically void ourselves of all the bad habits and all the things that we're not proud of. This idea is a delusion. It is false. It is the teaching of the adversary.<br><br>Maybe we could quote Tagore, who said, "I have spent my days stringing and unstringing my instrument while the song I came to sing remains unsung." We go around in circles, and we spend our time in triviality when we should get on with that which the Lord has given us to do by way of foreordination.<br><h2><b>Strengthening Others</b></h2><br>Now, speaking again of unselfish motives, I would like to observe that, as important and as immediately satisfying as these personal corrections in life might be, one of the most interesting and satisfying possibilities lies ahead as we, having overcome, can now reach back in added strength to assist others to do likewise. This is really the essence of the gospel of Jesus Christ, for it was the Savior who said, "Love thy neighbor" (Matthew 5:43); "Feed my sheep" (John 21:16); "Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me" (Matthew 25:40). Luke relates this conversation of the Savior, speaking to Peter: "Simon, Simon, behold, Satan hath desired to have you, that he may sift you as wheat: But I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not: and when thou are converted, strengthen thy brethren" (Luke 22:31–32). When thou are converted, strengthen thy brethren. Doing this can bring the most soul-satisfying joy that I know of here in mortality. As managing director of the Church's Social Services program, I see thousands upon thousands of volunteers quietly reaching out to lift the alcoholic, to help the drug abuser, to make provisions for an unwed mother that her life might be reconstructed, to spend time with a prisoner that he might be able to get back on a proper track.<br><br>Our charge is no different; "When thou art converted, strengthen they brethren" holds for you and me as well as for Simon Peter. Our repentance can be a double victory as we give ourselves to the Lord in this process of helping others. It can be a great victory for ourselves and for those that we lift up after we have been made stronger. Here again we emphasize the positive, the unselfish act, as the supreme fulfillment of all that we are trying to do.<br><h2><b>Gaining Exaltation</b></h2><br>Young people, the Lord loves you, and Heavenly Father has not given one single principle that would condemn. Even excommunication is temporary and can only make the future possibilities brighter. His work, and his glory, is to exalt. One more encouraging note, especially for you students (with all due respect to these illustrious faculty members I see here today), is that God doesn't grade on the curve. He would like us all to get an A. And he has made that provision--everybody can get an A--but we have to qualify for it. Don't become an ally to Satan's plan of unhappiness and destruction. Don't you do it. You learn to take advantage of the Lord's purification processes. We have talked about them here today.<br><br>"Cast Thy Burden upon the Lord." I am sure that Brother Evan Davis was inspired to select this great hymn today. It fits in so beautifully with the theme of our discussion. Let your heart be in tune. Let it be in tune so that you can receive this blessing:<br><br><i>That the doctrine of the priesthood shall distil upon thy soul as the dews from heaven.</i><br><br><i>That the Holy Ghost shall be thy constant companion, that thy scepter might be an unchanging scepter of righteousness and truth; and that thy dominion shall be an everlasting dominion, and that without compulsory means it shall flow unto thee forever and ever.</i>[See D&amp;amp;C 121:45–46]<br><br>That is what this Church is all about. I want to bear you my solemn witness that I know that God lives, that I know that Jesus Christ is his son, and that I know the ordained priesthood officers in the church are good men, servants of our Heavenly Father, who give themselves unselfishly to the work so that you and I might have proper direction, so that you and I might be able to cast our burdens upon the Lord, and so that you and I might be able to qualify for that great eternal destiny involving a man, a woman, a family unit led by priesthood authority. I pray that we might so live and so qualify ourselves in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Robert L.

<br>
President Oaks, members of the faculty, members of the student body, friends and guests, it is a high honor to be invited by the President of your University to address a group such as this, and I am highly concerned with it. I don't think that I have ever faced a visible audience larger than this, but I have faced in my imagination many audiences of various sizes over television and radio.<br><br>My first experience speaking before a student body of Brigham Young University was given to me at the invitation of Dr. Ernest Wilkinson, a friend whom I had long admired and been associated with, about seventeen years ago. At that time I talked on the subject of law and entitled the speech "Joseph Smith and the Rule of Probabilities." As is the case today, on that occasion I had quite a group--almost a hand-picked group--of relatives and friends who were there to hear me. They assured me that it was a good talk. But, when I consider the fact that it has taken me seventeen years to get a second invitation, I'll have to appraise that first effort with a good deal of modesty.<br><br>Today, again, I would like to discuss with you the law--this time, not the law that is made by legislatures, but the higher law, which I conceive of as law that has been discovered rather than made--law that is quite different in some respects from the laws of men and in other respects may coincide with it. The laws of men come and go; they are fleeting. They change with the going and the coming of legislators. The statute books of our states are filled with laws--some of them good, some of them bad, some of them useless, some of them useful but not founded in fact or upon reality. An example of these last-mentioned laws is the presumption of law that if a man disappears and is absent from his family for a period--usually a period of seven years--and if his family, after making contacts with those who would most likely know of his existence if he were still alive, has no evidence to bear out the fact that he is alive, then the law presumes him to be dead. This may be a reality; it may not be a reality. One of the English jurists, Lord Darling, commented on this law in these words: "If a man stay away from his wife for seven years, the law presumes the separation to have killed him; yet according to our daily experience, it might well prolong his life."<br><br>The law that I shall speak of today is the law that is eternal, unchangeable, universal, everlastingly true, founded in reason and in fact--law that does not change with changes in the attitudes of people. We must conform our attitudes to this law; the law will not conform to our attitudes. I think of the laws of God in the same sense in which I think of the laws of nature, the laws of gravitation, the laws of motion, the laws of chemical combination. They are there everlastingly, discovered by God, revealed to man by him as we are prepared to receive them. I am going to borrow a definition of law for the purpose of this talk from the distinguished French writer André Maurois. He said, "Laws are the necessary relations which follow from the nature of things." When man comes to realize that true laws are the necessary relations that follow from the nature of things and are not made or created but are discovered, then he begins to understand that his blessings, as well as his misfortunes, are the necessary results of his obedience to or violation of law.<br><h2><b>The Law of Health</b></h2><br>With this definition in mind, let us turn to an analysis of some of the principles of the gospel. We'll take as our first example a very simple one--the law of health that is known as the Word of Wisdom. Incidentally, we will commemorate the 141st anniversary of the giving of that law tomorrow. The Lord, in the prohibitions referred to in that law, said this: "Inasmuch as any man drinketh wine or strong drink among you, behold it is not good. ... Strong drinks are not for the belly, but for the washing of your bodies" (D&amp;amp;C 89:5, 7). Parenthetically, I think he referred to an external washing. "And again, tobacco is not for the body, neither for the belly, and is not good for man" (D&amp;amp;C 89:8).<br><br>Let me ask you a question. Do you suppose that the day before this law was given or revealed, ten days before it, ten years before it, a millennium before it, tobacco was good for man and good for the belly, which includes the whole abdominal cavity from the breast to the thighs? Do you suppose that it was good for man and that the giving of the law, ipso facto, made it bad? Why, the answer to that is so obvious that the question is an idle one. There is something about the nature of the body of man and of nicotine, which is in the tobacco, that when nicotine is taken or absorbed into the body it sets up some harmful relations that are necessary results of the relationship between them. The illnesses, the ailments, that have been charged by individual scientists and individual physicians to the use of tobacco are so numerous that to enumerate them in ordinary type would give us a list as long as the arm. I have made a note of forty-four of these illnesses, and I am going to refer to just a few of them here: duodenal ulcer; liver hemorrhages; kidney degeneration; heightened blood pressure; degeneration of the heart muscle; heart block; Bright's disease, which is a degeneration of the kidneys and the imperfect elimination of uric acid; tobacco epilepsy; cancer of the mouth and throat; premature senility; apoplexy.<br><br>I wouldn't have you believe, nor would I advise you that the medical profession as a whole or that scientists as a whole would accept, the thesis that all of these ailments are chargeable to tobacco, that they are all the direct, proximate result of the absorption of nicotine. They wouldn't even agree that some of these ailments are in a contributive way the responsibility of tobacco. But the case against tobacco is so well proved that, if it weren't for the profit element in its production and sale, there would undoubtedly be a national law against its use. A national law against its use might not accomplish very much either, because it takes men a long time to accept law. It takes them a long time to learn. There are men too dull to learn that our blessings or our misfortunes are the result of obedience or disobedience. An English author, Sir Thomas Pope Blount, has said that "some will never learn anything because they understand everything too soon." And that's the case with many men.<br><h2><b>The Laws of Repentance and Baptism</b></h2><br>I cannot and do not pretend to be able to point to the fundamental, basic, eternal principles involved in all of the commandments of the Lord. I have no trouble with the principle of repentance. The recognition of mistakes, the sorrow or regret for them, the resolution to proceed in a new and better course, and the actual proceeding in that course comprise repentance. I have no difficulty in seeing that it is a fundamental, eternal principle of progression. But when it comes to baptism, in the words of Paul, "[I] see through a glass, darkly" (1 Corinthians 13:12). I see all the symbolism attached to it: the likeness of it to a birth, the likeness of it to a death, the likeness to the death and the burial and the resurrection of the Master. Just as he came forth from that stony tomb, each of us comes froth from the watery grave to a newness of life, putting away the old life and living a new and better one. I can understand all of these things, but they do not explain to me the great importance that God has placed upon baptism. The Master said that, without it, no man could enter into the kingdom of God (see John 3:5). Perhaps it is a matter of obedience. Perhaps it is a matter even more significant than that. When men make covenants and contracts with one another, it is common practice to reduce them to writing so that they may have a witness of the nature of the covenant and of the making of the covenant. Perhaps baptism serves the Lord's purpose as a witness of the making of covenants on the part of his children. Alma so expressed his opinion when he, having fled from those who were about to destroy him among the followers of King Noah, went to the place that was called Mormon. Here his disciples began coming to him in secret and by night for fear of the persecution that would involve them if they came in the daytime. Alma said these significant words to them:<br><br><i>Behold, here are the waters of Mormon,... now, as ye are desirous to come into the fold of God, and to be called his people, and are willing to bear one another's burdens, that they may be light;</i><br><br><i>Yea, and are willing to mourn with those that mourn; yea, and comfort those that stand in need of comfort, and to stand as witnesses of God at all times and in all things, and in all places that ye may be in, even until death....</i><br><br><i>Now I say unto you, if this be the desire of your hearts, what have you against being baptized in the name of the Lord, as a witness before him that ye have entered into a covenant with him, that ye will serve him and keep his commandments?</i>[Mosiah 18:8–10]<br><br>Perhaps that is the principle, the everlasting principle, that underlies the ordinance of baptism. It is our witness to God that we are willing to serve and obey him.<br><h2><b>The Covenant of the Higher Priesthood</b></h2><br>When we make covenants with God, usually they are not unilateral covenants, for God makes reciprocal covenants with us. His covenants may be implied or expressed. As a good example of an express covenant, I refer you to the covenant that is made when you receive the priesthood--the higher priesthood. Man covenants with God to magnify that priesthood, to live by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God. And God makes covenants with him. These reciprocal covenants are set out in the 84th section of the Doctrine and Covenants. They are comprehended in that final statement of his covenant, as follows: "All that my Father hath shall be given unto him" (D&amp;amp;C 84:38). That is an express covenant; God promises to give to us all that he has, provided we honor our covenants. What God gives to us, however, he gives to us through obedience to law.<br><br>A story might be interjected here. I have a brother sitting here before me who has served you for many years as a doctor in the McDonald Student Health Center. He has been a very, very liberal brother in the benefactions he has given to the family. For years he sent us Christmas gifts the like of which we could not reciprocate. One year when Sister Edmunds and I felt that we had a few extra dollars, we decided to make a present to him and his wife, a Christmas present that would be somewhat commensurate with what they had been doing for us. We went to one of the large stores in the Chicago Loop, one of the very prominent stores in the Midwest, and selected a beautiful set of china plates that were to cost us quite a sum of money. As I took out the check and began to fill it in, I said to the clerk, "I don't want this sent out now." It was then the middle of November, and I didn't want the gift to appear as an invitation to my brother to go the extra mile and outdo me. So I said to the clerk, "I want you to hold this until the middle of December and then ship it."<br><br>She said, "It is against the policy of the store to do that. If you pay for merchandise fully, we must send it out within a reasonable time. But you can do this: you can make a small payment on account and then, when you want the merchandise sent out, you can come into the store, pay the balance, and we'll be glad to ship it." We made a small payment and left.<br><br>About the middle of December I said to Sister Edmunds, "Don't you think it's about time we had that gift sent to Paul and Ella?" She agreed that it was and said she would go in and make the payment and order its shipment. During the afternoon, a few minutes after she had entered the store, I received a distress call at my office from my wife. She said, "Something terrible has happened. I came into this store and I spoke to one of the clerks and told her that I had come to make the balance payment on a gift we had ordered and to have it shipped to Utah. The clerk left me for a few minutes, came back, and then told me that the gift had been sent. I told her I didn't see how it could have been because we hadn't paid for it. She said, 'Well, it was sent COD.'" What followed that in the telephone conversation is best described by my wife. She said, "When I told you that, there was a dead silence. I know that you are not a swearing man." (This is her story; I am not admitting to anything.) "But you broke the silence of the telephone by saying, 'Did you ever hear of anything so damned dumb?'" After saying that, embarrassment crowded in upon my mind, and I immediately wrote a letter of apology to my brother and sent him the money that he had had to pay to take the gift out of the mail.<br><br>In due course, I received a response from him which was very interesting. He said, "We could hardly believe, John, that you were sending us a Christmas gift COD. But we entered into the spirit of the thing and we took it out. We called in our friends and showed them this beautiful gift and told them how we had received it. Our friends and neighbors have come to the conclusion that it was a very smart idea. They're all for bigger and better Christmas gifts. And we're already planning on what we will send you for Christmas next year."<br><br>As I contemplated what I might receive the next year, I thought to myself, "Well, I have to be a good sport. I'll have to take it--whether it's a wheelchair or an elephant." Then I thought to myself, "There are some gifts he could send me that I wouldn't mind paying for COD." Then the thought came to me, "Why, aren't all of our blessings sent to us in that same manner? Does not God give us our blessings COD?"<br><h2><b>Many Blessings Predicated on Future Obedience</b></h2><br>"There is a law, irrevocably decreed," the Lord said, "... upon which all blessings are predicated--And when we obtain any blessing from God, it is by obedience to that law upon which it is predicated" (D&amp;amp;C 130:20–21). Isn't this in a sense a COD blessing? I think it is. The greatest blessing our Heavenly Father can give us, he said, is the blessing of eternal life (see D&amp;amp;C 14:7). He can't give us that as one would give a birthday present; that's something he can only give us COD. We pay the price and we receive the blessing.<br><br>We have all made successful starts toward eternal life. Eternal life is more than just living forever, more than immortality. Eternal life is to live a life like unto our Eternal Father's, to have the privilege and power and knowledge to become creators, to organize and form earths, to people worlds, to become heavenly fathers and heavenly mothers ourselves. We have taken the first step toward that in keeping our preexistent estate so that we might come to earth and have bodies.<br><br>We also have other tests, and there are other steps that must be taken. We must live according to the light and truth that have come into our lives--the light and truth that we have received or have had the opportunity to receive, had we reached for them. We must enter into the covenant of baptism. We must accept and enter into the covenant of baptism. We must accept and enter into the covenant of the holy priesthood. We must receive our endowments in the holy temples of God. We must enter into the covenant of eternal marriage in that holy place. I have seen so many couples who come into the Salt Lake Temple for marriage, coming in groups, day after day. In one month alone, the month of August 1973, we had 1,113 couples come to that temple to receive this sacred ordinance, which is required for eternal life. As I performed some of these marriages, I said to these couples, "We can give you the ordinance, but we can't give you eternal marriage. That is your decision; that is your job. That you must earn. You must endure in righteousness to the end. You have nothing made by simply coming here. Nothing is ever made that you do not make yourself. You will have to continue in righteousness to the end of your lives, living 'by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.'"<br><br>When I think of eternal life, the thought is beyond my comprehension. Whenever I consider the words that were phrased by Lorenzo Snow, "As man is, God once was; as God is, man may be," there seems to loom up before me an unclimbable mountain. Then I begin to take comfort in some of the thoughts that I have heard. One of them was expressed by Nicholas Murray Butler: "When the plains rise, the mountains look small." I don't know that this mountain of godhood that we call "eternal life" will ever look small, but I believe that it is climbable. I believe it will take all the faith, all the desire, all the will, all the strength, all the potential that I have as a son of God to climb that mountain, but I believe it is climbable because God said it was. He revealed it to the Prophet Joseph and Sidney Rigdon in a great vision and revelation in the year 1832 (see D&amp;amp;C 76). And he has said of his revelations, "What I the Lord have spoken, I have spoken, and I excuse not myself; and though the heavens and the earth pass away, my word shall not pass away, but shall all be fulfilled" (D&amp;amp;C 1:38).<br><h2><b>God's Laws Designed to Make Us Perfect</b></h2><br>The Savior gave to us a tremendous challenge. The challenge was this: "Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect" (Matthew 5:48). This is the purpose of the law--the perfection of mankind. Unlike the laws of man, which often do not lead to any perfection, the laws of God were designed and revealed for our perfection. The laws of men are sometimes revealed for our restraint and for our control, and so on. They may be successful or unsuccessful. One satirical writer has said of the laws of men, "The law can make you quit drinking [which I doubt], but the law can't make you quit being the kind that needs a law to make you quit drinking" (Donald Robert Perry Marquis). That's the case with the laws of men. The laws of God have a great persuasion, and accompanied by the Spirit of God they can lead man on to perfection.<br><br>We know the way, we know the reward, and we know the cost that we must pay. The question for each of us to answer is this: Will we abide the law? Will we pay the cost? God cannot give to man that which man is not willing and prepared to receive. Through his love and mercy he reveals the law, but he can't give to man eternal life unless man will prepare himself through obedience to the law to receive eternal life. Laws are the necessary relations which follow from the nature of things. God has said that "he who is not able to abide the law of a celestial kingdom cannot abide a celestial glory. And he who cannot abide the law of a terrestrial kingdom cannot abide a terrestrial glory" (D&amp;amp;C 88:22–23). There is something about the nature of man that, when he abides the celestial law, he produces a celestial body. When he abides the terrestrial law, he produces a terrestrial body. There is no chance and there is no accident in this. It follows as a necessary relation of his obedience to law.<br><br>My brothers and my sisters, young and old, this is within your reach. This is within your power. And I want to say to you that, when eternal life is at stake, no man can afford indifference. And eternal life<i>is</i>at stake.<br><br>I heard a story told by a doctor in Salt Lake many years ago. He said that he had left his home one night to make a house call. A patient called while he was away, and his young daughter answered the phone. She told him that the doctor wasn't there. The patient said, "This is an emergency. I must be able to reach him. Where is he?"<br><br>She replied, "I don't know, but he said he was going out on an eternity case."<br><br>Each of our lives, day after day, is an eternity case with us. Where will you spend your postmortal life? Will you spend it with a family? Will you have a wife? Will you have your children in the life hereafter? You may say, as many of our people say, "Nobody can take my wife away and nobody can take my children away from me." President Brigham Young said, "The right to say 'This is my wife and these are my children' depends upon your obedience to the commandments of God."<br><br>Yes, laws are the necessary relations which follow from the nature of things. Choose well the law and make your choice for eternity. When eternal life is the stake, you cannot afford indifference. I bear witness to these truths in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>John K.

<h1>est in Us - Truman G. Madsen - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
May I begin with an incident from our history which, when I first read it, inflamed me and changed my life. In the 1830s there was a student at Oberlin College whose name was Lorenzo Snow. He was disillusioned with what he saw of religion in general and Christianity in particular. He wrote a letter to his sister who had become a Latter-day Saint, Eliza R. Snow, and confessed his difficulties. She wrote back and invited him to Kirtland. He came. Within a few moments, as I read the story, he was inside the temple, the building which at that time served, as many of you know, more than one purpose. It served<i>all</i>of the fundamental functions of the Church. As he entered, there was a meeting in progress, a small one. Patriarchal blessings were being given by the Prophet's father, Joseph Smith, Sr. He listened, first incredulous, then open, and toward the end inspired. He kept saying to himself, "Can this be simply a man or is there something divine involved?" He came more and more to feel that the Spirit was in it.<br><br>At the end of that, the Prophet's father took his hand (there had been no introduction as I read it) and, still filled with the light of his calling, said two things to him. "You will become one of us." Lorenzo Snow understood that but didn't believe it. But now the blockbuster. "And you will become great--even as great as God is. And you could not wish to become greater." That, young Lorenzo Snow did not understand. Shortly the first prediction was fulfilled. The story of his conversion, of his baptism, of the overwhelming later experience after a confirmation which he felt left him somewhat stillborn, when he was so immersed by the influences of God that for several nights he could hardly sleep, burning, he says, with a "tangible awareness" of God in a way that changed him--that story there isn't time for.<br><h2><b>Lorenzo Snow's Revelation About Perfection</b></h2><br>But I now move you to a later period in his life. He had served; he had become one of our great and dedicated missionaries. He was sitting discussing the scriptures with a brother in Nauvoo. At that moment something happened to him which in later life he called an impression; sometimes he spoke of it as a vision, sometimes as an overwhelming revelation. He came to glimpse the meaning of what had been said to him. And he formed it in a couplet which we hesitate, all of us, and I think wisely, to cite in discussion or conversation but which is a sacred, glorious insight. It's a couplet; he put it in faultless rhythm: "As man now is God once was. As God now is man may become." He says he saw a conduit, as it were, down through which, in fact, by our very nature, by our being begotten of our eternal parents, we descend and up through which we may ascend. It struck him with power that if a prince born to a king will one day inherit his throne, so a son of an eternal father will one day inherit the fullness of his father's kingdom.<br><br>Suddenly he recovered the verses, repeated but without depth, of the New Testament that we are commanded to become perfect; then, lest we should relativize that, the Master had added, "even as your Father." The verses in 1 John vibrate with his comprehension of love: "Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that<i>we</i>should be called the sons of God. . . . Beloved, now<i>are we</i>the sons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is" (1 John 3:1–2; emphasis added).<br><br>That became a guiding star to young Lorenzo Snow. It went with him through other callings and sacrifices. He hardly dared breathe it--even to his intimates--except to his sister, Eliza, and later during a close missionary discussion with Brother Brigham Young. Not a word had been spoken by the Prophet Joseph specifically giving that principle. But Lorenzo knew it. And you can imagine how he felt when, sitting in the Nauvoo Grove, April 1844, the Prophet Joseph Smith arose and said with power, "God was once a man as we are now."<br><h2><b>Sectarian Concepts of Deity</b></h2><br>Now may I take you elsewhere to sympathize for a moment with the outlook others have on this and to understand why it is so sacred and must be kept so. In a discussion at a widely known theological seminary in the East, I was asked, "What is the Mormon understanding of God?" I struggled to testify. Then three of the most learned of their teachers, not with acrimony but with candor, said, "Let us explain why we cannot accept this. First of all, you people talk of God in terms that are human--all too human." (That's a phrase, incidentally, from Nietzsche.) "But the second problem is worse. You dare to say that man can become like God." And they held up a hand and said, "Blasphemy." Well, that hurts a little. I was led to ask two series of questions. (Mind you, I'm telling you the story. I'm not sure they would tell it the same way. I've had a chance to improve it in the interim.)<br><br>The first was a series of questions about the nature of Christ. "Was he a person?"<br><br>"Yes."<br><br>"Did he live in a certain place and time?"<br><br>"Yes."<br><br>"Was he embodied?"<br><br>"Yes."<br><br>"Was he somewhere between five and seven feet in height?"<br><br>"Well, we hadn't thought of it, but, yes, we suppose he was."<br><br>"Was he resurrected with his physical body?"<br><br>"He was."<br><br>"Does he now have that body?"<br><br>"Yes."<br><br>"Will he always?"<br><br>"Yes."<br><br>"Is there any reason we should not adore and honor and worship him for what he has now become?"<br><br>"No," they said, "he is very God."<br><br>"Yes," I said, "what then of the Father?"<br><br>"Oh no, oh no." And then they issued a kind of Platonic manifesto--the statement out of the traditional creeds which are, all due honor to them, more Greek than they are Hebrew. "No, no, the Father is 'immaterial, incorporeal, beyond space, beyond time, unchanging, unembodied, etc.'"<br><br>Now, earlier they had berated me because Mormons, as you know, are credited--or blamed--for teaching, not trinitarianism, but tritheism--the idea of three distinct personages. And I couldn't resist at that point saying, "Who has two Gods? You are the ones who are saying that there are two utterly unlike persons. The religious dilemma is how can I honor the Father and seek to become like him (for even the pronoun 'him' is not appropriate) without become<i>un</i>like the Christ whom you say we can properly adore and worship and honor." Well, the attack at that point was that I didn't understand the Trinity. And I acknowledged that was true.<br><br>But now the second set of questions: "Why," I dared to ask--and it's a question any child can ask--"did God make us at all?" There's an answer to that in their catechism. Basically, it is that God did so for his own pleasure and by his inscrutable will. Sometimes it is suggested that he did so that he might have creatures to honor and worship him--which, if we are stark in response, is not the most unselfish motive one could conceive. Sometimes it is said that he did so for<i>our</i>happiness. But because of the creeds it is impossible to say that God<i>needed</i>to do so, for God, in their view, is beyond need. And then the bold question I put was "You hold, don't you, that God has and had all power, all knowledge, all anticipatory wisdom, and that he knew, therefore, exactly what he was about and could have done otherwise?"<br><br>"Yes," they allowed, "he could."<br><br>"Why then, since God could have created cocreators, did he choose to make us creatures? Why did God choose to make us his everlasting inferiors?"<br><br>At that point one of them said, "God's very nature<i>forbids</i>that he should have peers."<br><br>I replied, "That's interesting. For us God's very nature requires that he should have peers. Which God is more worthy of our love?"<br><h2><b>Bearing Witness of a Living God</b></h2><br>Now, brothers and sisters, prophets have lived and died to reestablish in the world in our generation that glorious truth--that what the Eternal Father wants for you and with you is the fullness of your possibilities. And those possibilities are infinite. And he did not simply make you from nothing into a worm; he adopted and begat you into his likeness in order to share his nature. And he sent his Firstborn Son to exemplify just how glorious that nature can be--even in mortality. That is our witness.<br><br>Again and again in recent months I've been in circumstances sometimes trying and sometimes inspiring. People want me to answer the question "Are Mormons Christians?" I've occasionally reversed it: "Are Christians Mormon?" I have evidence, more and more of it, that there are major spokesmen in all the wings of Christianity and in Judaism who are saying unwittingly today what only the Prophet Joseph Smith was saying 150 years ago.<br><br>But one of the discomforts of belonging to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is that occasionally one wonders, "Can I witness to an unbelieving world that I am committed to Jesus Christ in the fullest, richest, highest sense?" Part of my message tonight is to tell you that you can, that you belong to a heritage that testifies that Jesus, the Christ, known for what he was on the morning of his resurrection, is in exact similitude of the highest kind of being in the universe. There is nothing more, nothing higher to be achieved. It is a blasphemy on the part of many beyond the pales of this Church to hold that we are to respect him as simply a kind of man or even a special and endowed and divinely inspired man, but to hold that the nature of God, the highest God, if you will, is something else. I repeat, their concept is not higher; it is always and everywhere lower. To worship "Being" in a static form, to worship an "Unconditioned" without intelligence and will and embodiment, to worship principle, to worship any aspect of the universe or all of it together in preference to the glorified personality who was Jesus Christ is blasphemy. "They seek not the Lord," said the Lord in his preface to modern revelation, "to establish<i>his</i>righteousness, but every man walketh in his own way, and after the image of his own God, whose image is in the likeness of the world, and whose substance is that of an idol" (D&amp;amp;C 1:16; emphasis added). Is there in the world such an idea of God "in the likeness of the world, and whose substance is that of an idol"? Yes. And we must go on witnessing to a<i>living</i>God--even, paradoxically, if it costs us our lives.<br><h2><b>A Sense of Humor and Divine Potential</b></h2><br>Now, let me return to two or three implications of this insight for our own nature. I dared to say once to one of our great leaders, "Do you believe God has a sense of humor?"<br><br>And without a hesitation he snapped his fingers and said, "Of course. He made you, didn't he?"<br><br>There is something terribly cruel about that. With it I match the psychiatric story of a man who said, "Doctor, I think I have an inferiority complex."<br><br>After some days of psychoanalysis the verdict came out: "No, you're simply inferior."<br><br><i>I know</i>, and, having made you laugh, I wish this could go all the way to your marrow, I<i>know</i>that there are on this campus hundreds, thousands, who carry that kind of anchor on their shoulders: "I don't amount to much. I'm not really one of those good ones." Or, as a student said to me not too long ago, "I think I'm just basically telestial material."<br><br>What is truth? The truth is, and I bear it humbly, that even the person you think the worst off--and in some cases that may be yourself--even that personality that it has been most difficult for you to forgive will be, in a century or two, in such a condition that if you saw him or her your first impulse would be to kneel in reverence. The truth is that the embryo within the worst of us is divine. The truth is that there is nothing you can do to really destroy that fact. The potential is there.<br><h2><b>The Challenges of Church Service and Growth</b></h2><br>Now, that leads to a second and more realistic comment in some ways. We live in a church that places tremendous burdens on the laity. We go on asking our nineteen-year-olds to do the impossible. I had a colleague at Harvard who said, "Admit, Madsen, you don't really seriously send out these boys expecting to make converts, do you? Level with me. Your real purpose is to help them develop a cultural affinity and get some language skill; now isn't that it? You can't expect a mere boy to go out in the wild world and make converts."<br><br>I said, "No, I can't! But the Lord does. And they're succeeding at the rate of a hundred thousand a year." Yes.<br><br>I've noticed that teachers are told (talking about teachers in the Aaronic Priesthood) to see that there is no iniquity in the Church. Strange burden to put on a teenager. We do; the Lord does. And how many of the parents of those of you sitting here tonight are today faithful and alive in the Church because of you and your example? How many parents have been converted by the conversions of their children? How many inactives have been reactivated by the services and faith of their missionary children? How, we don't know. We don't realize our own power or the divine burden placed upon us.<br><br>Constantly I am astonished to reread the statement made by the Prophet in a setting which I contrast tonight to what we see here. Maybe there were a hundred members of the church then. There were only eight or ten in this particular meeting in a log cabin. Now, the names are names to conjure with. But they weren't all that great then: Brigham Young, Heber C. Kimball, Wilford Woodruff, the two Pratts, Orson Hyde. The Prophet said to them, "Please, brethren, bear your witness as to the future of this Church." It's 1834. Well, they did so. In my imagination I picture a kind of "Can You Top This?" session. Maybe somebody was daring enough to say that he could foresee the time when there would be fifty thousand Latter-day Saints. When they were all through and had done their best, the Prophet arose and said, "Brethren, I've appreciated what you've said, but you no more comprehend the destinies of this Church than a little child on its mother's lap." That's strong language to a Brigham Young. And then he said, "Brethren, this Church will fill North and South America. Brethren, this Church will fill the earth." We don't read that anyone topped that. That's true! It is happening under our noses. And when you're in your prime--let's just suppose that's 1990--do you know how many missionaries there will be if we call just the present proportion we're calling (2 to 3 percent of our membership)? We'll have seventy-five thousand missionaries! We'll just be getting started then.<br><br>Look, the burden has been placed upon us, and the Lord trusts us even when we don't fully trust ourselves. The embryo within this student body often keeps me awake at nights. I marvel, I wonder, and I say, "Why can't we have twenty thousand cheering their hearts out for other things than the last five seconds of a basketball game?" (But I was here shouting last night. I don't want to suggest that you shouldn't shout then.) There is a power in unity. And the ultimate unity that the Lord promised and prayed for is again a oneness with him and with the Father, and that requires that we become like them in nature. In very nature. That requires processes which the Lord again and again has compared most constantly to the process of birth and begetting. We are his children; he is our Father. Locked in us, hidden from our present view, are glorious insights and memories, which to know would, for many of us, lead to the neglect of the purposes of this world. We couldn't stand to stay here, I suspect, if we knew all. I've read recently an account, I hope trustworthy, of a brother who says that the Prophet Joseph implied just that--that were it not for the strong biological urge in us to survive, to hold on to the slipping rope even when we're in pain and suffering, and, in addition to that, were it not for the drawing, the dropping as it were, of the curtain which prevents our gathering from the vineyards of an infinite memory--were it not, in short, for our mortal amnesia, we couldn't stand it. The shock of leaving that condition and entering this one would be unbearable. We have to stay to work out the possibilities, to undergo the stress and distress that lead to perfection.<br><h2><b>Communication with the Living God</b></h2><br>Another implication. These brethren and sisters who caught hold in the first generation of the concept of bearing within themselves the very image, the literal image in its entirety, of the living God prayed differently. They did not pray to a God afar off. They did not make amends in some verbal way to a principle. They walked "with Father"--not even saying, "the Father," but "Father." All intimacy. All warmth. All trust. And how I have marveled to read the accounts. I'm afraid they're in contrast to some of the prayers that I myself and perhaps you utter today. My great-grandfather, for example, used to say, "Stay there. Stay on your knees and talk with him [that's different from talking<i>to</i>him] until you prevail with the Spirit." He used the image "break the ice"; tear it off and stay on your knees until you're warm.<br><br>Or again, there is the Wilford Woodruff description of the Prophet's prayers: "Always," he says, "conversational." No forced tone of voice, no ostentation, plain, open--the way a trusting child would say his inmost thoughts to a father or mother.<br><br>And then there is the description of Heber C. Kimball, the grandfather of our present leader. His biographer, Orson F. Whitney, says of him that "prayers are rarely heard as were heard to issue from the heart and lips of this man." I was curious why. What did he do differently? Well, I found out. There was first of all a sense of dedication in his home. The home is the second most sacred place in the Church--the first being the temple. (President Lee recently instructed that if you're not going to be married in the temple, the next best place is home.) They understood that. They dedicated their homes; they dedicated, at times, a room--he did--a special room for prayer. He knew what it was to kneel in silence for a time, to ruminate, to meditate, to recover something of the light in the scriptures and in himself. And then to pray.<br><br>He constantly taught his family, and by example demonstrated, that the way to pray is to let out what is really in. For example, he says in a discourse, "When I am angry, the<i>first</i>thing I do is pray. And I am never so angry but what I can't." Well, I was taught the exact opposite. If you're angry you straighten things out, you count to ten, soak your head in a bucket, and when things are all even and you're composed, then you pray. No. The first thing he did was pray. What, you might ask me, would he say? I don't know. I can only imagine. But he let it out honestly, openly, in the words that were appropriate. "I'm so angry," he might have said, "I could spit." If that's the way it was, then that's the way to say it. And there came a return wave, for the Lord honors you when you level, when you stop praying from the neck up and begin praying from way inside, trusting the Spirit to take even the ineptitudes and translate them perfectly, trusting the Lord to know and daring even to voice those particular feelings about which you are most anxious and even guilty, including the prayer which he occasionally offered: "Father in heaven, I just don't feel like praying." That's an honest and powerful prayer. I recommend it.<br><br>And then there is the example, lest you suppose there are certain things out of bounds entirely, when he in fact was praying with the family and laughed in the middle. Having named a brother, he burst out laughing. As I have told my wife, I can picture three solutions to that: He might have arisen, left the room with his hand over his mouth, and let his wife pick up the pieces. That's what I would have done. He could have delivered a very solemn 21/2-minute talk on why we<i>never ever</i>permit a smile in prayer. Or he could have done what he did do. There was a slight pause, and then he said, "I'm sorry, Lord, but I just can't help laughing when I think about Brother Brown." And then he went on with his prayer.<br><br>Friends not of our faith would say of this, "Blasphemy." I testify to you, "Beautiful." Do you think it is a secret to the Lord that you have a funny bone? Do you think that there is wisdom in hiding? And brothers and sisters, be honest. When you testify that the Lord knows your thoughts and feelings, do you believe it? If you were speaking to a loved earthly father and you were in serious trouble, really serious--maybe tragic trouble--but in the middle of the recital if you burst into laughter, maybe a little half-hysterical, would he not understand? Yes, we're warned against lightmindedness. But what is that? The betrayal, I suggest to you, of sacred things--making light of, ridiculing. That, always and everywhere will deny you the privileges of the Spirit of the Lord. You will be left to yourself if you indulge that kind of lightmindedness. But the Lord nowhere condemns lightheartedness. He commands it. He says that we're to have "a glad heart and a cheerful countenance" (D&amp;amp;C 59:15) even on fast Sunday when our heads ache and we're hungry. And he wants us, both in sorrow and in joy, to have the resilient kind of response that humor makes possible. Sometimes life is so ridiculous there is nothing else to do--except laugh.<br><br>Thank God we have examples of this in our midst. I wish there were time to mention several, but I'll just name one. Dear President Brown was walking down an aisle recently in a chapel. Up came a little white-haired sister who burst out, "Oh, President Brown, I've always wanted you to speak at my funeral."<br><br>With his eyes twinkling, he said, "Sister, if you want me to speak at your funeral, you'd better hurry." The children of God are lighthearted. Don't take yourself so seriously, a friend said to me, that when you walk down the street people look at you and say, "Three cheers for sin."<br><h2><b>Man Is Not Depraved, but Divine</b></h2><br>But now, I bring all this, which has been rather circular, to what I pray may be a worthy and fitting end. I, brothers and sisters, have known men who were not too worthy of admiration. I have visited on occasion in prison and heard a guard say, "The more I see of men, the more I admire dogs." I myself in honest introspection can find within me things I am not proud of--snakes and spiders, all the things Freud said, and worse. But I bear you witness tonight that the solution to that is not the one that even many religionists have come upon--the solution of saying, "All right, let's admit it, man is absolutely no good. Man is depraved; man is indeed a worm. And if there is to be anything salvaged, it will be done purely at the initiative and solely by the causation of God. And our destiny will be to be counted with those who, likewise unworthily, were put in a place."<br><br>My testimony to you is that you have come literally "trailing clouds of glory." If you only knew who you are and what you did and how you earned the privileges of mortality, and not just mortality but of this time, this place, this dispensation, and the associates that have been meant to cross and intertwine with your lives; if you knew now the vision you had then of what this trial, this probation, what in my bitter moments I call this spook alley of mortality, could produce, would produce; if you knew the latent infinite power that is locked up and hidden for your own good now--you would never again yield to any of the putdowns that are a dime a dozen in our culture today. Everywhere pessimism, everywhere suspicion, everywhere the denial of the worth and dignity of man.<br><br>I have faith that if only twenty thousand caught hold of God's living candle on that truth and went out into the world--I don't care if the vocations are sensational, spectacular, or brilliant--just out in the world being true to the vision, we would not need to defend the cause of Jesus Christ. People would come and ask, "Where have you found such peace? Where have you found the radiance that I sense in your eyes and in your face? How come you don't get carried away with the world?" And we could answer that the work of salvation is the glorious work of Jesus Christ. But it is also the glorious work of the uncovering and recovering of your own latent divinity. I know that idea is offensive to persons whom I would not wish to offend. I know that it goes against the grain of much that is built into our secular culture. I know that there are those who say there is no proof. But I bear witness that Jesus Christ, if there were none else, is the living proof and that, as you walk in the pattern he has ordained,<i>you</i>will be living proof. I bear that witness in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Truman G. Madsen held the Richard L.

I heard a story some time ago about a young man, a teenager, who came home too late. He had violated his curfew, and his father, waiting for him as he came in the house, delivered a 2 1/2-minute sermon about how he should get in on time, how he would need to have strength if he was going to fulfill his mission on the earth, and how he had to have proper rest and sleep. "The early bird gets the worm," he said, "and you can't get up early if you're tired and sleepy." Like most teenagers the young man had a sharp comeback: "That worm must have been up too early, or the bird would never have gotten him." The father's response was that the worm had been out all night and that his getting in too late was how he had gotten into trouble.<br><br>It is important that we understand why we are here, and this institution is dedicated to making that purpose known to us. Such men as Truman Madsen convey a vivid understanding of why we are here and what our potential is--our purpose. Brother Madsen is a great missionary, and I hope each one of you is too, because you have that responsibility. I would have spoken to you tonight at some length about service. I'm not going to do that, although I may come back and do it--if I get invited, that is.<br><h2><b>The Influence of Righteous Living</b></h2><br>May I say that you never know where your influence will reach, and you never know what's going to happen in the lives of people that you touch. Shortly after I was baptized in Japan during the Korean War, I came back home to San Diego. I had found the truth, and I was sure that everyone in the world was looking for the truth. I was going to give it to them, whether they wanted it or whether they didn't. I joined a car pool that went from my home in Chula Vista, California, to North Island, my duty station. It was about a forty-five-minute ride in each direction. In the car pool with me were three other lieutenants (I was a lieutenant at the time) and one enlisted man. The enlisted man's name was George Whitehead; he was a first class ordinanceman. I figured, "This will be a cinch. It will be easy to convert these four. They can't get out of the car, and the trip is forty-five minutes in each direction. It won't be long until I'll have them all in the Church. Then I'll move into another car pool and convert them. . . . Why, I can convert a whole ward just by going back and forth to work." I then went to work on those four.<br><br>The three lieutenants never heard a word that I said, or if they did I couldn't tell it, but that enlisted man dared not turn me off. I could tell that George was interested, so when I drove I would let the other three out of the car, park in front of George's house, and preach the gospel to him for an hour before I'd let him out. I had the pressure on him to come to church. It seemed that he was interested, but he wouldn't come. It took about four weeks, as I recall, before he finally said, "Well, I'm ready to come to church tomorrow, and my wife, Lucille, is going to come with me." I found out it was Lucille who had been holding up the works all the time.<br><br>I went over to the chapel the Saturday evening before George was coming to church on Sunday, taking with me the young man who had baptized me in Japan. (He was spending a lot of time at my house at that time.) We washed the back door of the church. We really scrubbed it because it was dirty. "You're crazy, washing the back door of a church," my friend told me.<br><br>I said, "I'm going to wash the back door of the church because George and Lucille are going to come through this door tomorrow, and everything has to be perfect." (I presume no one looks at the church more critically than a missionary bringing a contact to church for the first time. He wants all the babies to be quiet, the music to be beautiful, and everybody on the stand to stay awake. But perhaps that's too much to expect.)<br><br>They came to church, and we had a great Sunday School class, which I taught. I had planted some questions among members of the class that I felt my contacts needed to hear the answers to in church. And I had all the answers ready, of course. George looked like a sponge, soaking up everything that was said. But Lucille, sitting beside him, looked like a sphinx. You couldn't tell if she had heard a word that I said; if she had, it hadn't registered. I could hardly wait. As we walked out of the church, through that clean door (about which I made some comment, I think), I asked Lucille, "What did you think about that? How did you feel about your first visit to the Lord's church?"<br><br>She said, without a smile, "I was born a Methodist, and I expect to die one."<br><br>I hadn't heard LeGrand Richards's story at that time about the Englishman and the Scotsman. The Englishman said, "I was born an Englishman, raised an Englishman, and expect to die an Englishman."<br><br>The Scotsman replied, "Have you no ambition?"<br><br>I could have used that on Lucille, but it's a good thing I didn't because what I did say was "Lucille, I promise you that you'll never have to give up anything true you've learned as a Methodist to be a Latter-day Saint. We have no quarrel with other churches. We don't write tracts against other churches, and we never will because we are not in the business of tearing down people's faiths, but rather of building them up.<br><br>"To our Protestant friends who believe that salvation is by grace through faith alone, we make no argument because we are not to contend with people. We are to bear witness of what is true. We say to them, 'We understand your emphasis on faith. We believe, too, "without faith it is impossible to please God." You must have faith. But there is more to salvation than just faith. There are also certain works you must perform, certain ordinances you must receive, and certain authority you must hold. So come, let us share with you the fulness of the gospel. We won't take anything from you that's true; we'll just add to what you have.'<br><br>"To our Catholic friends who believe that salvation is by grace through sacraments, we say, 'We understand your emphasis on the sacraments–we call them ordinances. We believe them too. Did not the Master say, "Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God" (John 3:5)? We believe that baptism is essential to salvation, but there is more to salvation than just baptism. There are certain works you have to perform, yes, and certain faith you must exercise in the Lord and in your fellowman. There is authority you must hold. So come, let us share with you the fulness of the gospel. We are not going to take anything from you that's true; we will just add to what you have.'"<br><br>That's essentially what I told Lucille, but she didn't say a word. She just walked on. That was in 1952.<br><br>Six years later, in 1958, I was back in Washington, D.C., still in the navy. The navy sent me out to southern California to do some temple work. As a matter of fact, they didn't send me to do temple work, but that's the way it worked out. I went out to go to a special school at USC, and while I was there, I did the work in the temple for my grandparents on both sides of my family, also for my own mother, who had died not having accepted the gospel. As I recall, I sealed one of my grandparents, my grandfather, to two wives and sixteen children. Of course, I'll have to answer to him one day for that, but I think he'll be pleased.<br><br>The girl who was proxy for two of my grandmothers and for my own mother was the same Lucille Whitehead. This girl, who had been born a Methodist and expected to die one, didn't quite make it. As a matter of fact, she was ready for baptism just two weeks from the time she made that statement to me, because the Holy Ghost had touched her heart, and she knew the Church was true. As a matter of fact, she was ready for baptism before George, her husband, was. George was in the bishopric of the Oxnard Ward in California just two years after he was baptized.<br><br>The last time I saw George and Lucille together, they had two books of family group sheets that were four inches thick. They had both found volumes about their families that someone they had never met had put together without knowing why. All Lucille and George did was to copy off all these names and do the work in the temple for them.<br><br>It was about three years ago, I think, at October conference time that the door of my office suddenly opened and in came this sister. She rushed over, threw her arms around me, kissed me on the cheek, and swung me around a couple of times. I said, "Now, this sure is exciting, but who in the world are you, anyway?"<br><br>She answered, "Brother Rector, don't you recognize me? I'm Lucille Whitehead." (She'd put on a pound or two since I'd last seen her.)<br><br>"Well, where are you, Lucille?" I asked.<br><br>"I'm the Relief Society president in the Colorado Mission--the whole mission."<br><br>"What is George doing?"<br><br>"Why, he is the branch president." I think the branch was in North Platte, Nebraska.<br><br>You see, these are choice people whom the Lord knew. I didn't know that she was going to do the work for my mother. If you don't know who the people are around you, the Lord knows, and if you take the opportunity to share the gospel with them, they will have an impact on your life. I testify of that.<br><br>I know where those two missionaries are that knocked on my door back in 1951. I wasn't at home, but my wife was and she let them in. She was what you call a "new move-in"; she had just moved into the house. She was also expecting our third child--expectant mothers make good contacts too. It is important that we be alert to the experiences that prepare people to hear the gospel and that we live the gospel so that our examples will be in harmony with the Spirit of the Lord.<br><h2><b>Obedience to the Principles of the Gospel</b></h2><br>You are great examples to the whole world. We love you. We appreciate you. You have a great service to render, and you have opportunities to serve all about you. May I bear witness to you that I know that God, our Heavenly Father, lives and that he is your Father. You don't belong to your parents; they just act as if you did. You belong to the Lord. You are his children, and he is much concerned about you and very anxious. He wants to bless you, but you have to be in condition to get those blessings. Being in that condition comes through obedience. I plead with you to live the commandments as you understand them so that all things will be possible to you. All blessings will be available when you are in condition to receive them, and condition comes through obedience.<br><br>I bear witness that Jesus is the Christ. He is our Elder Brother. He did pay the price for our sins, and because of him we have access back to our Heavenly Father. He made our return possible. He had no sins of his own; it was your sins and mine that caused him to suffer, but he did it because he loved us. He says that, if we come unto him and confess our sins and forsake them and follow him, we will go free, for he has paid the price for us. Wouldn't we be stupid not to accept that offer?<br><br>I bear witness to you that this is the church and kingdom of God on earth and that it has been restored through a great, great prophet--Joseph Smith, wonderful man that he was. We could talk for days about the Prophet Joseph. Among other things nothing could "get him down." He seemed never to get discouraged. At one time he said, "Never be discouraged. If I were sunk in the deepest pit in Nova Scotia and the Rocky Mountains were piled on top of me, I'd hold on, exercise good courage and faith, and come out on top." Joseph would have, too.<br><br>There was another time when he said, "I am wont to walk in deep water," just as Paul said, "I am exceeding joyful in all our tribulation" (2 Corinthians 7:4). Isn't it great that Paul liked trials, because he had so many of them? That's the way the prophet Joseph was, too--you couldn't beat him.<br><br>Don't you just love people who can't be beaten? That's the way the Lord is. Nothing can defeat him. The kingdom is not going to fail. It's going to roll forth. Yes, it will break down all other kingdoms and fill the whole earth and stand forever, and you're part of it. Isn't it great to be part of a winning team? Don't you love a winner? I do; I hate to lose. I think I'm the worst loser in all the world. I don't believe in losing. Some say, "It matters not whether you win or lose, but how you play the game." That may be all right for football or basketball, but it's not all right for the kingdom of God. No, sir. It makes a lot of difference whether you win or not. I certainly didn't join this Church to lose my soul. We came here to win, and we will win if we stick with the Lord because he's not a loser. The kingdom will not fail. Isn't it great to be part of it? But you've got to be in the thick of it to really enjoy it. The Lord will let you get right in the middle of it if you want to. This is his kingdom.<br><br>I bear witness to you that we have a living prophet of God on earth--President Spencer W. Kimball. We could talk a long time about him, too, marvelous man that he is, preserved by the Lord to lead his church and kingdom at a critical time. President Kimball will lead the Church marvelously well, for he acts under the direction of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, whose church this really is.<br><br>I bear this witness to you in all soberness. May the Lord bless us to walk uprightly before him, keep his commandments, and show him that we love him by the way we obey. That we may do so I pray humbly in Jesus' name. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Hartman Rector, Jr., was a member of the First Quorum of the Seventy of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when this fireside address was given at Brigham Young University on 3 March 1974.</i></i><br><br><i>© Intellectual Reserve, Inc.

<br>
One of the most inspiring sermons I have had the privilege of hearing was delivered about the time I entered high school in one of our assemblies. Most of that sermon has been forgotten over the years; however, the central theme is vividly remembered. This sermon was delivered by a member of our stake presidency. He was the owner and operator of the local hardware store, a man who was familiar with hand tools, so it was natural for him to talk about the most common one of all--the hammer.<br><br>He told a story of a French carpenter in the early 1800s who was having difficulty in his profession keeping his productivity high because of the defective hammers he used. He had trouble keeping the head on the hammer as he worked. He would spend half of his time chasing his flying hammerhead. He tried everything to attempt to keep the head on. He tried to nail it on. He tried to soak it in water. He even tried to glue it. Each process would help only for a short time before he would again find himself chasing the hammerhead. Now, all of the carpenters in the country were having the same problem and all were seemingly content to live with the situation with the exception of this man. He desired to be the best carpenter in all of France, but his efficiency was limited to the effectiveness of the tools he used. He reasoned that the only way he could become the best was to build a better hammer. Each evening after his working hours, he would ponder and think about what could be done to develop a better hammer. Finally, after years of work, the right concept was discovered. It was a simple solution, but, oh, how workable. The process he developed was to make the bottom of the hammerhead smaller than the top and then drive a wedge into the top of the hammer. As long as the wedge was in place, the hammerhead could not come off. In fact, the more pressure applied to the hammerhead to attempt to have it fly off, the more pressure was on the wedge to keep it in place. He had built the world's greatest hammer. It has become the pattern for most of the hammer manufacturers even to this day. Now, his was not the world's greatest discovery, but in his own field he became the best.<br><br>The message and theme of this great sermon given by a member of our stake presidency was contained in a poem, only part of which I can remember. It is as follows:<br><br><i>If you can't be a pine on the top of the hill,</i><br><i>Be a scrub in the valley--but be</i><br><i>The best little scrub by the side of the rill;</i><br><i>Be a bush if you can't be a tree.</i><br><i>If you can't be a highway then just be a trail,</i><br><i>If you can't be the sun be a star;</i><br><i>It isn't by size that you win or you fail--</i><br><i>Be the best of whatever you are!</i><br><br>[Douglas Malloch, "Be the Best of Whatever You Are"]<br><br>Let me address myself to three areas where I would like to challenge you to be the best with the great potential our Father in heaven has blessed you with.<br><h2><b>The Blessing of Divine Parentage</b></h2><br>First, as a child of God. One of the greatest weaknesses in most of us is our lack of faith in ourselves. One of our common failings is to depreciate our tremendous worth. A firm I was associated with sometime ago embarked on a great executive development program at considerable expense to itself. The program was open to all who expressed an interest. All they had to do was sign up. The firm paid the costs and even allowed the employees one hour off from their normal daily work for classroom time--a free opportunity for an education in the art of management. During the two years the program was offered, only 3 percent of the employees signed for the course. I have observed another situation where this 3 percent statistic seems to be somewhat reliable as the number of the divine children of our Father in heaven who have enough faith in themselves to make the effort to do something important with their lives. Now, we are a special group assembled here because of the light and knowledge that have been given to us about our potential. Surely, we could never be numbered among the 97 percent who are not taking advantage of opportunities. The scriptures tell us of our divine nature. Do you remember what the Psalmist said?<br><br><i>O Lord our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth! who hast set thy glory above the heavens. . . .</i><br><br><i>When I consider thy heavens, the work of thy fingers, the moon and the stars, which thou hast ordained;</i><br><br><i>What is man, that thou art mindful of him? and the son of man, that thou visitest him?</i><br><br><i>For thou hast made him a little lower than the angels, and hast crowned him with glory and honor.</i>[Psalms 8:1, 3–5]<br><br>Have you ever thought of yourself as being a "junior angel"? Brigham Young has further defined our eternal relationship by reporting:<br><br><i>Things were first created spiritually; the Father actually begat the spirits, and they were brought forth and lived with him. . . .</i><br><br><i>I want to tell you, each and every one of you, that you are well acquainted with God our Heavenly Father. . . . You are all well acquainted with him, for there is not a soul of you but what has lived in his house and dwelt with him year after year; and yet you are seeking to become acquainted with him, when the fact is, you have merely forgotten what you did know.</i><br><br><i>There is not a person here to-day but what is a son or a daughter of that Being. In the spirit world their spirits were first begotten and brought forth, and they lived there with their parents for ages before they came here. . . .</i><br><br><i>We are the sons and daughters of celestial beings, and the germ of Diety dwells within us. . . .</i><br><br><i>We are all his children. We are his sons and daughters naturally, and by the principles of eternal life. We are brethren and sisters.</i>[<i>Discourses of Brigham Young</i>, com. John A. Widtsoe (Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Co., 1973), pp. 50, 53]<br><br>History has abundantly given evidence of man's potential when he allows himself to be led by the power of the Lord. Do you remember the story of Joseph who was sold into Egypt? He was sent by his father to check on the welfare of his brothers as they tended the flocks. When they saw him coming, they seized upon the opportunity of finding him alone to satisfy the jealousy in their hearts and sold him for twenty pieces of silver to merchants on their way to Egypt. In Egypt, Joseph was purchased by Potiphar, the captain of the guard. Even as a servant in a far-off land, as a slave to a foreigner, he soon distinguished himself. The scriptures record:<br><br><i>And the Lord was with Joseph, and he was a prosperous man; and he was in the house of the Egyptian.</i><br><br><i>And his master saw that the Lord was with him, and that the Lord made all that he did to prosper in his hand.</i><br><br><i>And Joseph found grace in his sight, and he served him; and he made him overseer over his house, and all that he had he put into his hand.</i>[Genesis 39:2–4]<br><br>Joseph's life continued to have its ups and downs. He found himself accused falsely of being unfaithful to his master and was cast into prison. Once again, because of his faithfulness, the Lord provided an opportunity for him to interpret Pharaoh's dream. Joseph was given the opportunity because of this interpretation to serve Pharaoh. He so distinguished himself in this service that he became a ruler in Egypt while being only thirty years of age. Listen to the honor that Pharaoh bestowed upon him:<br><br><i>And Pharaoh said unto his servants, Can we find such a one as this is, a man in whom the spirit of God is?</i><br><br><i>And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Forasmuch as God hath shewed thee all this, there is none so discreet and wise as though art:</i><br><br><i>Thou shalt be over my house, and according unto thy word shall all my people be ruled: only in the throne will I be greater than though.</i><br><br><i>And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, See, I have set thee over all the land of Egypt.</i><br><br><i>And Pharaoh took off his ring from his hand, and put it upon Joseph's hand, and arrayed him in vestures of fine linen, and put a gold chain about his neck;</i><br><br><i>And he made him to ride in the second chariot which he had; and they cried before him, Bow the knee; and he made him ruler over all the land of Egypt.</i>[Genesis 41:38–43]<br><br>Note the characteristic which distinguished Joseph to both Potiphar and the Pharaoh: "a man in whom the spirit of God is."<br><br>We each have the choice of being worldly like unto the brothers of Joseph or living worthy of the blessings of the Lord like unto Joseph. President Romney has said: "We mortals are in very deed the literal off-spring of God. If man understood, believed and accepted this truth and lived by it, our sick and dying society would be reformed and redeemed and men would have peace and eternal joy." With this divine knowledge burning within our souls, surely much will be expected of us. As a child of God, be the best of whatever you are.<br><h2><b>The Blessing of Church Service</b></h2><br>The second challenge I wish to extend to each of you pertains to service in God's kingdom here upon the earth. One of the most exciting blessings which can come to us as members of our Savior's church is to live in this modern day when the Church is experiencing its greatest period of growth. Each day since the restoration of the gospel there has been greater opportunities for service in the Church than there was the day before. Tomorrow, there will be an even greater opportunity than there is today. Certainly, this is the day spoken of by the ancient prophet when he said:<br><br><i>And it shall come to pass in the last days, that the mountain of the Lord's house shall be established in the top of the mountains, and shall be exalted above the hills; and all nations shall flow unto it.</i><br><br><i>And many people shall go and say, Come ye, and let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, to the house of the God of Jacob; and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths.</i>[Isaiah 2:2–3]<br><br>As I travel throughout the stakes of the Church there is always one common cry: "If I only had another bishop like Brother Jones or another Relief Society president like Sister Smith or another Young Adult representative like Sister Brown or another home teacher like Brother Doe, what a difference I could make in my stake." When asked by a group of full-time missionaries recently as to what was the greatest challenge the Church is facing today, I was quick to respond that it is the challenge of growth. I wonder if the only reason that hundreds of thousands more are not embracing the gospel is that we have not yet developed a strong enough leadership base. Then, we too must examine our effectiveness as leaders when only 50 or 60 percent of our families are presided over by fathers active in the Church. Do you see what a great demand there is for qualified leaders in our Father in heaven's kingdom? Now consider the great privilege you are presently receiving to prepare you to be more able kingdom builders as your preparation relates to the instructions of the Lord to us:<br><br><i>Zion must increase in beauty, and in holiness; her borders must be enlarged; her stakes must be strengthened; yea, verily I say unto you, Zion must arise and put on her beautiful garments.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 82:14]<br><br>Some labor with the misconception that the professions for which they are preparing themselves will be too demanding to consider a life of major service in the kingdom of God. My experience has been that the greatest teacher is service in his kingdom. Let me give you an example:<br><br>When I was a young man in my late twenties, I was offered the position of controller in a small store in central Idaho after only six months' experience in the retail business. I had about a month in this new position before I could acquire a place or residence for my family to come and join me. During that month, I almost lived at the store. A twenty-four-hour workday was a common occurrence as I attempted to keep up with the work load that I had been assigned. I was having a desperate time trying to learn a new job and to keep pace with the responsibility I had been given. Just after my family arrived and we were settled, a car pulled up in front of our home one evening and I was invited to come out and visit with a member of our stake presidency and a member of our ward bishopric. I was shocked with the announcement that a change was being made in our bishopric and a counselor was being called as the new bishop. He had selected me to be his second counselor. My first reaction was to say, "No, I am too busy." But the training of my parents soon rang louder than my first reaction and I agreed to serve. This first experience in the bishopric was the best education I have ever received in organization and management. I found the Lord's way was transferable to business. As I practiced in business the techniques taught to me in Church service, I became more efficient in my business assignments. I soon found myself with more time for family, Church, and business responsibilities. The second great benefit was the experience of the joy of service in the Church. Next to my family, the most rewarding experiences in my life have been Church service opportunities.<br><br>You have been blessed to be born in the most exciting era the Church has ever known. Don't deprive yourself of a most rewarding opportunity of being prepared and willing to serve the Master. As a servant in his kingdom, be the best of whatever you are.<br><h2><b>The Blessing and Obligation of Citizenship</b></h2><br>The final area I would like to touch on is our obligation to the earth and the nation in which we live. I have just returned from one of the great nations of the world. We were so impressed with the people. How friendly and considerate they were to us. I would tell my wife, "If you want to have fun in this country, go out and get lost. Those people are so great at giving directions when you ask for assistance. They tell you where to go with such detail and then repeat it two or three times to be certain you understand."<br><br>This country is in one of its most difficult periods. After suffering during World War II, the people went into a great rebuilding program. As they accomplished and things became easy again, they started to relax and wanted only to enjoy life. Their great interest became the pub and the television. If an industry was in difficulty, rather than attempting to solve the problem, it was much easier and more secure to turn it over to the government and nationalize it. One by one, the government found itself operating more and more businesses. To offset this great national power, the workers organized into national unions and union leadership had so much control that they could paralyze the nation anytime it was to their advantage to call a strike.<br><br>A strike was in progress while we were there. Public buildings were required to close down at 10:30 at night. Stores were only allowed to turn on their lights one half of each working day. Shopping in stores during the period without lights was interesting. There would be one light burning at the entrance to the store. As you would step into the selling departments to shop, a salesperson would carry coleman lanterns around to show you the merchandise. In one store we visited, the temperature was 45 degrees. The saleslady explained they had been without heat all winter. The work week was reduced to three days. In hotels, you would find each room equipped with a candle with a note stating the lights could be turned out at any time. The heat was on in the hotel only during the evening and the early morning hours. Having a haircut was an experience. The barbershop was cold and dark as you entered. The barber seated you in a chair and then ran downstairs to turn on a little handmade generator operated by his former Honda. One neon tube than came on and the barber commenced to cut your hair. I was greatly relieved to go outside after the haircut to see if my head was still in place. On top of all this, the people had to live with the realization that if the strike was allowed to continue two additional weeks, all power would be turned off.<br><br>The economic pressures caused the government to fall and a general election was called. This election was held while we were there. It was very interesting to see 85 percent of the voters turn out to cast their ballots. Unfortunately, the election just highlighted problems rather than solving them. There had been such lack of interest for so long that the elections failed to turn up new leadership. The vote was split between the two major parties. One received the popular-vote margin. The second received the greater number of seats in the governing body. Neither had the majority to rule. A small third party was now in control and could bargain for the best deal. The ability to organize the government rested in its hands. Radical leaders could now demand positions of importance and power in the new government far beyond what they were entitled to as representatives of the people.<br><br>This is a classic example, to me, of what occurs when complacency and the desire for security supersede the desire for freedom and the willingness to sacrifice for its preservation. I wish that this were just an isolated case of the problems of just one nation. Unfortunately, the cry is being heard from almost all free nations for willing, dedicated, honest leadership to guide them through troubled times.<br><br>Now you find yourself at an age when you are expected to make your contribution to the leadership of your nation. I challenge you as a citizen to be the best of whatever you are.<br><br>We currently find ourselves in a situation where we have experienced a period of unprecedented prosperity. It has caused us to become soft and spoiled. We have again reached the point where we demand much more than we are willing to give and have become self-centered and worldly. We turn to things of man rather than to things of God.<br><br>We know the ultimate outcome of such a course. We know the suffering, bloodshed, sorrow, and despair which will follow if this direction is not changed. Of course, the immediate question that comes to mind when we examine our current state of affairs is why must we be knocked to our knees before we start on the road to recovery. The answer is obvious--the cycle can be reversed at any point. All that is needed is inspired leadership to give direction. Where can we expect to find that leadership today? One cannot stand in the position which I occupy at this present moment without knowing the answer to this question. Look around you. Have you ever seen a more inspiring sight? Do you realize that the person sitting next to you has the potential to become one of the best-trained leaders the world has ever known? In the book of Ether a great truth is given: "In the gift of his Son hath God prepared a more excellent way" (Ether 12:11). Supporting each of you here is a heritage of almost 150 years of continuous revelations to prophets of God preparing you for this great day. We have been promised, "And if your eye be single to my glory your whole body shall be filled with light and there shall be no darkness in you and that body which is filled with light comprehendeth all things" (D&amp;amp;C 88:67). The only missing ingredient to make our contribution as leaders in God's kingdom is found in the Doctrine and Covenants: "If ye have desires to serve God ye are called to the work; For behold the field is white already to harvest" (D&amp;amp;C 4:3–4).<br><br>There has never been a time in the history of the world when those who are prepared to give honest, inspired leadership have greater opportunity than there is today. Isn't this the time of those who have been given knowledge of the truth, the light of the gospel, to stop testing the line between right and wrong and enthusiastically embark on that which the Lord has asked us to do? Isn't this the time in our preparation to do all we have been assigned, and then just a little bit more? Isn't this the time in our Church service to do all our priesthood leaders would require of us, and then just a little bit more? Isn't this the time in our nation to fill our responsibilities as good citizens, and then just a little bit more?<br><br>My son found it necessary to leave this campus for a few hours this weekend to drive home to negotiate an advance on his allowance. While there, he studied this talk with great interest and decided what it needed was a little poetic flavoring. In about two and a half minutes, he penned these lines of rhyme for our instruction, titled, "To Be the Best of What I Am":<br><br><i>I am the best at what I do</i><br><i>and I do all I can.</i><br><i>I am the best in at least one thing,</i><br><i>When so I think</i><br><i>then so I am.</i><br><br><i>To serve my fellowman</i><br><i>As President</i><br><i>or plumber</i><br><i>The best way that I can,</i><br><i>Brings to me the greatest joy to stay</i><br><i>Through winds of circumstance</i><br><i>may seldom blow my way.</i><br><i>I remain a servant of God,</i><br><i>an executor of His righteous plan.</i><br><br><i>To be a child of God</i><br><i>inherently filled with potential</i><br><i>And then to blame whatever fortune may come</i><br><i>on environment</i><br><i>Seems a bit deceitful.</i><br><br><i>I am a child of God</i><br><i>and this one thing I know:</i><br><i>You, too, are a child of God</i><br><i>not on earth for merely show</i><br><i>For you and I came here to grow.</i><br><br><i>I am the best at what I do</i><br><i>and I do all I can.</i><br><i>I am the best in at least one thing,</i><br><i>When so I think</i><br><i>then so I am.</i><br><br>I give you my witness that I know by personal experience that, the more you serve the Lord, the greater are his blessings to you. There is no greater joy than being a builder in his kingdom. I challenge you with all of the great power and potential that is within you to be the best of whatever you are, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>L.

<h1>y of Celestial Exaltation - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
It is a glorious experience to be part of this fireside, in the presence of so many keen, alert, youthful minds. The God-given human mind is far greater as a reservoir for organizing and accumulating knowledge than the greatest man-made computers. The human mind is one of the greatest, if not the greatest, of all of God's masterful creations. As we unite our minds this evening in the atmosphere of the Lord's university, the power of your potential godliness can be felt. We have assembled this evening to think, to reflect, and to enjoy the blessings of the Holy Spirit. Jesus Christ said, "And the Spirit shall be given unto you by the prayer of faith; and if ye receive not the Spirit ye shall not teach" (D&amp;amp;C 42:14). I have prayed, with faith, for the Holy Ghost to be with us.<br><h2><b>Know the Father and the Son</b></h2><br>Jesus asked us to know our Heavenly Father and to know Jesus Christ. He said of this life, "This is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou has sent" (John 17:3). Remember those words. They were given by a living God, and they are clear and complete and do not need correction or adjustment. To have the full measure of eternal life in a divine way you must know the only true God and Jesus Christ. I repeat, "This is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou has sent." Knowing the only true God and Jesus Christ is the most rewarding and precious of all knowledge. If you were asked these questions: "Do you know God?" "Do you know Jesus Christ?" what would your answer be? It is important to know that the scriptures contain divine tests to determine the effectiveness of the doctrines and commandments in our lives. I repeat the questions: "Do you know the only true God, and do you know Jesus Christ?" If your answer is "yes," then let's see how you measure up to the test as given by the apostle John. He said, "And hereby we do know that we know him, if we keep his commandments. He that saith, I know him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him" (1 John 2:3–4). And I don't mind telling you that test has been translated correctly. Be careful not to get carried away with any foolish thoughts that might justify weakness and failure to know and keep God's commandments. Does your knowledge of God impel you to know and keep his commandments? Knowing and keeping the commandments of God are the divine ways to perfection and eternal life in the kingdom of God.<br><br>It is dishonest and most disrespectful to say that you know God and that you know Jesus Christ and then to continue to ignore and set aside their commandments. Jesus said, "Behold, this is your work, to keep my commandments, yea, with all your might, mind, and strength" (D&amp;amp;C 11:20).<br><br>God is available to all that ask, seek, and knock. Jesus said, "Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you: For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened" (Matthew 7:7–8). This is a God-given formula on how to reach and know your Heavenly Father and your Savior, Jesus Christ. There is no other divine way; all other programs come from man or the devil.<br><br>It is a profound truth that each of you is in the image and likeness of God. Your creation within your mother and your birth were divine miracles. Your spirit, your brain, your eyes, your ears, your heart, and every part of your glorious, magnificent soul were made possible by the only true God.<br><br>This earth, universe, the air that we breathe, the food and water that we consume, and nature with all of its splendor and beauty were made possible by the only true and living God and Jesus Christ. We owe them everything, and our first interest and desire should be to know them.<br><h2><b>Love the Lord thy God</b></h2><br>Jesus said, "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind. This is the first and great commandment" (Matthew 22:37–38).<br><br>If you were asked the question "Do you love God first?" what would your answer be? If your answer is "yes," you should measure up to the Lord's test. Jesus said, "If ye love me, keep my commandments" (John 14:15). "He that hath my commandments, and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me: and he that loveth me shall be loved of my Father, and I will love him, and will manifest myself to him" (John 14:21).<br><br>Again, John, the apostle of love, gave words that test us on the depth of our love for God. He said, "For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments: and his commandments are not grievous" (1 John 5:3)<br><br>In the latter days, Jesus said, "If thou lovest me thou shalt serve me and keep all my commandments" (D&amp;amp;C 42:29). He also said, "And that he created man, male and female, after his own image and in his own likeness, created he them; And gave unto them commandments that they should love and serve him, the only living and true God, and that he should be the only being whom they should worship" (D&amp;amp;C 20:18–19).<br><br>Do you love God first? Do you love God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind? Do you serve God? Do you know and keep God's commandments?<br><br>The Lord promised, "And, if you keep my commandments and endure to the end you shall have eternal life, which gift is the greatest of all the gifts of God" (D&amp;amp;C 14:7).<br><br>Do you owe the Lord for every day of your life? Some feel that they owe the Lord nothing. Yes, you owe him for your parents; for your spirit, mind, and body; for the sunshine; for the earth; for your friends and loved ones.<br><br>A young man once said to me, "I don't pay my tithing because I don't believe that I owe the Lord anything."<br><br>I answered, "What if the Lord were to turn the air off for a few moments, would you hastily change your mind?"<br><br>He responded, "I hope that he doesn't." What would you do if the air were turned off for two minutes, and God agreed to turn it back on if you would agree to love him with all your heart, might, mind and soul? Would you quickly agree, or would you want to procrastinate and think it over?<br><br>The Lord does not force man into loving him. He promised man this choice privilege and blessing in these words: "Be faithful and diligent in keeping the commandments of God, and I will encircle thee in the arms of my love" (D&amp;amp;C 6:20). What a choice promise! If you keep his commandments, God will encircle you in the arms of his love!<br><br>In these latter days the Lord has admonished:<br><br><i>Yea, blessed are they whose feet stand upon the land of Zion, who have obeyed my gospel; for they shall receive for their reward the good things of the earth, and it shall bring forth in its strength.</i><br><br><i>And they shall also be crowned with blessings from above, yea, and with commandments not a few, and with revelations in their time--they that are faithful and diligent before me.</i><br><br><i>Wherefore, I give unto them a commandment, saying thus: Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, with all thy might, mind, and strength; and in the name of Jesus Christ thou shalt serve him.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 59:3–5].<br><br>This is a divine order for children of God. How powerful in your life is the influence of your love for God? How effective in your daily character is your love for God? The acts of your daily life, the sweetness of your character, reveal the love you have for your creator. Man is not the author of his own creation, his birth, his life, his death, his resurrection, and his eternal life; all of these acts are from God. His creations are real. Birth is real. Life is real. Mortal death is real. And the resurrection and life after death are real. The highest and most important kinds of knowledge available to each of us are the doctrines, commandments, and the eternal truths from God. Don't ever sell them short. If you fail to visit with the Lord and his prophets in the scriptures on a daily basis, you fail in one of the great blessings.<br><h2><b>Seek Divine Truth</b></h2><br>A prophet said, "As [a man] thinketh in his heart, so is he" (Proverbs 23:7). As you think in your heart, so are you. Your acts are a product of your thinking. Do you depend on a divine source for your answers? Some seek familiar spirits. Keep your eyes open. Some follow witchcraft to find life's answers. Some seek the answers through the stimulation of drugs. Some want to feel their godliness from drugs and stimulants rather than from the commandments of the Lord. Some seek inspiration from a bottle rather than the Bible. Some look to astrology to give life's answers, to foretell the future, and to interpret the influence of the heavenly bodies upon their lives and destinies. Some are complacent, indifferent, and don't care.<br><br>I am talking to the finest the Lord has on this earth. There is not a finer body of human beings anyplace in the world than right here. You happen to be part of it. Yes, it is true that "as a man thinketh in his heart, so is he." Are you looking for the divine way of life, for divine truths? Jesus lived on the earth as a God. He taught doctrines and commandments from heaven. He exemplified the divine way. He said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me" (John 14:6). This scripture is easy to memorize but not easy to comprehend fully.<br><br>Some choose to make their own way and plan of life. They have their own traditions and commandments. The Lord said, "I, the Lord, am bound when ye do what I say; but when ye do not what I say, ye have no promise" (D&amp;amp;C 82:10).<br><br>Do you know where the door to the kingdom of God is? Jesus said, "I am the door: by me if any man enter in, he shall be saved" (John 10:9). The apostle Paul said, "For through him we both have access by one Spirit unto the Father" (Ephesians 2:18). Jesus Christ is the one and only way to the kingdom of God. Man can become godlike and enter into the kingdom of God by following and keeping the commandments of Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ is the only mortal being that has ever lived on this earth that had the power of a God. He walked on water; he stopped the wind and the storm; he raised the dead back to mortal life; he healed the blind, sick, and crippled. He multiplied a few fishes and a few loaves of bread and fed thousands. He was transfigured in the presence of Peter and John; he was first to be resurrected from the dead; he ascended before witnesses from this earth into the kingdom of God.<br><br>Do you pray to God? Do you pray as Jesus commanded? Do you keep the commandment on the proper manner of prayer? The Lord's prayer is a commandment. Jesus commanded:<br><br><i>After this manner therefore pray ye: Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed by thy name.</i><br><br><i>Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven.</i><br><br><i>Give us this day our daily bread.</i><br><br><i>And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors.</i><br><br><i>And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil: For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever. Amen.</i>[Matthew 6:9–13]<br><br>The test: Do you pray for the kingdom of God to grow and flourish on the earth? Do you participate in helping to build the kingdom of God on earth as it is in heaven? Do you pray to do the will of God? Do you thank God for all good things? Do you ask for forgiveness of your sins and weaknesses? Do you ask God to help you in the temptations of this life? Do you ask God to deliver you from evil? What is your goal in this life? Is it eternal life in the kingdom of God? Do you say to your Heavenly Father, "For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever. Amen"? Do you ask in the name of Jesus Christ? Jesus said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me" (John 14:6).<br><br>Jesus gave the following promise: "And whatsoever ye shall ask in my name, that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son. If ye shall ask any thing in my name, I will do it" (John 14:13–14).<br><br>Today in this troubled world many are looking for evidence of divine power. We must all open our eyes and our hearts to the abundance of divine power in our own lives and in all that surrounds us.<br><br>Many are looking for peace; Jesus Christ is the Prince of Peace. Many are looking for a powerful voice; the voice of Jesus Christ is the most powerful voice known to man. Many are looking for an eternal purpose. Jesus commanded all mankind to "seek ... first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness" (Matthew 6:33).<br><br>The test: Do you seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness or do you put worldly gains and achievements first?<br><h2><b>Protect Yourself Against Evil</b></h2><br>The apostle Paul warned and commanded the saints of his day to be strong in the Lord and the power of his might, to put on the whole armor of God:<br><br><i>Put on the whole armor of God, that you may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil.</i><br><br><i>For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.</i><br><br><i>Wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand.</i><br><br><i>Stand therefore, having your loins girt about with truth, and having on the breastplate of righteousness;</i><br><br><i>And your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace;</i><br><br><i>Above all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked.</i><br><br><i>And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God:</i><br><br><i>Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for all saints.</i>[Ephesians 6:11–18]<br><br>Again in these latter days, Jesus Christ commanded that man, and especially members of his Church, put on the whole armor of God (see D&amp;amp;C 27:15–18).<br><br>Why do we as children of God with potential godliness need the protection of the whole armor of God? Why do we need protection against the powers of the devil and his evil, ungodly ways? Why do we need protection against traditions and commandments of men? Why do we need protection against Satan's inspired clothing styles, Satan's inspired music, and Satan's inspired traditions? Why do we need protection against Satan's inspired, sex-stimulating lyrics and eardrum-destroying music? Why? Some people like Satan's music more than they love the Lord's music. These people are among us. If you are one of them, I can tell you that much of the rock music and hard rock comes from Satan. It is part of the destruction of godliness. The devil has been given power to lead people captive at his own will. I will read it to you from the scriptures. Here is the power Satan was given by your Heavenly Father: "And he became Satan, yea, even the devil, the father of all lies, to deceive and to blind men, and to lead them captive at his will, even as many as would not hearken unto my voice" (Moses 4:4). The only protection we have is the voice of the Lord.<br><br>The prophet Alma said:<br><br><i>For I say unto you that whatsoever is good cometh from God, and whatsoever is evil cometh from the devil.</i><br><br><i>Therefore, if a man bringeth forth good works he hearkeneth unto the voice of the good shepherd, and he doth follow him; but whosoever bringeth forth evil works, the same becometh a child of the devil, for he hearkeneth unto his voice, and doth follow him.</i><br><br><i>And whosoever doeth this must receive his wages of him; therefore, for his wages he receiveth death, as to things pertaining unto righteousness, being dead unto all good works.</i>[Alma 5:40–42]<br><br>The prophet Mosiah recorded, "Therefore I say unto you, that he that will not hear my voice [speaking for the Lord], the same shall ye not receive into my church, for him I will not receive at the last day" (Mosiah 26:28). The Lord said to the Prophet Joseph Smith, "The hour is not yet, but is nigh at hand, when peace shall be taken from the earth, and the devil shall have power over his own dominion" (D&amp;amp;C 1:35). President Harold B. Lee, on March 18, 1973, said in the Manti Temple, "Now is the time spoken of in the scriptures when peace shall be taken from the earth. We are in it. It is all around us." Then hear these comforting words: "And also the Lord shall have power over his saints, and shall reign in their midst, and shall come down in judgment upon ... the world" (D&amp;amp;C 1:36). Brothers and sisters, fellow students, there has never been a better time in the history of man to be a Saint with Jesus directly at the head of the Church. Don't despair. He has more power than the adversary, far more.<br><br>We are in the last days. Prophecies from the scriptures about the last days are being fulfilled. You have heard this passage many times, but it bears a lot of repeating:<br><br><i>In the last days perilous times shall come.</i><br><br><i>For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,</i><br><br><i>Without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good,</i><br><br><i>Traitors, heady, highminded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God;</i><br><br><i>Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof: from such turn away.</i><br><br><i>For of this sort are they which creep into houses, and lead captive silly women laden with sins, led away with divers lusts,</i><br><br><i>Ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.</i>[2 Timothy 3:1–7]<br><br>Today, as never before, we need the whole armor of God. We need to keep it tight. We can't wear it loose because the devil is too clever with his darts. Righteousness today is wrestling against the rulers of darkness in this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places. The fiery darts of evil and wickedness are all around us.<br><br>When the Lord said the time was nigh at hand when peace would be taken from the earth and the devil would have power over his own dominion, he gave the comforting statement that the Lord would be at the head of this Church. President Kimball is the mouthpiece for the Lord, but the Lord is the head of this Church. The Lord said, "The eyes of the Lord are in every place, beholding the evil and the good" (Proverbs 15:3). We should not be tempted in this life, brothers and sisters, to try to gain the celestial kingdom by shoddy, questionable, manmade shortcuts.<br><h2><b>Progress Toward Celestial Exaltation</b></h2><br>To the progressive mind, searching is inevitable. Reaching and wanting and waiting are also inevitable. But be sure to enjoy the full journey of life; don't always wonder when you are going to get there. Some want to arrive without taking the journey. One of the choice virtues of life is to be prepared to enjoy the journey. Some want God's rewards and blessings without earning them. Some want divine protection without putting on the whole armor of God. Remember God's greatest gift and blessing is to live someday with him in his celestial kingdom. Are you preparing and working to receive a degree that prepares you to enter into the celestial kingdom? Are you building a celestial, godlike character into your life? Are you devoting sufficient time to preparing your mind and body for celestial glory? If you want to grow a celestial garden, you had better sow celestial seeds. The apostle Paul gave this warning:<br><br><i>Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap.</i><br><br><i>For he that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption; but he that soweth to the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting.</i><br><br><i>And let us not be weary in well doing: for in due season we shall reap, if we faint not.</i>[Galatians 6:7–9]<br><br>The apostle said, "Be valiant and do not grow weary and faint on the course, on the journey." If you sow seeds of righteousness, you will harvest righteousness. If you sow thorns and corruption, you will reap thorns and corruption. A prophet of the Lord said, "For they have sown the wind, and they shall reap the whirlwind" (Hosea 8:7). If you sow seeds of purity, you will harvest purity. If you sow seeds of petting, immorality, and promiscuity, you will harvest destruction to your godlike attributes. If you sow seeds of pure love, you will receive pure love. If you love God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind, you will reap God's love. If you would obtain celestial glory, you must plant into your heart and character God's heavenly ways. Jesus admonished in these words: "For if you will that I give unto you a place in the celestial world, you must prepare yourselves by doing the things which I have commanded you and required of you" (D&amp;amp;C 78:7). If you want a celestial life, you will have to plant celestial seeds. Pure religion comes from God. If you want pure religion in your life, you must plant the gospel of Jesus Christ in your heart. Remember, "As a man thinketh in his heart, so is he." If you think as a celestial being, you will be a celestial being. If you think as a child of God should think, you will be a member of his celestial family.<br><br>Jesus said, "As many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God" (John 1:12). Isn't that a great promise? Our religion teaches personal responsibility to a living, personal God. There is a powerful, divine influence in knowing that an interested, all-seeing eye scrutinizes our every thought and word and act. Salvation and godliness come from the church of Jesus Christ. His church was established to build divine character in the human soul. The Church was organized for the perfecting of the Saints. The Lord has raised up prophets, apostles, and leaders that are inspired to lead the Church. They are the mouthpieces of the Lord, the voice of the Lord, and the power of God unto salvation. With such heavenly guidance, none need go astray. You must keep in mind that there is a divine purpose in your life. Each day you are preparing for the degree of glory that you will merit from your life's work. There is a degree available that will allow you to enter into the telestial kingdom of glory; there is a degree available that will qualify you to enter into the terrestrial kingdom of glory; there is a degree available, and the requirements, that will permit you to go into the celestial kingdom of heaven with God. All of us, all mankind, will receive a final examination from God. And each will receive his graduation degree of glory, befitting his life's accomplishments in relation to how he has obeyed the will of the Lord. The Lord gave these words:<br><br><i>For those that live shall inherit the earth, and those that die shall rest from all their labors, and their works shall follow them; and they shall receive a crown in the mansions of my Father, which I have prepared for them.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 59:2]<br><br><i>For they shall be judged according to their works, and every man shall receive according to his own works, his own dominion, in the mansions which are prepared.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 76:111]<br><br>We are free to choose for ourselves. Receiving the degree and diploma of salvation and eternal life for the celestial glory is the greatest of all successes and achievements. This is God's greatest gift and reward. Remember his promises:<br><br><i>If thou wilt do good, yea, and hold out faithful to the end, thou shalt be saved in the kingdom of God, which is the greatest of all gifts of God; for there is no gift greater than the gift of salvation.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 6:13]<br><br><i>They who are of a celestial spirit shall receive the same body which was a natural body; even ye shall receive your bodies, and your glory shall be that glory by which your bodies are quickened.</i><br><br><i>Ye who are quickened by a portion of the celestial glory shall then receive of the same, even a fulness.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 88:28–29]<br><br>The vision and revelation received by the Prophet Joseph Smith and Sidney Rigdon pertaining to the celestial kingdom is recorded in section 76 of the Doctrine and Covenants, as you know. It is a divine classic, and, in my opinion, among the greatest of all literature. Be sure you are acquainted with section 76 of the word of God. It contains information on the three kingdoms that God has prepared and promised to his children. If you have prepared yourself for the celestial kingdom, you are prepared to live with God and his saints. Here are the blessings for the celestial kingdom. I am going to read them from the word of the Lord, and then I will close. The people who will inherit the celestial kingdom are those that, after being baptized and receiving the Holy Ghost,<br><br><i>overcome by faith, and are sealed by the Holy Spirit of promise, which the Father sheds forth upon all those who are just and true.</i><br><br><i>They are they who are the church of the Firstborn.</i><br><br><i>They are they into whose hands the Father has given all things--</i><br><br><i>They are they who are priests and kings, who have received of his fulness, and of his glory;</i><br><br><i>And are priests of the Most High, after the order of Melchizedek, which was after the order of Enoch, which was after the order of the Only Begotten Son.</i><br><br><i>Wherefore, as it is written, they are gods, even the sons of God.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 76:53–58]<br><br>This goal is worth working for. Don't dissipate your godliness for a dish of mush. Don't sell it for a pot of porridge.<br><br>Section 76 continues:<br><br><i>Wherefore, all things are theirs, whether life or death, or things present, or things to come, all are theirs and they are Christ's, and Christ is God's.</i><br><br><i>And they shall overcome all things.</i><br><br><i>Wherefore, let no man glory in man, but rather let him glory in God, who shall subdue all enemies under his feet.</i><br><br><i>These shall dwell in the presence of God and his Christ forever and ever.</i><br><br><i>These are they whom he shall bring with him, when he shall come in the clouds of heaven to reign on the earth over his people.</i><br><br><i>These are they who shall have part in the first resurrection.</i><br><br><i>These are they who shall come forth in the resurrection of the just.</i><br><br><i>These are they who are come unto Mount Zion, and unto the city of the living God, the heavenly place, the holiest of all. ...</i><br><br><i>These are they whose names are written in heaven, where God and Christ are the judge of all.</i><br><br><i>These are they who are just men made perfect through Jesus the mediator of the new covenant, who wrought out this perfect atonement through the shedding of his own blood.</i><br><br><i>These are they whose bodies are celestial, whose glory is that of the sun, even the glory of God, the highest of all</i>[D&amp;amp;C 76: 59–66, 68–70]<br><br>We have a prophet today. If you ever have a problem that seems too difficult for you, go to your bishop, or go to your stake president, and if the problem still seems too difficult, write a letter to the prophet of God. He'll honor your letter. Don't despair. You are a child of God, in his image and likeness. That makes you big enough for any occasion, big enough for any problem that can come. I know that the Lord is close by. I see his hand working all the time, all over the earth. I see his prophet making prophetic moves and his apostles making inspired moves on the earth. We are not left without leadership. We are not left to despair. The greatest day of all is coming when Jesus comes with his saints to reign on this earth. Let us be sure we are with him, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Bernard P.

<h1>es on the Frontiers of Knowledge - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Thank you very much, and thank you, President Oaks. This is really my first opportunity to view this audience from this particular perspective, and as you can probably imagine, it is indeed overwhelming. But I do want to express, both for myself and I am sure for all of the other recipients of the Karl G. Maeser Awards today, our appreciation to the Alumni Association and to the University. We feel that this is an honor to be invited to join such distinguished company as the past recipients of these awards, and we do thank you. Since teachers wouldn't be teachers without students, I would also like to take this opportunity today to express my own appreciation to my students and to tell them how much they mean to me and how special they are. I see them scattered over the audience.<br><br>At an assembly recognizing achievement in research and teaching within a university, it seems appropriate to talk about challenges on the frontiers of knowledge. A true university is on the frontiers of knowledge. It is a community of scholars dedicated to expanding the bounds of knowledge in all disciplines. The university offers both faculty and students a challenge, not only to learn what others have discovered, but also to feel that joy of discovering for themselves something really new after long and diligent research. Challenges create excitement, and the university world can be a very exciting place--for the fresh young undergraduate completing his first independent study project, for the young faculty member with a new Ph.D. just beginning to test his research abilities on his own, for the seasoned researcher with many publications to his credit and with the earned respect of his colleagues, and for everyone in between.<br><br>Dr. DeBakey, the noted heart surgeon, pointed out a few weeks ago when he visited this campus that every one of us has an important obligation to at least support scientific research that will be used to improve the quality of life for all mankind. Dr. DeBakey, of course, vividly demonstrated this point by showing films of lifesaving open-heart surgery that had been made possible through the efforts of hundreds of researchers working in laboratories throughout the world.<br><br>There are new challenges on the frontiers of knowledge in every academic discipline of the university. Many of the unsolved problems that present challenges overlap several disciplines, and interdisciplinary approaches to their solution are essential. We do need to work together in this community of scholars that is a university. Cooperation among disciplines and understanding of each other's abilities and contributions will help greatly to further the knowledge explosion and the application of new knowledge to the problems of living.<br><h2><b>Food and Nutrition an Applied Science</b></h2><br>Today I would like to take my own academic area, which is nutrition and food science, to illustrate just a few of the unsolved problems that are today creating challenges. As I talk about some of the unanswered questions in nutrition, equally challenging problems in each of your own academic areas should come to mind. The problems may be different, but the challenges of discovery should have a common thread.<br><br>My chosen field of study is one that might be classified as an applied science. Consequently, it draws on many other areas for basic scientific principles to be applied to the practical problems dealing with food and nutrition. It draws on chemistry, biochemistry, physiology, microbiology, medicine, sociology, psychology, anthropology, economics, agriculture, and engineering--all important to food and nutrition. It is in itself interdisciplinary, at least in a sense. The area of nutrition and food science is also one that is somewhat unique because it actually involves a personal experience for everyone who lives. Whether you eat to live or live to eat, you are still involved with food. Everyone eats, or he doesn't live very long. Thus, everyone is something of an expert on foods, at least where his own food habits are concerned. This situation creates both advantages and disadvantages for the educator and the researcher in nutrition and food science. It is an advantage in that he has a really tremendous audience interested in his subject, but it is sometimes a disadvantage in that he has to compete with so many self-styled authorities, to whom subjective personal experience is sometimes more important than documented research data.<br><br>Yes, the problems in nutrition and food science are many. It is a relatively new science, only about sixty years old. Although it is a rapidly expanding field, the expansion often seems to do little more than open up new areas of the unknown. And I think that this is common to most disciplines--a sometimes overwhelming recognition of the tremendous store of knowledge and application yet to be discovered.<br><h2><b>Social Implications of Food</b></h2><br>Let's begin with some social science implications for food and nutrition. We might say that food is more than nutrition. Man as a biological being does require food to sustain life. He eats to satisfy his hunger and to meet his basic drive for food. But man is also a social being, and food is intimately woven into the social, psychological, and intellectual lives of men. Men have learned to live and work together and have organized themselves into societies. As human infants grow and develop, they are incorporated into one of these societies through varied experiences, and many of these experiences involve food. The term<i>culture</i>may be used to describe a way of life in which there are common customs or rules for behavior and in which there is a common understanding among members of the group. Food is filled with many different meanings and much symbolism for all individuals at various ages and stages of their maturity. Food is part of the fabric of life, and this fact must be recognized by anyone who seeks to change or to modify the food patterns of individuals and groups.<br><br>An anthropologist, Dorothy Lee, has written about food and human existence:<br><br><i>When I speak of FOOD AND HUMAN EXISTENCE, I am not trying to use a special synonym for the phrase "nutrition and life." I mean something beyond mere biochemical nutrition and more than mere physical survival. Food can engage me completely as a person. It can bring to life my keen anticipation, my impatient or happy waiting; it can evoke my memory in all its pain and joy; it can pierce me with nostalgia; it can revolt me to the point of vomiting. Its preparation can be an act of relatedness, of obligation, of self-fulfillment, of creativity, of love; its eating can be participation and communion. Let us hope it also nourishes me physically, supplying me with the proteins, vitamins, carbohydrates, and other nutrients I need to stay alive and healthy so that I can experience the fullness of human existence.</i>["Food and Human Existence," National Dairy Council<i>Nutrition News</i>25 (October 1962):3]<br><h2><b>Technological Influences on Nutrition</b></h2><br>Much of modern society has become oriented toward science and technology. Engineering developments and food technologies have been extensive in recent years. Such things as prepared infant formulas have become readily available. The large-scale food production and service outside the home are expanding the habit of eating out. The increasing use of convenience food, both in the home and in the eating-out establishment, is another part of this expanding technology. This technology has influenced the food habits and patterns of eating for most of us in the United States. The fact that much food preparation is now done outside the home may very well influence the social aspects of food within the home, since this situation decreases individual family members' reliance on each other for providing food to eat. Anyone can warm up his own TV dinner; he doesn't need mother to do it for him. Probably the impact of technology has had an influence in stimulating the back-to-nature movement in food. Organic home gardening is becoming more popular, especially in groups among whom so-called natural or unprocessed foods are emphasized. For those who are part of this movement, actually more rather than less food preparation is done at home. Thus, we have opposite trends, both influenced by modern technology.<br><h2><b>Symbolic Uses of Foods</b></h2><br>With all of these technological influences, I think it is important that the meanings of food other than the merely biological ones be considered and talked about. Food, we might say, means security. The infant learns about security when his mother responds to his crying by giving him food. Familiar foods bring back memories of home and family and make one feel more secure even when away from home. A food package, home baking sent by a mother to a son or daughter in college, has much more significance than the empty calories it may contain, and I suspect that most of you know this from personal experience.<br><br>My nephew is now on a mission in Japan. Next to a letter from home, he seems to find a box of home-baked American cookies the best antidote for homesickness and for the problem of getting used to strange and unfamiliar foods--even though the cookies are only crumbs when they arrive in Japan, and he has to eat them with a spoon. The feeling of being full and physically satisfied and of knowing that there is a year's supply of food stored in the basement also brings security of both a temporal and a spiritual nature, especially to the breadwinner of the family.<br><br>Food is also the symbol of hospitality, and it is used to show that one cares about others and is a friend. A new family is welcomed into the neighborhood with food. Gifts of food are given, both in times of happiness and holidays, and in times of sorrow when a loved one has been lost. Certain foods show status. Beefsteak has status in the United States. Taking someone out for a steak dinner usually means a little more than going out for a hamburger, although the nutritional quality of the meats is the same. White rice, although nutritionally inferior to brown rice, has status in some countries of the world and is preferred and eaten primarily for this reason. Foods commonly eaten by blacks in the southern United States--such as collards and turnip greens, fat pork, and certain fish--were for a long time not acceptable to whites because of status. Now, however, this attitude is changing, and soul food is being served and enjoyed in many prestigious restaurants throughout the country.<br><br>To quote Dr. Lee again:<br><br><i>In our own society food is . . . the center of values and feelings that have nothing to do with nutrition, with the stilling of hunger pangs, or even with eating itself. Why else did the supermarkets in Detroit begin to stock black-eyed peas and mustard greens as soon as the influx of Southern immigrants hit the city? Why do stores in the big city carry queer things like seaweed, vine leaves pickled in brine, or dried stringy abominably (or is it deliciously?) smelling fish?</i><br><br><i>I will tell you why they carry vine leaves. They carry them for me because I yearn for them. For me, born and nurtured in the Near East, a vine leaf wrapped around cold rice cooked with olive oil, onions, herbs, pine-nuts, and currants, evokes a whole way of life. It brings to me a re-enactment of the time I sat around the table with my mother and my sisters, skillfully spreading out the wrinkled vine leaves with sensitive fingertips, gauging to a grain the right amount of filling as I piled it on each leaf, wrapping and rolling and stacking interminably, smelling the tangy scent, talking and quarreling and laughing and singing.</i>["Food and Human Existence"]<br><h2><b>Problems of Poor Nutrition</b></h2><br>How do the many meanings of food offer challenges on the frontiers of knowledge? There are worldwide problems of health related to poor nutrition. Poverty and ignorance are probably the major reasons for consumption of inadequate diets, but results of dietary surveys, at least in the United States, suggest that only at the very bottom of the economic scale, where there is the greatest poverty, does lack of money play the dominant factor in determining food choices. If a nutrition educator wants to help people make wiser food choices from a biological or a health standpoint, he must be interested in the process of changing food habits. And these habits, as we have been pointing out, may be very deeply ingrained. Anyone who works with changing any part of cultural food habits must study the entire cultural pattern carefully, because a change in food habits may have extensive and sometimes undesirable effects on other parts of the culture. Food habits are changing in many parts of the world; I don't want to give the impression that you can't change food habits. But they're not necessarily always changing for the best. Affluence brings its own problems in relation to food. The challenge is to find out more about how good habits do change and to channel this discovery into areas that will bring lasting benefits to human health.<br><br>What are some of the other unsolved problems in nutrition waiting to challenge anyone who is willing? Changing patterns of disease over the years have pushed certain chronic diseases to the top of the list for causes of death in the United States. A leader is heart disease. The abnormality that underlies much of the heart disease is a condition with the unpronounceable name<i>atherosclerosis</i>, a type of degeneration of the arteries that is characterized by the accumulation of fatty substances as lesions in the walls of the medium and large arteries of the body. Atherosclerosis of the coronary arteries, narrowing and blocking the arteries that nourish the heart muscle itself, is probably the basic cause of heart attacks that claim the lives of so many relatively young American men each year. A recently published textbook says, "It is hard to overemphasize the enormity of the problem of atherosclerosis as a disease." What does nutrition have to do with atherosclerosis? Here is another challenge. An elevated level of blood cholesterol and possibly triglycerides or plain fat in the blood is now considered to be a major risk factor for coronary heart disease, even though many people who have heart attacks do not have high levels of blood cholesterol. It has been shown in many research studies that the amount of fat in the blood is affected by the type and amount of food that is eaten. But in spite of the publication during the past fifteen years of literally thousands of research reports on this subject, an incontestable direct link between diet and coronary heart disease in the human has not been proven. Who could ask for a greater challenge than to solve or to clarify this problem and related ones for mankind?<br><br>In other areas, what is the relationship between the amount of fiber or bulk in the diet and cancer of the colon, which is a problem of increasing magnitude in the United States? How does nutrition affect the aging process? How can the accumulation of excess fatty tissue in the body, a condition that we call obesity, be prevented in an affluent society such as ours, where we have really outdone ourselves in providing, not only an abundance of food, but also an abundance of food that delights the palate without regard to the nutritional contribution that it might make to meeting the body's physiological needs?<br><br>Is it really desirable to feed babies in a way that produces the most rapid growth possible? Is that peak growth curve going to bring long-term dividends? Some animal studies have suggested that baby rats fed both calories and protein a little sparingly, so that they did not grow quite as rapidly as they might have done, actually reaped benefits in longer life and in extended prime of life, or period of productivity. When the rats grew rapidly, they matured earlier--but they also died at a younger age. These are only animal studies. Is this pattern true for humans?<br><br>What are the roles of the trace elements, such as chromium, zinc, and copper, in human nutrition and in the prevention of disease? Will massive doses of vitamins really decrease illness? And is this a nutritional problem or is it a pharmacological one? Are vitamins being used as drugs in this case? After the researchers discover and clarify new knowledge, who translates these masses of scientific data into a practical language, understood by everyone who chooses the food he will eat each day, day by day and year by year?<br><br>The dietician or nutritionist has been called a translator of nutrition information. How effectively are we doing this? How can it be done better? Challenges--there are enough challenges for all of us, both in my academic discipline and in yours. Look for these challenges and get involved in them.<br><br>Finally, speaking of challenges, I would like to tell you that this has been a great challenge as well as a pleasure for me to talk with you today. I hope that while you are here at BYU you will each catch the spirit of discovering, the search for truth and light in the academic world, and that you will know the excitement that comes from making even a tiny contribution to expanding the frontiers of knowledge. This is my prayer in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Marion Bennion was director of the BYU coordinated undergraduate program in dietetics when this devotional address was given on 26 March 1974.</i></i><br><br><i>© Brigham Young University.

<h1>Sheep - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I feel about as out of place as a rabbi in the mission home to be in this position. I have been here at BYU for fifteen years and have seen some outstanding speakers and heard some great sermons preached from this and other pulpits for devotional assemblies. When the President's office called and asked if I would fulfill this particular assignment, I searched in vain for excuses but could find none. I hearkened back to the teachings that came from my home: I was taught obedience as a very young man. I'm happy for that teaching. I'll never forget the time when I was eighteen and signed a professional baseball contract. As I was ready to go to spring training for the first time, my mother said, "Glen, I've got a piece of advice for you."<br><br>"Yes, Mother dear, what would that be?"<br><br>"Put on a clean pair of socks every day."<br><br>I thought, "Gee, that's good advice." But after the eighth day I couldn't even get my shoes on. As a result of that training, when I was asked to occupy this position, I immediately said yes.<br><br>The school experience is one of problem solving, of decision making. We know that the prime objective of this and any school is the removal of ignorance. We also know that many schools steep themselves in tradition and in effect teach you and me how to live in the past. What I'm trying to do this day with the few things I would like to say is help you to make decisions that are meaningful and to become an adept problem solver. Young people today are constantly challenged. You're forced to choose between alternatives, compelled to make value judgments, and certainly obliged to solve problems and pressured to make decisions. Many of these decisions will have an influence on your opportunity to enjoy an exalted hereafter and will have a lasting effect for eternities to come.<br><h2><b>Making Important Decisions Once</b></h2><br>I am certainly no sage, and I do not speak to you from an ivory tower, but I do submit to you the proposition that you make as many decisions as you possibly can in advance and make them only once. How often we say, "Gee, I've got this decision to make today," or, "I've got this problem to solve." We continually redecide and re-solve. That isn't necessary. Just think of all the things in your life that can be decided but one time. For example, isn't it terrible for the brethren to have to spend all Saturday evening trying to decide whether or not to attend priesthood meeting Sunday morning or for the sisters to spend a whole week wondering about Relief Society or whether they can get to their Primary assignments?<br><br>There are so many things in life that can be solved in advance and but once. We have to make decisions, I believe, when we're emotion-free, when we're clear to think and to think rationally. In baseball, for example, prior to the game, the two managers or the two coaches meet with the umpires and go over what are called the "ground rules." The ground rules are unique little rules that pertain just to a particular baseball park. For example, if the ball trickles into the dugout, the ball is dead and the runners advance a base. This is decided before the game ever starts. But can you imagine making that kind of decision when the University of Utah and BYU are playing a baseball game? We'd never arrive at a logical decision because in the middle of the game we are not emotion-free.<br><br>I see people sitting in the stands and watching a young quarterback make what they consider to be a great decision. Thirty-five thousand fans screaming in his ear, the ball on the four-yard line, fourth and goal, his team behind by a few points, and he needs a touchdown. That quarterback comes out and makes the decision, and his team goes in for the touchdown and wins a very important football game. The people sit back and say, "Gee, that kid thinks well on his feet. Boy, what a fine young thinker he is." Well, they give him credit for being something that he really may not be, because that decision was probably made far in advance. Under the guidance of a very capable coach, this young man has discussed strategy and learned about football hour after hour. The coach as said, "Look, when there are thirty-five thousand fans in the stands, when it's fourth and goal and we really need a touchdown, these are the one or two plays that you have as alternatives. You do not have the whole range of three or four hundred plays; you have but one or two that will really help you."<br><br>I believe that's what we have to do in our lives--to make decisions in advance. I know that we have to make boy-girl decisions far in advance, because if we wait till after the dance and after the malt and the hamburger and we're close to each other and are feeling the emotions of being near someone who is very attractive, we're never going to make the decision that should be made. We're going to make the wrong decision. And so I suggest to you this day that you make as many decisions as you possibly can, make them one time, make them in advance, and make them when you are absolutely emotion-free.<br><h2><b>Five Helps for Successful Decision Making</b></h2><br>There are some things that have helped me in decision making, and perhaps they'd be helpful to you. In 1 Nephi, Nephi's brothers came to him with a question. Their father, Lehi, had made some explanations about doctrine, and they really didn't understand it. They asked Nephi, "Help us with this. What should we do?"<br><br>Nephi's question to them was "Have ye inquired of the Lord?" (1 Nephi 15:8). That helps Glen Tuckett: first, inquire of the Lord.<br><br>The second step that's helpful to me is also illustrated in the scriptures. As Adam offered sacrifice, an angel appeared and said, "Why dost thou offer sacrifices unto the Lord?"<br><br>Adam's answer was, "I know not, save the Lord commanded me" (Moses 5:6). That's excellent advice, I think, for you and me. We do something because our Heavenly Father commanded us. I'm sure that someone once said, "Nephi, why do you keep two records? One record would be plenty."<br><br>Nephi answered, "I really don't know except the Lord commanded me" (see 1 Nephi 19). Neither Nephi nor his questioner knew that Martin Harris was going to lose a few pages and that a few other things were going to happen.<br><br>I think my problem is maybe like yours. Once in a while I inquire of the Lord, I'm commanded of the Lord through inspiration, and maybe the answer really doesn't fit. Sometimes I have the audacity to say, "Now, Lord, let me explain the problem one more time."<br><br>I remember that when I was a young man my father told me to do something, and I had the audacity to say, "Dad, why?" (That was before the new freedoms became prevalent.)<br><br>Dad said, "Because I told you so." Gee, that was a good reason! That was a really good reason. I believe it should be reason enough for you and me when the Lord commands us to do things we don't understand.<br><br>The third point about problem solving is illustrated in the life of the Savior. The entourage of which the twelve-year-old Jesus was a part had started their journey northward after having been in the city of their birth to observe the Passover. They'd gone about a day's journey and found that the boy Jesus was not with them. We're told that it took three days before they discovered this twelve-year-old discussing weighty matters with very wise men in the temple. His mother was greatly exercised and wondered why he had thus dealt with them. And his answer was very, very important, because he said, "Wist ye not that I must be about my Father's business?" (Luke 2:49). I believe that it helps in problem solving to be about our Father's business.<br><br>The fourth help to me in solving problems comes from the Savior's teachings to the Nephites. Third Nephi records the Savior's appearance to the Saints and the great advice he gave. He told the people what to name the church and other important things they should do. Toward the latter part of the twenty-seventh chapter of 3 Nephi, he asked them the question, "What manner of men ought ye to be?" As only the Savior could teach, he didn't let them go home and think about it; he taught them there on the spot. He said, "Verily I say unto you, even as I am" (3 Nephi 27:27).<br><br>Here is the fifth point that I think helps me in problem solving. When the Savior had glimpsed the other side and returned to visit with his chosen on the shore of the sea of Tiberias, he confronted one by saying, "Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me?"<br><br>And Peter said, "Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love thee."<br><br>The Savior responded, "Feed my sheep" (John 21:16).<br><br>These things have been helpful to me in solving problems: to inquire of the Lord; to do what I'm commanded to do, knowing not why, save the Lord commanded me; to be about his business; to use the Savior as an example; and, finally, to feed his sheep. I'm sure that all of us are in the "sheep-feeding business"--either as shepherds or as consumers. Those of you who consume will soon feed. I have often thought, "What did the Lord really mean when he told Simon to feed his sheep?" I have four little personal sheep of my own who call me "Dad," and I have many, many other sheep that I have adopted.<br><h2><b>Feed Your Sheep with Love</b></h2><br>What do these sheep really need to be fed? I think first and foremost they need to be fed a thing called<i>love</i>. When the Man of Nazareth started his ministry, those that were in political power at the time more or less backed him into a corner and tried to get him to incriminate himself by giving the wrong answer to the question they were going to ask. They asked him, "What's the first and great commandment? What's the most important of all the rules and laws and do's and don'ts that we're trying to live?" Brother Talmage tells us that in the law of Moses, the decalogue, there were 732 do's and don'ts--little picayunish things. Other scriptorians tell us there were 3,600 do's and don'ts in the law of Moses.<br><br>The Savior did not hesitate but said that the first and great commandment is "Thou shalt<i>love</i>the Lord thy God." And without being asked, he said, "The second is like unto it, Thou shalt<i>love</i>thy neighbor" (see Matthew 22:36–39; emphasis added). So his answer to the question contained the word<i>love</i>twice.<br><br>John, who chronicled the life of the Savior, tried to tell you and me how we're made in the similitude of our Heavenly Father and finally, in the fourth chapter of his first epistle, told us that "God is love" (1 John 4:8). That's a great one-word description or definition of our Heavenly Father.<br><br>Paul, who wrote and traveled and did so many things, talked about faith, hope, charity, long-suffering. But one time he said that the most important of all is love. I'm naïve enough to believe this--that the most important of all is love.<br><br>Burt Bacharach, who writes your kind of music (and my kind of music, too, by the way), a few years ago wrote a melody to Hal David's words: "What the world needs now is love, sweet love. That's the only thing that there's just too little of. . . . No, not just for some, but for everyone. Lord, we don't need another mountain." We've got plenty of mountains. What the world<i>really</i>needs now is love, sweet love.<br><br>A few years ago the Green Bay Packers won the Super Bowl for the second consecutive year and for ten years had dominated professional football. After that victory, the television crew was in the dressing room, and the interviewer had the microphone right under the chin of the great and late coach Vince Lombardi. His question was "How come the Packers win all the time? Your blocking techniques, tackling techniques, game plan, kicking game--all are very similar to everyone else's in the league. How come the Packers win all the time?"<br><br>Vince Lombardi was a very emotional man, a very verbal man, but it took him a long while to get it out. Finally he wiped a tear from his cheek and said, "The Packers win because the Packers love each other." If you've ever seen Henry Jordan or Ray Nitschke, you know that only a mother could love those guys. This is the thing that makes the gospel so vital. The gospel, the good news of the Lord and Savior, is the gospel of love. That's the thing that makes it go.<br><br>I must confess to you that, up until fifteen years ago (I got married about fifteen years ago), I had but one prayer in my heart. There was only one thing that I wanted to do. I prayed morning and night, unashamedly, that I could be the shortstop for the New York Yankees. That was my prayer. I don't pray that any more. (The Mets maybe, but not the Yankees.)<br><br>My prayer now is "I want to be the father of lovely and virtuous young ladies." I've been blessed with four little girls. I've observed families that have done a great job with their children. I went to one couple, Doctor and Sister Sundwall, and asked, "How come your kids are so good? What is it you do with them?"<br><br>They said, "Oh, we do this, this, this, and we give them plenty of love."<br><br>I asked Dick and Shelba Simper, "How come your kids are so good? What is it you do?"<br><br>"Oh, we do this, this, this, and, oh, by the way, we give them plenty of love." That seems to be the common denominator--give them plenty of love. What the world needs now is love, sweet love.<br><br>Just think of all the people, the neurotics, the emotionally disturbed, who are now being treated because of some deep-seated problems that could be traced back to the fact that somewhere in their lives they were deprived of love. Wouldn't it be great if kids that needed help would just raise their hands and say, "Help"? They don't do that. None of us does. We manifest that need in so many, many ways, and what we're saying is that we really need love.<br><h2><b>Develop a Testimony</b></h2><br>I wish we could feed our sheep a thing called a testimony. Webster's says that a testimony is "a statement or affirmation of fact." I've often thought about this. I've often thought, at the time of confirmation, "Wouldn't it be nice, when we lay hands on the head of the individual being confirmed and tell him to receive the Holy Ghost, if we could say, 'And, by the way, receive ye a testimony'?" Evidently, our Heavenly Father didn't want it to work that way, because a plan similar to that was rejected in the premortal existence. Evidently a testimony is something that we have to earn and work for ourselves.<br><br>Testimonies are an unusual kind of thing. My life is also a little bit strange because sometimes I am up on the mountain. Up on the mount, I've got a beautiful view of Zion. It's clear up there, and it's crisp, and I feel good. I'm living the way I should. But then other times, when I'm not doing the things that I should be doing, I lapse down into the valley of despair. As we sang the opening song, a great feeling came over me when I hit the same note that you were singing. It's nice to be in tune, and, similarly, it's nice to be in step and to be doing what our Heavenly Father would like us to do.<br><br>Now I'd like to draw a couple of analogies about testimonies and other things. I'm involved in the area of physical education, and I would like you to know that the law of testimony is very, very similar to the law of muscle. The law of muscle is this: we take a muscle and overload it; when we work it hard it grows. It gets bigger and more efficient. Take the biceps, for example, the muscle that makes your arm bend up and down. When we overload that muscle we work on it and work on it and every day overload it and we find that the muscle gets stronger and stronger and stronger. (A person with a well-developed biceps is easy to recognize. He goes around in short-sleeved shirts; he gyrates and gestures, and we just know he's got biceps. We say, "Gee, there goes a guy with a biceps." It just sticks out all over him.)<br><br>But, you know, if a person forgets about his biceps and quits using it, in about the same amount of time that it took to develop that great strength, the muscle will go right back down to where it was when he started. Muscles are just like testimonies; testimonies have to be used. They have to be overloaded, they have to be borne, and they have to be expressed. As we do those things, they get bigger and bigger and bigger. Others notice and say, "There goes somebody with a testimony." It sticks out just exactly as a biceps does.<br><br>I would much rather have an emotional testimony than an intellectual testimony. I can read Hugh Nibley's book<i>Approach to the Book of Mormon</i>, I can read Jack West's<i>Trial of the Stick of Joseph</i>, and there's no way that the Book of Mormon can be anything but what it purports to be. But that's an intellectual testimony. I remember, when I was a youngster in school, we studied prehistoric man. I knew all about prehistoric man--Neanderthal man, Cro-Magnon man, Peking man. In fact I wrote a paper on Peking man. I knew where he lived, how he lived, the kind of job he had, the kind of girl he married. I was really a pro about prehistoric man. I even read<i>Fleet Foot, the Cave Boy</i>, which required a little extra work. A few years ago I read that a group of archaeologists and anthropologists in London got together and said, "We're really sorry, everyone, but there's no such thing as Peking man. We created him out of something that really didn't exist."<br><br>In biology, twenty-five years ago, the answer to the question "How many chromosomes in the human reproductive cell?" was simple--twenty-four. Try twenty-four on for size today and see how well you do on a biology test. There are really only twenty-three. (I don't know what happened to that other chromosome, but some of the people I see around these days make me wonder.)<br><br>I'd much rather have an emotional feeling about the gospel: the feeling that comes over you when you read the Book of Mormon and, as Moroni said, pray about it (see Moroni 10:4). You get such a good feeling. The men walking and talking on the road to Emmaus were joined by a stranger who asked questions. When they arrived at their destination, the stranger broke bread and blessed it and then he disappeared. One man said to the other, "Did not our heart burn within us . . . ?" (Luke 24:32). That's the kind of feeling that I want. I like the emotional testimony.<br><h2><strong>Motivate Yourself</strong></h2><br>I have two other quick points that help in sheep feeding. It is really important to feed sheep inspiration. We're now in an era of motivation. Everything we hear about is motivation this and motivation that. We have just concluded a great general conference. People have come up to me and said, "Oh, didn't Elder Dunn and didn't Elder Hanks motivate you?" I don't mean to be sacrilegious or anything, but my answer to them is "No, they didn't motivate me at all, but they surely inspired me to motivate myself." Inspiration comes from without, and, I believe, motivation comes from within. We've each got our own little motivator, just as we have our own little cholesterol maker somewhere in our bodies. That motivator makes you and me do things that are really worthwhile.<br><br>When I think of inspiration, I think of the things that come from without. I think of the young boy in fifth grade in Murray, Utah, who was taking a class in music appreciation and learned a song entitled "Stouthearted Men": "Start me with ten who are stouthearted men, and I'll soon give you ten thousand more." That's a fight song, and I'm just naïve enough to believe that statement. Only a handful thought that the Man of Nazareth really was what he said he was, and Christianity has grown so greatly. There's another quote that says, "Hearts can inspire other hearts with their fire. And the strong obey when a strong man shows them the way." There are strong men around, there are strong people around, and I believe that it's incumbent upon you and me to find out who they are and to pattern our lives after them. There are not enough good patterns in the world at the present time, but the greatest ones are our Church leaders and others right here at BYU.<br><br>I find a new hero every time I read the standard works of the Church. If I had time I'd tell you about some of them. I would, however, like to tell you the best inspiration story I know, which is a football story about a young man playing fullback for the University of Oklahoma. The University of Oklahoma had gone ten years without losing a conference football game, had gone forty-seven straight games without losing to anyone; Army, Navy, Notre Dame, Texas, Alabama--you name the team, they played them and beat them. But on this particular day, while playing the University of Nebraska at Norman, Oklahoma, it looked as if they were going to be beaten. It was late in the game, they had the ball deep in their own territory, and they were behind. The winning streak was going to go down the drain, but in a second down and long-yardage situation the ball was handed off to the tailback, a young man named Billy Vessels, who ran sixty-seven yards for a touchdown that snatched victory from defeat. His run prolonged that great winning streak. All of the news media said, "That touchdown run was, without a doubt, the best run in the history of Oklahoma football and maybe in the history of football per se."<br><br>On Monday, when the coaches looked at the film, they found that something strange had happened on this particular play. Billy Vessels did make a great run, but the play went differently than they had thought. The quarterback, Claude Arnold, took the snap from center and handed off to Vessels, the tailback, who was going to run around the right end. The fullback was a boy named Leon Heath; he wore number 40 on his jersey. His job on this play was to hook the end, to block him in, so Vessels could run around him. As the ball was snapped, the end came across too far. The average player would have thought, "Get back over there. The coach said you'd be right there. Get over there." Players move around from time to time, and they are not always located where we coaches draw them on the board. Instead of trying to hook the end, Heath just drove him out of the play, and Vessels cut inside, got around the corner, and eventually was confronted by the cornerback. Vessels made a quick left, cut behind the line of scrimmage, and ran into the offside linebacker. What a hit! Two great athletes going full speed. Vessels was struggling to stay on his feet and eventually to break the tackle. Just when it looked as if he were going down, into the film came number 40, the man who had just blocked the end. Heath got a shoulder pad into the linebacker and knocked him off the tackle. Vessels spun free, balanced on his hand, hit for the sidelines and then headed for the tall grass of the end zone, which was about sixty yards away. Billy Vessels--six foot two, 210 pounds of Heisman-trophy-winning, All-American tailback--could run like the wind. As he was on his way to the end zone, here came the weakside safety, the man that plays on the weak side of the formation. You could just see that he was going to get Vessels on about the fifteen-yard line. When Vessels got to the twenty-five, he had to make up his mind what he was going to do--run over him, stop, call time, say, "King's x," or something else. Just as he had to make up his mind, into the film came number 40, Leon Heath, moving like a freight train. He hit that safety, put him about eight rows up in the grandstand, and Vessels walked into the end zone for the greatest run in the history of Oklahoma football.<br><br>That's inspiration. That's an inspiring kind of a performance. If you and I are going to get where we would like to get eventually, we had better not only complete that first assignment but also go get a linebacker. And if we really want an exalted hereafter, we had better hitch up our belts and go get the safety.<br><h2><b>Be Committed</b></h2><br>My final point is a thing called commitment, which means you are going to do what you say you are going to do. I think about all the commitments that come into our lives. If I could just feed the sheep with whom I work daily this thing called commitment, that would be great. I have seen what a few committed individuals can do, and so have you.<br><br>As a young man working in a bishopric, I taught a lesson to the teachers quorum about commitment. One of the stories was about an airplane pilot who was going to land on an aircraft carrier. After three pages of verbal intrigue, the whole crux of the matter was that, when the pilot got to a certain point in his descent, he had to go land on a little moving dot, the aircraft carrier. Can you imagine it? Before he got there he could go up, down, left, right, and come back and try again and again. But once he went past a certain point, he was committed to go land on that little dot. I thought that was really something.<br><br>Now let's change the setting to 1974. How would you like to be lying on your back on the launching pad, looking at all those dials and switches and hear someone say, "10, 9, 8, . . ."? "Oh, my gosh, how did I get in here?" you'd think. They tell me that until the count gets to four you can call time, push the off button, abort the mission, and you don't have to go. But once it gets past four, you are committed. Total commitment? Clear to the moon! That is total commitment.<br><br>I believe this has to happen to us in our lives in the Church; we have got to commit totally. The sooner we do that, the better off we are going to be. We have got to do it. I would like to conclude with another sports story that really depicts this thing called commitment.<br><br>It was homecoming day at Champaign-Urbana, the home of the fighting Illini--the University of Illinois. They were playing Wisconsin for the Big Ten football championship. With seventy-two thousand fans in the stands, late in the ball game, Illinois had a lead of seven to three. Wisconsin had the football on Illinois' four-yard line, first and goal, with four minutes left to play. Get the picture? A field goal won't tie it or win it; they have got to score a touchdown. Illinois had a little linebacker who, during the time out prior to putting the ball in play, went around and shook guys, saying, "We have got to stop them! It is important that we win this football game." Just before Wisconsin went into the huddle, this little Illinois linebacker got the Wisconsin quarterback's attention. Playing fullback for Wisconsin that year was a guy named Alan "the horse" Ameche--six foot three, 230 pounds, Heisman trophy winner, two-year All-American, later the all-pro fullback for the Baltimore Colts--a moose of a man. Your grandmother would have known who was going to get the football on the four-yard line. But this little linebacker got the quarterback's attention and said, "Hey, send Ameche at me." Now, I have been on the line of scrimmage, and I would just as soon Ameche went over there someplace. This is like saying, "President, let me do it"; "Bishop, I'll do it"; "Dad, I'd be happy to do it." The linebacker felt, "The whole game depends on how I play. Send him at me." The quarterback thought, "You're as good as the next guy," and he handed off to Ameche in the direction of the taunting linebacker. When the dust settled, this little guy screwed his hat back on straight again, and, with the ball on the three-yard line, got the quarterback's attention and hollered, "Hey, send Ameche at me again." Four times he egged him on: "Send Ameche at me." When the smoke cleared and the dust settled, the ball was on the ten-yard line, and Illinois won a great football game because one little guy on that team had enough courage to invite them to "send Ameche at me!" that's commitment!<br><br>As the Savior began his ministry, he needed helpers. He went to Peter and Andrew and said, "Come follow me." And they straightway left their nets and followed the Savior--<i>Commitment!</i>He went to James and John, the sons of Zebedee, and said, "Come follow me." And they immediately left their father and their boat and followed the Savior (see Matthew 4). That's commitment! These are the things that we have to do. If we are going to be saved in our Heavenly Father's kingdom, I believe it becomes incumbent upon you and upon me to make this decision, as others have made it. I think Joshua said it best: "Choose you this day whom ye will serve; . . . but as for me and my house, we will serve the Lord" (Joshua 24:15). May this be our lot I pray humbly in Jesus' name. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Glen C. Tuckett was the baseball coach at BYU when this devotional address was given on 9 April 1974.</i></i><br><br><i>© Brigham Young University. All rights reserved.</i>
<h1>et to Heaven - Loren C. Dunn - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I appreciate, my brothers and sisters, the opportunity of spending these few minutes with you. It is an interesting experience to come back to BYU from time to time and to have the opportunity to speak to the student body. May I relay my congratulations to the<i>Universe</i>staff. I hope most of you are planning to make journalism a career. We are in deep need of some objectivity in the profession and we are in need of people who don't carry their individual biases into the profession. We are in need of people who uphold the truest standards of journalism and have the ability to bring out the facts and to be objective about what they are looking at and what they report and what they do. A free press is based on the integrity and ability of people who are involved with the press, and it will stay as free as they are capable and competent enough to be worthy of the trust of the people. So there is great need for what these young people are training themselves for today.<br><br>I was going through some notes last night and came across something that was of interest to me at least. Somebody had collected some phobias. I hope I can pronounce all these correctly. (There's a sister out in Orem who, if I go wrong in my grammar or enunciation, sends me an anonymous letter and always spells my name wrong.) The list included<i>amathaphobia</i>, an abnormal fear of dust;<i>amaxaphobia</i>, morbid dread of boarding a trolley car;<i>chronaphobia</i>, impulse to smash clocks;<i>rectophism</i>, an uncontrollable desire to buy shoes;<i>triskaidekaphobia</i>, irrational fear of the number thirteen; and, finally,<i>uranathphobia</i>, the fear of going to heaven.<br><br>And I guess it's this last one that I would like to speak most about, because we run across people who seem to have a great fear of going to heaven. I guess the gospel of Jesus Christ is aimed at helping people to understand, first of all, what it means to go to heaven and, secondly, what they need to do in order to get there. So what I'd like to do in the next few minutes today is to discuss with you the whole concept of how to get you to heaven. There are two basic, fundamental scriptures--or I should say concepts--that teach us how to get to heaven. Let me share those with you if I can.<br><h2><b>Obedience</b></h2><br>This is the Lord speaking in 3 Nephi:<br><br><i>And this is my doctrine, and it is the doctrine which the Father hath given unto me; and I bear record of the Father, and the Father beareth record of me, and the Holy Ghost beareth record of the Father and me; and I bear record that the Father commandeth all men, everywhere, to repent and believe in me.</i>[3 Nephi 11:32]<br><br>I like that. This is the Lord teaching the Nephites right after he appeared. First of all, he taught that he was obedient to his Father and gave us a pattern that we must follow if we are to be saved, and that is to be obedient to the Lord as the Lord has been obedient to his Father. I think there is another principle there which is also beautiful, and that is just the simple, plain, basic principle of a son or a daughter being obedient to his father and his mother. There's something divine about that relationship. There's something that strengthens everybody concerned when that kind of obedience is enjoyed.<br><h2><b>The Covenant of Baptism</b></h2><br>The following verse is one I would like you to listen to:<br><br><i>And whoso believeth in me, and is baptized, the same shall be saved; and they are they who shall inherit the kingdom of God.</i><br><br><i>And whoso believeth not in me, and is not baptized, shall be damned.</i>[3 Nephi 11:33–34]<br><br>The Lord sends us here as his children to do one basic thing that we know of, and that is to be baptized. Anybody who wishes to inherit the kingdom of God and anybody who wishes to be saved on the face of this earth must be baptized and must be baptized by someone who has the authority. Belief in Jesus Christ is essential, and baptism by someone who has the authority is essential. But we're sent to this earth, basically, to partake of two significant ordinances, and one of those is baptism. So important is it that the Lord says, "And whoso believeth not in me, and is not baptized, shall be damned," which is to say that his progress will be stopped.<br><br>Baptism is one of the first doctrines that the Savior taught the Nephites after he appeared. His words are recorded in 3 Nephi 11:33–34. Three verses later he returned to the same topic: "And again I say unto you, ye must repent, and become as a little child, and be baptized in my name, or ye can in nowise receive these things" (3 Nephi 11:37). In the very next verse, for the third time, as if he were trying to emphasize to the Nephites what the basic fundamentals of the gospel of Jesus Christ were about, he said, "And again I say unto you, ye must repent, and be baptized in my name, and become as a little child, or ye can in nowise inherit the kingdom of God" (3 Nephi 11:38). That's three times. "Verily, verily, I say unto you, that this is my doctrine, and whoso buildeth upon this buildeth upon my rock, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against them" (3 Nephi 11:39).<br><br>Baptism is essential for a person who wants to inherit the kingdom of God. That's one of the basic ordinances that the Lord sent us here to earth to partake of, and the person who is baptized has a hope of inheriting the kingdom of God. The person who doesn't, according to the Lord, will be damned--or his progress, in other words, will be stopped.<br><h2><b>Childlike Forgiveness and Faith</b></h2><br>I like this statement in 3 Nephi where the Savior says, "And become as a little child" (3 Nephi 11:37). He repeats that a couple of times. He's not referring to becoming childish, but childlike. And I think children teach us great lessons sometimes. We have five children now. Our most recent one is four months old. We have a relatively young family, and I'm interested in watching my children to learn some of the great qualities and characteristics that they teach us.<br><br>I have a two-year-old who's a bandit. He's a very active little boy, and he gets in trouble sometimes and requires some punishment--a spanking or something of the nature. He's very dramatic when he's spanked; first his lips begin to quiver, and then he goes into his room and cries. But always, within two or three minutes, he's back again. Life is back to normal, and he's going about doing the things he's doing--sometimes the same things that he was doing before.<br><br>It's remarkable to me to see the ability of a child to forgive. I had a friend once who punished his child for something he didn't do. That was an interesting experience because, when he found out the child hadn't done it, he called him in and said, "Son, I'm sorry I did this, but I want you to know that there's something to be learned from it. That is that you will, in your lifetime, be blamed for things that you didn't do." Now, everyone has to go through that. That's one of the trials of life. But if you can undergo that trial with a forgiving heart and if it doesn't make you bitter, then you will have learned something that will help you in your eternal progression and bring you peace and joy and happiness in your life. A child has the ability to do that. A child has the ability to forgive. And that, truly, is a great characteristic.<br><br>Children are also full of faith. They're quick to believe, aren't they? They're anxious to believe, and they continue to believe until we do things that destroy that faith and until they get older and maybe a little bit more cynical. In a way that change is unfortunate. You look at some of the great men you know and you'll find that spirit and quality of faith, the desire and the ability to believe. That truly is a great and a beautiful and a marvelous characteristic--the ability to have faith and the ability to believe and to maintain that belief through life.<br><br>My father had that quality in his adult life. I can remember a person came to town one day and wanted a handout for a meal. My father wouldn't give it to him, but he said, "Now, what do you do?"<br><br>The fellow said, "Well, I've been a painter."<br><br>The poor man's hands were shaky and the rest of it, but Father said, "Well, we've got an old barn that we'd like you to paint, and if you'll paint that, then we'll pay you for it and you'll have something to go on."<br><br>So the fellow went around the corner to England's paint store and bought some paint. Then he went down and painted our barn.<br><br>Mr. England called us after it was over and said, "You know that man you sent up?"<br><br>My father said, "Yes."<br><br>He said, "Well, he bought more paint than he needed." Of course, by then he was gone.<br><br>But my father said, a little bit philosophically, "Well, we got our painted barn and we've given this man an opportunity to know that somebody had faith in him and trust in him. Hopefully, somewhere down the line that will take effect."<br><br>Some people may have said to my father, "Well, you were taken," but I look on the situation in a little different way. He had the ability to have faith, to have faith in other people.<br><h2><b>The Covenant of Temple Marriage</b></h2><br>The second great commandment, or ordinance, that we need to take advantage of as we go through life is explained in section 131 of the Doctrine and Covenants. Let me read that to you:<br><br><i>In the celestial glory there are three heavens or degrees;</i><br><br><i>And in order to obtain the highest, a man must enter into this order of the priesthood</i>[meaning the new and everlasting covenant of marriage];<br><br><i>And if he does not, he cannot obtain it.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 131:1–3]<br><br>We all know that there are three degrees of glory, but in the highest degree there are also three degrees. A man may enter into the second or third degrees of the celestial degree, but that is the end of his kingdom. He cannot have an increase. It's interesting to me that the Lord would equate exaltation with increase. The world seems to think that increase is a dirty word nowadays, but I think of the passage, also in the Doctrine and Covenants, where the Lord says that the world is "full, and there is enough and to spare" (D&amp;amp;C 104:17). The world has abundance, or it is full and to spare--which is to say that, if its resources are used properly, there is enough for everyone. I think that we have a great need to look more toward the second coming of Jesus Christ than we do toward the time when there won't be enough of the environment left for people to live in. the Lord is not that poor a planner. The world was created for man and it will serve its purpose. That doesn't mean that we don't have to be careful as far as the environment is concerned, because we do. He expects us to husband and take care of what we have. But the problem is not overpopulation, generally speaking. The problem is the salvation of man and the earth's fulfilling its purpose as far as the destiny of man is concerned.<br><br>The Lord tells us, if we can put these two scriptures together, that a man will inherit his kingdom, which I assume is the kingdom where he is--the celestial kingdom--through baptism and temple marriage. It is through temple marriage that a man and wife are sealed together for time and eternity. That's the ordinance that binds together the family and the family organization. In section 132 the Lord, listing a whole number of things--like contracts, oaths, obligations, and so forth--says that these things will have an end when men are dead because they are sealed by the authority of this earth. But there is only one thing that will go beyond this earth, as far as authority is concerned, and that is that which has been sealed by the priesthood, because that and that alone will be recognized after men are out of this world. If a person wants a marriage for time and eternity, and if he wants an eternal family unit, it must be based on the principle of temple marriage and the principle of the priesthood, which causes something to last beyond this life (see D&amp;amp;C 132:7). The Lord has sent us here to do essentially two things: first, get baptized and keep all the ordinances surrounding baptism--that is, keeping the commandments associated with baptism; second, get married in the temple. And if we are married in the temple and are faithful to the covenants associated with it, then he has promised us that we can inherit the highest degree in the highest kingdom. We can go where he is. We can become like unto gods if we take advantage of these two great and glorious ordinances.<br><h2><b>Genealogy</b></h2><br>Genealogical work is so important to these two ordinances that the Lord has seen to it that we go to great lengths to perform them for people who didn't have the opportunity to do them when they were here. Their whole progress and their whole future, eternal future, and their whole exaltation rest with these two great and glorious ordinances--the ordinance of baptism and the ordinance of temple marriage.<br><br>As you come into this earth life, if you want to do two things that will bring joy and a hope of eternal progression to yourself--and I'm sure joy to the angels of heaven and to the lord himself--you will live so that you can be worthy of baptism and then keep the baptismal covenant, and you will live so that you can be worthy of temple marriage and then keep the temple covenant.<br><h2><b>Missionary Work</b></h2><br>If that is the way that a person returns and is exalted in the presence of God, do you see now the importance of our going into the world and teaching the gospel of Jesus Christ? We teach the discussions to bring a person to a realization that he needs to be baptized in the appropriate and proper way by someone who has the authority in order to enter into the kingdom of God. That's the beginning of eternal progression. The whole purpose of these discussions is to reach out to the lovely, wonderful sons and daughters of God who have not yet received this information and to bring them to an understanding that this is the way that a man or a woman or a child returns to the presence of God.<br><br>In connection with this, President Kimball has spoken to both the General Authorities and the Regional and Mission Representatives about missionary work. Also, in the priesthood session of the last general conference, he made one thing very clear as he began to enlarge the vision of all of us concerning this great work, through which we bring the gospel of the kingdom to the entire world. He said every young man is expected to go on a mission. As you think of the baptismal covenant, as you think of the responsibilities associated with the priesthood, that's just a natural thing, isn't it? In order to honor his priesthood, in order to honor his baptismal covenant, a young man will put himself in a position where he can bring this knowledge to the sons and daughters of God who are in darkness. There are millions of them and God loves them. How will they know unless we tell them? I'm sure this is precisely the thing the Lord expects of us as his children--to bring this knowledge of salvation and exaltation to those who are yet in darkness.<br><br>You can do a lot of things in life and you can become part of a lot of causes, but what a magnificent thing you have done when you have brought to some child of God, some son or daughter of God, the pathway and the ordinances that lead to his presence! That's the ultimate gift. Everything else pales next to the opportunity of returning to the presence of God, and so the ultimate in service and in love of fellowman is our ability to offer others the way to exaltation--the strait gate, the narrow way, the way to return to the presence of a God who lives. President Kimball--and I'm sure the Lord, because he speaks through President Kimball--expects the priesthood, the young priesthood, to prepare, to be worthy, and to go into the world and bring exaltation and the pathway to exaltation to those who are yet in darkness. Baptism and temple marriage are important ordinances in this context.<br><h2><b>Winning the Race Toward Exaltation</b></h2><br>Not too long ago, my son and I went to a professional track meet. It was a good night. We saw two or three world records broken. One, as I remember, was in the 880. If you've been to one of these meets, you know the way to tell whether or not the person is going to break a world's record. There are simulated lights around the track that flash on and off at the pace of the world's record. You watch those blinking lights go on and off around the track and know that that's the pace that will have to be bettered in order to beat the world's record. You watch the man running, and you watch those lights, and you can tell how close the record is to being broken. The runners in the 880 got off to a furious start; almost everybody was ahead of the light. At 440, one person in particular was still ahead of the light. As they came into the final lap and he made his move, he was a good quarter of a track ahead of the light. He finished strong and broke the world's record, and the place was in pandemonium. It was exciting to watch.<br><br>The thing that interested me about the winner, though, was that, when he passed the 440 mark and was ahead of the light, he didn't' stop and jump up and down. You see, nobody gives you credit until you've crossed the finish line. And the race is not through until you've crossed the finish line. Although you may be ahead at the 440 mark, it can all go for naught if suddenly you stop to say, "I made it this far."<br><br>Perhaps in the Church there is danger of this feeling. We're taught, many of us, in our youth to respond to the question "What do you want to do?" by saying, "Well, I want to go on a mission and maybe I want to graduate from college." (It's not important what you do professionally as long as you become as good as you can be at whatever you decide.) Our youth conclude by saying, "And I want to get married in the temple." So we pass those marks. We pass the 110 and the 220, the 440, and sometimes we're into the final lap, or maybe we're not that far along, and perhaps that final lap consists of temple marriage. We get married in the temple, and perhaps we have fulfilled all the goals we have set for ourselves.<br><br>Tragically enough, some of us in those kinds of circumstances, after baptism and temple marriage, don't understand that from that point forward we simply have to finish the race. Tragically enough, some who don't realize the fact begin to run into problems, and some of them stop before they've crossed the finish line. Some marriages go in the wrong direction. Some people who had everything going for them suddenly haven't been able to make their marriages work, and they have some difficulties.<br><br>The objective is not temple marriage alone. The objective is being married in the temple, then keeping the covenants, and then crossing the finish line--living your marriage a day at a time. Someone once said that you get married in the temple and then you spend the rest of your life learning to live together and putting together an eternal relationship. It's not all glory. You have to do it a day at a time. You have to lay your foundation. You have to accomplish the things you need to accomplish a day at a time. You need to learn to know each other and you need to work out your problems. You need to learn to be loyal to each other, and when the humdrum pace of life sets in, you need to see things through. A day at a time, make your marriage and your relationship and your love a little stronger and a little better. Temple marriage is no guarantee in itself that you'll have a successful marriage, although it is a tremendous beginning, a<i>tremendous</i>beginning. But from that point forward, your marriage will be the sum total of what you and your companion contribute to it. You don't get very much out of your marriage that you haven't first of all put into it. And if you establish that marriage relationship, that eternal marriage relationship, then you'll have something going for you. But just because you're on the starting blocks and just because you've pushed off into a temple marriage does not guarantee, without any effort on your part or without the living of the commandments, that you're going to finish the race. You have to persevere, and you have to cross the finish line. There are a lot of older people who can tell you that. Marriage can become, and it should become, more beautiful as time goes on, as you honor the covenants, as you honor each other, as you put your marriage together, as you seek to finish the race.<br><br>The Lord has sent us here, not just to get baptized, but to get baptized and to live the baptismal covenants--to keep the commandments. He sent us here, not just to have a temple marriage, but to have a temple marriage, then to live the holy covenants of the temple and of that marriage relationship when two are joined together, to live them for the rest of our lives, and to begin to make a little bit of heaven on earth in the sanctity and beauty of our own homes. We have to finish the race. It's not good enough just to push off the starting blocks and know that we're on the right track. We have to continue on, persevere, and endure to the end and establish an eternal relationship between husband and wife. Would you please remember that? Would you please remember that, when you enter into your temple marriage, it is by no means the end, but only the beginning? The next objective is indeed to endure to the end, to bless that relationship with children, and to begin to establish the kind of family that can truly be eternal. That's the purpose of life--not merely to launch into the sacred temple relationship, but to go on from there and make a truly eternal temple marriage out of that relationship, out of that beginning.<br><br>I think everybody is aware, for the most part, what the covenants and commandments are, what the Lord expects of us. In order to endure to the end, we've got to set our goals on finishing the race. In order to make things work, in order to be true to the baptismal covenant and the temple covenant, we must finish the race.<br><h2><b>Loyalty to the Priesthood</b></h2><br>May I read to you a statement from the First Presidency of the Church some years ago, when Joseph F. Smith was President of the Church, which I think summarizes what it is that I'd like to convey regarding how we can prepare ourselves to run the race to the end. The principle here is obedience to the priesthood and to the Lord's anointed. I've become convinced in my life that, after all of the nitty-gritty issues have faded away, the Lord is going to judge us pretty much on how loyal we were to the priesthood and how loyal we were to those whom he called. After all the issues have disappeared, I believe much of how we'll be measured will be our attitude and loyalty in that regard. This quotation is titled "The Warning Voice":<br><br><i>Directions for the guidance of the Church will come by revelation through the head. All faithful members are entitled to the inspiration of the Holy Ghost for themselves, their families, and for those over whom they are appointed and ordained to preside. But anything at discord with that which comes from God through the head of the Church is not to be received as authoritative or reliable. In secular as well as spiritual affairs, Saints may receive divine guidance and revelation affecting themselves, but this does not convey authority to direct others and is not to be accepted when contrary to Church covenants, doctrines, or discipline, or to known facts, demonstrated truths, or good common sense.</i><br><br><i>The Lord's church is a house of order. It is not governed by individual gifts or manifestations, but by the order and power of the holy priesthood as sustained by the voice and vote of the Church in its appointed conferences.</i>[That is a great principle. You know, some people are more apt to believe what they hear in Relief Society by way of, not the lesson, but informal discussion, than they are to believe what the President of the Church says in the editorial of the<i>Ensign</i>magazine that month. And that's what this principle is talking about.]<br><br><i>The history of the Church records many pretended revelations claimed by imposters or zealots who believed in the manifestations they sought to lead other persons to accept, and in every instance, disappointment, sorrow, and disaster have resulted therefrom. Be not led by any spirit or influence that discredits established authority and contradicts true scientific principles and discoveries or leads away from the direct revelations of God for the government of the Church. The Holy Ghost does not contradict its own revealings. Truth is always harmonious with itself. Piety is often the cloak of error. The counsel of the Lord, through the channel he has appointed, will be followed with safety. Therefore, Oh ye Latter-day Saints, profit by these words of warning.</i><br><br><i>Joseph F. Smith</i><br><i>Anthon H. Lund</i><br><i>Charles W. Penrose</i><br><i>The First Presidency</i><br><br>If we develop, as we take these ordinances upon ourselves, a spirit and attitude of loyalty to the priesthood and to those whom the Lord has anointed and ordained as the leaders of his church, then there is no way that we can find ourselves in disharmony with the Lord or his purposes. When we develop that attitude, then the covenants and commandments become easier to live and the ability to finish the race becomes easier and more realistic in our lives.<br><br>Now, let me say something that I've said before. I think that, after all the issues have faded away, the Lord will judge us on how faithful and loyal we were to the priesthood and to the Lord's anointed. The issue seems to lie there as far as our own exaltation and our own finishing of the race are concerned.<br><br>I am grateful again for this opportunity to be with you. I pray that we may set as goals in our lives baptism, if we have not done it, and then the honoring of the baptismal covenant; temple marriage and the honoring of the marriage covenant and the building of the marriage relationship; then the determination to finish the race, to run it and accomplish that which will bring us peace and happiness, and to be loyal to that marriage relationship, loyal to the priesthood, and loyal to the Lord's anointed.<br><br>I bear you my witness that I know that this is the church of Jesus Christ. I testify to you that I know God lives and that Jesus is the Christ and that Joseph Smith saw what he said he saw and that Spencer W. Kimball is a prophet of God today. I bear you that witness. This is the church of Jesus Christ. This is the way that a man returns to the presence of God. May we be loyal to it. May we bring this message to those yet in darkness, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Loren C.

<h1> Receive - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
President Oaks and you wonderful students and faculty, it is a great experience for me to be here with you today and with my dear husband and three of the four children that were mentioned in the introduction. This morning as I approached this beautiful campus, nestled at the base of these majestic mountains, and caught the grandeur of God's creations, myriads of warm, shiny experiences in and around this campus were recalled: There were weekends spent with a beloved aunt, Alice Louise Reynolds, a faculty member for many years. Our home in Salt Lake was her home. My room was her room. We shared so much--so much that she was determined to have a hand in selecting my husband. She didn't, but she highly approved of this wonderful man whom I sit by today and who received part of his college education under the mammoth trees of the lower campus. Although I graduated from the University of Utah, my favorite and most exciting dates were with BYU men at your fabulous socials, spiritual events, dances, picnics, and many exchange performances in which I was a participant. My mother was a graduate of Brigham Young Academy. Another aunt was the wife of one of your former Presidents, Benjamin Cluff. A daughter, Allyson, received her degree from this University four years ago. A son, Judd, found his eternal companion, Elizabeth, in your A Capella Choir last year and took her to the house of the Lord just two months ago, and they're here today. Another daughter here today, Jennie Jo, hopes to enroll as a freshman and swell your ranks by one in the fall of 1975.<br><br>I salute many of your faculty who have helped shape and mold my thinking: Reed Bradford, Antone Romney, Virginia Cutler, Leon Hartshorn, Jim Barton, and others. I extend deepest appreciation to President Oaks for providing great teachers with whom we serve in the Aaronic Priesthood MIA. I feel deeply honored and grateful to occupy this spot, which is a mere speck in this awesome and glorious edifice, and pray that the Spirit of the Lord will allow us to communicate these next few minutes on our needs to be ready to receive.<br><h2><b>The Challenge of Missionary Work</b></h2><br>The Lord must love us deeply and feel that we are ready to receive the inspiration, confidence, and trust our beloved prophet extended to us at general conference as President Kimball literally opened the heavens and enlarged our vision and understanding. Many of the Brethren subsequently referred to the powerful address on missionary work given by President Kimball at the seminar of the Regional Representatives of the Twelve. At that time, using successive section and verse, he gave the Lord's directives relative to taking the gospel to the uttermost parts of the earth and unto every creature that all might hear and receive his word. And we were admonished to teach all nations, kindreds, tongues, and people. President Kimball brought to our attention promises, commandments, directions, and the absolute faith that the Lord can do all things and will make it possible for his kingdom to roll forth to bring to pass his work and his glory--the immortality and eternal life of man. Are we ready to receive such vision, such direction, such commandment, that this is the time and this is the generation who have been prepared for this period of divine design in God's timetable? I am persuaded that God prepares the way and quickens the souls of men that they are ready to receive his word if they keep his commandments and are sensitive to his promptings.<br><br>To President David O. McKay's admonition several years ago that every member be a missionary, a new dimension, a new understanding has been given. President Kimball spoke of men in ages past opening doors and getting into places that were impregnable because they did as the Lord told them. God continues to open doors. President Kimball reminded the Brethren that the Lehites got into the promised land, that the early Americans won a triumph in the Revolutionary War, that the children of Israel were set free and made an exodus out of Egypt. Then in reference to the doors to the nations of the world we must open to missionary work, he said:<br><br><i>But I can see no good reason why the Lord would open doors that we are not prepared to enter. Why should he break down the Iron Curtain or the Bamboo Curtain or any other curtain if we are still unprepared to enter?</i><br><br><i>I believe we have men who could help the Apostles to open these doors--statesmen, able and trustworthy--but, when we are ready for them.</i>[Regional Representatives seminar, 4 April 1974]<br><br>President Kimball mentioned the fact that Brother David Kennedy would help specifically in this tremendous challenge and opportunity. Now, there is a perfect example of preparation. The Lord has given Brother Kennedy a training that few other man in the world will ever receive, and he has prepared him for this very delicate work of opening the doors of the nations to the gospel, which shall now go forth unto every nation. It will happen as we are ready to receive.<br><br>Again I quote from President Kimball:<br><br><i>The question is frequently asked: Should every young man fill a mission? And the answer has been given by the Lord. It is "Yes." Every young man should fill a mission. He</i>[the Lord]<i>said:</i><br><br><i>"Send forth the elders of my Church unto the nations which are afar off;</i>[He said elders. We have been talking about elders.]<i>unto the islands of the sea; send forth unto foreign lands; call upon all nations--first upon the Gentiles, and then upon the Jews."</i>(D&amp;amp;C 133:8.)<br><br><i>He did not limit it.</i><br><br><i>We now ordain young men at nineteen years of age to be elders. The answer is "yes." Every man should also pay his tithing. Every man should also observe the Sabbath. Every man should attend his meetings. Every man should consummate his marriage in the temple and properly train his children, and do many other mighty works. Of course he should. He does not always do it.</i><br><br><i>We realize that while all men definitely should, all men are not prepared to teach the gospel abroad. Far too many young men arrive at missionary age quite unprepared to go on a mission, and of course they should not be sent. But they should all be prepared.</i>[Regional Representatives seminar, 4 April 1974]<br><br>And thereon hangs one of our greatest challenges--to keep these young boys worthy.<br><h2><b>The Role of Women</b></h2><br>Perhaps this is where the women--the wives, the mothers, the girlfriends--fit in. They can prepare themselves to help create the atmosphere whereby these young men may develop and magnify their priesthood and realize their potential. One of BYU's most talented and loved writers, Carol Lynn Pearson, put this concept in such an eloquent language that I would like to quote one of her poems, called "On Nest Building":<br><br><i>Mud is not bad for nest building.</i><br><i>Mud and stick and a fallen feather or two will do</i><br><i>And require no reaching.</i><br><i>I could rest there with my little ones,</i><br><i>Sound for the season at least.</i><br><i>But if I may fly awhile,</i><br><i>If I may cut through a sunset going out</i><br><i>And a rainbow coming back--</i><br><i>Color upon color sealed in my eyes--</i><br><i>If I may have the unboundaried skies for my study,</i><br><i>Clouds, cities, rivers for my rooms,</i><br><i>If I may search the centuries for melody and meaning,</i><br><i>If I may try for the sun, I shall come back</i><br><i>Bearing such beauties gleaned from God's and man's very best,</i><br><i>I shall come filled and then, oh the nest that I can build.</i><br><br>To you young women, while the emphasis is not so much on leaving home to fill a calling in the Church, still there is a great emphasis concerning this preparation period for<i>your</i>special mission.<br><br>As you meet the challenges of each day and seek divine direction, you will develop a relationship with your Father in heaven. You will become acquainted with the whisperings of the Spirit. You will grow spiritually during your preparation time. You will be in readiness to be received in due time, to be the eternal companion of whom God spoke when he said, "They twain shall become one." Father Adam and Mother Eve were the prototypes of every couple who ever hoped to attain exaltation. You will seek to follow their example and to see in their relationship a priesthood courtship. As you seek to understand priesthood, its power and purpose, you will acquire an understanding and testimony of the order and government of God's kingdom here on the earth. And as you further develop and become ready to enter into the house of the Lord with one of his servants, a returned missionary, you will be ready to have a priesthood courtship of your own--one where God is the third party.<br><br>With permission, may I read a letter from our new daughter-in-law, Elizabeth, whom I mentioned before. This was written in the Salt Lake Tabernacle just four months ago, following the beginning of their priesthood courtship. It reads:<br><br><i>Dear Judd,</i><br><br><i>We are now just two minutes to broadcast time. There are a few more people here than usual because of Easter. This morning is so beautiful. I think that the morning is the most beautiful time of the whole day because it is new and full of hope--like a little resurrection every twenty-four hours.</i><br><br><i>Sitting here listening to this glorious music and thought-provoking words is a wonderful blessing, but there is another gift not everyone is aware of. This is the gift of atonement and resurrection. They are singing a chorale from the</i>St. Matthew Passion.<i>If only the whole world could hear it and understand its significance! We are like the rest of the world if we do not sink our roots deep into the earth. A tree without roots is called a prop. Its leaves exist without purpose or growth. This kind of tree can look exactly like a growing tree, but its purpose is not for growing and producing. What I am saying is that, even though we laugh or joke or hold hands and smile, it is meaningless if we are without roots. Our roots have got to be so completely anchored that nothing can blow us over. These roots must be firmly anchored in Jesus Christ. We must receive that gift without pause and steadfastly. This relationship cannot exist or function unless we anchor it in this good earth of the gospel.</i><br><br><i>I love you for all I am when I am with you and for all you are even when I'm not around. Let's keep building as dynamically and enthusiastically as we can.</i><br><br><i>Remember that, even though you have a scar in the middle of your eyebrow, I love you a lot.</i><br><br><i>E.C.</i><br><br>That is a beautiful love letter within the bonds of a priesthood courtship.<br><br>In your own preparation and in your own priesthood courtship, you will discover that like spirits attract. You will be in readiness to receive, in due time, the eternal companionship of which God spoke: "For intelligence cleaveth unto intelligence; wisdom receiveth wisdom; truth embraceth truth; virtue loveth virtue; light cleaveth unto light" (D&amp;amp;C 88:40). What you prepare to be is what you will attract. As a young woman more fully begins to understand her relationship to the priesthood of God here on earth, she begins to comprehend the strength, the power, the protection, the direction, yes, and the ultimate opportunities of exaltation that can come to her only within this priesthood structure and in no other way.<br><h2><b>Preparation During Youth</b></h2><br>I fondly reflect on games of my childhood such as "Kick the Can" and "Run, Sheepie, Run," when the captain or the starter would say, "Ready; set; go!" or "Ready; run." When it was time to come to find us, he would call, "Ready or not, you shall be caught." Will we be ready when we shall be caught, when this mortal life is ended, when we have finished this second estate?<br><br>Last year, standing in the wings behind the curtain moments before a magnificently inspiring young artists' music festival, I witnessed a performance that touched my heart--maybe even more than the performance on stage, certainly as much. A prayer had been offered in behalf of each of the young performers that their hard weeks--yes, even years of conscientious preparation--might be drawn from at this moment to ensure a masterful performance. Eyes were moist; hearts were touched as the strength and unity of family members lent confidence and encouragement to each performer. At that moment, a father, appearing proud and grateful, quickly leaned forward, gave his beautiful young daughter a tender kiss on the cheek, and whispered, "You're ready, my dear." And her next step was on stage, alone--a solo flight.<br><br>Oh, that our preparation at each step in our lives might be such that, as we approach that hour of challenge (and there are many), we might have that quiet whispering of the Spirit in our ears: "You're ready, my dear." Readiness implies so much and demands much more. The requirements are discipline, teachableness, understanding, humility, faith, and practice. These are just a few of the ingredients. To receive means to own, to accept, to have it become a part of you. When it is yours, you can share it.<br><h2><b>Obedient Servants of the Lord</b></h2><br>How generously the Lord has given us models and accounts of his chosen servants who have been ready to receive his commandments, his signs, and his direction. Noah was ready to receive the instructions for the ark that would carry him and all forms of life across the seas and perpetuate the human race and other forms of life. The brother of Jared was made ready to receive his instructions to build the barges and then, through the Spirit of God, beheld the finger of the Lord: "And it came to pass that when the brother of Jared had said these words, behold, the Lord stretched forth his hand and touched the stones one by one with his finger" (Ether 3:6). Daniel was made ready to receive interpretive powers that he might decipher and translate the words of prophecy in the royal court of Balshazzar, the king of Babylon, and was later protected when cast into the den of lions as God sent his angel to shut the lion's mouth.<br><br>How carefully the Lord prepared Abraham to be ready to receive one of the greatest tests of faith in holy writ! I weep and feel the greatest compassion when I read the account of his preparation for the sacrifice of his only son, Isaac, as written by Brother Melvin J. Ballard:<br><br><i>I think as I read the story of Abraham's sacrifices of his son Isaac that our Father is trying to tell us what it cost him to give his Son as a gift to the world. You remember the story of how Abraham's son came after long years of waiting and was looked upon by his worthy sire, Abraham, as more precious than all his other possessions; yet, in the midst of his rejoicing, Abraham was told to take this only son and offer him as a sacrifice to the Lord. He responded. Can you feel what was in the heart of Abraham on that occasion? You love your son just as Abraham did</i>[or will love a son as he did]<i>; perhaps not quite so much, because of the peculiar circumstances, but what do you think was in his heart when he started away from Mother Sarah, and they bade her goodbye? What do you think was in his heart when he saw Isaac bidding farewell to his mother to take that three days' journey to the appointed place where the sacrifice was to be made? I imagine it was about all Father Abraham could do to keep from showing his great grief and sorrow at that parting, but he and his son trudged along three days toward the appointed place, Isaac carrying the fagots that were to consume the sacrifice. The two travelers rested, finally, at the mountainside, and the men who had accompanied them were told to remain while Abraham and his son started up the hill.</i><br><br><i>The boy then said to his father: "Why, Father, we have the fagots; we have the fire to burn the sacrifice; but where is the sacrifice?"</i><br><br><i>It must have pierced the heart of Father Abraham to hear the trusting and confiding son say: "You have forgotten the sacrifice." Looking at the youth, his son of promise, the poor father could only say: "The Lord will provide."</i><br><br><i>They ascended the mountain, gathered the stones together, and placed the fagots upon them. Then Isaac was bound, hand and foot, kneeling upon the altar. I presume Abraham, like a true father, must have given his son his farewell kiss, his blessing, his love, and his soul must have been drawn out in that hour of agony toward his son who was to die by the hand of his own father. Every step proceeded until the cold steel was drawn, and the hand raised that was to strike the blow to let out the life's blood when the angel of the Lord said: "It is enough."</i>[Bryant S. Hinckley,<i>Sermons and Missionary Services of Melvin Joseph Ballard</i>(Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Co., 1949), pp. 152–53]<br><br>The love, the pain, the faith and compassion we feel, perhaps bring us one small step closer to understanding the sacrifice of our Father in heaven in giving his Only Begotten Son as a ransom that we might have eternal life. Abraham was ready to receive this ultimate test from God.<br><br>King Benjamin's exhortation to his sons as he prepared them and made Mosiah ready to receive the keys and powers of the kingdom is another vivid example of a people made ready to hear the word of the Lord. You will remember Mosiah was directed to make a proclamation that all should gather themselves together to go up to the temple to hear the words of the Lord:<br><br><i>And it came to pass that when they came up to the temple, they pitched their tents round about, every man according to his family, consisting of his wife, and his sons, and his daughters, ... from the eldest down to the youngest, every family being separate one from another.</i><br><br><i>And they pitched their tents round about the temple, every man having his tent with the door thereof towards the temple, that thereby they might remain in their tents and hear the words which King Benjamin should speak unto them.</i>[Mosiah 2:5–6]<br><br>Families prepared and ready to receive instruction today from a prophet of the Lord in a comparable way, we come together twice a year to see and hear God's chosen servants. Saints in the United States and Canada, Central and South America, Mexico, Australia, countries in Europe--including Great Britain, Austria, France, Switzerland, Belgium, and the Netherlands--Hawaii, and the United States Armed Forces in the Pacific heard our prophet speak this spring. In 890 buildings 190,000 priesthood bearers were instructed in their duties at the general priesthood meeting. Through electronic media the Lord has provided a way that all may hear.<br><br>We all know the miracle of preparing a land where the gospel could be restored in such a climate that Joseph Smith was ready to receive divine revelation. As a boy, he saw Satan's buffeting, and surely this is a method of preparing us to be steadfast in the gospel. He was visited by angels and was made to wait and learn patience and be prepared to receive the gospel in its fullness. Joseph Smith, just as all of the prophets of God were, was foreordained and made ready to come to this earth at this time and was appointed by God to restore the gospel of Jesus Christ here on earth. In section 35 of the Doctrine and Covenants, in response to an inquiry of Sidney Rigdon, the Lord said, "And there are none that doeth good except those who are ready to receive the fulness of my gospel, which I have sent forth unto this generation" (D&amp;amp;C 35:12). This means you, me, all of God's children. This generation may receive the fullness of the Lord's gospel when we are ready to receive it. What greater promise could we be given?<br><br>We have thus far spoken of men who were made ready to receive direct revelation from the Lord and to become instruments in his hands in furthering his work. Great among such children of God was Mary, a woman, the mother of Jesus. What greater privilege and calling could come than that of being made ready to become the mother of the Son of God? We know she was prepared to be the mother of Jesus for centuries before this event took place, as recorded in the writings of King Benjamin, Nephi, and Isaiah, who prophesied, "A virgin shall conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel" (Isaiah 7:14).<br><br>We know little about Mary's early life--only that she was living in Nazareth and espoused to Joseph, which was the custom that was often followed by a girl early in her life. She must have been very young when the angel Gabriel appeared to her, and after addressing her as "blessed among women," he said, "Thou hast found favor with God. And, behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a son, and shalt call his name Jesus. He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Highest" (Luke 1:30–32). Imagine the impact of this announcement from a heavenly messenger to one young girl, probably younger than any girl in this building! But after the angel had explained how this would take place and told her about the son of Elizabeth, John the Baptist, who would be born to prepare the way for the Lord Jesus Christ, the angel said, "For with God nothing shall be impossible" (Luke 1:37).<br><br>Mary's response was "Behold the handmaid of the Lord; be it unto me according to thy word" (Luke 1:38). Oh, that each of us could have such unquestioning faith, such commitment, such absolute trust in the Lord, and be so prepared that we could say to anything he asked of us, "Be it unto me according to thy word."<br><br>Inspired by this passage, one of your own faculty members, Eloise Bell, along with another beautiful woman, Dorothy Neilson--both of the Aaronic Priesthood MIA general board--wrote the following verses:<br><br><i>Behold thy handmaiden, Lord.</i><br><i>Ready now am I,</i><br><i>To live thy word, to teach thy word,</i><br><i>To praise thy name on high.</i><br><br><i>Behold my hands, O Lord,</i><br><i>Consecrated to thee,</i><br><i>To serve thy daughters, to serve thy sons,</i><br><i>To comfort each one tenderly.</i><br><br><i>Behold mine eyes, O Lord,</i><br><i>Windows to my soul,</i><br><i>To see thy light, to love thy light,</i><br><i>To know and shape my role.</i><br><br><i>Behold the handmaiden of the Lord;</i><br><i>Be it unto me according to thy word.</i><br><i>As Mary spoke, so speak I.</i><br><i>Heavenly Father, I will try</i><br><br><i>To do thy will,</i><br><i>Thy laws fulfill,</i><br><i>In service to magnify thee,</i><br><i>In humility to seek thee,</i><br><br><i>Always to speak of thee,</i><br><i>And thine,</i><br><i>As mine.</i><br><i>Behold thy handmaiden.</i><br><br><i>Behold my heart, O Lord,</i><br><i>Waiting here before thee,</i><br><i>To feel thy love, to share thy love;</i><br><i>Ever thy child I will be.</i><br><br>Of course, the celestial example of preparation and readiness is that of the Lord Jesus Christ, who was prepared in the preexistence to receive the greatest of all assignments from our Heavenly Father--to sacrifice his life that we might all live eternally.<br><br>Speaking of the life of our late prophet Harold B. Lee, President Spencer W. Kimball described him as "a high peak in a mighty range of impregnable mountains" ("Guidelines to Carry Forth the Work of God in Cleanliness,"<i>Ensign</i>4 [May 1974]: 4). He was prepared by the Lord to be the prophet of the Church and the mighty architect of correlation, through which process the Lord will work in preparing us for the second coming of the Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.<br><br>Through President Lee, the Lord called me to my position. I love him. I will ever revere him throughout all eternity. My constant prayer is that I will be an adequate instrument in the Lord's hands and merit his trust and confidence.<br><br>Our beloved President Kimball is as great an example as any of the prophets of old. He was foreordained, prepared, preserved, tested, challenged, refined, and made ready to be our prophet today--our prophet, seer, and revelator. One senses the power, vision, and sense of urgency he has in extending the blessings of the gospel to all mankind. He was prepared and made ready even before the foundations of the earth. He was one of the noble and great ones whom Abraham saw. You, as baptized members of the Church, were there, too. You were prepared to come forth in this day and age to partake of and share in the gospel.<br><h2><b>The Purpose of Life on Earth</b></h2><br>The delightful musical<i>Saturday's Warrior</i>that I enjoyed at your Mormon Arts Festival told a profound story. The characters were living in the preexistence with one another--children of our Heavenly Father, a family of brothers and sisters with gifts and talents and wants and challenges and all the things that children have as potential grownups. Father may have said to us one day, "Are you ready now? I'm going to send you down to earth to prove you, to give you a mortal body, that you may prove you are worthy for me to prepare you for life eternal." Isn't it a comforting knowledge to know we kept our first estate? If we did so once, maybe we can do it a second time.<br><br>We came down and forgot all, but the Lord did not leave us without assistance. He sent the gospel among us and bestowed upon his sons the holy priesthood, which is the power to act in his name. He even made provision that his sons could be prepared for this holy priesthood by giving the younger men the Aaronic Priesthood. Our beloved Bishop Victor L. Brown is the president of this Aaronic Priesthood today. God has told us that this is the preparatory priesthood. He does not expect a man to be ordained into the Holy Melchizedek Priesthood without being prepared, not only spiritually, but also mentally, socially, and temporally. Part of and nestled in the arms of this wonderful preparatory priesthood is the MIA function. Therein you will find great programs for the development and preparation of young men and young women to fulfill their destinies as the promised children of God: men for the governorship of worlds, women for the motherhood of nations. Each one of us, then, is preparing just by virtue of the fact that we live. Each one of us is preparing for good or evil, and that which we prepare for we will receive.<br><br>Each one of us has a specific destiny, which God intends we shall receive according to our faithfulness. He has a place for each of us and prepares us each day to receive it if we are worthy. Everything in our lives is there for a purpose, and that purpose is to prepare us. Preparation precedeth all readiness. Are we ready to receive the sacrament, the companionship of the Holy Ghost, a comprehension of the Lord's atoning sacrifice? Our Father in heaven is anxious to open the windows of heaven to us just as soon as we are prepared and ready.<br><br>I am reminded of Enos, a young man thoroughly taught in the words of God by his father. One day when Enos went into the forest to hunt, which we understand was not uncommon, something very uncommon happened. Enos was different when he returned. There had been a turning point in his life. He was not the same. Enos spoke concerning this experience in these words: "And my soul hungered; and I kneeled down before my Maker, and I cried unto him in mighty prayer and supplication for mine own soul; and all the day long did I cry unto him; yea, and when the night came I did still raise my voice high that it reached the heavens" (Enos 4). Enos heard the voice of the Lord and he had a spiritual experience that made a difference because he was ready. He was prepared. That day when he went to hunt beasts in the forest, the words which he had so often heard his father speak, we are told, sank deep into his heart and he received a remission of his sins and became spiritually in tune.<br><br>My dear young friends, may I challenge you this day to prepare yourselves to be in readiness and to ask the Lord, as did Enos, for a remission of your sins. This very day, some of you might go into your forests, so to speak. As your souls hunger for a readiness to receive, it is my testimony, through his Spirit, that he will speak to you concerning the yearnings of your heart. Be ye ready to receive, and the Lord will pour down his blessings upon you, making it possible for you to realize your divine destiny.<br><br>I know that God lives. I know that his son is Jesus the Christ, our Redeemer. I know that a prophet speaks for the Lord today. I love my Heavenly Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. I have every confidence in all this world that you are a choice generation, saved and prepared and here because of what you did in the preexistence. I pray with all my heart that we will understand the great power of the priesthood, that girls will understand their roles, that boys will magnify their priesthood, that we women may stand at the side of you men and together receive the celestial blessings that I know are in store for us. I say this in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Ruth H.

<h1>on Eagles&#039; Wings: Bondage, Justice, and Mercy - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
While looking into your faces for the last twenty minutes or so, I have seen a lot of male-female combinations, which for some peculiar reason have brought to my mind the only story I know of a college freshman (who may have been registering at this University for all I know). He faced on that day the myriad of questionnaires and information items that freshmen get when they register, and somehow during the day he got one which said, among other things, "Do you believe in college marriages?"<br><br>He thought about it a minute, shrugged his shoulders, and said, "Well, I guess--if the colleges really love each other."<br><br>I don't know about love from college to college, but let me say something about the new dean at the University: I am madly in love with you and with the possibilities of coming to be with you. It seems to me that the engagement has been too extended already, so I'm looking forward to the ceremony about the first of July, when I will officially become dean of Religious Instruction.<br><br>Since it is June, we could talk about marriage. But instead let me talk about the only other thing that I can think of that's appropriate in June--and that's not cutoff Levi's or hay fever. It is something about the commencement circuit that I've been on. I've been with big people and little people and young people and not-so-young people, hearing across the length of the land that commencements are "not really the end but the beginning" and things like that. I've been so struck and virtually preoccupied with one recent experience that I'm going to ask your indulgence in letting me share it with you tonight.<br><h2><b>An Unusual Commencement</b></h2><br>It was unlike any other commencement or baccalaureate exercise I had ever attended or participated in myself. It was held one week ago, last Thursday, on the twenty-third of May. There were forty-four graduates, all male. They did not have traditional academic robes or caps or gowns. Their attire, to a man, was light blue denim shirts and dark blue denim trousers. The ceremony was not held in a fieldhouse or a stadium or even a lovely auditorium. The exercise was held in a modest interdenominational chapel at the Utah state prison. The graduating class consisted of forty-four men who had successfully completed a year's course of Bible study sponsored by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints but open to all who cared to come and participate. These forty-four represented more than a dozen different religions, and, of course, many of them had no formal religious affiliation at all. At this very moment a lot of images and impressions are coming back to my mind, and I hope I can catch them long enough to share some of them with you.<br><br>One is of the delightful, tall, cordial, and warm inmate who conducted the exercises. He immediately warmed the group to the evening. About half were pleasantly and appropriately called "outsiders." He said he wanted the outsiders particularly to appreciate that he was in prison even though he had hired one of the biggest criminal lawyers in America: "It's only after I was through with the trial that I fully understood that designation. What it means to be a criminal lawyer is that he thought he was a lawyer and I think he's a criminal."<br><br>I remember the prayers. The opening prayer was given by a young man, but he seemed like a boy and looked like a boy and I think had not yet begun to shave. He gave there the first verbal and public prayer, according to the chaplain, that he'd ever given in his life. He was frightened to death, but it was a prayer of the heart, and you would need to have been there and to have heard it to appreciate fully what that might have meant. He was in the prison for ten years to life on an armed robbery charge. The closing prayer was given by a man who was, I suppose, forty-five or fifty years old--just a pleasant, warm, slightly chubby man who looked as if he should have been somebody's uncle and undoubtedly was. He was in for a life term on second-degree murder.<br><br>The choir sang, among other numbers, the Hammerstein-Romberg song "Stouthearted Men." If you could have seen the looks on their faces and felt the feeling in their voices, you would have known something about stouthearted men that you'd never understood before. I don't think any two of them crossed paths on the same note at any given moment during the rendition. But it was a choir of angels. It really was. When they sang, "Give me some men who are stouthearted men, who will fight for the rights they adore. Give me ten men who are stouthearted men, and I'll soon give you ten thousand more," they knew something about rights that had been adored and lost, that were adored all the more because they had been lost, and that perhaps were desired more greatly because someday they might return.<br><br>I remember just a couple of other impressions. A young man who was now on the outside had come back to get his certificate and to encourage his colleagues. He said something that I wrote down. I'll call him Howard, though that isn't really his name. He looked out to his colleagues and said, "Guys, the perspective in prison is really bad. It really looks better on the outside. Try to remember that." Then he turned to the outsiders, to the friends and families who had come in, and said, "You people are a light in a dark place. If it were not for love like yours, we would not be able to get from where we are to where we need to be."<br><br>He was followed extemporaneously by another delightful young man who couldn't have been more than twenty years of age. He had been in and out very quickly--I think for less than eight months on good behavior--and talked about what it was like to be back out, to be keeping a job, dating girls, going to church, and trying to live a moral and law-abiding life. He turned to friend and stranger alike and said, "Please understand that those of us at the halfway house need faith and prayers, too. We have reentered a world of temptation."<br><br>I would also like to mention the concluding comment of the inmate who conducted the service. He said, when it was all over, with some emotion in his voice and a little mist in his eyes, "This is the most auspicious occasion of our year. It is better than Christmas. It's better than Thanksgiving. It's even better than Mother's Day. It's better because we're enlightened, and that's as close as we come to being free."<br><br>Then the gates clanged behind my wife and me. That night we went home, and I confess I couldn't sleep. Pat fell asleep, it was late, and our children were already asleep, but I couldn't sleep. That experience haunted me and does yet at this pulpit. That's why I choose to speak to you tonight as I do. I had in the early hours of that morning, and have had somewhat since, feelings and thoughts and a response to bondage and freedom and their relationship to enlightenment and love in a way that I confess I have never had before--even though I've studied those principles and read the doctrines and thought I had a pretty good understanding of what all of them might mean. The inmate conducting the meeting had talked about enlightenment, and I confess that I was a little more enlightened and I little more free myself because of a couple of ideas. I get an idea only about once every three months, and I was grateful to get two or three there right in a row.<br><h2><b>The Justice of God</b></h2><br>Let me just enumerate for you the impressions I received the night after that ceremony. One is that God is just. Alma said, "What, do ye suppose that mercy can rob justice? I say unto you, Nay; not one whit. If so, God would cease to be God" (Alma 42:25). Paul said to the Galatians, "Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap" (Galatians 6:7).<br><br>This thought was put in more modern language by a coed at this school after a computer-arranged date. She came home to her roommate and said, "That is the most depressing thing in the world."<br><br>The roommate said, "What is?"<br><br>She replied, "To spend the evening with exactly what you deserve."<br><br>God is just, and mercy cannot rob justice or else God would not be God. We must not be deceived; God is not mocked, for whatsoever a man soweth, so shall he reap.<br><br>One of the thoughts that followed my remembering that God is just is that Paul really meant we reap in kind, which is obvious to all of you and I don't need to belabor the point. It came to me again that, if we sow thistles, we don't really plan to get strawberries. If we sow hate, we don't really expect to participate in an abundance of love. We get back, in kind, that which we reap. Then another thought came tumbling as I thought of those men in their blue: it's one things to reap in kind, but we reap, somehow, always in greater quantity. We sow a little thistle, and we get a lot of thistle--years and years of it, big bushes and branches of it. We never get rid of it unless we cut it out. If we sow a little bit of hate, before we know it we've reaped a lot of hate--smoldering and festering and belligerent and finally warring and malicious hate.<br><br>A third prophet, Hosea of the Old Testament, warned all of us to be careful lest we learn personally something that I think my friends at the state institution understood more fully than I had: "For they have sown the wind, and they shall reap the whirlwind" (Hosea 8:7). They got back more of a kind than ever they had planned on. Surely no one has ever set out, in the words of Harry Emerson Fosdick, "to go straight to Sing Sing." Similarly, I suppose no one has ever intended to go to our own institution at the point of the mountain. So my first large thought was that God is just, we really do reap what we sow, and maybe we reap more than we thought we were sowing.<br><h2><b>Faith in God Based on His Justice</b></h2><br>Then, ironically, I had a comforting thought that my first thought wasn't as painful as it sounded. In this sense, however frightening it may be that all of us have sinned, however frightening it may be to contemplate a just God, it is infinitely more frightening to me to contemplate an unjust God. Now, I suppose you're taking Humanities 101 or something else along the way, aren't you? I would be the last to disparage that which we have received in Western civilization from the good Greeks. But I, for one, am very glad that we are not submitting to the gods of Tantalus and Sisyphus and Prometheus. When one of those fellows had a bad day,<i>everybody</i>had a bad day.<br><br>I simply refer you to what I think is a basic principle of Latter-day Saint doctrine. That is the true principle that we have to know God is just in order to go forward. If you get a chance, open to Joseph Smith's <i>Lectures on Faith</i>one evening, turn to the fourth lecture, and read a basic list of attributes which God has to have, which we know he does have, and which enable us to have faith--that is, those principles which give us the courage to believe that it will be well with us if we do certain things. One of those attributes is justice, and we would not have the faith, due to fear, to live righteously or to love better or to repent more readily if somehow we didn't think that justice would count for us, if somehow we thought that God would change his mind and decide there was another set of rules. Because we know that God is just and would cease to be God if he weren't so, we have the faith, we have the makings and the beginnings and the foundation of faith, to go forward and to know that we will not be the victims of whimsy or caprice or a bad day or a bad joke. And that assurance was somehow, in a way that it never had been before, very encouraging.<br><h2><b>The Mercy of God</b></h2><br>Then I had a third thought. How grateful I was that, in addition to just being just, God decided, because he is who he is, that he had to be a merciful God also. We don't need to take the time to read all of Alma 42, but you ought to sometime. After Alma had established with Corianton that God had to be just, it was then determined that that same God would have to be merciful as well and that mercy would claim the penitent. Now, the reason that thought was different to me was that I'd just been where they had added<i>i-a-r-y</i>to that word. That thought gave me encouragement. Mercy could claim the penitent. I decided that if those men had to go to the penitentiary to take advantage of the gift of mercy, if somehow by going there they found the gospel of Jesus Christ or the scriptures or the Atonement or any of those things that might lead to the others, then their imprisonment was worth it. Let's go to the penitentiary, or let's go to the bishop, or let's go to the Lord or to those that we've offended or to those that have offended us. Our own little penitentiaries, I suppose, are all around us. If that's what it takes to make us truly penitent, to enable us to lay claim to the gift of mercy, then we have to do it.<br><br>I know it isn't easy to go back and to undo and to start again and to make a new beginning, but I believe with all my heart that it is easier and surely more satisfying to begin anew than to go on and try to believe that justice will not take its toll. As Richard L. Evans was fond of saying, "What's the use of running if you're on the wrong road?" A favorite British scholar said, using the same metaphor:<br><br><i>I do not think that all who choose wrong roads perish; but their rescue consists in being put back on the right road. A</i>[mathematical]<i>sum</i>[incorrectly worked]<i>can be put right; but only by going back till you find the error and then working it fresh from that point</i>. [It will]<i>never</i>[be corrected]<i>by simply</i>going on.<i>Evil can be undone, but it cannot "develop" into good,</i>[worlds without end].<i>Time does not heal it. The spell must be unwound.</i>[C. S. Lewis,<i>The Great Divorce</i>(New York: Macmillan Co., 1973), p. 6]<br><br>So God is just, but mercy claimeth the penitent and the evil can be undone.<br><h2><b>The Need for Repentance</b></h2><br>The final and crowning thought that I had (and by this time I don't know what hour of the morning it was) helped me understand what maybe I'd never literally understood. It is why in every generation, to every dispensation, the Lord has said what he said in section 6 of the Doctrine and Covenants, very early in the doctrines of this dispensation: "Say nothing but repentance unto this generation; keep my commandments" (D&amp;amp;C 6:9). That became a very positive and a very helpful and a very moving thought and verse for me. I knew in a way that I'd never understood before that there is no other way besides repentance.<br><br>Let me shift gears slightly. None of you, I hope, is going to be whisked off to the point of the mountain right after this speech. (Some of you may hope that I will be.) I would pray that there are no Church courts pending on moral transgressions in your lives, but I believe that, if you're like any of the rest of us who are mortal, you have some areas in which to unchain yourselves, that you have some bonds and some fetters that you could afford to be free of, that there is some repenting to be done in all of your lives--although less than the great, dramatic sins and civil transgressions that we read about in the newspapers. May I isolate just two or three examples.<br><h2><b>The Bondage of Ignorance</b></h2><br>I confess that I cannot begin with anything other than what seems to me the supreme bond at this level, and that is simply not to know enough. There are little clichés that we learn early in our lives. Most of them I hate; some of them I really hate. I think number one on my list is "Sticks and stones will break my bones, but names will never hurt me." I hate that. I'll take sticks and stones any day. But second to that are the clichés "Ignorance is bliss" and "What I don't know won't hurt me." Let me say to you with all of the intensity that I have that nothing will hurt you more than what you don't know.<br><br>Plato said, about as early as anybody other than the Israelites started making quotable comments, "It is better to be unborn than untaught, for ignorance is at the root of all misfortune." And I don't know whether or not Sam Johnson knew we were going to be here tonight (or whether or not he knew I'd go to visit the prison), but he said, "Ignorance,<i>when voluntary</i>, is criminal, and a man may be properly charged with that evil which he neglected or refused to learn how to prevent" (emphasis added).<br><br>But I don't want to talk just about Plato's books and Sam Johnson's books. We believe in this Church--we have it as a tenet of our faith--that a man cannot be saved in ignorance, that what we learn in this life rises with us in the resurrection, that we have so much the advantage in the world to come if we are knowledgeable, that we're saved, in fact, in proportion to that which we have learned, that light and truth forsake the evil one, that the glory of God is intelligence, and we go on and on and on. At one time in the history of the Church in this dispensation, the entire Church, collectively, was indicted. Will you listen to this from section 84:<br><br><i>And I now give unto you a commandment to beware concerning yourselves, to give diligent heed to the words of eternal life.</i><br><br><i>For you shall live by every word that proceedeth forth from the mouth of God.</i><br><br><i>For the</i>word<i>of the Lord is truth, and whatsoever is truth is light, and whatsoever is light is Spirit, even the Spirit of Jesus Christ</i>. [D&amp;amp;C 84:43–45; emphasis added]<br><br>The beginning of coming ultimately into the presence of the Lord Jesus Christ, which is where section 84 takes us, is a ladder to get on to things, to get started, and to get to where we need to be. The first rung of the ladder, if you will, is the<i>word</i>: "The word of the Lord is truth"; "Give heed to the words of eternal life"; "And your minds in times past have been darkened because of unbelief, and because you have treated lightly the things you have received ... even the Book of Mormon and the former commandments which I have given" (D&amp;amp;C 84:54, 57).<br><br>Now, this Book of Mormon is some book! I've wandered off to a school or two and read books--both in and out of libraries. I didn't think there was any other world but the inside of a carrel--not to be confused with that place where you put cows and horses. But I've never known a book, in all the searching that I've done and all of the reading that I've done, which was purported to have been brought by an angel and translated by the gift and power of God--except the Book of Mormon.<br><br>Can we also be accused of taking this book lightly? Some of us treat it like almost any other book: let it gather a little dust or press the rose from Mary Jane's wedding, use it as a doorstop in the hallway, do almost anything with it but read it. I believe that we will be indicted for the resulting bondage that we incur and that we will serve some sentence in this life or the next for that which we fail to learn. I can't spend all evening on that, but please remember, from the fifteenth chapter of John, "If ye abide in me, and my words abide in you, ye shall ask what ye will, and it shall be done unto you" (John 15:7).<br><h2><b>The Bondage of Flesh</b></h2><br>We're bonded and indentured and in servitude too often to our own bodies. I don't mean just the dramatic sins, the anger and the temper that lead to murder or the passion that leads to sexual transgression or the lust that leads to theft. Even beyond those, as serious as they are (and I suppose an entire evening ought to be spent on each of them), there are other things. Paul said, "For I delight in the law of God after the inward man: But I see another law in my members warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity" (Romans 7:22–23). The war in the members of the body of someone who is a little overweight that makes him huff and puff by the time he gets to the top of the stairs and go into a cardiac arrest because he isn't jogging enough, the war of the mattress on his back which he somehow cannot shake in the morning so that he misses those precious and most inspirational hours of the day, the war of grooming and attention which could do much for us, sometimes, if we would--all these are important. But beyond that, there are serious limitations on our bodies.<br><br>Two weeks ago I met for the first time a man I would like to meet again and know more of. His name is Henry D. Stagg--Don Stagg to his friends. He went to bed in August of 1965 about the way everybody else goes to bed and about the way he had all of his life. The difference came the next morning, when his body awoke and his eyes didn't. He was blind, frightened, and he was more than that--terrified. He went to the doctor, who said with guarded optimism, "Well, this thing sometimes doesn't last very long, and it might just be an hour or two." Well, the hours stretched into days and the days stretched into weeks and the weeks finally became a month. Don Stagg could think only of one thing, and that was suicide. He wanted out. (He hadn't asked for this kind of body, and he didn't suppose that he had to go on with it, so he wanted out.)<br><br>Well, to make a long story short, Don Stagg found, in the midst of his experience, what one of the prisoners found; that is, it takes some love to get from where we are to where we need to be. One evening Mrs. Stagg arranged to slip the children past the hospital security. They shuffled into the room, and Don did not know who was there. He was surly and arrogant almost all of the time, by his own admission, and he didn't want to talk, but then he felt those little hands on his legs and on his arms. The children said, "Daddy, we love you, and we want you to come home. We don't want any other daddy."<br><br>Don had seen a little light in a dark place, so he went home and started that night to pace off the house. He first paced off the steps from the bedroom to the refrigerator. He says, "It's one thing to be blind; it's another thing to starve to death." When he had the house mastered, he went out into the neighborhood and then up and down the streets for miles away. He decided that he could do quite a little bit, and about two years after the effects of this disease had taken his sight, he enrolled in law school at the University of Utah. In four years he had passed all his courses and the state bar. For one year he worked for the attorney general's office and now is in private practice.<br><br>Don Stagg is blind and has some limitations and some bonds put upon him by his own body, but he is doing a great deal. He water-skis and he snow-skis and, just a short time ago, he shot a two-under-par game at the Bonneville Golf Course in Salt Lake City. Now, there are some things he can't do. He cannot see the daughter who has been born to him since he lost his sight. But he believes he will and he believes that that will not be a limitation upon him and that he will not be bound down by that blindness or by anything else. There's something in that kind of spirit which seems to break every kind of bond that might ever come in this life or the next.<br><h2><b>The Bondage of Environment</b></h2><br>Life itself--external circumstances--seems to me to impose a good deal of bondage upon us; that is, although we may be perfectly healthy, have fine bodies and our eyesight, and even know a little bit, life has cast us in roles that somehow we cannot escape.<br><br>I was born in St. George, Utah. I'll tell you a couple of stories I know about St. George. One is that Brother Rolfe Peterson, who used to be in the English Department here, once said that St. George was the only place in the continental United States that a harpsichord was a "horpsicard."<br><br>J. Golden Kimball, on a stake conference assignment down there one day said, "If I owned the two, I would rather live in hell and try to rent St. George."<br><br>In discussing limitations of birth and circumstance, I remember the very famous story which Elder Marion D. Hanks told me as a missionary a dozen years ago and which I'm pleased to see recorded in his recently published book. With his permission, I repeat that little story for you because it's a favorite of mine and I really believe in the principle that it teaches:<br><br><i>The famed naturalist of the last century, Louis Agassiz, was lecturing in London and had done a marvelous job. An obviously bright little old lady, but one who did not seem to have all the advantages in life, came up and was spiteful. She was resentful and said that she had never had the chances that he had had and she hoped he appreciated it. He took that bit of lacing very pleasantly and turned to the lady and, when she was through, said, "What do you do?"</i><br><br><i>She said, "I run a boarding house with my sister. I'm unmarried."</i><br><br><i>"What do you do at the boarding house?"</i><br><br><i>"Well, I skin potatoes and chop onions for the stew. We have stew every day."</i><br><br><i>"Where do you sit when you do that interesting but homely task?"</i><br><br><i>"I sit on the bottom step of the kitchen stairs."</i><br><br><i>"Where do your feet rest when you sit there on the bottom step?"</i><br><br><i>"On a glazed brick."</i><br><br><i>"What's a glazed brick?"</i><br><br><i>"I don't know."</i><br><br><i>"How long have you been sitting there?"</i><br><br><i>"Fifteen years."</i><br><br><i>Agassiz concluded, "Here's my card. Would you write me a note when you get a moment about what a glazed brick is?"</i><br><br><i>Well, that made her mad enough to go home and do it. She went home and got the dictionary out and found out that a brick was a piece of baked clay. That didn't seem enough to send to a Harvard professor, so she went to the encyclopedia and found out that a brick was made of vitrified kaolin and hydrous aluminum silicate, which didn't mean a thing to her. She went to work and visited a brick factory and a tile maker. Then she went back in history and studied a little bit about geology and learned something about clay and clay beds and what</i>hydrous<i>meant and what</i>vitrified<i>meant. She began to soar out of the basement of a boarding house on the wings of words like</i>vitrified kaolin<i>and</i>hydrous aluminum silicate.<i>She finally decided that there were about 120 different kinds of glazed bricks and tiles. She could tell Agassiz that, so she wrote him a little note of thirty-six pages and said, "Here's your glazed brick."</i><br><br><i>He wrote back, "This is a fine piece of work. If you change this and that and the other, I'll prepare it for publication and send you that which is due you from the publication." She thought no more of it, made the changes, sent it back, and almost by return mail came a check for 250 dollars. His letter said, "I've published your piece. What was under the brick?"</i><br><br><i>And she said, "Ants."</i><br><br><i>He replied (all of this by mail), "What is an ant?"</i><br><br><i>She went to work and this time she was excited. She found 1825 different kinds of ants. She found that there were ants that you could put three to the head of a pin and still have standing room left over. She found that there were ants an inch long that moved in armies half a mile wide and destroyed everything in their path. She found that some ants were blind; some ants lost their wings on the afternoon they died; some milked cows and took the milk to the aristocrats up the street. She found more ants than anybody had ever found, so she wrote Mr. Agassiz something of a treatise, numbering 360 pages. He published it and sent her the money and royalties, which continued to come in. She saw the lands and places of her dreams on a little carpet of vitrified kaolin and on the wings of flying ants that may lose their wings on the afternoon they die.</i>[<i>The Gift of Self</i>(Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1974), pp. 151–53]<br><br>I do not minimize and I don't mean to be Pollyannaish about the limitations of our circumstances and our environment and the battle that it is to overcome them. I know that there is a bond, that there are fetters that are real that don't get published in civil courts or in Church councils, but about which we can do something. For all I know we may be sitting with our feet on glazed bricks.<br><h2><b>The Bondage of the World</b></h2><br>Let me just conclude this thought about other kinds of bonds with one that's perhaps as serious as any. We may be bright and learned. We may be physically fit and fully capable. We may have all of the advantages of circumstance and environment and society, but there is a bond and a servitude and a limitation which if we're not careful may, in fact, be more apparent and evident and to which we may be more vulnerable at that point than at almost any other time. For lack of something else to call it, let me call it the world. I want to read you a few lines about this subject:<br><br><i>For that person striving to live righteously, this mortal existence is a testing time indeed. The faithful are plagued with the temptations of a world that appears to have lost itself in a snarled maze of ambiguity, mendacity, and threatening uncertainty. The challenge to live in the world but not of the world is a monumental one, indeed.</i><br><br><i>Our second estate is indeed a probationary state. The choices we are called upon to make every day of our lives call forth the exercise of our agency. That we fail so frequently to think and do that which is right is not evidence against the practicality of righteous living. We do not falter and stumble in the path of righteousness simply because we do nothing else, but because too often we lose the vision of our relationship with God. The incessant din and cackling ado of this turbulent life drown out the message which asserts that, as man is, God once was and that, as God is, man may become.</i><br><br><i>If we will not dance to the music of materialism and hedonism but will remain attuned to the voice of godly reason, we will be led to the green pastures of respite and the still waters of spiritual refreshment. All the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune this world can hurl against us are as nothing when compared to the rewards for steadfastness and faithfulness. It would behoove us all to fix our sights more consistently upon the things which are everlasting and eternal. This world is not our home.</i><br><br>Those are lines from the valedictory address at the Utah state prison, May 23, 1974, given by inmate John McRell, who is about fifty years of age and has been behind bars for more than half of those years.<br><h2><b>The Importance of Freedom</b></h2><br>We began on something of a theological note. Let me close similarly. I guess if we had to pick a theme for our existence--that existence which we know of, not our past in the preexistence and surely not what lies ahead (although we do have some indication scripturally and through the teachings of the prophets about the past and the future)--that theme would have to have something to do with freedom. We know that an important part of the issue in the great council in heaven was how freedom was going to be achieved once we got here. The Father's course was one of agency and choice and freedom to err, but ultimately freedom to succeed. As many safeguards as possible and all the powers of the universe were brought to guarantee our freedom to the extent that we would wish it so. We really do experience bondage and prison when we are not free. I thought here tonight, while sitting on the stand, what a fortunate time we live in, because our prophet is not incarcerated. I suppose that, if you took the sum total of religious history in the dispensations down to and including our own, you would find the Brethren in prison most of the time: Israel as a whole in servitude or escaping some Egyptians or some Babylonians or some Lamanites or their own fears or their own sins.<br><br>I almost wish I had been in prison so I could make this statement very dramatic. I wish I could talk to you like Peter or Paul and have the angels come, or like Alma and Amulek and have the prison walls crumble, or like Joseph Smith, who could write what may be the most sublime scriptural literature of our dispensation out of the very heart and center or a dingy and dismal and very dreary prison. We thank God that we live in such a time as we do, when the President and prophet of our Church does not need to live in fear or imprisonment and when we are not and Israel is not, at least politically or physically, required to go into bondage and into slavery. But there are other kinds of bonds and there are other kinds of prisons which we need to work to destroy for our own sakes. All that we came here to do we need to do.<br><br>I believe with all my heart, I believe as certainly as I stand here, that--if we can repent of our sins, if we can be charitable with the sins of others, if we can take courage toward our circumstances and want to do something about them--there is a power, a living Father of us all who will reach down and, in the scriptural term, "bear us as on eagles' wings." When Moses was called to lead the children of Israel out of Egypt, Jehovah came down and said:<br><br><i>The cry of the children of Israel is come unto me: and I have also seen the oppression wherewith the Egyptians oppress them....</i><br><br><i>I will send thee unto Pharaoh, that thou mayest bring forth my people the children of Israel out of Egypt.</i><br><br><i>And Moses said unto God, who am I, that I should go unto Pharaoh ... ?</i><br><br><i>And he said, Certainly I will be with thee.</i>[Exodus 3:9–12]<br><br>And then there were demonstrations of God's presence. Sticks turned into serpents and water turned into blood, but that wasn't enough. There were plagues--frogs and lice, hail and locusts--and that wasn't enough. There was darkness, literally, and then death. Finally, that was enough. Then Israel was set free from political servitude to pursue a higher freedom if they would. And that challenge remains before us.<br><br>There really is, still stretching before you and me, something of a desert and a sea, like a barbed prison wire between our Egypt and our promised land. We're all somewhere in that desert. When they gathered, that little band of Israelites, at the Mount of Sinai, Jehovah said to the sons of Abraham, "Thus shalt thou say to the house of Jacob, and tell the children of Israel; Ye have seen what I did unto the Egyptians, and how I bare you on eagles' wings, and brought you unto myself" (Exodus 19:3–4)<br><br>I have, in my life, been borne on eagles' wings. I know with all my heart that God lives, that Jesus is the Christ. I have known those things in a way, over the last few months, that I've never known in my life, and yet I've known them for a long time. I know that Jesus leads this Church, that it is his church, that he is the chief cornerstone around which the foundation of apostles and living prophets is laid. I know that we'll be with him again, that we will stand free for a time, unfettered, unencumbered, and will recognize in the marks on his flesh something of his bondage and imprisonment and dying service to us. I know that we must repent of our sins and that God has to be just, but I take great delight and eternal love in the scriptural satisfaction and the words of the living prophets that, where sin abounded, grace did much more abound and mercy claimeth the penitent.<br><br>May you, in the words of Isaiah, wait upon the Lord and have your strength renewed that you may be borne as on the wings of eagles, that you may run and not be weary, that you may walk and not faint. May you so run, I pray, on the right road and there be borne as on the wings of eagles by a Father who lives and loves us all and gave his Only Begotten Son. For that I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Jeffrey R.

<h1>Health of the Saints - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Thank you, President Oaks. Brothers and sisters, I stand before you in all humility. I am numbed by the knowledge of the stature of those who have preceded me in these devotional programs and by the knowledge of those who will follow. I have a son who formerly was a student at this University and is now serving in the mission field and a daughter who recently was accepted for the Fall Semester. We're delighted that the University would confer that honor upon them, to accept them as students here. It's a great university, and you have an exceedingly capable President --President Dallin Oaks--a distinguished faculty, and an outstanding and unique student body. I pay a tribute to all of you who are here today.<br><br>I humbly pray that the prayer that was offered in my behalf by Dr. Whitehead will be fulfilled, because I deeply need the Spirit of my Heaven Father during the time that I stand at this podium. The title of my remarks will be "For the Health of the Saints." Peter stated that the Saints were "a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people" (1 Peter 2:9). And we have seen that in many ways the Saints are peculiar in terms of their health.<br><br>Not too long ago, there appeared in a publication of the University of California at Los Angeles an article with this title: "Striking Low Cancer Mortality Among Mormons" (<i>UCLA Cancer Bulletin</i>1 [April/May 1974]). This article, by Dr. James E. Enstrom, reported that LDS Church members sampled who lived in Alameda County, California, during a 6-and-a-half-year period had a mortality rate only 55 percent as great as the total sample in that county. Then the article went on to state that for the entire state of California a comparison of observed to expected mortality for the year 1970 indicated that Latter-day Saints experienced only about 50 percent of expected deaths from all causes and from cancer of all sites. So, indeed, in terms of these California statistics, we are a peculiar people. Of particular interest, low rates occurred for cancer of the stomach, colon, breast, kidney, and other sites which have never before been clearly related to factors such as smoking. The article underlined the peculiarities of these Mormon statistics.<br><br>Another recent study indicates that Utah residents, who are about 72 percent LDS, experience total mortality and cancer mortality rates which are the lowest in the United States (Public Health Service, "Vital Statistics of the United States: 1969," unpublished data from computer tapes [Washington, D.C.: National Center for Health Statistics, 1973]). A third study with somewhat preliminary data indicates that the cardiovascular disease mortality rate among Los Angeles County, California, LDS Church members is roughly one-half of the rate for the entire Los Angeles County white population. James E. Enstrom, Ph.D., a nonmember of the Church who also made this study, stated, "Almost all forms of cardiovascular disease are lower than expected, and the total cardiovascular disease mortality rate for Los Angeles County Mormons as a whole is about the lowest of any substantial United States population group thus far studied" ("Cardiovascular Disease Among Mormons," to be published). Other statistics could be cited if necessary to illustrate my point--that Mormons are different from their non-member neighbors. What then does this mean? What are the reasons for these differences? Let me for the remainder of my talk mention four significant areas of Church involvement in health that I believe make us a peculiar people in terms of our health statistics.<br><h2><b>Church Medical Facilities</b></h2><br>The first area that I'd like to mention relates to Church hospitals and clinics. This is of great historical significance because when the pioneers came to the Great Basin there were no health care facilities, and the Church provided these services for the members as well as the nonmembers who lived in these communities. The Church first became involved in the operation of hospitals in 1882 and has continued to provide curative health services since that time. Today the Church owns or operates fifteen hospitals and four clinics in Utah, Idaho, Wyoming, and Arizona. These hospitals range in size from 15 to 580 beds. They exist in urban and rural areas of these states. The hospitals include over 2,000 beds and employ 6,350 persons. There are 1,100 physicians serving on the medical staffs of these hospitals. In 1973 there were 104,000 patients admitted and over 360,000 emergency and out-patient visits to these fifteen hospitals. An interesting fact is that more than 19,000 babies were born in these hospitals last year, which is well above the national average for the number of beds comprising the Church system. We're proud of this record, and parenthetically I'd like to express appreciation to the married students here at BYU for their wholehearted support of this wonderful record. These hospitals operated by the Church are noted for the high-quality service they provide to members and nonmembers at a reasonable cost. Hospitals operated and owned by the Church are one significant area of Church involvement in health that relates to the wonderful Church health record.<br><h2><b>Health Services Missionaries</b></h2><br>A second significant area relates to the Church Health Services missionary program. Our Heavenly Father is concerned with the health and temporal well-being of members worldwide. Here in the United States, in Canada, western Europe, and many other countries, modern health-care facilities and well-prepared doctors and other professional people exist to take care of members when they have a health problem. However, in many parts of the world resources are lacking. In those areas where the Church is growing the fastest--parts of Latin America, the South Pacific, the Asian Rim--members of the Church sometimes experience overwhelming and unmet health needs. During the past three years, 136 doctors, dentists, nurses, nutritionists, home economists, and others have been called by the Church to serve as Health Services missionaries. A total of ninety-six are currently serving in twenty-four missions located on the Indian reservations in the United States, in South and Central America, the South Pacific, the Asian Rim, and southern Europe.<br><br>Certain guiding principles are used by these Health Services missionaries in carrying out their work. First, they teach correct principles rather than provide "things." They emphasize disease prevention through health education. They encourage wise utilization of local health-care facilities and resources. They correlate their activities under the priesthood and auxiliary programs. They complement the proselyting program of the Church. I wish there were time for me to explain the inspiration behind these guiding principles. I'd like to assure you that much good is being accomplished as a result of the efforts of these wonderful people, who give so generously of their time and their savings.<br><br>Might I relate one experience that illustrates what is being done as these Health Services missionaries serve in so many countries. Several years ago I had an opportunity to visit Bolivia. On the Altiplano, high above the city of La Paz, at an altitude of 13,600 feet on a beautiful Sabbath morning, I visited a Sunday school of one of the branches. I felt the spirit of those wonderful people as they met there. I watched a wonderful Sunday School president conduct with great ability. When one of the 2-and-a-half-minute speakers did not show up, extemporaneously he delivered the 2-and-a-half-minute talk. What a spirit I felt as he bore his testimony to the divinity of the gospel. And even though I didn't understand his Indian dialect, I felt of that spirit and that testimony.<br><br>After Sunday School, this good man introduced me to his lovely wife, the branch Primary president. Strapped to her back was a little bundle--their six-week-old baby. When they learned that I was a physician, they asked if I would come with them to their home to examine the baby to see if it was doing all right. I went with them down the unpaved streets to their little home. It was built of adobe brick, had a dirt floor, and was perhaps ten by fourteen feet--about the size of a single-car garage. As we went inside, I saw it was immaculately clean. One could feel the good spirit in that home. In addition to the parents and the baby, the family included two older sons.<br><br>The mother sat on the bed and began unwrapping the layers of blankets that she had placed around the baby to keep it warm. When the last blanket was removed, I looked down and gasped. There was a little baby that was no more than skin and bones. Untactfully I said, "What happened? Why is the baby so thin?" and then they explained to me how this mother had become very ill during the latter part of her pregnancy. There had not been enough food in that home to provide her with the nourishment she needed. She had developed all of the symptoms of what we here call toxemia of pregnancy. Somehow she had been able to give birth to that baby, but her sickness was so severe that she was unable to nurse. The family did the best they could. They bought a can of a dried-milk formula, but with an income that was barely twenty dollars a month (converted to United States currency), they couldn't afford to buy more when the first can was gone. I asked them, "What are you feeding the baby now?" they showed me a baby bottle filled with fluid so diluted that I could have read newsprint through the bottle. The fluid contained only a few drops of milk from a tiny can of condensed milk. The can had to last three or four days. I gave them what instructions I could to help and, as I left their home, said to the branch president, giving him a few pesos, "Please see that this baby receives all the food that it needs." I heard several weeks later from the mission president that the baby had died. It had gone past the point of no return.<br><br>Oh, if we could have brought it here to Provo to the Utah Valley LDS Hospital or to the Primary Children's Medical Center and started intravenous feedings and some of the modern techniques that we employ here, perhaps the baby's life could have been saved. But the baby had lived too long in that environment.<br><br>That was three years ago. Today in Bolivia nurses and a doctor, called as Health Services missionaries, are teaching through priesthood and auxiliary channels lessons on home nursing, care of the baby, care of the pregnant mother, nutrition, sanitation--a whole series of subjects that help people better understand how to stay strong and healthy. These health missionaries have investigated what local health resources exist that the people can use. They learned that this little family could have obtained milk from a source that was available in the community. And so today the Saints are being blessed through resources that exist locally that many didn't know about before. The Saints are being blessed in this far-off land through the Health Services missionaries. And in Guatemala, Thailand, Taiwan, and many other places here upon this earth, the devoted efforts of Health Services missionaries are being extended to lift up our brothers and sisters and their nonmember friends.<br><br>The Church needs more Health Services missionaries. Requests far exceeding the supply come in from the missions. May I just mention parenthetically that the same criteria for worthiness and self-sufficiency exist for the Health Services missionaries as for the proselyting missionaries. The duration of their call is eighteen months for sisters and couples, twenty-four months for elders. The method of call is identical to that of proselyting missionaries. Begin with your bishop or branch president if you have training and background and the desire to serve your fellowmen, to reach out and lift up those who need help so much. You are needed--whoever you are, wherever you are--if you have a health background and a desire to serve.<br><h2><b>The Word of Wisdom</b></h2><br>A third significant area of Church involvement in health relates to the glorious revelation in the 89th section of the Doctrine and Covenants known as the Word of Wisdom. This revelation, given in the year 1833, was more than a hundred years ahead of its time. No document, whether it be a seven-hundred-page medical textbook or an article in a modern medical journal, contains any more useful or relevant information on how to remain strong and healthy. In light of the scientific discoveries that have been made during the last twenty or thirty years, the Word of Wisdom is a testimony to the divinity of the gospel and to the divine calling of the Prophet Joseph Smith.<br><br>In recent years, there has been little change in man's life span or progress in reducing infant mortality. Cardiovascular disease, cancer, accidents, and conditions of the lung and liver have taken the place of communicable diseases such as pneumonia, polio, and smallpox. Changes in longevity and infant mortality were significantly influenced by public health programs, such as providing clean, pure water for drinking, sanitary sewers, and immunizations for children. Today's leading killers do not respond to mass campaigns and to community projects.<br><br>Individual behavior, as never before, is directly related to good health. Abstaining from tobacco, alcohol, tea, coffee, and addicting drugs; emphasis on a well-balanced diet--particularly the use of fruits, vegetables, and wholesome grains and moderation in the eating of meats; fasting at monthly intervals; hard work and regular exercise; a positive, purposeful outlook on life; a happy family relationship; and peace of mind derived from a conscience free of guilt--all are powerful aspects of the gospel of Jesus Christ which strongly promote physical and emotional well-being.<br><br>In the Word of Wisdom, "given for a principle with promise," the Lord said:<br><br><i>All saints . . . walking in obedience to the commandments, shall receive health in their navel and marrow to their bones;</i><br><br><i>And shall find wisdom and great treasures of knowledge, even hidden treasures;</i><br><br><i>And shall run and not be weary, and shall walk and not faint.</i><br><br><i>And I, the Lord, give unto them a promise, that the destroying angel shall pass by them, as the children of Israel, and not slay them. Amen.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 89:18–21]<br><br>Brothers and sisters, so has it been. The statistics that I've given show how literally these promises have been fulfilled in the lives of the Saints at home and abroad. Yes, indeed, the Word of Wisdom is a principle with a promise.<br><h2><b>The Healing Power of the Priesthood</b></h2><br>A fourth significant area that affects the health of the Saints is the power of the priesthood restored in these latter days--a power that is unmatched, is incomparable in terms of what it accomplishes in blessing and bringing about miracles today just as they occurred in days past. You remember James, in the New Testament, declared:<br><br><i>Is any sick among you? let him call for the elders of the church; and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord:</i><br><br><i>And the prayer of faith shall save the sick, and the Lord shall raise him up; and if he have committed sins, they shall be forgiven him.</i>[James 5:14–15]<br><br>And this revelation to the Prophet Joseph Smith is recorded in section 42 of the Doctrine and Covenants:<br><br><i>And the elders of the church, two or more, shall be called, and shall pray for and lay their hands upon them in my name; and if they die they shall die unto me, and if they live they shall live unto me. . . .</i><br><br><i>And it shall come to pass that those that die in me shall not taste of death, for it shall be sweet unto them. . . .</i><br><br><i>And again, it shall come to pass that he that hath faith in me to be healed, and is not appointed unto death, shall be healed.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 42:44, 46, 48]<br><br>And so in our days is recorded the promise that we can call in faith upon the Lord Jesus Christ with the power of the restored priesthood to bring to pass the same miracles that occurred while the Savior himself was upon the earth, among the Jews in Palestine and the Nephites on the American continent.<br><br>Consider the story of Lazarus, the brother of Mary and Martha. When Jesus came to Bethany, where they lived, Lazarus had been in the tomb for four days. As he came to the home and saw Mary and Martha and the rest of the mourners weeping, the scriptures record that Jesus wept. They led him to the tomb, where a large stone had been rolled in front of where the body lay. And then Jesus said, "Take ye away the stone." Martha was concerned and reminded him that Lazarus had been dead for four days. Jesus replied, "Said I not unto thee, that, if thou wouldest believe, thou shouldest see the glory of God?" And then, with the stone removed, Jesus cried out with a loud voice, "Lazarus, come forth." And he who was dead came forth from the tomb. He was covered by graveclothes and a napkin, as was the burial custom of the people. And Jesus then asked the astounded, weeping Mary and Martha to remove those clothes (see John 11:17–46). A miracle? Oh, how sublime, how poignant, how wonderful! And those same miracles occur today.<br><br>Consider the story of Peter and John after the ascension of the Savior. As they went into the temple, they saw at the gate a man who had been lame from birth sitting and begging alms. Peter looked at him as they approached and said, "Look on us." The lame man must have expected a coin, but Peter said to him, "Silver and gold have I none; but such as I have give I thee: In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and walk." And then Peter reached down to that man who hadn't walked, who hadn't run, who hadn't leaped since his birth and lifted him to his feet (see Acts 3:2–11). Miracle? Oh, how wonderful! What a blessing! What an outpouring of the Spirit! What faith! What priesthood power! Brothers and sisters, I bear testimony to you today that that same priesthood power exists in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and that it has a significant effect on the health of the Saints.<br><br>May I share with you an experience or two that I've had. Several years ago I was called to the Primary Children's Medical Center to see a nine-year-old boy. Three days before, he had complained to his parents of headache and not feeling well. They had noted that his little body was hot; he had a fever. For three days they watched and waited and hoped that he would recover, but he became increasingly sick. On the day he was brought to the hospital he had lapsed into unconsciousness, and the family realized for the first time how really sick he was. At the hospital he was examined by the doctors. The laboratory tests and the X rays were done. Then, because bacterial or spinal meningitis was suspected, a little needle was put into his back so that they could obtain a sample of spinal fluid to make an examination. As that fluid came out through the hollow hub of the needle, instead of being crystal clear like spring water, it was cloudy. When the fluid was examined under the microscope, one could see the pus cells and the bacteria. Yes, indeed, he was critically ill with bacterial meningitis.<br><br>That evening as I left that little boy in his room--unconscious, blood pressure falling, intravenous fluids started, massive doses of penicillin being infused through the intravenous fluids--I had serious doubts that he would survive. I had doubts, if he did survive, that he would ever be normal.<br><br>Walking down the hall, I met that little boy's mother and father. The father said, "Doctor Mason, will you assist us in administering to our boy?" So I went back into that room. There the father and I exercised our priesthood in behalf of the little fellow. The father anointed his son and then asked me if I would seal the anointing and give a blessing. As we laid our hands upon that little boy, the Spirit of the Holy Ghost whispered to me, "Promise him he will recover. Promise him he'll have no aftereffects of this infection." And so in the name of Jesus Christ and by the power of the holy Melchizedek Priesthood that I held, I promised that boy that he would be healed. I promised him that he would have no aftereffects. As I left that room the second time that evening (even though earlier I had had grave doubts), after that manifestation of the Spirit, I had an assurance that was much surer than medical science or previous experience. I knew that he would live. And indeed, he did. His recovery was uneventful and complete.<br><br>Brothers and sisters, if time permitted, I could relate other accounts which lead me to believe with every fiber of my body that, although the Lord expects us to apply principles of modern medical science in our lives and although he expects us to be obedient to the Word of Wisdom, after we have done all we can, as members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints we can call upon a greater power. Miracles are performed as a manifestation of the spiritual gifts that are part of this Church. All of you have had similar experiences with members of your family. These are sacred experiences, indeed, that we all cherish and that strengthen testimony already developed.<br><br>Some of you may ask, though, "Why are not the sick always healed? Why don't they always recover when we invoke the blessings of our Heavenly Father?" I think the Lord has well answered that in section 42 of the Doctrine and Covenants: "And again, it shall come to pass that he that hath faith in me to be healed,<i>and is not appointed unto death</i>, shall be healed" (D&amp;amp;C 42:48; emphasis added).<br><br>We don't always understand the purposes and the wisdom of the Lord. Not too long ago, a great prophet was taken from our midst--a prophet who had the benefit of every knowledge and discovery known to medical science, a prophet who had been anointed and blessed, but did not survive. Why? "He that . . . is not appointed unto death, shall be healed." I think the significant things is "And it shall come to pass that those that die in me shall not taste of death, for it shall be sweet unto them" (D&amp;amp;C 42:46).<br><br>We often poorly understand the purposes and wisdom of our Father in heaven. If we live properly, if we exercise our faith, and if we exercise the priesthood, we have the assurance that right will prevail and that God's purposes will occur as they relate to a loved one who needs the help of our Heavenly Father.<br><br>Brothers and sisters, isn't it wonderful to belong to a church that has the solution to our temporal problems as well as the spiritual insights, laws, ordinances, and commandments that if we are obedient will lead us back into the presence of our Savior and our Father in heaven? I bear you my witness that our Heavenly Father is interested in our health and temporal well-being. I know that the Saints are blessed. I know that the priesthood has been restored and that we have modern revelation. I pray that we might have the courage to follow the voice of a prophet, to apply these principles, to exercise our faith, and to utilize our priesthood to bless others and ourselves. And I leave that testimony and my blessing with you in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>James O.

<h1>g the Gospel unto All the Nations - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I was influenced, as you were, by that very wonderful musical presentation. Someone has penned these lines:<br><br><i>Of all the arts beneath the heaven</i><br><i>That man has found or God has given,</i><br><i>None draws the soul so sweet away</i><br><i>As music's mystic melting lay.</i><br><i>Slight emblems of the bliss above,</i><br><i>It draws the soul to all consuming love.</i><br><br>Thank you so much for the influence of that wonderful musical number.<br><br>President Oaks, fellow citizens in the kingdom of God, I'm thrilled to be here with you today. As we think back to the meridian of time, when the Savior gave an admonition to those who were closely associated with him in the establishing of the kingdom of God, we remember that he said, "Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature" (Mark 16:15).<br><br>And then, in the beginning of this dispensation, the blessings of which we are enjoying, we hear these words in the very first section of the Doctrine and Covenants: "For verily the voice of the Lord is unto all men, and there is none to escape; and there is no eye that shall not see, neither ear that shall not hear, neither heart that shall not be penetrated" (D&amp;amp;C 1:2).<br><br>And then we move to our day. Within just the past few weeks we've heard this from President Spencer W. Kimball: "I wonder if we are doing all we can. Are we complacent in our approach to teaching all the world? We have been proselyting now 144 years. Are we prepared to lengthen our stride? To enlarge our vision?" (Regional Representatives seminar, 4 April 1974).<br><h2><b>The Growth of the Church</b></h2><br>May we look to history for a moment to see where we are? It took 117 years for the Church to arrive at the point where there were one million members alive at one time. That happened in 1947. In sixteen additional years, or in 1963, the Church passed the two million mark in population. In 1971, in eight more years, the third million was added. Can we sense what's happening as the word is going into all the world? Section 90 of the Doctrine and Covenants gives us some view of what the Lord had in mind. When he was talking with the Prophet Joseph, he said to him:<br><br><i>That through your administration they</i>[the world]<i>may receive the word, and through their administration</i>[and I think he's talking here about us]<i>the word may go forth unto the ends of the earth, unto the Gentiles first and then, behold, and lo, they shall turn unto the Jews.</i><br><br><i>And then cometh the day when the arm of the Lord shall be revealed in power in convincing the nations ... of the gospel of their salvation.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 90:9–10]<br><br>I humbly submit, brothers and sisters, that we're just about on the threshold of this day when the arm of the Lord shall be revealed in power in convincing the nations.<br><h2><b>Preaching the Gospel Throughout the World</b></h2><br>As we consider the word that must go forth by us, we wonder what our sources of inspiration are for the word that we will present and take to the world. I'd like to refer, first of all, to section 68 of the Doctrine and Covenants, which says (speaking of the leaders of the Church, the General Authorities, primarily the President and the counselors, those whom we sustain as prophets, seers, and revelators), "And whatsoever they shall speak when moved upon by the Holy Ghost shall be scripture, shall be the will of the Lord, shall be the mind of the Lord, shall be the word of the Lord, shall be the voice of the Lord, and the power of God unto salvation" (D&amp;amp;C 68:4). How might we obtain this word? One possibility is, of course, to be present at general conference, when the Brethren, under the inspiration of the Spirit, share with us the mind and the will and the word of the Lord. Another is alluded to by President Kimball, who spoke here on campus some time ago and uttered these words:<br><br><i>I hope you young people all heard the messages of the ages delivered last month</i>[at general conference].<i>There will be other conferences every six months. I hope you will get your copy of</i>The Improvement Era<i>and underline the pertinent thoughts and keep it with you for continual reference.</i>[Conference material is now published in the<i>Ensign</i>magazine.]<i>No text or volume outside the standard works of the Church should have such a prominent place on your personal library shelves.</i>["In the World but Not of It,"<i>Speeches of the Year</i>(Provo, Utah: Brigham Young University Press, 1968), p. 3]<br><br>So we can attach ourselves to the mind of the Lord by studying his word as it's made available to us in the Church periodicals and specifically in the<i>Ensign</i>magazine at the present time.<br><br>Now, what about the word that goes out to the world? You're going to have Dr. Ludlow, director of the Church correlation program, speak to you next week. He's a key in the whole nerve center in the creation of materials for the Church. You should listen carefully to what he shares with you this coming week.<br><h2><b>Correlation and Church Curricula</b></h2><br>From Brother Ludlow and other fine key men, there is a curriculum plan that has been established in the Church and has been very spiritually and prayerfully prepared. It's taken months to consider it carefully. The curriculum is somewhat similar, I suspect, to the influence that comes in your lives here on this outstanding campus as you trek your way towards your doctorate. As you go into your field of choice, you find there are certain influences that must come into your lives to give you more breadth and depth and height in your experience and understanding. This same thing is true in the case of the curriculum of the Church as we consider our trek, not for our doctorates, but for exaltation and return to the side of our Heavenly Father. So this plan has carefully considered what our needs are as children, as youth, as young adults, as mature people with families and responsibilities, as grandparents. Through this curriculum plan will come into our lives those things that would lead us through this probationary state if we will take advantage of the opportunities afforded by Church participation and the very wonderful inspirational opportunities that are available to us.<br><br>As this material is created under the course of this curriculum plan, wonderful people--the finest minds on the face of the earth--are molding it together in an instructional development effort. They're going to package it attractively so that it will penetrate our very hearts and our minds and our eyes. These people, many of whom are here from the campus of Brigham Young University, are giving their all prayerfully and carefully to prepare this material. Then, the correlation process is a process somewhat judicial in nature, one that carefully analyzes all the material to make certain that there's doctrinal purity in it and that it adheres to Church policy.<br><br>I thought it might be interesting for you just to have a chance to step behind the scenes as the materials are prepared and see how they move to the world. We have a distribution center in Salt Lake City--186,000 square feet. Out of that center, in the last few weeks and in the next few weeks, will have flowed millions of pounds of material to the English-speaking world. Large containers have been placed aboard ships and have now arrived in Manchester, England, and in Auckland, New Zealand, where they will be shipped to all the units served by those distribution centers.<br><br>Let me relate one illustration that I used at one time to show the extent of one program in the Church, the family home evening program, and the amount of paper that's used in that one program throughout the world. If we were to take those pages and attach them end to end, put them in a roll at the Salt Lake airport, attach the end of the roll to a jet, and let it take off to the east, it could fly to Denver, Colorado, and there would still be paper on the roll in Salt Lake City. That jet then could continue to Chicago, then to New York, then to London, to Paris, to Beirut, to Saigon, to Hong Kong, to Tokyo, to San Francisco, and back to Salt Lake City, and still there would be several thousand miles of paper in that roll. That's the amount of paper used in one program. Can you allow your imagination, then, to move into the various other programs of the Church and see the interesting challenge in getting the word there (meaning throughout the English-speaking world)?<br><h2><b>The Challenge of Translation</b></h2><br>Section 90 of the Doctrine and Covenants says, "And then cometh the day when the arm of the Lord shall be revealed in power in convincing the nations" (D&amp;amp;C 90:10). The eleventh verse of the same section qualifies the non-English effort of the Church: "For it shall come to pass in that day [and I suggest it's our day], that every man shall hear the fulness of the gospel in his own tongue, and in his own language" (D&amp;amp;C 90:11). That's a great effort that is occurring in the international part of Church internal communications. Translation is a very challenging, wonderful experience. I remember in a meeting in Hong Kong, China, a fine man of Chinese descent, speaking in perfect Oxford English, made this statement: "Without translation, there would be no commerce, no social relations between nations. Without translation, salvation would only be available to the nation where the world of the Lord was revealed."<br><br>Translation occurs, in part, in Salt Lake City on the twenty-first floor of that beautiful new office building--not the translation per se, but the preparation to translate. There we go through an adaptation process, where all the materials that I've described thus far have been prepared and then are transculturalized; that is, we take out the illustrations that would be pertinent to those of us who are here in Provo, but perhaps not pertinent to those in Tahiti or in Helsinki, Finland. There are introduced into the courses of study, then, appropriate and apt illustrations that will move those people. You see, the challenge is to motivate all of the eternal spirits in whatever culture they find themselves, just as we in our culture would be motivated as we read the materials prepared for our own edification in the Church.<br><br>Translation is a very challenging responsibility. We now have the full Church program in sixteen languages that represent many, many nations. We're doing part of the Church program in an additional twenty-one languages in preparation for missionary work that is just commencing in many parts of the world and in preparation to respond to the call of the prophet as he tells us, "Move into new parts of the world."<br><br>One illustration of the difficulty of translation that might be appropriate occurred in a non-Church setting, but I think you can appreciate this. It was a meeting in Vienna, Austria, between Krushchev and President Kennedy. During the course of this meeting, through interpreters, President Kennedy was stressing the fact that Mr. Krushchev of Russia should not miscalculate the American will. As President Kennedy would stress, "Don't miscalculate our will," Mr. Khrushchev would flush and would respond rather negatively. At the end of the conference, President Kennedy was not satisfied with the progress that had been made, and so they went back through the interpretation script to find out what might have happened. It occurred to them, as they reviewed what had occurred, that the person who had done the interpreting from English into Russian had interpreted the term<i>miscalculate</i>as "You dumbbell, you could not add two and two and get four."<br><br>We must be very careful not to translate just word to word, but it must be feeling to feeling. That's the challenge of our wonderful translators all over the world. We have translating teams in Finland, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Holland, Germany, Italy, Spain, France, throughout the Middle East, South Africa, down in Brazil and Spanish-speaking Latin America, Tahiti, Samoa, Tonga, up through the Indonesian area in the Thai language, the Vietnamese. We're translating in Hong Kong, Taiwan, in Japan, and in Seoul, Korea, and that's where the work is done. It's an interesting challenge, you see, to operate in a church that is international, that is intercultural, and that is multilingual. As we think of meeting the challenges of personnel, of communication, of transportation, of going through customs, it's possible only because those involved in the process live close to the Lord.<br><br>Let me share with you a couple of personalities who have operated in the translation department. We'll first go to Sweden, if we might. There Sister Margstrom (who has now passed away, by the way), after being very crippled with a disease that wouldn't allow her to operate normally as we operate, translated the book<i>Jesus the Christ</i>from English into Swedish. Her script came in typewritten. That doesn't seem unusual until you recognize that his crippling disease that she had would allow her only to hold in one hand, with some pain, a stick with a rubber tip. She typed that transcript one letter at a time.<br><br>There are wonderful people like that all over the world. A sister down in Tahiti, as she responded to her family's comments about "Why do you put so much time in translating?" said, "Well, you go out from our home to gather the wealth of the world, and I stay here to gather the wealth of the Lord."<br><br>We had a seminar of our key people from various parts of the world not too long ago in Salt Lake City. There was a man from the South Pacific, Brother Bill Roberts. He had charge of all of the South Pacific at that time. Another man, Immo Luschin von Ebengreuth, from Frankfurt, Germany, plus a man from the Orient, and a half dozen or so key people from throughout the world also attended the conference. As we closed this several-day seminar with a little luncheon and a testimonial meeting, Brother Roberts in his testimony was very overcome emotionally. I wondered a little about it. He said, "You know, I want to express love for Brother Luschin."<br><br>When Brother Luschin stood to express his testimony, he reciprocated the statements made by Brother Roberts and said, "I have in my heart a very special love for Brother Roberts. Perhaps you'd like to know why we are making these kinds of expressions. Brother Roberts was a commissioned officer in the New Zealand armed forces; I, a commissioned officer in the German armed forces. We fought each other in Africa, in Italy, and right up into Germany. At that time, we were trying to kill each other. Now, we know that that feeling has been completely erased, and we love each other with all our hearts." That's some idea of what the word will do as it impresses the mind and the heart of a member of the Church.<br><h2><b>Stake Conferences</b></h2><br>The word goes forth each weekend in stake conferences. The General Authorities move around the world, as do the Regional Representatives of the Twelve. In interim meetings and in regional meetings, they take the word out to the world. A week ago today, I was a third of the way around the world from here in Bai Blanca, Argentina. We'd started the meeting there at seven o'clock in the morning. It had lasted about three hours, and about this time we were running to catch a plane to fly several hundred miles to Buenos Aires, where we were to hold two more meetings, one in the afternoon and one in the evening. Now that schedule is almost typical of the lives of the General Authorities, I am finding. They move around the world; it's been calculated there's something like seventy-five thousand miles traveled each weekend by the cumulative mileage of the General Authorities. Add to that the distance the Regional Representatives of the Twelve travel, and there is a tremendous mount of impact throughout the world.<br><h2><b>Area General Conferences</b></h2><br>The world must go forth, and stake conferences, regional meetings, stake priesthood leadership meetings, and various other approaches are used very effectively. It was mentioned that there was some participation on our part in the area general conferences. Interestingly enough, Brother Robinson and Brother Peterson, who are here, are Regional Representatives of the Twelve for two of the Scandinavian countries and are a part of a very key committee that is now planning what will happen over in Stockholm in the middle of August.<br><br>These area conferences are wonderful experiences. They're something fairly new in the Church, as you know. Let's go to Manchester, England, for just a glimpse. The ecstasy on the faces of the Saints as they saw the prophet was more to be felt than to be described. To see the tears coursing down their cheeks as they came in close proximity to him was wonderful. Let's look into the mind of the prophet for a moment. On Saturday, we had two meetings going simultaneously, a meeting for adults in one building and one for youth in another. President Joseph Fielding Smith was to be the first speaker in the adult session and then, halfway through, at the rest song, was to move to the other meeting. At the time of the rest song, then, Arthur Haycock (the prophet's secretary), a physician, and myself were accompanying the President between the two meetings. Halfway through the walk we were complimenting President Smith on how well we felt he had done and how he had impressed the Saints with his testimony. He stopped, got our attention, and said, "I haven't come this far to fail." You could just feel his whole body desiring to respond to the Spirit of the Lord and to reach out and touch those members that were there assembled.<br><br>The Saints in England sang, as a closing number of the conference, an original hymn, the words written by one of the stake presidents, Ernest Hewitt. Can you imagine now, at the close of this wonderful series of three days of spiritual, uplifting experiences, those Saints singing these words?<br><br><i>In Britain's chosen countryside,</i><br><i>Mid England's dales and Scottish hills,</i><br><i>Welsh mountains green and Irish lakes;</i><br><i>Here we live, and here we will serve.</i><br><br><i>God gave to us this special land,</i><br><i>He made us men of character;</i><br><i>Our women fair and steadfast too.</i><br><i>Here we will live, here we will serve.</i><br><br><i>Here we were called by God above,</i><br><i>To join the special chosen few,</i><br><i>To be His saints, called, set apart.</i><br><i>So here we live, here we will serve.</i><br><br><i>This is our place, here we will stay,</i><br><i>To build, to strengthen ward and stake</i><br><i>Until the Lord supreme shall reign;</i><br><em>This is our place, here we will serve.</em><br><br>There wasn't a dry eye in that building as these words were echoed in song and spirit, and I felt very sorry for the stake president who had to offer the benediction. He choked up, as you would, an almost inaudible prayer as he expressed appreciation to our Heavenly Father for the spirit of that occasion.<br><br>Mexico City, 1972: Those Saints came from the deserts. They came from the industrial cities of the north. They came from the small pellittos in the east and west. They came from the tropical coastlines down south in Central America. Throughout the summer those Saints had saved and borrowed and sold whatever they had to try to get together the two hundred pesos per person that was necessary for bus tickets. I'll just use one illustration. Four busloads came from a very distant area. There was no money left over for food, but that didn't matter. This group decided that they could fast for the three or four days of the conference. Most of the Saints arriving at the area general conference in Mexico City didn't have two pesos (about sixteen cents American currency) for a cot, and so they spent those nights on hard floors. But, oh, what an inspiration it was to witness sixteen thousand members of the Church sustain President Harold B. Lee for the first time in a general conference as the President and the prophet, seer, and revelator of the Church! There were so many choice experiences that time will not permit me to relate all of them.<br><br>Munich, Germany, for just a thought or two. There, people had come from Germany and Austria and Holland, Belgium, France, Italy, and Spain. Speakers of all those languages were there to hear the world of the Lord. Interestingly enough, they could all hear it simultaneously. Those that didn't understand German were furnished with tiny transistor-type affairs with earphones. They could dial their language. If I were speaking in English and your native tongue were Italian, you could just turn to Italian and my words would come automatically to you in the language to which you were native.<br><br>One final illustration related to the Munich conference didn't happen in Munich, but in Holland. Just after the conference, Brother de Jager, Regional Representative of the Twelve, was in his own ward. There, interestingly enough, he heard the choir sing at sacrament meeting, not in Dutch, but in German. He asked them afterward, "Why are you singing in German in the sacrament meeting?"<br><br>They, with spiritual smiles on their faces, said, "Brother de Jager, this is one of the hymns we learned at the area general conference." You remember the occupation of Holland by the Germans, and yet you see how the Saints had reciprocated the Spirit of the Lord.<br><br>A brief testimony, now, as we think of the word going forth. The Prophet Joseph Smith said, with great boldness and assurance:<br><br><i>No unhallowed hand can stop the work from progressing; persecutions may rage, mobs may combine, armies may assemble, calumny may defame, but the truth of God will go forth boldly, nobly, and independent, till it has penetrated every continent, visited every clime, swept every country, and sounded in every ear, till the purposes of God shall be accomplished and the Great Jehovah shall say the work is done.</i>[<i>Documentary History of the Church</i>, 4:540]<br><br>Our present prophet, seer, and revelator, President Spencer W. Kimball, stated:<br><br><i>Using all the latest inventions and equipment and paraphernalia already developed and that which will follow, can you see that perhaps the day may come when the world will be converted and covered? If we do all we can, and I accept my own part of that responsibility, I am sure the Lord will bring more discoveries to our use. He will bring a change of heart into kings and magistrates and emperors, or he will divert rivers or open seas or find ways to touch hearts. He will open the gates and make possible the proselyting. Of that I have great faith.</i>[Regional Representatives seminar, 4 April 1974]<br><br>I bear you a personal witness of our modern prophet. His trumpet has given us a certain sound. We must be prepared to march to all the world and preach the gospel to every creature. I know that God lives. I know that Jesus is the Christ. If we can link our efforts with their power, we can accomplish the objectives that our Father in heaven has in mind in bringing to pass the immortality and eternal life of man. I bear you that witness humbly and with every fiber of my being and in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>J.

<h1> Choice Above All - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Good evening. It's a great honor and privilege to greet you this evening--the beautiful Sabbath evening that is--in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. We meet in his name; it's because of him that we're here.<br><br>We're on the eve of what we call the Fourth of July. It's altogether fitting that we consider, relative to the Fourth of July, the real meaning that is behind it. Certainly the Lord Jesus Christ is behind the Fourth of July and our celebration thereof. It's marvelous to have just the opportunity to get together on a Sunday evening like this with so many of you. You make such a beautiful picture. As I walked in here, I was struck by the pastel shades that were before me. You're like spirits, I'm sure, that radiate colors, feelings. I guess spirits do have colors. Certainly your spirits show through. It's what's inside that makes you look as you do on the outside. We're indebted to the living prophets for information such as this.<br><br>We're all spirits, each one of us. Each of us lives in a house of clay for a brief period of time, but it's our spirit that sees and feels and hears. It's the spirit, I presume, that also gets addicted to drugs and bad habits and evil desires, because each one of us is a spirit--just as God is a spirit. I refer you to the Doctrine and Covenants, where it says, "For man is spirit" (D&amp;amp;C 93:33).<br><h2><b>The Meaning of Freedom</b></h2><br>We talk of a person having a good spirit or a bad spirit. We talk of the spirit of '76. We are going to celebrate our two hundredth national anniversary in the not-too-distant future, and this spirit of '76 is to permeate everything that we do. This evening I'd like to talk a bit about the spirit of '76 and what we are really dong when we celebrate the Fourth of July.<br><br>This holiday means a lot of things to a lot of different people, I'm sure, but most of all it means freedom--real freedom, the freedom to act, the freedom to pray, the freedom to love and<i>know</i>what we're doing. We do many things without really understanding what we're doing, but real freedom gives us knowledge and makes us free to move within our own spheres of activity. When the Lord makes us free, we're free, indeed, because we're not fettered by false ideas or understandings. We need to understand that we're here for a purpose, each one of us. We have missions to fulfill--real missions, missions that reach into eternity. We can make serious mistakes if we don't understand why we're here. We've been told we're here to fill missions that will make us as our Heavenly Father is. The mission, the purpose, the work and glory of our Heavenly Father are to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man--and woman. (<i>Man</i>, in this instance, is a collective term. It includes everyone.)<br><br>Resurrection comes as a free gift. No one has to do anything for that. Everybody's going to be resurrected whether he wants to be or whether he doesn't. There will be a lot of people resurrected that won't want to be. They're going to be resurrected anyway. You're going to get it whether you want it or whether you don't. All too often that happens to us in life: we get something whether we want it or not. Resurrection is a free gift which was given to us by the Lord Jesus Christ, our elder brother.<br><br>But God equates his glory with eternal life, meaning the power to procreate after our own kind, eternally. That's the real purpose of being here. Eternal life is a gift of God, but it's not a gift in the sense that resurrection is a gift. No one will receive eternal life who doesn't want it. You have to want it more than anything else in this world because you have to have help from heavenly Father to receive it. The fact remains that the Lord cannot give it to you unless you're in condition to receive it. You can't get blessings from your Father unless you're in condition to receive them. Our whole purpose here is to get ourselves in condition to enjoy eternal life. That also comes only through the Lord Jesus Christ. And so freedom--real freedom--means freedom to get ourselves in condition to enjoy eternal life.<br><br>The Fourth of July, then, celebrates freedom of a sort. Everyone enjoys the Fourth of July. To children it means fireworks, Roman candles, sky rockets, explosions of all kinds. Back in my home state of Missouri, when I was growing up, there were no limits on the size of firecrackers. We took great delight in laying a stick of dynamite on top of a log, lighting it, and then going back quite a distance. We rattled all the dishes on the shelves of every home in the valley in which I lived. We youngsters could hardly wait for the Fourth of July. I've always had a sneaking hunch that the Fourth means freedom to play with matches. I'm sure that has something to do with the reason children love it so.<br><br>To mothers, the Fourth means fixing picnic lunches and making sure that there's plenty to eat for everyone. They are the only ones who don't really enjoy much freedom on the Fourth of July.<br><h2><b>The Symbolism of the Flag</b></h2><br>To everyone the Fourth means parades with marching bands, horses, floats, and beautiful girls such as are here this evening. It also means the flag, Old Glory, the star-spangled banner, the red, white, and blue. There is a poem that says:<br><br><i>Hats off!</i><br><i>Along the street there comes</i><br><i>A blare of bugle, a ruffle of drums,</i><br><i>A flash of color beneath the sky:</i><br><i>Hats off!</i><br><i>The flag is passing by.</i><br><br>[Henry H. Bennett, "The Flag Goes By," st. 1]<br><br>Red means courage and hardness. That's the reason, I presume, it was chosen. White means purity, virtue, innocence. Blue means vigilance, perseverance, justice. It's altogether fitting that our flag represent these virtues, and all those who live under this flag should manifest these virtues in everything that they do. With this symbolism you can appreciate why the Lord might like the stars and stripes--seven red, six white stripes, and then a blue field of stars, one star representing each state of the Union. It takes an act of Congress to add a state to the Union, of course. A star is always added on the Fourth of July following the acceptance of a new state. Today, of course, there are fifty of those stars.<br><br>The flag became known as the "star-spangled banner" because of the song written by Francis Scott Key in 1814. As you know, his song became the national anthem. The name "Old Glory" came from a ship captain by the name of William Driver. The first time that we heard that name was in 1824.<br><h2><b>This Land Is Choice</b></h2><br>I thrill when I see the flag. I hope you do, too. It stands for the USA. This is a land choice above all other lands. We have revelation on the subject. There's nothing like the USA anywhere. There never has been, and I presume there never will be. The Lord has made that comment in respect to this earth. There are those who feel that we in the Western Hemisphere are the New World but, of course, we aren't the New World at all this is where it all began; thus the USA is really the "Old World."<br><br>It was on this continent, near the center of this continent (in fact, very near Missouri, which is the center of this continent), that the Garden of Eden was located. Life didn't start off over in what they call the "cradle of civilization" or today's Holy Land. No, it started in the central part of the United States. That's where Adam and Eve were cast out of the garden. They moved out to earn their bread by the sweat of their brows. Also it was there that Cain slew Abel. It was there that Noah built an ark, in the middle of a continent like the United States. No wonder they thought he was a little bit "strange," to say the least. It was there that he and his wife and his three sons and their wives embarked on the ark and floated for many, many days. The ark finally came to rest on top of Mount Ararat. They came down out of the ark, and civilization supposedly started from there. But that was the second start. Civilization had already started here.<br><br>The Book of Mormon says that, when the waters receded off of this land, it became a land choice above all other lands--a land of promise to those who would obey the God of this land, who is Jesus Christ. If the people would not obey the God of this land, then they would be swept off (see Ether 2:7–12). That has happened at least three times previously as far as we know. It happened in Noah's time, certainly. It happened again to the Jaredite civilization. It happened again in the Nephite civilization, which included the Mulekites. It may have happened at other times. We're not sure. We don't have all the records that deal with this land, but what records we do have are consistent. The warning to us in this day and time is that unless<i>we</i>live these commandments, unless<i>we</i>serve the God of this land, we too can be swept from this land. I don't believe that will happen again because this people, the Lord's people, the Latter-day Saints, are going to keep the commandments of God. If they don't, they will no longer be Latter-day Saints.<br><br>It's important that we know where our salvation is. We know that if we want to remain free we have to remain firm--firm in living obedient to these commandments. This nation has been established primarily to preach the gospel. That's really the only purpose in it. Nations such as this are not established just to enjoy prosperity and ease in living, though we have that; but if we let this be our object and design, the nation will not remain free. A call to be God's nation is a call to service, a call to give of ourselves, to reach out as we have been doing since the day the USA really became a nation.<br><br>Early in our history there were those who were friendly to us because we were struggling. It seems that tyranny has always been more organized than freedom. Freedom is more precious than any of the gifts for which you may be tempted to give it up. Sometimes we're tempted to give it up for ease or for personal convenience, but we dare not. Someone has said that anyone can sympathize with a friend's suffering, but it requires a really fine nature to sympathize with a friend's success. The USA has been very successful, and some who were our friends while we were struggling are no longer such fast friends. They find things to criticize about us. I presume that we deserve it, but there's still no nation like this one, which has been set up to reach out to people and to lift people. That's what we've done.<br><h2><b>Spreading the Gospel from the USA</b></h2><br>I'm proud of the USA because it has provided the means to establish and carry forth the gospel. It took a Constitution that was put together by men whom the Lord raised up for that very purpose. He says that he did:<br><br><i>Therefore, it is not right that any man should be in bondage one to another.</i><br><br><i>And for this purpose have I established the Constitution of this land, by the hands of wise men whom I raised up unto this very purpose and redeemed the land by the shedding of blood.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 101:79–80]<br><br>It seems always to be part of the Lord's economy that choice lands must be redeemed by the shedding of blood. This is a pattern the Lord has always followed.<br><br>So we have a nation established in this land, and it took a special Constitution to get it done. But that's not the end, certainly. I heard the testimony of a new mission president, Brother Salik, who is now presiding over the Brazil Rio de Janeiro Mission. He was born in Yugoslavia but moved into Austria at the end of World War II because of persecution. He said that the people almost starved to death but were saved by assistance under the Marshall Plan, in which food, clothing, and monetary assistance were provided by the United States after World War II to help those countries get on their feet. Brother Salik emigrated to Australia, and there two Mormon elders taught him the gospel and he joined the Church. He feels that he was saved by help from the United States.<br><br>The same thing has happened in many, many other instances, of course. It happened in Japan. Japan was placed under the occupation of American forces after World War II. It took the best blood of this nation to subdue that nation--that's for sure. But because the Japanese were placed under domination of the United States, they were made free--free for the first time in the history of that country. With that new freedom, everyone knows what has happened. Japan has become an economic power second perhaps only to the USA. And its economy is growing all the time.<br><br>You can see the difference between countries that were placed under Communist domination and those under American control. Certainly East Germany was one of the former countries. I've been there. There is no freedom. It is difficult for us even to keep the Church as a unit there--very difficult indeed. The Church cannot grow there, while in Japan it is growing by leaps and bounds. There are six missions in Japan today. The stakes are growing. It's the same way in Korea. We just divided that mission. There are two missions in Korea today and a stake in Seoul. And there will be other stakes in Korea.<br><br>In both Japan and Korea, when the troops moved out, the mission president and the missionaries moved in. Why? Because of Mormon servicemen. Wherever Old Glory flies, there the kingdom of God is established. It's that way all over the world. It makes no difference where she flies; you'll find the kingdom of God there. I'm convinced that the stars and stripes is God's flag because of what happens when it flies. It works the same way wherever you look. The same thing is happening in Vietnam, Thailand, Hong Kong, Singapore, Southeast Asia, and Taiwan. Mormon servicemen have established the kingdom, so when the military goes out, the mission president and the missionaries go in. And the Lord's kingdom rolls forth.<br><br>Notice the same pattern: these lands have been redeemed by the shedding of blood--the best blood of this generation. Many choice young servants of the Lord have died in those conflicts. I presume it has ever been so. It doesn't seem to make any difference whether it be in the Church or outside; thus the kingdom of God rolls forth in the earth.<br><br>President Lee's statement on this subject is very interesting. Talking in terms of the fact that we are now a worldwide organization, he said that we're all over the world, which brings up special problems in the Church. We're beginning to see an expansion of the Church, he said. We're beginning to see it is no longer an American church. It is an international, universal kingdom of God that bids fair now to be on the way to blanket the earth with truths as the waters cover the mighty deep, as the prophets have said.<br><br>President Lee also spoke in terms of the finances that we are receiving throughout the world. There are only three countries in the world that can really support the Church monetarily today. There are only three countries in the world that in fact donate more to the kingdom of God in a year than the Church actually spends in those countries. Mostly it's not the other countries' fault that they contribute less. The people donate their share, but when the family income is twelve dollars a month, that's not very much. The Lord asks for only one-tenth of it, and they give it. These are good people, but they'd never be able to build the kind of chapels and the temples that need to be built around the world so that these people can enjoy the fullness of the gospel of Jesus Christ.<br><br>As we look at the figures, we see that the United States donates 112 percent of what is actually spent here in the United States. That extra 12 percent finances the rest of the world, almost, because 80 percent of the Church membership is in the United States. Canada donates 193 percent of what is spent in Canada. But only 2.2 percent of the Church members live in Canada, so that 93 percent, while substantial, is not all that much, you see. South Africa donates 157 percent. But there are only two-tenths of one percent of the Church members in South Africa. Every other country donates much less: the British Isles, 29 percent; Germany, 38 percent; South America, 17 percent; Mexico and Central America, 13 percent; Australia and New Zealand, 28 percent; Japan, Taiwan, and the Far East, 29 percent. You see, the Saints here in the USA donate what it takes to run the kingdom around the world. Isn't it a privilege to do it? Aren't you glad you can?<br><br>Why do you suppose the Lord organized the kingdom in the United States? So he could finance it. The kingdom has to be financed. I'm sure the Lord knows where all the gold is. He could give me a shovel and tell me where to dig, and I could probably bring back enough gold from within sight of where I am standing in two days' digging to finance the Church for the next fifty years. But if he did that, he could forget about us. We, you and I, desperately need to make this kind of sacrifice because it's sacrifice that brings forth the blessings of heaven. They don't come forth on any other basis. Sacrifice is what is required--coupled with obedience. As a matter of fact, obedience is sometimes sacrifice, isn't it?<br><br>The same kind of statistics are evident when it comes to preaching the gospel or furnishing the manpower to carry the message of the Restoration around the world. Eighty-eight percent of all our missionaries in the world today come from the USA. Canada furnishes 7 percent of the missionaries in the world. That's above their share by quite a bit, isn't it? Only 2.2 percent of the Church members live in Canada, but they furnish 7 percent of the missionaries. The USA and Canada together provide 95 percent of those the Lord calls to preach the gospel. That means that the rest of the world furnishes 5 percent. That's the reason that President Kimball is so anxious that we give the other countries in the world an opportunity to call their young men and women into the mission field. They desperately need to do so.<br><br>Calling missionaries from other countries wouldn't just take the load from the United States, because I don't anticipate any cutback in the missionary force from the USA. In fact, we need to increase the missionary force<i>here</i>because the Lord is going to open more doors for us and we're going to go places we've never been before. We're going to need this group that can come from the USA to go into lands that we would consider behind the Iron Curtain or the Bamboo Curtain. When the time comes to go, the Lord will open the curtains. There will be no curtains. We can penetrate them. We need to get ready to do that kind of work because it is vitally important that good people everywhere have an opportunity to hear the gospel. What happens to a young man when he has given the Lord his two years? Well, that's where we produce future mission presidents and stake presidents and bishops. That's what happens there. I've seen it happen among the peoples of those countries when their own young men have filled missions.<br><br>It's interesting also that 50 percent of all those missionaries who come from the United States come from the Utah-Idaho area. If the purpose of the Lord in establishing his kingdom here in the United States was to raise up a righteous generation in the rocky Mountains that would support the kingdom throughout the world, he has accomplished his purpose. But the end is not yet. It still goes on.<br><br>To me, it's obvious why the Lord established this country, this land. With his own hand he has done it. Isn't it great to be able to serve in the military of this country? As far as I'm concerned, service in the military of the USA is service in the kingdom of God. I believe that. I believe it even more strongly because of what the First Presidency has said. Their statement is "We believe that young men should hold themselves in readiness to answer the call of their country to serve in the military." We can build the kingdom wherever we are. It doesn't make any difference what you're doing or where you are located. The work must be done. And we're free to do it because we have this kind of a nation as our heritage. We know more about freedom, I presume, than anyone knows--except, I guess, maybe one doesn't really know about freedom unless he's lost it. But we know about freedom because we<i>have</i>experienced it.<br><h2><b>The USA Welcoming Immigrants</b></h2><br>Another reason why I love the USA is that she provides a haven for those who have no hope. It doesn't make any difference what nation they come from. The inscription on the Statue of Liberty says this very well. More properly, if we were looking up this inscription on the Statue of Liberty we would find that the name of the statue is the "Liberty, Enlightenment" or "Liberty Enlightening the World." That's really what the name of the Statue of Liberty is--"Liberty Enlightening the World." Isn't that descriptive? Part of the inscription on that statue says:<br><br><i>Keep, ancient lands, your storied pomp.</i><br><i>Give me your tired, your poor,</i><br><i>Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free,</i><br><i>The wretched refuse of your teeming shore,</i><br><i>Send these, the homeless, tempest-tossed, to me:</i><br><i>I lift my lamp beside the golden door.</i><br><br>[Emma Lazarus]<br><br>The people have come from all nations. The mixing of the blood of all of the children of God has taken place here. Isn't it apropos? That's how you get strength. Anybody who knows anything about raising cattle knows that you have to bring in outside blood lines every now and then to build strength in the stock. Of course, it's the same way in the kingdom of God. That's the reason we need to keep bringing in the converts, mixing them with the blood in the Church so the blood of Israel will be kept strong and viable.<br><h2><b>American Patriots</b></h2><br>Another reason why I love the USA is that she has produced some great men--great men that you can hold up as an example, that you can look to for leadership. George Washington, whom many call the father of this country, was such a man. In his first inauguration he set a tone that everyone could profitably seek to emulate. After he had accepted the oath of office from Robert Livingston of New York, he added the words "so help me God," and then he kissed the Bible and went back to work. There are no other coins that I know of anyplace in the world that have "In God We Trust" stamped on them as a motto.<br><br>Another great patriot was Thomas Jefferson, who wrote the Declaration of Independence--just struck it off, as it were, at the age of thirty-three. A short quote: "We hold these truths to be self-evident; that all men are created equal; that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness." About this document Edmund Burke, the famous English statesman, is supposed to have said, "It was the most noble document ever struck by the pen of man."<br><br>And then, of course, there was Abraham Lincoln, who could not abide that man should be in bondage one to another. Born in a log cabin, he followed the study course of the Bible, the scriptures, and you couldn't do better than that. He was probably one of the most quoted men of all times. They tell me his words fill fifteen volumes. The 2 1/2-minute talk that he delivered at Gettysburg I presume will stand always and forever as a masterpiece:<br><br><i>Fourscore and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.</i><br><br><i>Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation or any nation so conceived and so dedicated can long endure. We are met on a great battlefield of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of that field, as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this.</i><br><br><i>But, in a larger sense, we cannot dedicate</i>--<i>we cannot consecrate</i>--<i>we cannot hallow</i>--<i>this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it far above our poor power to add or detract. The world will little note nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here. It is for us, the living, rather to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us</i>--<i>that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion; that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain; that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom; and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.</i><br><br>I guess that couldn't be improved upon, for he said it all. The Spirit bears record that what he said was true.<br><br>The greatest American who has ever lived in this dispensation was the Prophet Joseph Smith, who was raised up by the Lord. We have testimony by prophets that he has done more, save the Lord Jesus Christ, than any other man for the salvation of mankind. Yes, he was the instrument through which the Lord reestablished his kingdom upon the earth, made it available to everyone, as many as will. The Prophet Joseph Smith was a great, great champion. He said one time, "Never be discouraged. If I were sunk in the deepest pit in Nova Scotia and the Rocky Mountains were piled on top of me, I'd hold on, exercise good courage and faith, and come out on top." I'm sure he would have. You couldn't beat him. Isn't it great to be that kind of a winner? I presume that's the way the Lord is. You can't beat him. He can make something good out of any bad kind of circumstances--no matter what the conditions are.<br><br>The Prophet Joseph Smith said at another time, "I never met a man I couldn't throw." Some thought that was a terrible thing for a prophet to say. But I love it, don't you? What a champion he was! He brought forth some of the greatest, most beautiful revelations that you could ever read. He told us how to exercise authority--the one thing that man has more trouble with than anything else. Authority is hard to exercise correctly. The Prophet started out using some of my favorite words. He said:<br><br><i>How long can rolling waters remain impure? What power shall stay the heavens? As well might man stretch forth his puny arm to stop the Missouri river in its decreed course</i>[I like that<i>Missouri</i>in there, you see]<i>or to turn it up stream, as to hinder the Almighty from pouring down knowledge from heaven upon the heads of the Latter-day Saints.</i><br><br><i>Behold, there are many called, but few are chosen. And why are they not chosen?</i><br><br><i>Because their hearts are set so much upon the things of this world, and aspire to the honors of men, that they do not learn this one lesson--</i><br><br><i>That the rights of the priesthood are inseparably connected with the powers of heaven, and that the powers of heaven cannot be controlled nor handled only upon the principles of righteousness.</i><br><br><i>That they may be conferred upon us, it is true; but when we undertake to cover our sins, or to gratify our pride, our vain ambition, or to exercise control or dominion or compulsion upon the souls of the children of men, in any degree of unrighteousness behold, the heavens withdraw themselves; the Spirit of the Lord is grieved; and when it is withdrawn, Amen to the priesthood or the authority of that man.</i><br><br><i>Behold, ere he is aware, he is left unto himself, to kick against the pricks, to persecute the saints, and to fight against God.</i><br><br><i>We have learned by sad experience that it is the nature and disposition of almost all men, as soon as they get a little authority, as they suppose, they will immediately begin to exercise unrighteous dominion.</i><br><br><i>Hence many are called, but few are chosen.</i><br><br><i>No power or influence can or ought to be maintained by virtue of the priesthood</i>[or authority]<i>, only by persuasion, by long-suffering, by gentleness and meekness, and by love unfeigned;</i><br><br><i>By kindness, and pure knowledge, which shall greatly enlarge the soul without hypocrisy, and without guile--</i><br><br><i>Reproving betimes with sharpness, when moved upon by the Holy Ghost; and then showing forth afterwards an increase of love toward him whom thou hast reproved, lest he esteem thee to be his enemy;</i><br><br><i>That he may know that thy faithfulness is stronger than the cords of death.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 121:33–44]<br><br>And then he gave the secret, if you would have communion with the Lord:<br><br><i>Let thy bowels also be full of charity towards all men, and to the household of faith, and let virtue garnish thy thoughts unceasingly; then shall thy confidence wax strong in the presence of God; and the doctrine of the priesthood shall distil upon thy soul as the dews from heaven.</i><br><br><i>The Holy Ghost shall be thy constant companion, and thy scepter an unchanging scepter of righteousness and truth; and thy dominion shall be an everlasting dominion, and without compulsory means it shall flow unto thee forever and ever.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 121:45–46]<br><br>There will be no greater words written than those. The Prophet Joseph Smith had to go through a lot of trials and tribulations to bring that to pass. He had to spend nine months in a jail--dungeon, if you would, back in Liberty, Missouri. I'm not proud of that. But if he had to do this only to bring forth those words, it was worth it.<br><br>Many times we feel that we're terribly put upon by the things we suffer. For instance, do you know what it took to get the Smith family from Sharon, Windsor County, Vermont, over to Palmyra, New York? Three crop failures and impending drought. I presume the Smith family felt that they were terribly mistreated. Now, of course, the Lord could have sent the angel Moroni down to Joseph Smith, Sr., and said, "Brother Smith, I'd like you to move your family over to Palmyra, New York. There's something I'd like Joseph to do over there." He could have, but he didn't, you see. He just made it untenable for them to stay there. Aren't you glad he did?<br><br>Many times the things that we think are terribly disconcerting to us and that we don't really deserve are the things that make us great. I had a cancer on my lip when I was eighteen years old. The doctor said it was caused from continuous exposure to the sun. If I stayed in the sun, he couldn't guarantee it wouldn't return. I love to farm, but I didn't like it that much, and so I left the farm. I had to, just as did the Saints who came to the Salt Lake Valley. (President Tanner says the Saints came of their own free will, because they had to.) That's the reason I left the farm. I left of my own free will because I had to. A short time later I was back in the navy living out in San Diego, California, and along came two young missionaries who knocked on the door. I don't think they ever would have found me back in Missouri. Not where I was, back there on the farm, anyway. If I hadn't had that cancer, I probably would not be here today. I'm glad I had it. The quality of refusing to be defeated will make winners of us all.<br><br>The Prophet Joseph Smith said something about patriotism that we ought to be aware of. He said, "Patriotism should be sought for and will be found in right living." Isn't that interesting? You can't be really patriotic unless you're righteous. No man can be a good Latter-day Saint and not be true to the best interests and welfare of his country. We know what we're supposed to do. King Benjamin's doctrine is still true: "When ye are in the service of your fellow beings ye are only in the service of your God" (Mosiah 2:17).<br><br>The USA is great because its leaders are willing to give it away. I don't know what Kissinger has bartered away over in the Near East, but I'm sure he's given quite a bit away because those people he was dealing with wouldn't do the things that<i>he'd</i>want them to do unless he paid them for it. I don't think anyone representing any other nation could have persuaded them to do it, though. The price may be a little high, but we can afford it. We can afford peace as long as it doesn't destroy liberty and take away our honor.<br><br>We need to give. That's the message of the Fourth of July, as far as I'm concerned. It is, once again, a looking back to that time when our forefathers were willing to pledge their lives, their fortunes, and their sacred honor to bring this nation to pass. Many gave their lives to do it, but it was worth it. When you die in this kind of a cause, I think you've got a ticket to the highest degree. "Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends" (John 15:13).<br><br>We're called of the Lord to give, worldwide. But we should do it in the Lord's way. We have to keep the free-enterprise system because that's what makes it possible for us to do what we're doing. We can't do it with socialism and communism. They have over half of the people in Russia on the farm trying to feed the other half. Here in the USA, less than 10 percent of the people are feeding everybody else, yet we hear that there are still too many farmers. The cattle ranchers are going to cut back on the cattle production because prices are so bad. Isn't that interesting? I believe we in the United States could feed the whole world if we really wanted to. We can do it because this is that land choice above all other lands. We can reach out to other peoples, and they can feel the touch of the Master's hand through us because that's what we're called to do.<br><h2><b>The Influence of the Master</b></h2><br>We are blessed above all other people. But we're not blessed to sit down with our blessing and hold it and hug it to our breasts; we are blessed to give it away, for in the giving we always get back more than we give. That's the gospel of Jesus Christ and that's the philosophy of this country. We've got to follow that because there are many who can feel the touch of the Master's hand through us. There's a verse that illustrates this point:<br><br><i>'Twas battered and scarred, and the auctioneer</i><br><i>Thought it scarcely worth his while</i><br><i>To waste much time on the old violin,</i><br><i>But he held it up with a smile:</i><br><i>"What am I bidden, good folks?" he cried,</i><br><i>"Who'll start the bidding for me?</i><br><i>A dollar, a dollar," then, "Two." "Only two?</i><br><i>Two dollars, and who'll make it three?</i><br><i>Three dollars, once; three dollars, twice;</i><br><i>Going for three--." But no.</i><br><i>From the room, far back, a gray-haired man</i><br><i>Came forward and picked up the bow;</i><br><i>Then, wiping the dust from the old violin,</i><br><i>And tightening the loose strings,</i><br><i>He played a melody pure and sweet</i><br><i>As sweet as a caroling angel sings.</i><br><br><i>The music ceased, and the auctioneer,</i><br><i>In a voice that was quiet and low,</i><br><i>Said, "What am I bid for the old violin?"</i><br><i>And he held it up with the bow.</i><br><i>"A thousand dollars, and who'll make it two?</i><br><i>Two thousand! And who'll make it three?</i><br><i>Three thousand, once, three thousand, twice,</i><br><i>And going and gone!" said he.</i><br><i>The people cheered, but some of them cried,</i><br><i>"We do not quite understand</i><br><i>What changed its worth." Swift came the reply:</i><br><i>"The touch of a master's hand."</i><br><br><i>And many a man with life out of tune,</i><br><i>And battered and scarred with sin,</i><br><i>Is auctioned cheap to the thoughtless crowd,</i><br><i>Much like the old violin.</i><br><i>A "mess of pottage," a glass of wine;</i><br><i>A game–and he travels on.</i><br><i>He's "going" once, and he's "going" twice,</i><br><i>He's "going" and almost "gone."</i><br><i>But the Master comes, and the foolish crowd</i><br><i>Never can quite understand</i><br><i>The worth of a soul or the change that's wrought</i><br><i>By the touch of the Master's hand.</i><br><br>[Myra Brooks Welch, "The Touch of the Master's Hand"]<br><br>The whole world can feel that touch through what goes out from this land, choice above all others. May we accept this challenge and may we love it. It's not enough just to be good, you know. You have to go the second mile. It's not enough just to pay your tithing; you've got to feel good about it. It's not enough just to be good; you've got to be good for something. We need to be good, but we need to be good for something. We need to be good for everybody that we touch.<br><br>Wherever the old stars and stripes flies or Old Glory waves, there the kingdom of God must be. That's what we're called to do, and you here who are young and vigorous don't know your own capacity. You're like the Lamanite striplings--I'm sure of that. There's nothing you can't do, as long as you include the Lord with it. He blesses this nation and he blesses those that go out to represent it, but we've got to be in condition so that the Spirit can speak through us.<br><br>It comes right back to what the Prophet said: "You cannot be patriotic unless you live righteously." Nor can you have eternal life unless you live righteously. You can't represent the Lord unless you live righteously. Righteous living makes it all possible. I'm convinced that this Church is going to be that leaven that leavens the whole loaf. We're going to be here when the master comes--a people prepared to meet him. We'll have to do it. It won't just happen because we're born here. We have great responsibility, but responsibility that's a lot of fun. Enjoy it.<br><br>I bear you my witness that I know that God, our Heavenly Father, lives and that he hears and answers prayers. He is interested in the United States of America; make no mistake about that. He has gone to every length to establish this land. He kept it hidden for centuries so that no one else knew about it. All those who come to this land are led by the Spirit of the Lord. That's what it says in the Book of Mormon. What does that say about your forebears? They were led by the Spirit of the Lord to come here.<br><br>I bear testimony that Jesus is the Christ and that he is the God of this land and that we have to worship the God of this land if we are to remain free and vigorous and viable. There is no other way. I bear witness that this is his true church. It's been reestablished upon the earth in our day and time through that great prophet, Joseph Smith--wonderful man that he was. But wonderful as he was, he's not the greatest prophet to you and me today. That man is Spencer W. Kimball, who is a prophet of the living God. I bear my witness that he is and that he makes the decisions in the Church and kingdom of God today that affect everybody throughout this world. It's a world organization. He makes those decisions under the direction of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, with whom he communicates, whose church it really is, and whose country this is, too. May we always be worthy and make the sacrifices necessary to be worthy. I pray that we will and leave my love and my blessing to you upon whom so much depends. You are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, a peculiar people, who are born to serve. May you do it I pray in Jesus' name. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Hartman Rector, Jr., was a member of the First Quorum of the Seventy of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when this fireside address was given at Brigham Young University on 30 June 1974.</i></i><br><br><i>© Brigham Young University.

<br>
It is a privilege for me, President Oaks, to be here. It is good to come back home again with friends and family and associates and co leagues. My mind goes back to the fact that I was scheduled to teach a class in this room when this building was built, and I remember the first time that I was in the room, before some of the seats were in, I had the responsibility of teaching a Book of Mormon course.<br><br>I deem it a privilege, my brothers and sisters, to be asked to be here as your devotional speaker today. I consider it a great privilege to be associated with this University in any way whatsoever. I have Brother Peterson's letter here inviting me to give this talk, and in the letter he indicates that "we are awaiting a message of your choice on a subject related to patriotism, or to our country, or on a gospel theme." After much thought and some prayer, I was impressed to select a topic that would be related to all three of these subjects. Thus I believe that our topic today would be appropriate at a political rally, at a Fourth of July celebration, or in a sacrament meeting. Of course, inasmuch as this is a devotional, the emphasis today will be based upon the doctrinal basis of the topic, but I think it would be equally appropriate at one of your freedom festival sessions here in Provo this week.<br><br>The subject I should like to discuss is basic to the gospel of Jesus Christ, and yet I am not going to talk primarily of faith or of repentance or of the Atonement. But faith, repentance, the Atonement, and all the other principles, ordinances, and doctrines of the gospel are based on this topic--indeed they would be virtually inoperative and impossible of existence if it were not for the subject that we will discuss--the subject of moral free agency.<br><br>Concerning the principle of free agency, President David O. McKay has written:<br><br><i>Next to the bestowal of life itself, the right to direct that life is God's greatest gift to man. . . . Freedom of choice is more to be treasured than any possession earth can give. It is inherent in the spirit of man. It is a divine gift to every normal being. . . . Everyone has this most precious of all life's endowments--the gift of free agency--man's inherited and inalienable right.</i>[<i>Improvement Era</i>65 (February 1962): 86]<br><h2><b>Free Agency in the Pre-Earthly Existence</b></h2><br>In discussing this topic with you today, I would like to begin at the beginning, but so far as I can tell there never was a beginning so far as the exercising of free agency is concerned. According to the Prophet Joseph Smith, our minds or intelligences--those parts of our being with which we think and make choices and determine actions--have always existed. Concerning this the Prophet said:<br><br><i>The mind or the intelligence which man possesses is co-equal with God himself. . . .</i><br><br><i>The intelligence of spirits had no beginning, neither will it have an end. . . . There never was a time when there were not spirits; for they are co-equal</i>[that is, co-eternal]<i>with our Father in heaven. . . .</i><br><br><i>Intelligence is eternal and exists upon a self-existent principle. It is a spirit from age to age, and there is no creation about it.</i>[<i>Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith</i>, comp. Joseph Fielding Smith (Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Co. 1938), pp. 353, 354]<br><br>Thus the capacity of choice, which is a most essential element in free agency, has evidently always been part of our being.<br><br>In the process of time each of our intelligences was clothed with a spiritual body by heavenly parents, and we became personages of spirits with bodies of eyes and ears and hands and feet. All of us on this earth had the same Father of our spiritual bodies, and because he lives in heaven we have been rightfully taught to refer to him as "our Father in heaven."<br><br>Our spirit bodies were capable of tremendous accomplishments, but they also had some serious limitations. There were some laws that they could not obey, and therefore there were some blessings not available to them. Thus, our Heavenly Father called us into a grand council in heaven where he proposed a plan that would give us further opportunities of growth and development by giving us further opportunities of choice. There the importance of moral free agency and its four necessary and essential conditions were explained to us: first, we must have the opportunity of choice--that is, the operation of law; second, there must be the possibility of the existence of opposites--good and evil, virtue and vice; these two make possible the third, the freedom of choice--that is, free agency; then finally a knowledge of the law and its consequences. All four of these conditions are necessary in order to accomplish the progression which would enable us to become as our Father in heaven, which was the main purpose of this new earth plan that he proposed.<br><br>When we lived with our Father in heaven, we did not need to exercise faith in whether or not he existed. We knew that he was because we saw him; we walked and talked with him. We knew he existed and were<i>convinced</i>of his existence, but we were not necessarily<i>converted</i>to him and to his great principles because our knowledge of him had come from external sources without virtually any effort on our part. So that we would come to a knowledge of him in and of ourselves, our Heavenly Father proposed that when we came into this earth life a veil of forgetfulness would be placed over our minds so that we would not remember our pre-earthly existence with him. Only then could the choices that we made here upon this earth truly come from within us. Our Father in heaven then promised us that while we were here on the earth he would give us law and would provide the possibility of opposites, would give us free agency, and would send angels and prophets to teach us and give us scriptures so we could learn the laws and why we should keep them. Thus, he promised us the necessary conditions on this earth so that we could become morally free before him.<br><br>The nature of law was also explained in that pre-earthly council--that each law has consequences, opposite and equal. Whenever a law is kept or obeyed, the consequence is a blessing which results in joy or happiness. Whenever a law is broken or disobeyed, the consequence is a punishment, which results in misery or unhappiness. This simple and perhaps overgeneralized explanation of the law of justice portrays how order is accomplished, for in the payment of the law of either obedience or disobedience, the law is brought back into a state of balance and thus order prevails. The law of justice then always requires a payment.<br><br>But another law also operates in the moral realm--the law of mercy, which in no way robs or violates the law of justice but which makes possible the vicarious payment of broken law. For example, the law of mercy permits the disobedience of a person to be atoned for or paid for by the obedience of the Savior, providing that the person who disobeyed the law will cease being disobedient--in other words, providing that person repents.<br><br>The great plan of salvation and exaltation was then explained to us: why the possibility of opposition must exist upon the earth and how it would occur through the fall of man, how the law of justice would require a payment for the broken law, and how the law of mercy would make the Atonement possible. The explanation of these things was later revealed to the prophet Lehi, and he taught them to his family in these words:<br><br><i>For it must needs be, that there is an opposition in all things. If not so . . . righteousness could not be brought to pass, neither wickedness, neither holiness nor misery, neither good nor bad. . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . there is a God, and he hath created all things, both the heavens and the earth, and all things that in them are, both things to act and things to be acted upon.</i><br><br><i>And to bring about his eternal purposes . . . the Lord God gave unto man that he should act for himself. Wherefore, man could not act for himself save it should be that he was enticed by the one or the other. . . .</i><br><br><i>And the Messiah cometh in the fulness of time, that he may redeem the children of men from the fall. And because that they are redeemed from the fall they have become free forever, knowing good from evil; to act for themselves and not to be acted upon, save it be by the punishment of the law. . . .</i><br><br><i>Wherefore, men are free according to the flesh; and all things are given them which are expedient unto man. And they are free to choose liberty and eternal life, through the great mediation of all men, or to choose captivity and death.</i>[2 Nephi 2:11, 14–16, 26–27]<br><br>It was then explained in this great pre-earthly council that as we would come to the earth the Spirit of Christ would be placed within each of us and another member of the Godhead, the Holy Ghost, would be empowered to witness, reveal, and testify to our spirits. Then, even though we had a veil of mortality over our minds, the Holy Ghost would be able to bring all things to our remembrance<i>if</i>we would listen to the words of the prophets, would read the words of the scriptures, and would respond to the Spirit of Christ that is within each of us by praying to our Father in heaven. This time, however, the knowledge would come to us by an act of will on our part. We would have internalized it; it would have become part of our very being, and therefore no one throughout all eternity could take this knowledge away from us unless we, by an act of will, would allow this knowledge to be taken away.<br><br>Now, there were other purposes, of course, for the earth life. We came here also to receive physical bodies capable of procreation. But the God-given power to have children would not be placed in our physical bodies until we had arrived at an age of accountability and had matured in experience so we could exercise our free agency in using these powers in righteousness.<br><br>It was soon evident when this great plan was presented to us that because of the Atonement and the principle of free agency, this earth life could become a great testing and proving period where, if we proved faithful to all the laws given to us by our Heavenly Father, we would become even as he is and share with him his power and glory. Perhaps it was when we realized this that the "sons of God shouted for joy," as recorded in the book of Job (Job 38:7).<br><h2><b>Lucifer's Plan to Deny Free Agency</b></h2><br>There were some, however, in that pre-earthly council who did not shout for joy. They either lacked faith in our Heavenly Father, in the Savior, or in the gospel plan, or they lacked faith in their own ability or willingness to keep the law that would be given to them. Thus, they actively opposed the plan of our Heavenly Father. Their leader was called Lucifer, "the son of the morning"; he is also known as the devil or Satan.<br><br>Lucifer not only opposed the plan of our Heavenly Father, but he sought to amend and change the terms of salvation by denying men their free agency and by dethroning our Heavenly Father. The exact words of Lucifer's boast are contained in the book of Moses: "I will redeem all mankind, that one soul shall not be lost, and surely I will do it; wherefore give me thine honor" (Moses 4:1).<br><br>We do not know all of the details of Lucifer's amended plan, but we do know from revelation that he "sought to destroy the agency of man" (Moses 4:3). This could be accomplished in many ways, including denying us either the opportunity of choice or the freedom of choice. In either case, not "one soul" would have been lost. It is sin that causes a soul to be lost, but how can a person sin if he does not have the opportunity to sin? That is, how can a person disobey a law if he does not have a law?<br><br>Lucifer's plan appealed to some, but it did not appeal to any of us in this audience. We saw that under his plan we would lose the challenge of growth and progression. We did not want to live in a world where we would be on the same plane forever. We had enough faith in our Heavenly Father and in his plan, in Jesus Christ, and in ourselves that we wanted to live in a world where there would be opportunities for further development. At the same time I am sure we realized that if we were not faithful to these laws and opportunities we might even be worse off than we had been before.<br><br>Thus there was a great war in heaven, and a key issue in that war was whether or not man was to be a morally free agent while upon the earth. A vote was taken. (By the way, that in itself indicates that we had our free agency there; in a sense Lucifer exercised his free agency in an attempt to deny us the right to exercise our free agency.) Two-thirds of those present voted for the plan of our Heavenly Father; one-third voted against the plan and did not participate in it.<br><h2><b>Freedom in the Garden of Eden</b></h2><br>So the plan was put into operation. A physical earth was created. Physical bodies were prepared for Adam and Eve. Their spirit bodies were placed in those physical bodies, and they became living souls. Then our Heavenly Father started to keep the promises that he had made to us by giving them the opportunity of choice. He did this by giving them law, by telling them what they should do and what they should not do: "Partake of the fruit of the tree of life." "Multiply." "Do not partake of the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil." Through his selection of the laws, he also gave them the possibility of opposites. Next he explained the consequences of those laws: "Partake of the fruit of the tree of life, and ye shall live forever." "Multiply, and you shall have joy and rejoicing in your posterity." "Partake of the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil, and you shall surely die." Then our Heavenly Father did one other thing: he explained the consequences of their choices and also explained that they would have the freedom to choose under this great earth plan. Notice how all three of these elements are present in one verse in the book of Moses:<br><br><i>But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it, nevertheless, thou mayest choose for thyself, for it is given unto thee; but, remember that I forbid it, for in the day thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.</i>[Moses 3:17]<br><br>Well, you know the rest of that story. Lucifer and his followers were cast out of heaven. In order to make all of us subject to him, thus enabling him to put his throne above the throne of God, he needed to accomplish two things: first of all, to get sin into the world, and then to keep Jesus Christ from atoning for that sin.<br><br>Therefore, Lucifer tried to get Adam to disobey one of the laws. When he was unsuccessful in this, he concentrated on Eve and finally enticed her to partake of the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil. Eve then persuaded Adam to partake of that same fruit. Although Adam and Eve had great intellect and powers of reason in the Garden of Eden, they were without experience; although they had the opportunity of choice and the freedom of choice in the Garden of Eden, yet they were not morally free because they did not fully understand the consequences of their choice. Oh, they heard the words of our Heavenly Father, "In the day thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die," but what was death to Adam and Eve? The veil of forgetfulness had already been placed over their minds--they had never seen death nor experienced it; they could not understand it. And because they did not fully comprehend the consequences of what they did, their disobedience of the law is referred to as a "transgression," not as a "sin," and consequently comes under the unconditional part of the atonement of Jesus Christ.<br><br>As a result of those transgressions, two deaths were introduced into the earth: physical death, which resulted from their partaking of that particular fruit; and spiritual death, which resulted from their disobeying our Heavenly Father. Thus misery and suffering, which are the consequences of broken law, entered into the world.<br><h2><b>The Atonement of Christ</b></h2><br>Now, because of limitation of time today, let us skip four thousand years of history and come down to the birth of Christ--a very important period so far as all mankind is concerned. Indeed, the prophet Jacob in the Book of Mormon said that, if Jesus Christ did not atone, then all mankind must unavoidably perish and we would all "become devils, angels to a devil, to be shut out from the presence of our God, and to remain with the father of lies, in misery, like unto himself" (2 Nephi 9:9). The plan was that Jesus Christ would be born into this earth as the Only Begotten Son of God in the flesh and would have power over the physical death. The plan also required that Jesus Christ would be sinless while he lived upon the earth so that he would have power over all the laws and would be able to atone for the spiritual death introduced by the fall of Adam and Eve.<br><br>Lucifer knew these two essential and necessary characteristics which Christ must possess. He may have known this because of his pre-earthly experience; if not, then surely he knew it because of the words of the prophets of God here upon the earth. Therefore, when the Savior was born, Lucifer tried in every way that he could think of to keep Jesus Christ from achieving his great divine destiny. He tried to get Jesus Christ to deny his divine sonship, but the Savior replied, "I came into the world to do the will of my Father." He tried to get Jesus Christ to break one of the laws, for he knew that if he could get the Savior to break only one law–to commit only one sin--then the Savior would not have power over all of the laws and therefore could not atone for the sins of all mankind.<br><br>But Jesus completely resisted the enticements of Lucifer; Jesus did not disobey any laws, and so he is referred to in the scriptures as the Sinless One. Jesus Christ was thus<i>able</i>to atone for both the physical death and the spiritual death. He was able to atone for the physical death because of the power that he had inherited from the Father as the Only Begotten Son of God in the flesh; he was<i>able</i>to atone for the spiritual death because he was sinless.<br><br>The next crucial question was "Would he be<i>willing</i>to atone for those deaths? Would he be willing to endure the intense suffering and pain that would be required to pay for the sins of all mankind? Would he be willing to submit to the chains of physical death and thereby voluntarily break the bands or the chains of physical death for all mankind?" The New Testament records the drama of the experiences of the Savior in Gethsemane, at Golgotha, and at the tomb, where he fully atoned for the two deaths, conquering both the grave and hell and thus becoming the great Savior and Redeemer of all mankind. In remembrance of the two aspects of his atonement, we have been commanded that when we partake of the sacrament we partake of two emblems--bread in remembrance of the body of Christ, which he gave as a ransom for all; and a liquid in remembrance of the blood of Christ, which he shed for the remission of our sins (see Matthew 26:22–25, Inspired Version).<br><br>As a result of the atonement of Jesus Christ, we are all freed from the bondage of the original transgression of Adam and Eve, as well as being freed from all those transgressions we committed before we arrived at the age of accountability. As the Savior himself has said, "I, the Lord God, make you free, therefore ye are free indeed; and the law also maketh you free" (D&amp;amp;C 98:8). Therefore, because of the Atonement, the extent of our individual free agency today is in direct proportion to the number and kind of laws we know and keep. Likewise the loss of our free agency today can be measured in direct proportion to the number and kind of laws we disobey. Perfect freedom is made possible to us through the Atonement, but it can come only through perfect obedience to the law.<br><br>The atonement of Jesus Christ also meant that Lucifer could not obtain his goal. He cannot win all of us. He cannot win Christ; Christ is already beyond his power. He cannot win those who have already lived on the earth obedient to the laws of our Heavenly Father and who have now been resurrected.<br><h2><b>Efforts to Limit Human Freedom</b></h2><br>But Lucifer is trying to run up as high a score as he can, and he does this by trying to keep us individually from achieving the great divine purposes for which we came here upon this earth, including the exercise of our free agency. He can do it by denying us any one of the four essential qualities of moral free agency. He can do it by denying us the opportunity of choice, and he tries to do this through certain types of governments, dictatorships, through the lack of governments (anarchy), and so on. He tries to do this by destroying, in our minds at least, the idea that there is a necessity of opposition, and therefore he tries to teach us "There is no sin. It mattereth not what a man does; whatsoever a man doeth is not sin. Eat, drink, and be merry, for tomorrow we die." Thus he destroys the role of opposition in our lives, or at least he attempts to do so.<br><br>He can also do it by destroying our freedom of choice, and he does this by enticing us to give up our right of free agency to other persons or to other institutions and allow them to make our choices for us, resulting in the evil that Presidents of the Church have talked about in communism and socialism and other orders of this type.<br><br>He also does it by trying to encourage us not to come to a knowledge of our Heavenly Father by not listening to the prophets, by not studying the scriptures, and therefore by not knowing the consequences of our choices: "The scriptures are irrelevant today. They were written a long time ago. Don't pay any attention to them," he says. "There are no such things as prophets upon the earth; they ceased at the time of Christ." Or he says that the heavens are sealed; there is no revelation today. He even says that God is dead!<br><br>Thus in one way or another he tries to entice us to become like him and to become subject to the misery and unhappiness that he now participates in. To achieve his devilish aims, Lucifer can and does work through many means: business combines, governments on all levels, military forces, educational institutions, secret combinations of all kinds, and even families, teachers, and churches. Wherever and whenever you find a person or an institution that seeks to destroy the free agency of man, there you will find the influence of Lucifer.<br><br>President Henry D. Moyle talked on this subject in these words:<br><br><i>All we have to do is . . . examine any movement that may be brought into our midst . . . and if it . . . attempt</i>[s]<i>to deprive us in the slightest respect of our free agency, we should avoid it as we would avoid immorality or anything else that is vicious. . . . Free agency is as necessary for our eternal salvation as is our virtue. And . . . as we guard our virtue with our lives, so should we guard our free agency.</i>[<i>Conference Report</i>, October 1947, p. 46]<br><br>President Marion G. Romney, when he was a member of the Council of the Twelve, gave this advice:<br><br><i>One of the fundamental doctrines of revealed truth is that . . . God endowed men with free agency (Moses 7:32). The preservation of this free agency is more important than the preservation of life itself. . . . Everything which militates against man's enjoyment of this endowment persuades not to believe in Christ, for He is the author of free agency.</i><br><br><i>Now the world today is in the throes of a great social and political revolution. In almost every department of society laws and practices are being daily proposed and adopted which greatly alter the course of our lives. Indeed, some of them are literally shaking the foundations of our political and social institutions. If you would know truth from error in this bitterly contested arena, apply Mormon's test to these innovations [as recorded in Moroni 7:16–18]. Do they facilitate or restrict the exercise of man's divine endowment of free agency? Tested by this standard, most of them will fall quickly into their proper category as between good and evil.</i>[<i>Speeches of the Year</i>(Provo, UT: Brigham Young University Press, 30 May 1957), pp. 10, 11]<br><br>As an example of how sin can put us into bondage, let us consider for a moment the Word of Wisdom, because this is a physical law that we can see and understand rather readily. The Lord has said tobacco is not good for man--that is the law. We have our free agency either to obey or to disobey the law. If we obey the law and do not smoke cigarettes, we enjoy better health than we would if we disobeyed the law. Also, by keeping the law we still have our free agency as to whether or not we will continue to keep the law. However, as soon as we disobey the law--in this case, when we become addicted to nicotine--we not only suffer the penalty of poorer health, but we also practically lose our free agency in that matter. The broken law has a claim over us, we have become slaves to the drug, and the broken law will continue to have a claim over us until we stop breaking the law--that is, until we repent. And essentially the same principle is involved in all of the laws given to us by our Heavenly Father.<br><h2><b>Scriptural References to Freedom</b></h2><br>Now, rather than to intersperse this discussion with some scriptural quotations, I wanted to develop at least this much and then to quote a few scriptures pertaining to these principles. I think there are about ten:<br><br><i>If ye continue in my word, then are ye my disciples indeed;</i><br><br><i>And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.</i>[John 8:31–32]<br><br><i>Though he were a Son, yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered;</i><br><br><i>And being made perfect, he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him.</i>[Hebrews 5:8–9]<br><br><i>Stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free, and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage.</i>[Galatians 5:1]<br><br><i>Men should be anxiously engaged in a good cause, and do many things of their own free will, and bring to pass much righteousness;</i><br><br><i>For the power is in them, wherein they are agents unto themselves. And inasmuch as men do good they shall in nowise lose their reward.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 58:27–28]<br><br>And it must needs be that the devil should tempt the children of men, or they could not be agents unto themselves;<i>for if they never should have bitter they could not know the sweet.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 29:39; emphasis added]<br><br><i>Whosoever perisheth, perisheth unto himself; and whosoever doeth iniquity, doeth it unto himself; for behold,</i>ye are free; ye are permitted to act for yourselves;<i>for behold, God hath given unto you a knowledge and he hath made you free.</i><br><br><i>He hath given unto you that ye might know good from evil, and he hath given unto you that ye might choose life or death; and ye can do good and be restored unto that which is good, or have that which is good restored unto you; or ye can do evil, and have that which is evil restored unto you.</i>[Helaman 14:30–31; emphasis added]<br><br><i>Be not deceived; God is not mocked; for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap.</i>[Galatians 6:7]<br><br><i>To him that knoweth to do good, and doeth it not, to him it is sin.</i>[James 4:17]<br><br><i>The wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.</i>[Romans 6:23]<br><br><i>This is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent.</i>[John 17:3]<br><h2><b>Freedom Necessary for the Gospel to Flourish</b></h2><br>An atmosphere of freedom is necessary for the teaching and accepting of the gospel of Jesus Christ. The missionaries and the message of the restored gospel have been received by the nations of the earth in almost the same proportion as those nations have accepted the principles of freedom. So intertwined are the principles of the gospel and the principles of free agency that they have become almost as one. This characteristic has been pointed out by President John Taylor in these words:<br><br><i>Besides the preaching of the Gospel, we have another mission, namely, the perpetuation of the free agency of man and the maintenance of liberty, freedom, and the rights of man. . . . We have a right to liberty--that was a right that God gave to all men; and if there has been oppression, fraud or tyranny in the earth, it has been the result of the wickedness and corruptions of men and has always been opposed to God and the principles of truth.</i>[<i>Journal of Discourses</i>, 23:63]<br><br>Now, if what we have been saying here today is true, we as Latter-day Saints should be the most free of any people on the face of this earth. We have all the opportunities of choice that other people do--and more, because we have the additional laws and principles of the restored gospel. We have all the possibilities of opposites shared by other people and more, because of the differences between the brightness of the noonday sun of the restored gospel as compared with the moonlight of Protestant and Catholic Christianity and the darkness of skepticism, agnosticism, and atheism. We have all the freedom of choice enjoyed by other people and more, because we have modern scriptures and living prophets to guide us day by day. Thus if we as Latter-day Saints are not the most free people on the face of the earth, then we should be, because we have to the greatest extent the necessary components of free agency.<br><br>Now, essentially that is the message that I wanted to give today, and I hope that you will agree with me now that the theme could apply as well at a Fourth of July celebration or at a political rally as in sacrament meeting. However, before I finish I should like to share with you a statement by the late Elder Richard L. Evans pertaining to this topic which he gave in conjunction with an Independence Day celebration. The title of Elder Evans's brief address is "Thank God for Freedom":<br><br><i>May we take a moment from some of the side issues and from some of the irrelevant celebration, and clear our thoughts and humble our hearts and get down on our knees and simply, fervently, thank God for freedom--and then get on our feet with a firm resolve to preserve it against all who secretly or openly would set it aside.</i><br><br><i>Thank God for freedom--and for the Founding Fathers who reaffirmed to a new nation, an eternal, timeless truth: that the right of choice--that the free agency of man--is a God-given inalienable right, and is essential to the peace and growth and progress and salvation of the very soul.</i><br><br><i>This truth has been challenged again and again, and will yet be challenged again and again. It was challenged in the heavens before time began, by the brilliant but rebellious Lucifer. There was war in heaven--for freedom. And anyone who seeks to enslave men in any sense, in mind, in spirit, in thought--anyone who seeks to enslave the minds, the hearts, the spirits of men is essentially in league with Satan himself--for "where the spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty" [2 Corinthians 3:17]</i>.<br><br><i>Thank God for the Constitution of our country, which was brought into being "by the hands of wise men whom</i>[the Lord God]<i>raised up unto this very purpose" [D&amp;amp;C 101:80]. Thank God for the promise that in this choice land, men "shall be free from bondage, and from captivity, and from all other nations under heaven, if they will but serve" God [Ether 2:12].</i><br><br><i>Thank God for the right of choice, for the right to become whatever we can become in a free and provident land that, despite its imperfections, has proved to be more efficient for progress and human happiness than any society founded on the false philosophies that would seek to enslave the minds and souls of men.</i><br><br><i>God grant that we may repent wherever we have departed from the principles of freedom--that we may preserve the right to fail and the incentive to succeed, and live, as did the Founding Fathers, knowing that there are no acceptable substitutes for freedom.</i>[<i>From the Crossroads</i>(New York: Harper &amp;amp; Brothers, 1955), p. 45]<br><br>We teach our children that when they pray they should thank their Heavenly Father for the blessings that he has given to them. I hope that in our daily private and family prayers we will always thank our Heavenly Father for the great blessing that he has given us on this earth--the gift of moral free agency--and also for the right and opportunity to exercise this gift as members of his church and kingdom and as citizens of this country.<br><br>I bear my personal witness to the fact that our Heavenly Father and his divine Son, Jesus Christ, are the fountainhead of all truth and freedom. By following their teachings we can be free indeed and can find the joy and happiness that "surpasseth all understanding." This is their church. President Spencer W. Kimball is their prophet on the earth. I bear witness and testimony to you this day of these things in the name of our Savior, Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Daniel H. Ludlow was director of correlation for Internal Communications of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when this devotional address was given at Brigham Young University on 2 July 1974.</i></i><br><br><i>© Brigham Young University.

<br>
Thank you, President Lewis, so very much for that generous introduction. Thank you, Brother Downs, for that beautiful music. Thank you, my brothers and sisters, for sharing this hour with me. The introduction made me reflect back on my life. Many of the events mentioned in it sound better in the telling than in the doing, but I'm grateful that they would be mentioned.<br><h2><b>What We See Versus What We Know</b></h2><br>I had an experience the other morning that has resonated in my mind since that time. My son, for some reason, kind of got the missionary spirit and decided he'd do some things around the house. The current thing is to put mirror tile in the bathroom. Tile goes up quickly, so I brought some home, and my son stayed late one night putting it up. I got up early the next morning to clean up, but I didn't realize that the mirror tile had already been placed on one wall of the bathroom. Now, my wife has a strong nightlight in the bathroom. I'm not sure just what the psychological significance of that is. It's like a searchlight; if you walk in there you're well revealed. I was sleepy; I didn't pay much attention to the light. As I leaned over, I put one hand on the bathtub and was just removing my unmentionables when out of the corner of my eye I caught this figure standing before me. Everything happened so quickly I couldn't really maintain the aplomb that usually characterizes me. I saw this haggard, scrawny figure standing before me nude, and I jumped about three feet in the air. Then I recovered my poise. I thought the figure looked slightly familiar. I looked at it rather carefully and struck a pose or two. Then I studied it still more carefully. I walked over and looked at those broad shoulders, that noble brow, that resolute jaw, those gentle, earnest, warm, brown eyes. I reflected for a moment on the fact that, although the figure in the mirrors had not changed, there had been a change in the way that I perceived it. I wondered which one was the more accurate of the two. Which one was the real Woodbury, the essence of the person inside?<br><br>And as I thought about that, I remembered something that had happened when I was much younger. My little boy Lexon, fifteen years ago, was slithering around the floor in his diaper while I was lying on the couch. He came paddling across the floor (I was serving on President Lewis's high council at the time, as a matter of fact) and crawled up to me. His hot little breath raked the side of my face, and then he stood up to put his cheek against mine. I pretended to be asleep, but he lifted one eyelid. He looked inside, and then he let it fall back. Just learning to talk, he cupped his little mouth against my ear and gently whispered, "Hello, in there." I thought, isn't it interesting that he would say, "Hello, in there"? He knew that I wasn't really outside. I wasn't in my hands or in my feet or even in my eyeballs. He knew that there was some inner dimension, a part of me that he was trying to reach--the same part I was trying to discover in the mirrors. You see, we all want to learn who we are and what we're about.<br><br>I think of the art that we create for one another. There are two broad categories of art that can be sketched on canvas. One is the kind that is a representation of what we see, such as a painting of disappearing railroad tracks. It has proper perspective. The figures in the foreground are larger than those in the background, and we say, "Gee, he's a pretty good artist," because that's the way we think we see. But, you know, realistic representation is a fairly recent development in artistic practice. For a much longer period of time artists created a form of art that we now call primitive (although I don't think it's primitive at all), in which the elements of the picture are divided into three distinct segments. You're likely to see the Virgin Mary seated in the center; she's the largest element in the picture. Then, in front of her, but much smaller (and that's why we think it primitive), are three wise men and three shepherds. In the third segment, above, still much smaller (although they're usually behind her), are naked seraphim and cherubim singing the glory of the coming Lord, the birth of our Savior. But Mary is the largest figure in the picture. Why? Because she is the most<i>important</i>figure in the picture. We call that hieratic art, or the art of painting, not what we see, but what we<i>know</i>. We<i>know</i>that Mary and the baby Jesus are more important than the three wise men or the three shepherds. So we have two ways of representing reality: what we see, which is what I first saw in the mirror; and what we know, which is what I saw later on.<br><br>Now, isn't that an important distinction to make? We go through life distinguishing between what we see and what we know. I had a friend at the University of Iowa who was a psychologist. He once brought to me some optical illusions. The interesting thing about them is that they don't depend upon translation; they don't depend upon language. They look the same to all, no matter what language they speak. "Lael," he said, "What do these look like?"<br><br>I said, "They look like a bunch of scratches on a piece of paper."<br><br>He said, "I know, but if you were forced to a decision, what figures would you say these look like?"<br><br>I said, "Well, I don't know. They look like squares--just a group of squares to me."<br><br>Then my friend got a grant from the government, went to South Africa, went deep into the bush as far from civilization as he could get, and he held these same optical illusions before the people there and asked, "What do you see when you look at this?"<br><br>In whatever language they use, they said, "We see essentially vertical forms."<br><br>Then he came back and said, "I don't know how to understand this. People in America tend to see rectangles when they look at the optical illusion; people in Africa tend to see vertical structures when they look at it. Why is this so?" He concluded that it is due to the fact that people in America live in what he calls "carpentered societies." Americans live in a world of rectangles. You're looking at one now. You're seated in one. The floor is one, the shape of the proscenium arch is square. This is an easy way to build. It's the cheapest form of construction. You and I are used to seeing rectangles, whereas those who live in jungles, I suppose, are used to seeing vertical forms. This illustration lends emphasis to the concept that we see, not really what we<i>see</i>, but what we<i>know</i>. In other words, what we think we see is determined by what we know, or what happens in front of the eye is not as important as what happens in the back of the eye.<br><br>My brothers and sisters, what do you know about yourself? Have you ever been to a party where they were doing some hypnotism things? We know now from reading the<i>New Era</i>that that's not a very healthy activity, but I went to a party once where some people were hypnotized. They put a chair here, they put a chair there, and they hypnotized a boy and laid him across the two chairs, his head on one chair and his heels on another. The hypnotist said, "You are rigid." He made him<i>know</i>that he was rigid. That's an important point. Because he knew it, he became rigid. People jumped up and down on his belly. Can you imagine that! He had extraordinary ability in his body. I can't endure people jumping up and down on my belly even when I'm flat on the floor.<br><br>I read once of a woman who was washing dishes while looking out her kitchen window. Her boy was changing a tire out in back. He had jacked the car up by the bumper and very unwisely had crawled underneath to work. His mother saw the car slowly move backward. The bottom of the car was coming down on his chest and began crushing the life out of him. This little mother ran out of the kitchen, grabbed the back bumper of the car, lifted it up, and said to her son, "Get out of there as quick as you possibly can," or words to that effect. He crawled out. His life was saved. She then dropped the car and was taken to the hospital where she spent several months recovering from a broken back. Now, the point is that she didn't know she couldn't lift the back end of an automobile. I<i>know</i>I can't. I've had to change tires. I have trouble getting the hubcaps off and on because I know just how little power I really have. But a person can lie with his heels on one chair and his head on another and people can jump up and down on him. There's no question in my mind that inherent within each of us is the ability to lift a weight as heavy as an automobile.<br><br>My brothers and sisters, if a loved one lifts your eye or whispers into your ear, "Hello, in there," who responds? Who is in there in your head--that part of you that is inseparably connected with the body that your earthly father and mother prepared and that part of you that will leave when that body is laid to rest for a while?<br><br>Brothers and sisters, what do you see when you look at yourself, when you look into a mirror? Oh, I know. I know what you see because I've seen the same things myself: school problems, bad grades, flunking out of college, money problems, a poor complexion, an acute case of bad breath (and it's got to be pretty bad if you can see it in a mirror). Do you see what you<i>see</i>, or do you see what you<i>know</i>? Do you know who is in there? When you look at such images or think about them do you see the person inside? Stop and think about this problem for a minute, because if you think it through you can change your life, my brothers and sisters. If you know who is in there and remember it and act accordingly, you can become a different person.<br><h2><b>You Were Valiant in the Preexistence</b></h2><br>Do you know that in you there is one coeternal with God--uncreated intelligence? You were not created and you cannot be destroyed. I don't know how to reconcile that concept with the feelings of a person who's got a case of eczema or a figure problem or can't get a date for next Friday night. They are two different concepts–two different dimensions. But the first is more accurate than the second because the second will pass on in a short while, but the first remains forever. Can you see yourself as one who was present and who shouted when the foundations of the earth were laid? Do you know why you shouted? You shouted for joy. I know what you shouted. The prophets have told us. I used to think we all shouted "Hurray" or "Hallelujah," but we shouted the "Hosanna Shout."<br><br>Are you one who fought and was valiant in the great battle in heaven? I think you were. I think each of you had to make that decision. I think there was a debate about it. I think you fought and were valiant. I think that our Father laid his hands upon your head and set you apart and gave you special stewardships and responsibilities and blessed you as you came to this world. He did so just as you probably were blessed by your father when you came to Brigham Young University, or went on a mission, or were about to pick a marriage partner. Do you see in the mirror one who kept his first estate when a third of your brothers and sisters were not sufficiently valiant to make that kind of choice? When's the last time you looked at yourself and saw that truth about yourself?<br><br>Do you see yourself as one foreordained to the holy priesthood? That's one of the most humbling, awesome insights the gospel gives me. I was foreordained to the priesthood that I hold. I was foreordained by God the Father. I think that I sat in a chair or a throne and that God the Father put his hands on my head, along with my Elder Brother Jesus Christ (and while I'm just supposing, I suppose that Father Adam and Joseph Smith--since I was born into his dispensation--and my earthly father, Raymond Woodbury, and perhaps a few other choice persons who were interested in me were also there), and conferred the priesthood upon me and foreordained me to the responsibilities that I have in this world today. The same is true of every person, male or female, seated here, I believe. I think that the doctrines of our restored church support that view.<br><br>When we look in the mirror we should see someone who is an heir in the house of Israel. I'm an Ephraimite. Do you know what it means to be an Ephraimite? Do you know that Ephraimites are different from Jacobites and Manassehites? Each of us has our own blessings and responsibilities, and I know what mine are. I know the special kinds of talents that I'm supposed to have as an Ephraimite--not all of them, because Brigham Young just happened to say a few things about some of them that we really can't comprehend. But I know what some of them are, and that knowledge inspires me. I'm a better man knowing that I am an heir in the house of Israel. And I know that I am because I've been told in my patriarchal blessing that I shall become a priest and a king and a god.<br><h2><b>You Can Work Miracles</b></h2><br>If someone addresses you, do you know that he is speaking to the Lord's anointed? I once sat in the Provo Tabernacle and heard a man from Hawaii tell a story that is deeply embedded in my mind. He may be the biggest liar in the world--I don't know. I just know that this is what he said. He said, "I own some land in Hawaii, and I have dedicated part of that land as tithing<i>--</i>the best tenth part. About fifteen years ago [and I know this is true], there was a huge tidal wave that originated up in Alaska, swept down through the Pacific Basin, and killed many people. I was in Hawaii working on my property at that time. I didn't think much about the weather; it was a nice day. Suddenly I heard my wife drive up behind me in our old rattletrap truck. She said, 'We must leave immediately.'<br><br>"I said, 'Why?'<br><br>"She said, 'I just heard over the radio that there's a huge tidal wave coming this way and we just have time to get away.' I looked out to the ocean, and sure enough, I could see it. I don't know how tall it really was. It looked as if it were three hundred feet tall--a wall of solid water coming right toward me with a tremendous roar."<br><br>Then he told me how he reacted. In the telling of what he did, he made me analyze what I would do, because this man knew who he was and what powers he could command. I wondered if that was the same conclusion I would have come to, or if I'd have seen myself as just another puny man of the twentieth century--about to be overcome by the population explosion and pollution and the decay of the government and all those other problems that preoccupy our conversation<i>--</i>and therefore I would have gotten in the truck and run away. That may not have been such a bad choice, except that this man knew who he was and what he was about. He said, "I don't know why I did this, but I said to my wife, 'Get in the truck and leave.'<br><br>"She said, 'No, no, you must come.'<br><br>"But I repeated, 'Get in the truck and leave.'<br><br>"She got in the truck and left. I went up and I stood on the tenth part that I had consecrated to the Lord. I don't know why. I really don't think that land is any more sacred than any other; I just felt better there. I stood on that particular piece of consecrated land, and I raised my hands forward and out at shoulder level."<br><br>I thought, "Why would he raise his hands like that? We don't do that in the Church." I wondered if maybe he'd recently seen Charlton Heston in<i>The Ten Commandments</i>. But apparently it made him feel better to raise his hands like that, and in every move and every choice he was making, he was revealing the kind of person he saw when he looked in the mirror. He said, "I raised my hands like this and said these words: 'In the name of Jesus Christ and by the power of the Holy Melchizedek Priesthood which I hold, I command these waters to part.' You can come right now and look at my property and see the destruction that happened here and the destruction that happened there, but my land was preserved." What interested me was that he knew who he was--uncreate intelligence, a potential father of gods who had kept his first estate and was living in the last days, an incipient priest and king. He was one who would eventually be endowed, not with the five small senses that you and I use now, but maybe with twenty senses, or thirty, or forty.<br><h2><b>You Can Increase Your Powers of Perception</b></h2><br>I once read a very provocative statement by Orson Pratt. By sharing it with you I hope to arouse you to a lively perception of who you are and who you will become if you keep the commandments. One of the best ways I know to keep the commandments is to know why and who you are, as well as where and how. Orson Pratt said:<br><br><i>Suppose He should give us a sixth sense, a seventh, an eighth, a ninth, or a fiftieth. All these different senses would convey to us new ideas, as much so as the senses of tasting, smelling, or seeing communicate different ideas from that of hearing.</i>[<i>Journal of Discourses</i>, 2:247]<br><br>Orson Pratt spoke of the ability to obtain and consider many different ideas at the same time instead of thinking in a single channel only and of following only one course of reasoning. Elder Pratt said:<br><br><i>Knowledge will rush in from all quarters; it will come in like the light which flows from the sun, penetrating every part, informing the Spirit, and giving understanding concerning ten thousand things at the same time; and the mind will be capable of receiving and retaining all. . . . Not one object at a time, but a vast multitude of objects rush before his vision</i>[the vision of a celestialized soul]<i>, and are present before his mind, filling him in a moment with the knowledge of worlds more numerous than the sands of the sea shore. Will he be able to bear it? Yes, his mind is strengthened in proportion to the amount of information imparted. It is this tabernacle, in its present condition, that prevents us from a more enlarged understanding.</i>[<i>Journal of Discourses</i>, 2:246]<br><br>Elder Pratt continued by explaining that celestial beings have the ability to perceive with all parts of their bodies:<br><br><i>The spirit</i>[like the eye]<i>is inherently capable of experiencing the sensations of light. . . . I think we could then see in different directions at once, instead of looking in one particular direction; we could then look all around us at the same instant.</i>[<i>Journal of Discourses</i>, 2:243]<br><br>When I first read this, I remembered I'd read something similar--Philo Dibble's statement that Joseph Smith told him, after receiving revelation, "My whole body was full of light and I could see even out at the ends of my fingers and toes" (cited by N. B. Lundwall, comp.,<i>The Vision</i>[Salt Lake City: Bookcraft Publishing Company, n.d.], p. 11). Then suddenly I knew why the angel Moroni had hovered in the air when he was visiting Joseph. He wanted to see where he was going. He could see out of his toes. That makes me think of the familiar promise in the Doctrine and Covenants, section 88: "And if your eye be single to my glory, your whole bodies shall be filled with light, and there shall be no darkness in you; and that body which is filled with light comprehendeth all things" (D&amp;amp;C 88:67).<br><br>Dean Clark guided me to a statement by Brigham Young, who said something similar:<br><br><i>I long for the time that a point of the finger, or motion of the hand, will express every idea without utterance. When a man is full of the light of eternity, then the eye is not the only medium through which he sees, . . . nor the brain the only means by which he understands. When the whole body is full of the Holy Ghost, he can see behind him with as much ease, without turning his head, as he can see before him. If you have not that experience, you ought to have. It is not the optic nerve alone that gives the knowledge of surrounding objects to the mind. . . . I shall yet see the time that I can converse with this people, and not speak to them. . . . We are at present low, weak, and grovelling in dark, but we are planted here in weakness for the purpose of exaltation.</i>[<i>Journal of Discourses</i>, 1:70–71]<br><br>Again, Parley P. Pratt, in his book<i>Key to the Science of Theology,</i>says that we will move from one place to another without a loss of time by willing ourselves to be there: "There is no apparent limit to the speed attainable by the body when unchained, set free from the elements which now enslave it, and dictated by the will" (5th ed. [Liverpool: John Henry Smith, 1883], p. 162).<br><br>Brigham Young, in another statement, said that we can move instantaneously to any point in time:<br><br><i>The brightness and glory of the next apartment is inexpressible. . . . They [our youth] move with ease and like lightning. If we want to visit Jerusalem, or this, that, or the other place . . . there we are. . . . If we want to behold Jerusalem as it was in the days of the Savior; or if we want to see the Garden of Eden as it was when created [and notice we're not only moving through space, we're moving through time], there we are, and we see it as it existed spiritually, for it was created first spiritually and then temporally, and spiritually it still remains. . . . We may behold the earth as at the dawn of creation, or we may visit any city we please that exists upon its surface.</i>[<i>Journal of Discourses</i>, 14:231]<br><h2><b>You Are Building for Eternity</b></h2><br>My brothers and sisters, fellow sons and daughters of the living God, that is how I perceive you. Now I see you as my brothers and sisters in a way I did not before. Can you see within yourselves our brotherhood? Can you see the divine person that you are? You are now in eternity. Now is eternity, though not beyond the veil, which is obviously a part of eternity. But eternity doesn't<i>begin</i>at the veil; it<i>continues</i>there. That distinction makes all the difference in the world. This earth today is a part of heaven. You're not<i>going</i>to heaven; you<i>are</i>in heaven.<i>Now!</i>Today is tomorrow. You are now housed in your eternal body. It's imperfect, that's true, but it's yours. Some of us say of our bodies, "I'd like to trade it in." But they will be perfected. That process isn't something that happens only when we move through the veil. By celestial marriage and parenthood,<i>you</i>--as God did before you--are<i>now</i>in the process of peopling worlds and creating eternal families of gods. Now, today! I have started that process. There are four spirits that live in my home. My hope for exaltation rests with those four spirits--not my only hope, but a large part of it. If I'm going to create gods, if I am a god, if I'm a descendant of God, heir to a race of gods, this heritage does not end when I come into this existence and begin again when I leave it; it is now.<br><br>My brothers and sisters, single your eye to his glory. If you do, your whole body shall be filled with light and there shall be no darkness in you. "And that body which is filled with light comprehendeth all things." I bear you my testimony that God lives. And that's why artists create. It isn't enough to say, "I bear you my testimony that God lives." Language is often inadequate. I would like to sing to you my testimony, or dance it for you, or paint it for you. I think that's why we<i>shout</i>it. A shout should be said loud. (Do you know that the Saints in the Kirtland period often began their meetings by offering the Hosanna Shout instead of singing a hymn? They shouted it aloud. They didn't whisper it.)<br><br>When I attended the dedication of the Provo Temple I felt we had lost something which I think our prophets tried to help us to recover when they said, in a recent issue of the<i>Ensign</i>, that we should say<i>amen</i>out loud. Do you remember reading that? Say<i>AMEN</i>; don't whisper "amen." There comes a time when you have to shout, you have to sing, you have to dance.<br><br>I know that God lives, that he at this moment is near, that he knows what's being said here, or else he could not know the content of all of the creations. And I know that he loves you. Brigham Young said, "Give up all your hearts to God, and become sanctified throughout, and be led by the Holy Ghost from morning until evening, and from one year's end to another" (<i>Journal of Discourses</i>, 2:134). By definition, you then are perfect if you will do that. "Be ye therefore perfect" (Matthew 5:48).<br><br>Here's how to be perfect: when you behave as well as you possibly can, according to your knowledge. God himself cannot be any more perfect than he knows how. According to President Young, "The sin that will cleave to all the posterity of Adam and Eve is, that they have not done as well as they knew how" (<i>Journal of Discourses</i>, 2:130). May we resolve from this hour to keep that covenant--the covenant that we have already made--to do as well as we know how. That we may know who we are, why we are, where we are, and what we are about is my humble prayer in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Lael J.

<h1>ivine Counsel - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
The modern scriptures have received my attention and time during the twenty-six years I've been on the faculty at Brigham Young University--and for some time before then, in fact. I include in this body of material the sermons and writings of the General Authorities of the Church, especially the prophets, seers, and revelators of our dispensation. My special emphasis of study and teaching has been the Doctrine and Covenants.<br><h2><b>The Gift to Believe in Christ</b></h2><br>Two references from the modern revelations provide the principle basis for my remarks this morning. From the Doctrine and Covenants, section 46, the revelation on the gifts of the Holy Ghost, we read:<br><br><i>To some it is given by the Holy Ghost to know that Jesus Christ is the Son of God, and that he was crucified for the sins of the world.</i><br><br><i>To others it is given to believe on their words, that they also might have eternal life if they continue faithful.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 46:13–14]<br><br>And from a revelation among the many which the Lord has given to Latter-day Saints that they might not be deceived, section 52, we have the following:<br><br><i>And let them journey from thence preaching the word by the way, saying none other things than that which the prophets and apostles have written, and that which is taught them by the Comforter through the prayer of faith....</i><br><br><i>And again, I will give unto you a pattern in all things, that ye may not be deceived; for Satan is abroad in the land, and he goeth forth deceiving the nations--</i><br><br><i>Wherefore he that prayeth, whose spirit is contrite, the same is accepted of me if he obey mine ordinances.</i><br><br><i>He that speaketh, whose spirit is contrite, whose language is meek and edifieth, the same is of God if he obey mine ordinances.</i><br><br><i>And again, he that trembleth under my power shall be made strong, and shall bring forth fruits of praise and wisdom, according to the revelations and truths which I have given you.</i><br><br><i>And again, he that is overcome and bringeth not forth fruits, even according to this pattern, is not of me.</i><br><br><i>Wherefore, by this pattern ye shall know the spirits in all cases under the whole heavens.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 52:9, 14–19]<br><br>I believe that in these verses one will find the foundation for a life of peace and joy. Specifically, the following ideas may be derived from what I have read: First, among the gifts to which Latter-day Saints are entitled, if we seek for them, are the gifts to know that Jesus Christ is our Savior and, lacking this positive knowledge or testimony, we should prepare for it by seeking for the gift to believe on the words of testators. Second, our teaching should be that which the prophets and apostles give and that which is taught by the Holy Ghost to us individually through the prayer of faith. Third, a pattern against being deceived by Satan or against false spirits is to obey the Lord's ordinances--that is, not only the ordinances of baptism, confirmation, and temple ordinances, but also, as understood anciently, the other decrees of God, such as rules, regulations, and instructions.<br><h2><b>Spiritually Dead</b></h2><br>"To believe" are two words which, if really applied in one's quest for knowledge, may make the difference between being a faithful, devout Latter-day Saint or just a member of the Church. The latter point, I believe, was mentioned by President Spencer W. Kimball in a general conference in answer to the question "What is 'being valiant'?"<br><br><i>There are many in this Church today who think they live but are dead to the spiritual things. And I believe that many who are making the pretenses of being active are also spiritually dead. Their service is much of the letter and less of the spirit</i>. [<i>Conference Report</i>, April 1951, pp. 104–5]<br><br>President Harold B. Lee expressed the idea this way:<br><br><i>Conversion must mean more than just being a "card-carrying" member of the Church with a tithing receipt, a membership card, a temple recommend, etc. It means to overcome the tendencies to criticize and to strive continually to improve inward weaknesses and not merely the outward appearances.</i>[<i>Conference Report</i>, April 1971, p. 92]<br><br>The prophet Joseph Smith made a similar observation about the Church at a certain period during his lifetime:<br><br><i>It is made up of all those different sects professing every variety of opinion, and having been under the influence of so many kinds of spirits, it is not to be wondered at if there should be found among us false spirits.</i>[<i>Documentary History of the Church</i>, 4:580]<br><br>This condition in the early history of the Church brought forth these words from Elder George A. Smith, member of the Council of the Twelve and Church Historian:<br><br><i>There was a prevalent spirit all through the early history of the Church which prompted the elders to suppose that they knew more than the Prophet. Elders would tell you the Prophet was going wrong. Men who thought they knew all about this work, some of them thirty or forty years before the Lord revealed it, tried to "steady the ark." The Church was constantly afflicted with such a class of men.</i>[Hyrum M. Smith and Janne M. Sjodahl,<i>The Doctrine and Covenants Commentary</i>, 2nd ed. Rev. (Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Co., p. 290]<br><br>I presume that today there are more subtle means being used by some--not perhaps the direct way of telling the prophet that he is wrong, but accomplishing the same purpose in trying to "steady the ark" by refusing to believe what the Lord reveals today through his prophets. The casting of doubt, and even unbelief, on the scriptures and the fact that revelation is received by the leadership of the Church today is a common way of attempting to "steady the ark." President J. Reuben Clark, Jr., counselor to three Presidents of the Church, pled in several priesthood sessions of general conference that all Latter-day Saints might accept this counsel from the Lord: "I say unto you, be one; and if ye are not one ye are not mine" (D&amp;amp;C 38:27).<br><h2><b>A Zion People</b></h2><br>I have often reflected upon the concept of Zion practiced in ancient days, revealed anew in our dispensation and prophesied yet to be the Lord's divine program for this dispensation. In fact, if it is not realized by us, then the purposes of this last and greatest dispensation will be thwarted.<br><br>In earlier dispensations, the sacred historian recorded that these Zion people were the most blessed of all the peoples of the earth. Why? "Because they were of one heart and one mind, and dwelt in righteousness" (Moses 7:18). How might we become of one mind and one heart? Would not the scriptural admonition cited in the Doctrine and Covenants help us to achieve the Lord's ideal for us? Acquire the gift to believe the words of the prophet. Make sure that your believing heart is coupled with a positive knowledge of the divinity of this latter-day work. In harmony with these truths, we would accept this counsel from the published statement of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles in 1839:<br><br><i>Be careful that you teach not for the word of God the commandments of men, nor the doctrines of men, nor the ordinances of men, inasmuch as you are God's messengers. Study the word of God, and preach it and not your opinions, for no man's opinion is worth a straw. Advance no principle but what you can prove, for one scriptural proof is worth ten thousand opinions.</i>[<i>Documentary History of the Church</i>, 3:395–96]<br><br>And if we have prepared ourselves by believing the prophets and apostles, I believe we shall be directed by the Holy Ghost.<br><br>The Twelve Apostles of 1839 continued:<br><br><i>And if you unitedly seek after unity of purpose and design; if you are men of humility and faithfulness, of integrity and perseverance; if you submit yourselves to the teachings of heaven and are guided by the Spirit of God; if you at all times seek the glory of God and the salvation of men, and lay your honor prostrate in the dust, if need be, and are willing to fulfill the purposes of God in all things, the power of the priesthood will rest upon you, and you will become mighty in testimony.</i>[<i>Documentary History of the Church</i>, 3:397]<br><br>In my teaching of the gospel of Jesus Christ, I have accepted this fundamental truth: what we know about God and our relationship to him come from what God has revealed, the standard works of the Church, and the teachings of the living prophets. I believe that if we could follow, without reservation, this principle, we of this dispensation could also become of "one heart and of one mind." We would<i>be one</i>, and in that oneness we would be the Lord's.<br><br>It is as true today as in 1831, when the Lord said, "And he that will not take up his cross and follow me, and keep my commandments, the same shall not be saved" (D&amp;amp;C 56:2). That is an interesting and meaningful phrase, "to take up one's cross." I wonder if taking up one's cross might mean to sacrifice whatever is necessary to be a true member of Christ's church, to accept<i>full membership</i>in the kingdom of God, to be a loyal, willing subject--that is, to put the kingdom of God first above all other considerations.<br><br>The men and women who have lived as honored, faithful, and revered Latter-day Saints in the history of the Church are those who have contributed to the building of the kingdom of God and the eventual establishment of Zion. Because they have been one with the Brethren, they have been accepted of the Lord. We know that these Saints have exercised their free agency in a manner that brought great blessings to themselves. They have believed that loyalty to the living prophets is of great necessity in demonstrating their faith in God although it requires setting aside personal feelings, ideas, and even comforts. In fact, the Prophet Joseph Smith said:<br><br><i>The sacrifice required of Abraham in the offering up of Isaac, shows that if a man would attain to the keys of the kingdom of an endless life, he must sacrifice all things. When God offers a blessing or knowledge to a man, and he refuses to receive it, he will be damned.</i>[Joseph Smith,<i>Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith</i>, comp. Joseph Fielding Smith (Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Co., 1938), p. 322]<br><br>Later in this dispensation, President George Q. Cannon said:<br><br><i>I say to you this day in the presence of God and the holy angels of this assembly, if we expect to attain the fulfillment of the promises God has made to us, we must be self-sacrificing. There is no sacrifice that God can ask of us or his servants whom he has chosen to lead us that we should hesitate about making. In one sense of the word, it is not sacrifice. We may call it so because it comes in contact with our selfishness and our unbelief, but it ought not to come in contact with our faith.</i>[<i>Conference Report</i>, April 1899, p. 65]<br><h2><b>Accepting the Lord's Servants</b></h2><br>These honored Saints about whom I have spoken believed these words in a modern revelation:<br><br><i>And if my people will hearken unto my voice, and unto the voice of my servants whom I have appointed to lead my people, behold, verily I say unto you, they shall not be moved out of their place.</i><br><br><i>But if they will not hearken to my voice, nor unto the voice of these men whom I have appointed, they shall not be blest, because they pollute mine holy grounds, and mine holy ordinances, and charters, and my holy words which I give unto them.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 124:45–46]<br><br>I am convinced that salvation in this world and the world to come is contingent upon how well we accept the Lord's servants--not give lip service, but genuinely accept their counsel and teachings. After all, the attainment of salvation in God's kingdom fulfills the purpose of life, and this blessing, according to the Book of Mormon prophet King Benjamin, is dependent upon "retaining a remission of your sins" (Mosiah 4:26), which is received in baptism, and then walking guiltless before God.<br><br>Consider this scripture from the Doctrine and Covenants regarding how one may have his sins pardoned: "Behold, thus saith the Lord unto my people--you have many things to do and to repent of; for behold, your sins have come up unto me, and are not pardoned, because you seek to counsel in your own ways" (D&amp;amp;C 56:14).<br><br>When a member of the Church refuses to accept the counsel of the prophets, seers, and revelators, he lays the foundation for insecurity. The members of the First Presidency, the Council of the Twelve, and the Patriarch to the Church are the prophets, seers, and revelators. These Brethren have a special spiritual endowment above all other members of the Church. As President J. Reuben Clark, Jr., said:<br><br><i>They possess a special gift; they are sustained as prophets, seers, and revelators, which gives them a special spiritual endowment in connection with their teaching of the people. They have the right, the power, and authority to declare the mind and will of God to his people, subject to the overall power and authority of the President of the Church. Others of the General Authorities are not given this special spiritual endowment and authority covering their teaching; they have a resulting limitation, and the resulting limitation upon their power and authority in teaching applies to every other officer and member of the Church, for none of them is spiritually endowed as a prophet, seer, and revelator. Furthermore ... the President of the Church has a further and special spiritual endowment in this respect, for he is</i>the<i>prophet, seer, and revelator of the whole church.</i>[Quoted in Roy W. Doxey,<i>The Latter-day Prophets and the Doctrine and Covenants</i>(Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Co., 1963), 1:ix–x]<br><br>In refusing to receive the teachings of the Brethren, we're expressing contrary ideas, or, in my opinion, false teachings. President Joseph F. Smith categorized Latter-day Saints who are guilty of false teaching as the following:<br><br><i>First--The hopelessly ignorant, whose lack of intelligence is due to their indolence and sloth, who make but feeble effort, if indeed any at all, to better themselves by reading and study; those who are afflicted with a dread disease that may develop into in incurable malady--laziness.</i><br><br><i>Second--The proud and self-vaunting ones, who read by the lamp of their own conceit; who interpret by rules of their own contriving; who have become a law unto themselves, and so pose as the sole judges of their own doings. More dangerously ignorant than the first.</i><br><br><i>Beware of the lazy and the proud; their infection in each case is contagious; better for them and for all when they are compelled to display the yellow flag of warning, that the clean and uninfected may be protected.</i>[<i>Gospel Doctrine</i>(Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Co., 1971), p. 373]<br><br>Do not find yourselves in either one of these classes. Yours is the opportunity at Brigham Young University to study the gospel, to grow in faith and testimony. You have the opportunity to set a life pattern of study that will continue after you leave this institution. I have learned that by and large the informed Latter-day Saint, the student of the gospel, accepts the teachings of the Lord's anointed and conforms his life to gospel standards.<br><br>If you have a tendency to be aligned in the second class, the proud and self-vaunting who become a law unto themselves in picking and choosing the teachings of the Brethren which they believe compare to their own ideas of truth, then remember that the purpose for which you are here in life will be thwarted. President J. Reuben Clark, Jr., said:<br><br><i>But I had thought I might give you just a little different turn to that great sermon on the unity in the Church of Christ. I thought I might point out that our gospel comes in one package. We may not choose a particular thing that we like and ignore everything else, nor submerge nor subdue it. ... We may not, I repeat, say to ourselves, nor to one another, that this is the important thing or that is the important thing, the others being nonessential or unessential. We have no right to draw distinctions and differences among the commandments of God.</i><br><br><i>The Lord has given us nothing that is useless or unnecessary. He has filled the scriptures with the things we should do in order that we may gain salvation.</i><br><br><i>When we partake of the sacrament we covenant to obey and keep his commandments. There are no exceptions. There are no distinctions, do differences.</i><br><br><i>And so I have thought that I might urge as a part of the unity concerning which I have taken the liberty always to speak in this meeting of the Priesthood</i>[the general conference priesthood meeting],<i>as a part of this unity we should try to be united in the matter of Gospel doctrines and practices, each and all of us trying so to serve the Lord that we might meet and satisfy the covenant which we make when we eat the bread and drink the water in remembrance of his body and of his blood.</i><br><br><i>I do not think that this is a slight matter. There are groups, not many but some, who take this road to the left and call it the most important, another takes the road to the right with the same plea, another emphasizes this point, another that point, belittling some other points, and declaring that certain things are of the essence, and other things may be ignored. I do not read anywhere that the Lord has given to us, individually, the right to say which is most important. We should seek to keep all of the commandments. I repeat, speaking in the language of today, the gospel is one package.</i><br><br><i>I hope and pray the Lord will give us that unity along with all the other unities about which we know. I repeat what I have said so often here, that we being truly united, there is nothing that the Lord wants to be done that will fail of doing if we set our hands and our hearts thereto. And I pray again that we may see the necessity of accepting the gospel and all of it, that we may be saved and exalted in his presence.</i>[<i>Conference Report</i>, April 1955, pp. 10–11]<br><br>Eventual sorrow and regret owing to the loss of exaltation will be the condemnation of those who, having begun life's journey, finish short of their potential because of a love of the things of this world--false education, false theories of life--in fact, all ideas and teachings that are contrary to the gospel of Jesus Christ. I've always appreciated the following key to truth given by President Joseph Fielding Smith because it is the letter and the spirit of the gospel:<br><br><i>If members of the Church would place more confidence in the word of the Lord, and less confidence in the theories of men, they would be better off. I will give you a</i>key for your guidance: any doctrine, whether it comes in the name of religion, science, philosophy, or whatever it may be, that is in conflict with the revelations of the Lord that have been accepted by the Church as coming from the Lord will fail.<i>It may appear to be very plausible; it may be put before you in such a way that you cannot answer it, it may appear to be established by evidence that cannot be controverted, but all you need to do is bide your time. Time will level all things.</i>You will find that every doctrine, theory, principle, no matter how great it may appear; no matter how universally it may be believed, if it is not in accord with the word of the Lord, it will perish.<i>Nor is it necessary for us to try to stretch the word of the Lord to make it conform to these theories and teachings. The word of the Lord shall not pass away unfulfilled. I realize that we are all weak, and at times may place false interpretations upon the written word, but the revelations are so clear regarding Adam, the fall, the atonement, the resurrection, the redemption of the earth when it shall again be proclaimed "good," and so many other things which fall under the ban of present-day teaching that we need not be led astray. The theories of men change from day to day. Much that is taught now will tomorrow be in the discard, but</i>the word of the Lord will endure forever<i>.</i>[Quoted in Roy W. Doxey,<i>The Doctrine and Covenants Speaks</i>(Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Co., 1964), 1:370–71]<br><h2><b>Receiving Blessings Through Obedience</b></h2><br>How would you like to receive the blessings promised Lyman Sherman, one of the first seven presidents of the seventy, given in a revelation to Joseph Smith? Notice, as I read these verses, that he is granted forgiveness of his sins by keeping his vows or covenants, including obedience to the counsel of the Prophet:<br><br><i>Verily thus saith the Lord unto you, my servant Lyman: Your sins are forgiven you, because you have obeyed my voice in coming up hither this morning to receive counsel of him whom I have appointed.</i><br><br><i>Therefore, let your soul be at rest concerning your spiritual standing, and resist no more my voice.</i><br><br><i>And arise up and be more careful henceforth in observing your vows, which you have made and do make, and you shall be blessed with exceeding great blessings.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 108:1–3]<br><br>How may one receive these blessings? By not resisting the Lord's voice. Recall the verses from a revelation about abiding by the teachings of the Lord's servants: "And if my people will hearken unto my voice, and unto the voice of my servants whom I have appointed to lead my people, behold, verily I say unto you; they shall not be moved out of their place" (D&amp;amp;C 124:45).<br><br>Lyman Sherman was told of four ways he could strengthen the brethren. He was given counsel which is applicable to all Latter-day Saints in all periods of time: "Therefore, strengthen your brethren in all your conversation, in all your prayers, in all your exhortations, and in all your doings" (D&amp;amp;C 108:7). If these instructions are followed, it would mean that in our conversation, teaching, preaching, and prayers we would increase our right to the Spirit of the Lord and keep our covenants by increasing our leaders' usefulness and thereby contributing to the onward march of the kingdom of God. But we must be a<i>believing people</i>. We must have<i>belief</i>in the truth that God has spoken from the heavens and endowed his servants with the power to speak for him as though he were speaking, as expressed in this revelation:<br><br><i>For he that receiveth my servants receiveth me;</i><br><br><i>And he that receiveth me receiveth my Father;</i><br><br><i>And he that receiveth my Father receiveth my Father's kingdom; therefore all that my Father hath shall be given unto him.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 84:36–38]<br><br><i>Believe</i>that his revelations in the standard words of the Church contain the sure way to peace and happiness here and forever.<i>Believe</i>that the living prophet, President Spencer W. Kimball, is the most important prophet to us because it is he who leads the way to solving the problems of the day for us individually and as a group. The prophet Joseph Smith received the following revelation in answer to the prayers of the Saints about world conditions:<br><br><i>I tell you these things because of your prayers; wherefore, treasure up wisdom in your bosoms, lest the wickedness of men reveal these things unto you by their wickedness, in a manner which shall speak in your ears with a voice louder than that which shall shake the earth; but if ye are prepared ye shall not fear.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 38:30]<br><br>Where may I receive this help? Do as the Prophet Joseph Smith said: "Look to the First Presidency and receive instructions" (<i>Documentary History of the Church</i>, 3:391). If the Latter-day Saint does not listen to the prophet, he may not be aware of the answer to his own prayers.<br><h2><b>Studying and Following the Counsel of the Brethren</b></h2><br>For twenty-five years I have sat in every session of every general conference of the Church and listened to the prophets. I commend it to you. If you cannot be at the conference, listen by radio or television or read the proceedings of the general conferences in the Church publications. Absorb the inspiration available in these proceedings. Enjoy the experience of having the Holy Spirit bear witness to what is being said. Assimilate the truths spoken so well that they become part of your daily life and increase your believing capacity.<br><br>President Harold B. Lee, in the last general conference he addressed, said:<br><br><i>Now, you Latter-day Saints, I think you have never attended a conference wherein these three days you have heard more inspired declarations on most every subject and problem about which you have been worrying. If you want to know what the Lord would have the Saints know and to have his guidance and direction for the next six months, get a copy of the proceedings of this conference, and you will have the latest word of the Lord as far as the Saints are concerned. And</i>[also]<i>all others who are not of us, but who believe what has been said has been the mind of the Lord, the will of the Lord, the voice of the Lord, and the power of God unto salvation.</i>(See D&amp;amp;C 68:4.) ...<br><br><i>Where else can you go for guidance? Where is there safety in the world today? Safety can't be won by tanks and guns and airplanes and atomic bombs. There is only one place of safety, and that is within the realm of the power of Almighty God that he gives to those who keep his commandments and listen to his voice as he speaks through the channels that he has ordained for that purpose.</i>[<i>Conference Report</i>, October 1973, pp. 168–69]<br><br>To be a believing person in the gospel sense is to have singleness of purpose. To live so well in observing covenants received that nothing--neither pride of learning, the love of money, pleasures contrary to commandments, nor resistance to the counsel of those who preside over us--will prevent us from receiving eventual exaltation in the kingdom of God. The Lord's promise to those who accept his truth is expressed in these words from the Olive Leaf revelation in the Doctrine and Covenants:<br><br><i>And if your eye be single to my glory, your whole bodies shall be filled with light, and there shall be no darkness in you; and that body which is filled with light comprehendeth all things.</i><br><br><i>Therefore, sanctify yourselves that your minds become single to God, and the days will come that you shall see him; for he will unveil his face unto you, and it shall be in his own time, and in his own way, and according to his own will.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 88:67–68]<br><br>Revelation to the Lord's servants has been known throughout the dispensations. In many ways they have been inspired in the selection of officers in the Church, in prophecy, in the solution of problems. When it was necessary for President Joseph F. Smith to select counselors in the First Presidency, it was not difficult for him to select Anthon H. Lund as one counselor, but he was not able to determine who the other counselor should be, so he prayed for guidance. On the morning he was to meet with the Quorum of the Twelve to announce his selection, he received an audible revelation. He heard plainly the words "Choose John R. Winder as your first counselor." The voice was heard again stating the same command. Brother Winder, though a member of the Presiding Bishopric, had never been considered by President Smith until he heard the voice that morning. President Heber J. Grant had a similar revelation when he had the first opportunity to appoint an apostle. He related on several occasions how he had made up his mind to choose a close friend, but the word of the Lord came to him to appoint a comparative stranger, Elder Melvin J. Ballard.<br><br>Students, make it a part of your experience at BYU to acquire believing hearts and minds. Always keep in mind the purpose for which you are here in life as revealed in the scriptures. Reflect upon it often. Never lose sight of the need to look to the Presidency and receive instruction. I believe that we should also follow faithfully the counsel of those who preside over us in the branches or wards of the Church. I should like to challenge you to measure your acceptance of counsel from the following experience related by President Marion G. Romney in a general conference of the Church just two years ago:<br><br><i>I was greatly impressed by the President's</i>[President Joseph Fielding Smith's]<i>remarks. I am glad he said what he did. Listening to him, I was taken back in my thoughts a quarter of a century ago to an experience I had with President Heber J. Grant. We were discussing some criticism that had been directed against an action taken by him in his official capacity. Putting his arm across my back and resting his hand on my left shoulder he said, "My boy, you always keep your eye on the President of the Church, and if he tells you to do something wrong, and you do it, the Lord will bless you for it."</i><br><br><i>And then he added, "You don't need to worry, however; the Lord will never let his mouthpiece lead his people astray."</i><br><br><i>I haven't forgotten his counsel. I think I have been faithful to that charge ever since.</i>[<i>Conference Report</i>, April 1972, p. 111]<br><br>With half a century's experience of being a priesthood bearer and of serving on the Lord's errand much of that time, I testify to the strength and power that comes to one who accepts counsel. There has been borne to my soul the witness that to be a believing Latter-day Saint is the way of happiness and joy, peace and solemnity of spirit. There is nothing in this world that can equal full membership in the kingdom of God. I know that the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is divine, that Joseph Smith is a prophet, that President Spencer W. Kimball is the Lord's anointed today, that Jesus Christ is our Savior and Redeemer, and that God lives. I bear witness to these things in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Roy W. Doxey was serving as a Regional Representative of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when this devotional address was given at Brigham Young University on 30 July 1974.</i></i><br><br><i>© Intellectual Reserve, Inc.

<h1>ot to Have a Dream - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
My dear fellow students, I feel that I can call you fellow students because we teach that the glory of God is intelligence and that we should be students throughout all eternity. I am happy to be here with you this evening and I commend you for attending such an outstanding educational institution. I am sure we will all agree that it is one of the greatest in the world.<br><br>The music tonight certainly has contributed greatly to the spirituality of this occasion. The Lord said that "the song of the righteous is a prayer unto me, and it shall be answered with a blessing upon their heads" (D&amp;amp;C 25:12). I'm sure that has been the case here tonight.<br><br>I have written a talk to give you tonight. I've been a General Authority now for nearly fourteen years, and the first eight or ten years of my tenure as a General Authority were under the direction of President McKay. In one of our temple meetings during that time, President McKay suggested that from that time on he would like the General Authorities of the Church speaking at each general conference to write their talks down so that the talks could be translated ahead of time and broadcast over the air in many different languages simultaneously with their delivery. Up to that time the Brethren had been extemporaneously delivering their messages at conference.<br><br>After President McKay's request, some of the Brethren felt that they would prefer to be guided by the Spirit at the moment they were delivering their talks. I can see President McKay turning to President Brown and saying to him, "President Brown, will you explain our views on this matter?"<br><br>President Brown got up and said, "Brethren, we feel that the Spirit can direct you two weeks ahead or a month ahead or two months ahead just as well or maybe better than at the moment that you're talking."<br><br>As I was looking out over this great audience at what we call a fireside (I know there must be a fire somewhere close because of the heat), I couldn't help but think of another fireside that Sister Richards and I attended in Tokyo about two years ago. The president of the stake had asked us if we would speak at a fireside Sunday night. We said yes and went over there. I had thought there might be fifty or a hundred people present, but actually there were more than nine hundred attending that fireside. (This fireside tonight, of course, is much larger than that.)<br><br>I pray that the Spirit of the Lord will direct me in the things that I say to you this night and that in turn your hearts and minds might likewise be in tune with the Spirit. Let me start out by saying that you are a choice young people. You are blessed with the blood of Israel. You are blessed with the gospel of Jesus Christ, and, in my judgment, the Lord has a special mission for each one of you.<br><br>A wise man has said, "If you fail to prepare, you prepare to fail." We must prepare ourselves to succeed. Frequently we hear that the nation is at the crossroads of advancement or fall, and I think this statement could very well be a correct analysis of the present situation. Many have twisted moral values to suit themselves, scoffed at integrity, and become victims of feverish tension, lacking the one value they want most--inner peace. It seems to me that we should seek the success of the inner man now that our affluent society has furbished the outer man so extensively. We should search for paths to family harmony, more and better relatedness to God and to our fellowmen, and inner peace instead of inner tension.<br><h2><b>Aspiration for Service and Achievement</b></h2><br>Young people, I feel, want, and need a challenge--a great cause, an opportunity for expression. The Church furnishes these. Of course, we all have our free agency, as the writer of one of our favorite hymns so ably expressed:<br><br><i>Know this, that every soul is free</i><br><i>To choose his life and what he'll be,</i><br><i>For this eternal truth is given</i><br><i>That God will force no man to heav'n.</i><br><br>Each of us has the opportunity, and may I say responsibility, of deciding what we will do and what we will be. A line from the musical<i>South Pacific</i>says, "You've got to have a dream. If you don't have a dream, how you going to have a dream come true?" How true this is. It is well for us to remind ourselves periodically that every human being is divinely endowed with talents, with dignity, and with worth. This faith--with its corollary that in order to grow people must dream and work--shapes the interests and aspirations of almost every person.<br><br>An unknown author describes an incident on a London street with its outdoor bookstalls. It was late on a summer afternoon, and a misty rain was beginning to fall. The booksellers were putting coverings over their stock. As a passerby stood at a bookstall that afternoon, he noticed another man searching with unusual concentration throughout a mass of books. Anyone who is a reader is interested in someone else's interests. They fell into conversation. The stranger stated that he was always looking for a new book about some far away Shangri-la. It was with him something more than a mood of escape. It was a pursuit of an ideal. Some such mood comes to almost everyone sometimes. It is a deep restlessness. It may become almost a compulsion. This human trait is undoubtedly due to our power of imagination and our capacity for dreaming and envisioning something better ahead. Human progress without this imaginative gift is unthinkable. We are constituted for receiving ideas just as radio sets are equipped for receiving music from the air. Some sets with more sensitive response pick up the finer shortwaves that are lost to other sets.<br><br>Most of us dream and have aspirations. They are very laudable things to have to spur us on to greater achievements. Let me cite some outstanding examples to illustrate my point. Thomas A. Edison and Henry Ford both had burning desires to serve their fellowmen. They held fast to the belief that there were better ways to provide artificial light and transportation, and it was their dream to find them. Edison dreamed of serving mankind by developing a lamp that could be operated by electricity. Despite hundreds of failures before he perfected the incandescent electric light bulb, he persisted until he made it a physical reality. Henry Ford, poor and uneducated, dreamed of developing a horseless carriage at a price the average person could afford. He went to work with what tools he had, without waiting for opportunity to favor him, and served mankind well by providing good transportation for the average American. Again, these men were practical dreamers who had great desires to serve. They never quit until they made their dreams come true.<br><br>Prior to his martyrdom, the Prophet Joseph Smith envisioned taking the Saints to the western mountains, where, he stated, "We could have a government of our own, get up into the mountains where the devil cannot dig us out, and live in a healthful climate." The great western trek was a dream of the Prophet Joseph Smith, but the opportunity to make this dream come true fell upon his successor, Brigham Young. "The Word and Will of the Lord" (D&amp;amp;C 136:1) regarding this great migration was given through President Young and is contained in section 136 of the Doctrine and Covenants. Brigham Young then called upon the Saints to "shake themselves like mighty men."<br><br>The trip from Winter Quarters to the Salt Lake Valley took months filled with the most difficult experiences. En route, Jim Bridger, scout and frontiersman, met Brigham Young on the Wyoming wastes and advised him not to stop in Salt Lake Valley because nothing could be raised there. It is said that Bridger offered a thousand dollars for the first ear of corn grown in the valley. But Brigham Young and his loyal band of pioneers pressed on. The ox teams made straight for the Salt Lake Valley. Their prophetic leader pitched camp on the east bench of the valley and said, in words later to gain fame, "This is the place." The aspirations, dreams, and plans of the prophets Joseph Smith and Brigham Young to bring the Saints to the Rocky Mountains matured through faith, prayer, sacrifice, and hard work. This is the way your aspirations, dreams, and plans will likewise become realities.<br><br>Nathan W. Tanner, father of President N. Eldon Tanner, once remarked, "If you want your dreams to come true, you must wake up and go to work." I appreciate the great power of faith. We know that faith without works is dead. Reflecting upon our pioneer history gives us a great appreciation of our wonderful heritage. I assume that a substantial number of you are interested in developing leadership qualities. This is a very worthy ambition, providing you have a real desire to serve and are willing to pay the price. To those of you who would like to further develop leadership qualities, let me suggest that you recognize two fundamental facts that will be helpful in accomplishing your objectives: first, always remember that you are a spirit child of God and are endowed with dignity, worth, and special talents; second, commit yourself to be a leader. Set goals and be willing to pay the price of reaching them.<br><h2><b>The Worth of Souls</b></h2><br>Now, let me examine with you some specific matters with reference to the two suggestions I just mentioned. First, always remember that you are a spirit child of God and are endowed with dignity, worth, and special talents. The doctrine that we are actually spirit children of God clearly defines our possibilities and should give each of us a real sense of dignity and worth. In modern revelation we are told that "the spirit and the body are the soul of man" (D&amp;amp;C 88:15) and that "to every man is given a gift by the Spirit of God" (D&amp;amp;C 46:11). Being spirit children of God, we have been asked by our Savior to become perfect, even as our Father which is in heaven is perfect. We know that, as man is, God once was, and as God is, man may become by obedience to the laws and ordinances of the gospel. How then do we develop godlike qualities?<br><br>Today it is so common to hear people say, "What do I get out of it?" The law of survival is so ingrained in us that we frequently overlook the welfare of others. The Savior continually emphasized the doctrine of unselfishness: "And whosoever will be chief among you, let him be your servant" (Matthew 20:27), he said. He illustrated his point in the beautiful story of the good Samaritan. The entire gospel of Jesus Christ consists of unselfishness and sacrifice for a great cause. Joseph Smith said, "A religion that does not require the sacrifice of all things never has power sufficient to produce the faith necessary unto life and salvation. . . . It was through this sacrifice, and this only, that God has ordained that men should enjoy eternal life" (<i>Lectures on Faith</i>).<br><h2><b>The Blessings of the Temple</b></h2><br>I recently received a copy of a story written about a good friend of mine, Donald W. Cummings, former president of the first Australia state, concerning sacrifice bringing forth the blessings of heaven. Let me relate a portion of it.<br><br><i>What sacrifices would you be willing to make to go to the temple? Would you jeopardize your home, give up your job, sell your car? These thoughts nagged at the mind of the twenty-six-year-old district president as he weighed all that would be required of him and his family if he accepted the mission president's challenge to attend the house of the Lord. It was in 1958, and the New Zealand Temple dedication was just four months away. He sat pondering the difficulties he would have to face if he accepted this invitation, sweltering in the heat of the Australian summer; for it was January down under, and he lived in the city of Perth on the edge of the Indian Ocean.</i><br><br><i>The young man, President Donald W. Cummings, had joined the Church just ten years earlier and could remember well the small group of Saints who used to worship together. Now, of course, the district had two vigorous congregations, big healthy branches, and he was their spiritual leader. It was proper that he should attend the temple dedication regardless of the vast distance, for New Zealand was over four thousand miles away.</i><br><br><i>The mission president's challenge kept ringing in his ears: "If you have a righteous goal and pray about it, the Lord will help you achieve it." President Cummings reviewed his finances. He was struggling to purchase a home for his growing family. He earned only a modest salary. He had no money in the bank. He drove an old car. The price of going to New Zealand was six hundred pounds, or twelve hundred United States dollars at the time. He set his jaw and picked up the paper, looking in the classified section for loans. His eye caught an advertisement for loans on furniture. He stared out the window at his well-worn family car, pondered a little longer, and then made the decision. The company lending money against furniture was trying a new idea which they were soon to stop, but not before he was granted their final loan. He sold the old car and started walking and riding buses and even hitchhiking. He was to walk and ride buses for the next eighteen months and, in all of that time, never missed his rotated visits to the branches each week. He recalls, "Yes, it was hard getting around, but my wife and I remember this as one of the happiest periods of our lives." He had discovered the joys of sacrifice for the Lord. "We appreciated walking all the more."</i><br><br><i>Even in selling the car and mortgaging both house and furniture, he was still two hundred dollars short, with no other funds in sight and just several weeks to go. President and Sister Cummings were becoming discouraged when a call from the mission president two thousand miles away in Melbourne gave them fresh courage for the final push: "Keep trying. You'll make it."</i><br><br><i>Determined, they finalized their plans. There would be no turning back. President Cummings had to serve notice on his company that he would be quitting, for they would not hold his job for this six weeks' trip. With less than a week to go and still two hundred dollars shy, a relative who was not a member of the Church met him on the street and, after chatting about the intended trip, surprised him with a gift of a hundred dollars. With one day left, still another nonmember relative, having driven in from the country, pressed the final hundred dollars into his hand. Brother and Sister Cummings knew both gifts had been inspired.</i><br><br><i>"The Lord had intervened and he had touched the hearts of those closest to us. We were now on our way," they recall. This was to be an eight-thousand-mile round trip which started with a two-thousand-mile train trip across the width of the Australian outback. They changed trains five times and took 4 1/2 days to accomplish the journey. When the family finally arrived in Sidney, they delightedly met for the first time with other Saints who had also arranged for passage on a boat bound for Auckland. To their wrenching disappointment, however, they discovered the boat had recently been damaged in hitting the wharf. It required lengthy repairs and would now leave too late to get them to New Zealand on time.</i><br><br><i>They were billeted with Church members in Sidney while desperate arrangements were tried. They might still make the dedication if an airplane could be chartered. Remarkably this was done without excess cost. They all flew to the dedication and witnessed this sacred event as President David O. McKay presided and prayed. President Cummings was honored as a speaker in the spacious auditorium of the new Church college adjacent to the temple. After all their sacrifice, the Cummings family was gratified to attend the first day of endowments in the New Zealand Temple and was also the very first group to do work for the dead.</i><br><br><i>They were to have been placed in tents because their funds were so meager, but, again at the last minute, arrangements were made for hotel accommodations. Though the cost was doubled, it was agreed that they could pay later, though they never were to be billed and they never were able to discover whom to pay.</i><br><br><i>Too poor to tour, they rejoiced in working in the temple for several weeks. Then, filled with the spirit of their new blessings and accomplishments, they traveled home ten days by boat and train with merely ten dollars left--no job, no car, and a mortgaged home and furniture. But they were rich in rewards only a temple can provide--family sealing for all time and eternity.</i><br><br><i>President Cummings went back to his old employer to see about work. To his astonishment, he was hired with both an increase in pay and a new title–sales manager. But though he started work immediately, he would not get paid until the end of the week. Now the money had run out completely. There was nothing to eat. Again, one of his wife's country relatives paid a surprise visit and dropped off enough fresh garden produce to carry them until payday. When Elder Thomas S. Monson organized the Perth stake in 1968, Donald W. Cummings was its first stake president. He had seen the kingdom of God swell from a small handful to a big thriving stake, but he never forgot the promise of his mission president:</i>"If you have a righteous goal and pray about it, the Lord will help you achieve it." [See Richard J. Marshall, "Saga of Sacrifice,"<i>Ensign</i>4 (August 1974): 66–67]<br><br>Is the spirit of unselfishness and sacrifice motivating your activity? Is this the spirit that prompts you when you're asked to be a missionary, when you are paying your tithing, or when you are about to choose between attending priesthood or Relief Society meetings and going skiing or boating? Is this the spirit of sacrifice and unselfishness with you as you make your innumerable decisions every day? If so, you are developing god-like qualities. There is no genuine success or happiness in being self-centered and selfish.<br><h2><b>Commitment to Achieve Established Goals</b></h2><br>Now I should like to refer to the second point in developing leadership qualities--namely, commit yourself to be a leader, set goals, and be willing to pay the price. Each of us might well adopt the theme "Today's preparation means tomorrow's success." Certainly you must have that in mind in attending this great educational institution, and so each of us has the opportunity and responsibility of deciding what we will do and what we will be.<br><br>Goals and objectives in life are essential to worthwhile living. Once you adopt a worthwhile goal, let nothing interfere with your obtaining it. Set your goals early in life; then, when temptation arises, you have already made your decision and temptation will be easier to overcome. I would caution you, however, never to set your goal for a particular position in the Church, in the government, in our profession, or in other activities in life, but rather prepare yourself so that when the opportunity knocks at your door you will be ready. You can be sure that opportunity will knock when you are qualified.<br><br>You who are members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints have the Holy Ghost to quicken your minds and understandings and to magnify your wisdom, discernment, and judgment. Live in such a way that you'll be entitled to the whisperings of the Spirit; then have the courage to follow the inspiration you receive.<br><br>I recall that, when I was a young man, our congressman offered me an appointment to the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis, Maryland. This was a great honor and a real temptation, but after careful and prayerful consideration, I declined the appointment. I had definitely decided that I would like to go on a mission, and I could see that accepting the Naval Academy appointment would probably preclude my serving as a missionary. This was one of the important decisions of my entire life. I know that the Lord guided me in making the decision to decline the appointment, continue my education, and go on a mission.<br><br>Each of us must make many decisions during a lifetime that can greatly affect our happiness and our growth and development. Our Father in heaven has blessed each one of us with talents. It is our responsibility to find out what they are and to develop them that they might bring joy and happiness into the lives of others as well as our own.<br><br>Are you doing your best? Are you anxious to develop your talents to the greatest degree? Are you willing to put forth the time and effort to do this? If so, you are developing the leadership abilities and godlike qualities. You may say, as you see the accomplishments of a very talented person, "I could never do what he is doing." Possibly you couldn't. But I don't believe this criterion to be the true test of achievement. Real achievement relates to each individual achieving the best he is capable of, and each of us can do that. The measuring stick is, not someone else's accomplishments, but our own capabilities. Whatever you are, strive to be the best you possibly can, whether you are a carpenter, a teacher, a lawyer, a doctor, an engineer, a missionary, a churchman, or a statesman. Each of us has his own problems to solve, but as we do our part, the Lord will make us equal to the task, whatever it may be.<br><br>Charles F. Kettering, onetime president of General Motors Corporation, frequently said to his associates, "Problems are the price of progress. Don't bring me anything but trouble. Good news weakens me." What a wonderful philosophy: bring me problems because they strengthen me. Problems viewed in this way, as opportunities, make men and women strong.<br><h2><b>Activity in the Church</b></h2><br>We frequently hear that the Church is a peculiar organization and that the people are peculiar people. An experience I had on a plane illustrates this point. Some time ago I was returning from New York to Salt Lake City. As I got on the plane, I sat down next to a young man, and before long we engaged in conversation. I asked him where he was from, and he said that he was from Minneapolis. He was in the investment business and had been to New York attending a seminar. He asked me where I was from and what my work was, and I told him I was from Salt Lake City and that I was a Mormon missionary. I asked him what he knew about the Mormon Church, and he said, "Quite a bit." He informed me that he had been an ice skating instructor at Sun Valley a few years earlier and had met many Mormons while he was there. He had thought he would like to work in Salt Lake City, where he could become better acquainted with the Mormons. The next summer, he had secured work in Salt Lake, met many returned missionaries, and attended Mormon church meetings. He asked me if I would be interested in knowing what he thought was the most worthwhile thing in the Mormon Church. I told him that I would be delighted to get his impression, and he replied that it was the fact that the Church offered every person who was a member an opportunity to serve. That was the outstanding thing in the Church, as far as he could observe.<br><br>Thus, the Church is a peculiar church and has a tremendous appeal to young people because it has a dynamic yet realistic plan of life. Involvement and active participation are basic principles of Mormonism. Activities involve participation in religious services, dramatic arts, public speaking, sports, and other areas that contribute to the development of leadership qualities. The Church furnishes unlimited opportunities for sharing one's talents, time, and means. This generally requires personal sacrifice and hard work. Never forget that sacrifice brings forth the blessings of heaven.<br><br>Missionary work is such an opportunity. The young person planning missionary service dreams of being the instrument in the hands of the Lord in bringing many people into the Church, but he soon finds that doing so requires sacrifice and hard work. May I encourage you to accept every opportunity presented to you to serve with enthusiasm--not as a burden, but as a great blessing.<br><br>I am convinced that more opportunities await young leaders of today and tomorrow than any generation heretofore. I am confident that you will successfully meet the great challenges ahead. Remember that walking into the unknown is required of all of us. This takes courage and strength, and so I am grateful for yours.<br><br>We are living in a remarkable age--the dispensation of the fullness of times. I am grateful for the knowledge that God lives and that Jesus is the Christ. I bear witness to you that the gospel of Jesus Christ has been restored in its fulness through the instrumentality of the great prophet Joseph Smith and that there is a prophet of God on the earth today, President Spencer W. Kimball. May the Lord bless and sustain him and may we have the courage to follow his counsel.<br><br>In conclusion, may we all appreciate that freedom of choice is a basic principle of the gospel of Jesus Christ and be truly thankful for our free agency. May we recognize that it is vital that we learn to make wise choices and to control ourselves rather than to live by chance. May we also develop the courage to execute these wise choices we make from day to day. Truly the poet-songwriter was inspired when he wrote:<br><br><i>Choose the right, when a choice is placed before you;</i><br><i>In the right the Holy Spirit guides;</i><br><i>And its light is forever shining o'er you,</i><br><i>When in the right your heart confides.</i><br><br><i>Choose the right! let no spirit of digression</i><br><i>Overcome you in the evil hour;</i><br><i>There's the right and the wrong to every question,</i><br><i>Be safe through inspiration's power.</i><br><br><i>Choose the right! there is peace in righteous doing;</i><br><i>Choose the right! there's safety for the soul;</i><br><i>Choose the right in all labors you're pursuing;</i><br><i>Let God and heaven be your goal.</i><br><br>Let me assure you that the maximum joy and satisfaction out of life, the maximum in material rewards as well, will come almost automatically to those who choose the right and remember that success is a journey, not a destination. Therefore, never turn down an opportunity to serve in the Church, live the gospel principles, and follow the leaders of the Church.<br><br>Tragedy comes as a result of disobedience to the commandments of God, but peace, happiness, and success follow obedience. What are your dreams and aspirations for tomorrow? I suggest that you make them challenging, worthwhile, and many of them Church-oriented.<br><br>May the knowledge and spirit you receive at this great University be helpful in making your dreams come true and may the choice blessings of our Father in heaven be with you I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Franklin D. Richards was an Assistant to the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when this fireside address was given at Brigham Young University on 4 August 1974.</i></i><br><br><i>© Brigham Young University.

<h1>es: But for a Small Moment - Neal A. Maxwell - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I am delighted to be with you tonight, my brothers and sisters, to partake of the spirit that is here and of that marvelous music. I wish you knew how much as a generation you inspire those of us who have the privilege of working with you. I want you to know that I regard you highly--collectively and all here whom I know individually–and have great expectations for you. The highest compliment I can pay to you is that God has placed you here and now at this time to serve in his kingdom; so much is about to happen in which you will be involved and concerning which you will have some great influence.<br><br>It is because you will face some remarkable challenges in your time; it is because the Church has ceased to be in the eyes of men a mere cultural oddity in the Mountain West and is now, therefore, a global church--a light which can no longer be hid; it is because you have a rendezvous with destiny that will involve some soul stretching and some pain that I have chosen to speak to you tonight about the implications of two things we accept sometimes quite casually. These realities are that God loves us and, loving us, has placed us here to cope with challenges which he will place before us. I'm not sure we can always understand the implications of his love, because his love will call us at times to do things we may wonder about, and we may be confronted with circumstances we would rather not face. I believe with all my heart that because God loves us there are some particularized challenges that he will deliver to each of us. He will customize the curriculum for each of us in order to teach us the things we most need to know. He will set before us in life what we need, not always what we like. And this will require us to accept with all our hearts--particularly your generation--the truth that there is divine design in each of our lives and that you have rendezvous to keep, individually and collectively.<br><br>God knows even now what the future holds for each of us. In one of his revelations these startling words appear, as with so many revelations that are too big, I suppose, for us to manage fully: "In the presence of God, . . . all things . . . are manifest, past, present, and future, and are continually before the Lord" (D&amp;amp;C 130:7). The future "you" is before him now. He knows what it is he wishes to bring to pass in your life. He knows the kind of remodeling in your life and in mine that he wishes to achieve. Now, this will require us to believe in that divine design and at times to accept the truth which came to Joseph Smith wherein he was reminded that his suffering would be "but a small moment" (D&amp;amp;C 121:7). I'd like to talk to you about some of those small moments that will come your way in life and that come to each of us.<br><br>Let me begin by reminding you that we so blithely say in the Church that life is a school, a testing ground. It is true, even though it is trite. What we don't accept are the implications of that true teaching--at least as fully as we should. One of the implications is that the tests that we face are real. They are not going to be things we can do with one hand tied behind our backs. They are real enough that if we meet them we shall know that we have felt them, because we will feel them deeply and keenly and pervasively.<br><h2><b>The Lessons of the Atonement</b></h2><br>Christ on the cross gave out the cry "My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?" That cry on the cross is an indication that the very best of our Father's children found the trials so real, the tests so exquisite and so severe, that he cried out--not in doubt of his Father's reality, but wondering "why" at that moment of agony--for Jesus felt so alone. James Talmage advises us that in ways you and I cannot understand, God somehow withdrew his immediate presence from the Son so that Jesus Christ's triumph might be truly complete.<br><br>From Gethsemane and Calvary there are many lessons we need to apply to our own lives. We, too, at times may wonder if we have been forgotten and forsaken. Hopefully, we will do as the Master did and acknowledge that God is still there and never doubt that sublime reality–even though we may wonder and might desire to avoid some of life's experiences. We may at times, if we are not careful, try to pray away pain or what seems like an impending tragedy, but which is, in reality, an opportunity. We must do as Jesus did in that respect--also preface our prayers by saying, "If it be possible," let the trial pass from us--by saying, "Nevertheless, not as I will, but as thou wilt," and bowing in a sense of serenity to our Father in heaven's wisdom, because at times God will not be able to let us pass by a trial or a challenge. If we were allowed to bypass certain trials, everything that had gone on up to that moment in our lives would be wiped out. It is because he loves us that at times he will not intercede as we may wish him to. That, too, we learn from Gethsemane and from Calvary.<br><br>It is interesting to me, brothers and sisters, to note that among the qualities of a saint is the capacity to develop patience and to cope with the things that life inflicts upon us. That capacity brings together two prime attributes--patience and endurance. These are qualities, in the process of giving service to mankind that most people reject or undervalue. Most people would gladly serve mankind if somehow they could get it over with once, preferably with applause and recognition. But, for the sake of righteousness, to endure, to be patient in the midst of affliction, in the midst of being misunderstood, and in the midst of suffering--that is sainthood!<br><br>I am struck quite forcibly by the idea that no man has yet become President of the church of him who suffered so much who has not himself undergone some special challenges previous to that moment. The challenges vary from President to President, but the ways in which these men have coped with these challenges are strikingly similar.<br><br>If we use Jesus as a model in the midst of the suffering about which we're speaking, then it is also noteworthy that even in the midst of his exquisite agony he managed to have compassion for those nearby who were then suffering much, though much less than he--those on the adjoining crosses or about him below the cross. How marvelous it is when we see people who are not so swallowed up in their own suffering that they cannot still manage sympathy, even empathy, for those who suffer far, far less. How many of us here may have undergone the embarrassment of being comforted by those who had more reason to be comforted than we? Yet we recognize in that act of theirs a saintliness to which we would so gladly aspire.<br><br>If we at times wonder if our own agendum for life deliver to us challenges that seem unique, it would be worth our remembering that, when we feel rejected, we are members of the church of him who was most rejected by his very own with no cause for rejection. If at times we feel manipulated, we are disciples of him whom the establishment of his day sought to manipulate. If we at times feel unappreciated, we are worshipers of him who gave to us the Atonement--that marvelous, selfless act, the central act of all human history--unappreciated, at least fully, even among those who gathered about his feet while the very process of the Atonement was underway. If we sometimes feel misunderstood by those about us, even those we minister to, so did he, much more deeply and pervasively than we. And if we love and there is no reciprocity for our love, we worship him who taught us and showed us love that is unconditional, for we must love even when there is no reciprocity.<br><br>Most of our suffering, brothers and sisters, actually comes because of our sins and not because of our nobility. Isn't it marvelous that Jesus Christ, who did not have to endure that kind of suffering because he was sin-free, nevertheless took upon himself the sins of all of us and experienced an agony so exquisite we cannot comprehend it? I don't know how many people have lived on the earth for sure, but demographers say between 30 and 67 billion. If you were to collect the agony for your own sins and I for mine, and multiply it by that number, we can only shudder at what the sensitive, divine soul of Jesus must have experienced in taking upon himself the awful arithmetic of the sins of all of us--an act which he did selflessly and voluntarily. If it is also true (in some way we don't understand) that the cavity which suffering carves into our souls will one day also be the receptacle of joy, how infinitely greater Jesus' capacity for joy, when he said, after his resurrection, "Behold, my joy is full." How very, very full, indeed, his joy must have been!<br><br>I should like, therefore, to speak to you on the premise that it is a part of discipleship for us to be prepared for the kind of rigors that Jesus always leveled his disciples. He said, "My people must be tried in all things, that they may be prepared to receive the glory that I have for them, even the glory of Zion; and he that will not bear chastisement is not worthy of my kingdom" (D&amp;amp;C 136:31). That is hard doctrine. Peter made it even more rigorous. Peter didn't want us to take any credit upon ourselves for the suffering we endure because of our own mistakes. He was willing to see us take credit for the suffering we endure because of discipleship, but not because of our own stupidity or our own sin (1 Peter 2:20). Then Moroni reminded us, "For ye receive no witness until after the trial of your faith" (Ether 12:6). That's the rigorous path of discipleship, brothers and sisters, about which I wish to speak at least in this one dimension tonight, giving you some examples, if I may.<br><br>If God chooses to teach us the things we most need to learn because he loves us, and if he seeks to tame our souls and gentle us in the way we most need to be tamed and most need to be gentled, it follows that he will customize the challenges he gives us and individualize them so that we will be prepared for life in a better world by his refusal to take us out of this world, even though we are not of it. In the eternal ecology of things we must pray, therefore, not that things be taken from us, but that God's will be accomplished through us. What, therefore, may seem now to be mere unconnected pieces of tile will someday, when we look back, take form and pattern, and we will realize that God was making a mosaic. For there is in each of our lives this kind of divine design, this pattern, this purpose that is in the process of becoming, which is continually before the Lord but which for us, looking forward, is sometimes perplexing.<br><h2><b>Traps Impeding the Ability to Meet Challenges</b></h2><br>I should like to suggest some traps into which we can fall, if we are not careful, as we try to meet the challenges that life delivers at our doorsteps. The<i>first</i>temptation that we must resist, brothers and sisters, is the Jonah response, in which we sometimes think we can escape the calls that come to us, that we can somehow run away from the realities that will press in upon us. Jonah, you recall, had been called to go to Nineveh. He didn't want to go to that urban center that was so big. We are told it took the people hours to walk across that city. He tried to find a ship going to Tarshish. He "paid the fare thereof," hoping to leave the presence of the Lord. You and I will one day know, if we do not know now, there is no way we can escape from God's love, because it is infinite. However many times in our lives we might rather go to a Tarshish than a Nineveh, he will insist that we go to Nineveh, and we must pay "the fare thereof."<br><br>Recently a young man was called to his Nineveh. The president of the Salt Lake mission home, President Rawson, told Sister Maxwell and me that not too long ago a young man came in on a Saturday to the Salt Lake mission home and said, "President, may I see you?"<br><br>The president said, "Surely, son, come into my office."<br><br>He came in and said, "I need a blessing."<br><br>"Why do you need a blessing?"<br><br>"I need a blessing because I am the only member of my family who is a member of the Church. Yesterday, when I went to leave home, one parent told me never to come back again, the other wouldn't speak to me, and the only person who said goodbye was my little brother, who came to the front gate to say goodbye to me. I'm on my way overseas and I need a blessing."<br><br>Now, brothers and sisters, that is the kind of devotion we must have in preparation for the Ninevehs of life to which we are called. However rigorous the circumstances are, we must, as this young man did, be willing to go, to trust and to surrender ourselves to our Father in heaven, who knows why in his divine plans it must be so.<br><br>A<i>second</i>trap into which we can fall is the naïveté that grows out of our not realizing that the adversary will press particularly in the areas of our vulnerabilities. It ought not to surprise us that this will be so. The things that we would most like to avoid, therefore, will often be the things that confront us most directly and most sharply. Some of you may recall that the British military planners who built the fortress of Singapore, which was supposed to be invincible, fixed the guns of Singapore so that they would fire only seaward. The Japanese very cleverly came from behind on land. Churchill and others were stunned that this citadel and fortress had fallen so quietly and so simply. Some of us have guns that fire only in one direction. We are vulnerable, and our vulnerabilities will be probed by the vicissitudes of life. One of the great advantages of life in the Church (in which the gospel is at the center) is that we can overcome these vulnerabilities; otherwise, we shall be taken by surprise and swiftly.<br><br>A<i>third</i>trap into which we can fall, if we are not careful, is to fail to notice that at the center of many of our challenges is pride, is ego. In most emotional escalations with which I am familiar, if one goes to the very center of them, there is ego asserting itself relentlessly. The only cure for rampant ego is humility, and this is why circumstances often bring to us a kind of compelled or forced humility--so that we may recover our equilibrium. Humility can help us to dampen our pride. Ironically, for those of us who most need to serve to develop our capacity to love, our very egos often make us unapproachable so far as others are concerned. We, therefore, are underused and we wonder why. And this is typical of the trials that we impose upon ourselves.<br><br>A<i>fourth</i>trap into which we can fall is that we may at times assume that the plan of salvation requires merely that we endure and survive when, in fact, as is always the case with the gospel of Jesus Christ, it is required of us, not only that we endure, but also that we endure<i>well,</i>that we exhibit "grace under pressure." This is necessary, not only so that our own passage through the trial can be a growth experience, but also because (more than we know) there are always people watching to see if we can cope, who therefore may resolve to venture forth and to cope themselves. Every time we navigate safely on the strait and narrow way, there are other ships that are lost which can find their way because of our steady light.<br><br>A<i>fifth</i>trap, and a major one, is the trap of self-pity. One man has said that "hell is being frozen in self-pity." Indeed, at times when we think our lot is hard or when we feel our selves misunderstood, it will be so easy for us to indulge ourselves in feeling some self-pity. A contrasting episode comes to us out of ancient Greece: Several hundred Spartans were holding the pass at Thermopylae, that narrow pass, and the Persians came in overwhelming numbers and urged the Spartans to surrender. Hoping to intimidate them further, the Persians sent emissaries to the Spartans, saying they had so many archers in their army they could darken the sky with their arrows. The Spartans said, "So much the better. We shall fight in the shade."<br><br>Now, brothers and sisters, the disciple has to be ready to fight in the shade of circumstance. One of the ways we can have perspective that will permit us to fight in the shade of circumstances is to read the scriptures and have involvement--intellectually and spiritually--with the case studies in the scriptures of those men and women who have coped, and coped successfully, who have undergone far more than you and I are asked to undergo. When we understand these models, we may then understand that God is totally serious about his purpose "to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man," that his chief concerns are not real estate and political dominion, but the growth of souls, the celestializing of the souls with whom he works.<br><br>I am one of those, for instance, who does not believe the Mormon colonies in Mexico and Canada had much to do in the Lord's eyes with real estate or physical empire, but I feel rather that these colonies were established for the preparation of a people. I call your attention to the fact that two members of the First Presidency and the wife of President Kimball have come out of those colonies in Mexico and Canada--individuals prepared beforehand for the mighty roles they now carry on in the kingdom. I don't think God's too interested in real estate. He owns it all anyway. He does seem to be incredibly interested in what happens to us individually and will place us in those circumstances where we have the most opportune chances to grow and to carry out our purposes.<br><br>A<i>sixth</i>trap into which we can fall quite easily, brothers and sisters, is the trap in which we sense that something special is happening in our lives but are not able to sort it out with sufficient precision and clarity that we can articulate it to someone else. That is so often true of the gospel. Its truths are too powerful for us to manage on occasion. Let me give you this simple illustration of how we can know something and yet not be able to communicate it fully without the help of the Spirit. If I were to bring one of you into this hall and if, instead of all of you, it were filled with fifteen thousand mothers and if I were to say to you, "Somewhere in that audience is your mother; find her," you could do it, and I suspect it wouldn't take you very many minutes. But if I said to you, "Wait outside. There are fifteen thousand mothers in there and one of them is your mother. Now, you describe her to me with sufficient precision and clarity so that I can go find her," you couldn't do it. You would still know what she looked like, but tongue could not transmit what you knew. It is that way often with the gospel. That is why we are so in need of the Spirit–so that knowledge can arc like electricity from point to point, aided and impelled by the Spirit--aid without which we are simply not articulate enough to speak of all the things which we know.<br><br>It would be interesting, for instance, if I were to ask one of you to describe to the satisfaction of all here the color yellow. Yellow, of course, is a primary color, but it would be difficult for you to describe it to us without comparing it with other colors. Yet you have no difficulty recognizing yellow when you see it. We know more than we can tell! Sometimes the things we know take the form of knowledge about what is happening to us in life in which we sense purpose, in which we sense divine design, but which we cannot speak about with full articulateness. There are simply moments of mute comprehension and of mute certitude. We need to pay attention when these moments come to us, because God often gives us the assurances we need but not necessarily the capacity to transmit these assurances to anyone else.<br><br>I would like to share with you at this moment a highly personal experience. I will not mention the name of the man involved. I mention the experience only because of one of my own tendencies (those on the stand and elsewhere who know me know that I am often too verbal and silence does not come easily to me). Fortunately, on this occasion there was a kind of mute comprehension on my part that the most important thing I could do was to be still.<br><br>A few days after April conference, a very bright, able professional man called my secretary for an appointment. Fortunately she gave it to him, and fortunately it was of sufficient duration that there was time for the chemistry of this experience to operate. He came in and we greeted each other. I, frankly, was not sure of the purpose of his visit. I assumed it might even be that he had come to complain about something. There are portions of our time as General Authorities that are given over to being ombudsmen. But I said little and sat down. I resisted the temptation to fill the silence that then ensued. Tears welled up, filling his eyes. It seemed to me we must have sat there for ten minutes, but I am sure it was only three or four. I kept still, resisting the natural temptation to rush in with supporting words, and simply let the Spirit operate. Then out it came--a marvelous, manly confession, in which he said for him to become active in the kingdom again it was necessary that he set certain things right. Over the years he felt he had been unfair to me and unkind to me, and he wanted to come and to ask for forgiveness. I again largely resisted the temptation, which by then was strong, to rush in with some quick reassurances that might put him at ease. As thoughts tumbled on thoughts and verbalizations on verbalizations, this sweet man cleansed his soul. Indeed, I had<i>not</i>felt injured by him. I was not aware of his concerns, but it would have been folly for me to have so said before there was full closure in the matter at hand.<br><br>He is a marvelous, sweet man. I admire his courage. He said even that morning he had wondered if he could come, or if he shouldn't cancel his appointment. I love him. We embraced and have stayed in close contact since. He is able and is making marvelous progress in the kingdom. I'll always be grateful for that sensing of mute comprehension that something special was about to happen which I couldn't describe but in which my role for that occasion was mostly to be still and to listen. There are times when life will visit us with challenges in which we will have a mute comprehension of what is underway but cannot transmit it fully to someone else.<br><br>A<i>seventh</i>trap, brothers and sisters, is that some of us neglect to develop multiple forces of satisfaction. When one of the wells upon which we draw dries up through death, loss or status, disaffection, or physical ailment, we then find ourselves very thirsty because, instead of having multiple sources of satisfaction in our lives, we have become too dependent upon this or upon that. How important it is to the symmetry of our souls that we interact with all the gospel principles and with all the Church programs, so that we do not become so highly specialized that, if we are deprived of one source of satisfaction, indeed we are in difficulty. It is possible to be incarcerated within the prison of one principle. We are less vulnerable if our involvements with the kingdom are across the board. We are less vulnerable if we care deeply about many principles--not simply a few.<br><br>An<i>eighth</i>trap to be avoided, brothers and sisters, is the tendency we have--rather humanly, rather understandably--to get ourselves caught in peering through the prism of the present and then distorting our perspective about things. Time is of this world; it is not of eternity. We can, if we are not careful, feel the pressures of time and see things in a distorted way. How important it is that we see things as much as possible through the lens of the gospel with its eternal perspectives.<br><br>I should like, if I may, to share with you on this point the fine writing of your own A. Lester Allen, a dean and scientist on this campus. This is what I have come to call the "Allen Analogy" about time. Let me read you these lines, if I may. Their application will be obvious. Dean Allen writes:<br><br><i>Suppose, for instance, that we imagine a "being" moving onto our earth whose entire life-span is only 1/100 of a second. Ten thousand "years" for him, generation after generation, would be only one second of our time. Suppose this imaginary being comes up to a quiet pond in the forest where you are seated. You have just tossed in a rock and are watching the ripples. A leaf is fluttering from the sky and a bird is swooping over the water. He would find everything absolutely motionless. Looking at you, he would say: "In all recorded history nothing has changed. My father and his father before him have seen that everything is absolutely still. This creature called man has never had a heartbeat and has never breathed. The water is standing in stationary waves as if someone had thrown a rock into it; it seems frozen. A leaf is suspended in the air, and a bird has stopped right over the middle of the pond. There is no movement. Gravity is suspended." The concept of time in this imaginary being, so different from ours, would give him an entirely different perspective of what we call reality.</i><br><br><i>On the other hand, picture another imaginary creature for whom one "second" of his time is 10,000 years of our time. What would the pond be like to him? By the time he sat down beside it, taking 15,000 of our years to do so, the pond would have vanished. Individual human beings would be invisible, since our entire life-span would be only 1/100 of one of his "seconds." The surface of the earth would be undulating as mountains are built up and worn down. The forest would persist but a few minutes and then disappear. His concept of "reality" would be much different than our own.</i><br><br>That's the most clever way I have seen time and intimations of eternity dealt with.<i>It is very important that we not assume the perspective of mortality in making the decisions that bear on eternity!</i>We need the perspectives of the gospel to make decisions in the context of eternity. We need to understand we cannot do the Lord's work in the world's way.<br><h2><b>The Church's Basis in Christ</b></h2><br>Now, brothers and sisters, may I prepare to close with these thoughts: The Church is fully<i>Christ-centered</i>. The Church is also<i>Christ-powered</i>, and it is also designed to help its members become more<i>Christlike</i>. Since the gospel of Jesus Christ focuses on the truths that deal with everlasting things and not on obsolescent realities, it is very important for us, brothers and sisters, to recognize that the truths in which we traffic as members of the kingdom pertain to eternity as well as to this life.<br><br>I am surprised (I would be amused if the cost were not so great) that people think they can remove the foundations of our social structure--things like work, chastity, and family and then wonder why other things crumble. You can't remove the foundation of a building while standing inside and not be hit with falling plaster. We are now in the interesting position in the kingdom of trying to warn about what is happening in the world and, at the same time, of keeping ourselves personally secure. We must be Christ-centered individually. We must have his and God's power to do our work, and we must take seriously the challenge of becoming more Christlike. You're soon going to go out into a world full of marshmallow men. Like the act of putting a finger into a marshmallow, there is no core in these men, there is no center, and when one removes his finger, the marshmallow resumes its former shape. We are in a world of people who want to yield to everything--to every fad and to every fashion. It is incredibly important that we be committed to the core--committed to those things that matter, about which our Father in heaven has leveled with us through his Son, Jesus Christ, and his prophets.<br><br>I saw an interesting cartoon not too long ago that bears on this point of marshmallow men. It showed two multicolored desert lizards conversing. One said to the other, "Of course you're going through an identity crisis. You're a chameleon."<br><br>Of course the world is going through an identity crisis. Of course it's adrift: it's got no anchor. It does not have core principles upon which to decide all other things. I am grateful that our beliefs are related to the principles of the gospel of Jesus Christ. I am grateful that God has told us that we must be ready for the trials that life will bring our way.<br><br>I speak to this generation with some sense of vicarious anticipation in your behalf of what lies ahead--urging you to pour out your hearts in supplication and prayer. There is nothing more powerful than prayer, nothing more masculine or more feminine (at the same time) than prayer. There was more power processed and expended on that single night in Gethsemane, in that small garden, than all the armies and navies have ever expended in all the battles on the land and sea and in the air in all of human history. The catalyst of prayer helped Jesus to cope with suffering, and by his suffering he emancipated all men from death and made possible eternal life. This cardinal fact about the central act of human history, the Atonement, ought to give us pause, therefore, as we face our challenges individually.<br><br>I believe it was George Macdonald who reminded us that the only door out of the dungeon of self is the love of one's neighbor. How proud we ought to be, in a quiet way, that we are members of the church of the most selfless being who ever lived. How proud we ought to be to belong to a church that makes specific demands of us and gives us specific things to do and marks the strait and narrow way, lest we fall off one side of the precipice or the other. I am so grateful that God loves us enough to teach us specifically. Had secularists written the Ten Commandments, they might have said, "Thou shalt not be a bad person." Note what the Ten Commandments say: "Thou shalt not steal, thou shalt not covet, thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain, thou shalt not commit adultery," and so on. The gospel of Jesus Christ is specific because God cares specifically for each of us and, caring for us, will mark the way carefully lest we fall out of happiness.<br><br>A vague creed is fitted only for a vague God. We have a Father who loves us specifically and gives us things to do and, because he loves us, will cause us, at times, to have our souls stretched and to be fitted for a better world by coping with life in this world.<br><br>May God bless us with that kind of commitment, with the capacity to be serious disciples and to accept both the agendum that he has prepared for each of us because he loves us and the curriculum, prepared for each of us, which he has customized to teach us the things we most need to know, because he loves us.<br><br>There is a man I hope someday to meet--a brother of yours and mine in the kingdom. He lives somewhere behind the Iron Curtain. Another man, a priesthood leader behind the Iron Curtain, was told that there was such a man, who had not seen another member of the Church for many years. This good brother, moved by the Spirit, saved his money (which he didn't have much of), made his way through the red tape of crossing borders, and found this brother of yours and mine; he learned that he who was found had not seen another member of the Church for over twenty years. And when the man who was the finder indicated that it was possible, because he had been so authorized, to give this brother a patriarchal blessing, this good brother demurred momentarily until he got the tithing which he had saved for over twenty years and gave it to this other man so that he would be fully worthy of that blessing!<br><br>I don't know what the divine design is in the challenge of that kind of solitude. I know that this man, our brother, is meeting that challenge. Some of us will have to be most courageous, not when we're alone, but when we're in a crowd. Whatever the form the test takes, we must be willing to pass it. We must reach breaking points without breaking. We must be willing, if necessary, to give up our lives--not because we have a disdain for life as some do, but even though we love life--because we are the servants of him who did that in such an infinite way for all of us.<br><br>I testify to you in the solemnity of my soul that we are prophet-led, that this is the church of Jesus Christ, presided over by a prophet who himself knows a great deal about suffering. We are all the servants of him who suffered most that we might have with him a fullness of joy. May we be committed to that task this day and always I pray in the name of him whose church this is, even Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Neal A.

<h1>sing of Commandments - Dallin H. Oaks - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
My dear brothers and sisters, during the first three years of my service as President of Brigham Young University I have given several talks outlining the opportunities and responsibilities of students at this institution. The most recent, "Challenges for the Year Ahead," which was given a year ago, has been printed and mailed to each of you. I urge all students to familiarize themselves with the content of that message. It contains many important things that I will not repeat here. I hold the view that when important information is written down and made available to adults it is not necessary to repeat it again and again to make them responsible for the contents. For that reason this will not be a President's message of concern primarily to students. Instead, I will speak about matters that pertain to members of the Church generally. My devotional message concerns attitudes, and my objective is to encourage you to look upon the commandments of God as a blessing and to look upon your own talents as something you have a duty to magnify by every effort at your disposal.<br><h2><b>Commandments Make Weak Men Strong</b></h2><br>The Lord said this about the persons who would build up the land of Zion:<br><br><i>Blessed are they whose feet stand upon the land of Zion, who have obeyed my gospel; for they shall receive for their reward the good things of the earth, and it shall bring forth in its strength.</i><br><br><i>And they shall also be crowned with blessings from above, yea, and with commandments not a few, and with revelations in their time.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 59:3–4]<br><br>In the Lord's preface to the Book of Commandments, which is now called the Doctrine and Covenants, we find the Lord saying this:<br><br><i>These commandments are of me, and were given unto my servants in their weakness, after the manner of their language, that they might come to an understanding.</i><br><br><i>And inasmuch as they erred it might be made known;</i><br><br><i>And inasmuch as they sought wisdom they might be instructed;</i><br><br><i>And inasmuch as they sinned they might be chastened, that they might repent;</i><br><br><i>And inasmuch as they were humble they might be made strong, and blessed from on high, and receive knowledge from time to time.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 1:24–28]<br><br>Elsewhere in the Doctrine and Covenants we read that the Lord sent forth his gospel and gave his commandments "to prepare the weak for those things which are coming on the earth" that men "might be made partakers of the glories which were to be revealed" (D&amp;amp;C 133:57–58).<br><br>Commandments are a blessing, my brothers and sisters, because our Father in heaven has given them to us in order to help us grow and develop the qualities we must have if we are to obtain eternal life and dwell with him. By keeping his commandments, we qualify for his blessings. "There is a law," we are told, "irrevocably decreed in heaven before the foundations of this world, upon which all blessings are predicated--And when we obtain any blessing from God, it is by obedience to that law upon which it is predicated" (D&amp;amp;C 130:20–21). Until I read that passage again in the Doctrine and Covenants in preparation for this talk, I had not realized how that principle was juxtaposed to some important instruction about learning. Read those verses in the 130th section of the Doctrine and Covenants and then notice the two verses immediately preceding them:<br><br><i>Whatever principle of intelligence we attain unto in this life, it will rise with us in the resurrection.</i><br><br><i>And if a person gains more knowledge and intelligence in this life through his diligence and obedience than another, he will have so much the advantage in the world to come.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 130:18–19]<br><br>The next verse is "There is a law, irrevocably decreed in heaven ..., upon which all blessings are predicated." I see a real relationship between that principle and the activity of learning in which we are engaged--in which all of our Heavenly Father's children are or should be engaged.<br><br>Now, for purposes of illustration, I will review various commandments and comment on the blessings of obedience or the consequences of disobedience.<br><h2><b>The Law of Chastity</b></h2><br>First, chastity. Time after time, the scriptures teach us that no unclean thing can enter the kingdom of God or dwell in his presence (see Moses 6:57; 1 Nephi 10:21, 15:34). We are warned against sexual sin because it is among the gravest of sins, which will forever separate us from God--subject only to prolonged and painful repentance--and which will in any case cause an immediate withdrawal of the guiding Spirit of the Lord. As Paul taught in his first letter to the Corinthians, if any man defile the temple of God, which is our body, the spirit of God will withdraw from him (see 1 Corinthians 3:17).<br><br>Similarly, the prophet Helaman described the sorry state of the Nephites who had been brought low by their unbelief and wickedness: "The Spirit of the Lord," he said, "did no more preserve them; yea, it had withdrawn from them because the Spirit of the Lord doth not dwell in unholy temples--Therefore, the Lord did cease to preserve them" (Helaman 4:24–25).<br><h2><b>The Law of the Sabbath</b></h2><br>Consider the blessings associated with the law of the Sabbath. "Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy" (Exodus 20:8) was the commandment the Lord gave to the children of Israel for "a perpetual covenant"--a sign, he said, "between me and the children of Israel forever" (Exodus 31:16–17). When the Savior came, he rejected most of the technicalities that talmudic scholars had built around Sabbath observance, but he reaffirmed the sacredness of the Sabbath and taught that it was lawful to do well on the Sabbath (see Matthew 12:12) and that the Sabbath was made for man (see Mark 2:27). In our own day the Lord has taught us through prophets that we should rest from our labors, go to the house of prayer and offer up our sacraments, and pay our devotions unto the Most High "that thou mayest more fully keep thyself unspotted form the world" and "that thy joy may be full" (see D&amp;amp;C 59:9–13).<br><br>People who use the Sabbath day as a time of shopping, fishing, boating, or other recreational or business activities deprive themselves of the blessings of the Sabbath. The Sabbath is a blessing to man as a time of spiritual growth and refreshment. As Brigham Young taught, the laws of the Sabbath were given for the benefit of man–"not," he said, "imposed upon him as by a task-master, in the form of a rigid discipline; but they are bestowed upon him as a blessing, a favour, and a mercy, for his express benefit" (<i>Journal of Discourses</i>, 6:278). Persons who fail to keep the Sabbath lose an opportunity for spiritual growth and forfeit the rich companionship of the Spirit of the Lord.<br><br>I had a personal experience that taught me for all time the importance of observing the Sabbath. As a Brigham Young University student, married with two small children to support, I had a job that required me to work on the Sabbath. Consequently, I did not enjoy the blessings of the Sabbath in full measure, despite my efforts always to attend at least one of my Sabbath meetings. When I left this campus to study at the University of Chicago, my mother reminded me that my father had never studied on the Sabbath during his professional training. She said to me very casually, "Son, if you want to enjoy that blessing you should arrange your activities so that you never study, so that you never do anything on the Sabbath except partake of the spiritual food that is available to you on the Lord's day."<br><br>I made up my mind at that time that I would observe the Sabbath faithfully so that I could qualify for the blessings of spiritual growth and the companionship of the Spirit that come from observing faithfully the Sabbath of our Lord. I testify to you that I realized those blessings in measurable ways on innumerable occasions. My concern for the Sabbath is to earn the blessings available to those who observe it, not to keep myself from sinning. My attitude is to look on the commandment of the Sabbath as a gift of my Heavenly Father to teach me what I should do if I want to enjoy his richest blessings. That is the attitude I encourage each of us to develop toward each of our Father in heaven's commandments.<br><br>We read this in Isaiah about the Sabbath, and I affirm to you its truth:<br><br><i>If thou turn away thy foot from the sabbath, from doing thy pleasure on my holy day; and call the sabbath a delight, the holy of the Lord, honorable; and shalt honor him, not doing thine own ways, nor finding thine own pleasure, nor speaking thine own words:</i><br><br><i>Then shalt thou delight thyself in the Lord; and I will cause thee to ride upon the high places of the earth, and feed thee with the heritage of Jacob thy father: for the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it.</i>[Isaiah 58:13–14]<br><h2><b>The Law of Tithing</b></h2><br>Some commandments are given with an express promise. Tithing comes with a promise of material blessings:<br><br><i>Bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse, that there may be meat in mine house, and prove me now herewith, saith the Lord of hosts, if I will not open you the windows of heaven, and pour you out a blessing, that there shall not be room enough to receive it.</i><br><br><i>And I will rebuke the devourer for your sakes, and he shall not destroy the fruits of your ground; neither shall your vine cast her fruit before the time in the field....</i><br><br><i>And all nations shall call you blessed: for ye shall be a delightsome land, saith the Lord of hosts.</i>[Malachi 3:10–12]<br><br>Tithing also has its spiritual blessings, preparing us for celestial glory. In his sixth lecture on faith, the Prophet Joseph Smith spoke these words, which to me are memorable. They can be applied, not only to whatever small sacrifice we might make in paying our tithing, but also to every sacrifice we are called upon to make in keeping the commandments of God. "Let us here observe," the Prophet Joseph Smith said,<br><br><i>that a religion that does not require the sacrifice of all things, never has power sufficient to produce the faith necessary unto life and salvation; for from the first existence of man, the faith necessary unto the enjoyment of life and salvation never could be obtained without the sacrifice of all earthly things....</i><br><br><i>Those, then, who make the sacrifice, will have the testimony that their course is pleasing in the sight of God; and those who have this testimony will have faith to lay hold on eternal life, and will be enabled, through faith, to endure unto the end, and receive the crown that is laid up for them that love the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ.</i>[Joseph Smith,<i>Lectures on Faith</i>, pp. 60–61]<br><h2><b>Laws of Health</b></h2><br>There are other commandments that give reasons or promised blessings. Here is one that applies particularly to each of us, I suppose: "Retire to thy bed early, that ye may not be weary; arise early [perhaps the more difficult part of that counsel], that your bodies and your minds may be invigorated" (D&amp;amp;C 88:124.) Now, I submit that those who are interested in having vigorous bodies and minds need to have a special concern with that commandment.<br><br>Here is another that is a great favorite of mine. We all know what we are taught in the Word of Wisdom, section 89 of the Doctrine and Covenants. We covenant to abstain from alcohol, tobacco, tea, and coffee. Why? The Lord tells us. He gives us a promise:<br><br><i>All saints who remember to keep and do these sayings, walking in obedience to the commandments, shall receive health in their navel and marrow to their bones;</i><br><br><i>And shall find wisdom and great treasures of knowledge, even hidden treasures;</i><br><br><i>And shall run and not be weary, and shall walk and not faint.</i><br><br><i>And I, the Lord, give unto them a promise, that the destroying angel shall pass by them, as the children of Israel, and not slay them.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 89:18–21]<br><br>During the past two weeks we have seen evidence in the daily press of the destroying angel passing by members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in statistically measurable degree with respect to their death rate from all kinds of cancer. There is a phenomenal difference between the death rate of the members of this Church and other people generally. But more important even than the physical blessings of the Word of Wisdom in this community of learning are the spiritual blessings. When the Lord promises us that we will find wisdom and great treasures of knowledge, even hidden treasures, I suggest to you that one thing referred to is the office and mission of the Holy Ghost to teach us, to guide us into all truth, and to bring all things to our recollection (see John 14:26, 16:13). Those are the promises of the Spirit, and I suggest to you that those who break the Word of Wisdom forfeit the companionship of that Spirit and lose the blessings of being led to find wisdom and great treasures of knowledge by the companionship of that Spirit, blessings available to us if we live worthily, including faithful observance of the Word of Wisdom.<br><br>We should rejoice in the commandments of God and recognize them as valuable gifts from a loving Father to his children. "For what doth it profit a man if a gift is bestowed upon him, and he receive not the gift? Behold, he rejoices not in that which is given unto him, neither rejoices in him who is the giver of the gift" (D&amp;amp;C 88:33).<br><h2><b>The Process of True Repentance</b></h2><br>We are taught by the commandments of God how we can cleanse ourselves from sin. The various steps of repentance include recognition of the wrong, resolve to do right, and restitution. These steps prepare us for the spiritual growth necessary to overcome the effects of sin and to rise above it.<br><br>I recall a young man who did not understand repentance. A member of this Church, although not an active member and never faithful in the observance of his covenants even from his youth, this young man was in jail in Chicago. As a member of the stake presidency, I received a letter from loving parents in the West who said, "Would you visit our son?" I got to jail and found him there, charged with the murder of his six-month-old baby. The child had been crying, and this fellow, who had not learned how to control his emotions, had seized the baby in a fit of anger and struck it in the face with his fist, breaking some of the bones in the head, severing the spinal column, and causing almost instant death. He was charged with murder. I had the responsibility of talking with him and giving him such comfort as I could give. I tried to prepare him for what I considered to be his inevitable sentence to the penitentiary–as, indeed, turned out to be the case. I said to him, "You have got to prepare yourself to go to the penitentiary. You have killed a human being."<br><br>He said, "I didn't mean to and I am sorry. Why must I be punished?" This was his consistent attitude during the entire period of our interview. He could see no reason why he should be punished because he felt that, once he said he was sorry, no further act of contrition, no suffering, no repentance on his part was necessary. At variance with external law, that attitude, until it is changed, will prevent that young man from entering upon the long and difficult road of repentance. That attitude will embitter his soul as he endures the punishment necessary for one who has taken the life of a human being.<br><br>In contrast, consider the attitude of the students who write me about violations of the Code of Honor. About once a month or more frequently, I receive a letter from a student confessing that he or she has plagiarized or cheated on work at Brigham Young University. Some of these letters are from the mission field or from young men or women who are or are soon to be called upon missions. They say, "I have something on my conscience that I wish to clear. In Course 100 I cheated, or I plagiarized a paper. Here is the information. I am ready to take my punishment, a reduction in grade or a loss of credit, whatever it is. But I wish to get on the path of growth." And with love and understanding, rejoicing that someone has turned a corner on a dishonest, sinful, and degrading act, we consult with the teachers involved and assist these students in a spirit of mercy and justice, as best we are able.<br><h2><b>The Family</b></h2><br>We are taught by the gospel about the supreme importance of the family. Why is the family so important? It is because the most important position we hold in this life is our position as husband or wife, father or mother, and family member. When these relationships are sealed by the power of the holy priesthood, they are assured for all eternity. In every position other than the family that we hold in this life--my position, your position, Church positions, civic, employment, and government positions<i>--</i>we are subject to being released by duly constituted authority in this life; or, if it is a position we hold for life, the Lord can release us by arresting a heartbeat. Only family positions are of eternal duration, provided of course they are sealed by proper authority and confirmed by worthy adherence to covenants.<br><h2><b>Challenges Coming from the Lord's Servants</b></h2><br>So much for commandments. What about the things we are asked to do by the servants of the Lord? A favorite example of mine is the march of Zion's Camp. The ostensible purpose of this march was to move five hundred men from Ohio to give military relief to the persecuted Saints in Missouri. The real purpose and effect of the march were to develop faith and give leadership training and experience to the men who were in Zion's Camp. These were the individuals who would be called to lead the kingdom. Zion's Camp included all twelve men who were later called to the first Quorum of the Twelve, including some who were to become Presidents of the Church.<br><br>Winston Churchill spoke of the sharp agate points upon which the ponderous balance of destiny turns. Every one of us has in our own lives those sharp agate points upon which the ponderous balance of our destinies turn. Thirteen years ago, my stake president, John K. Edmunds, called me to meet him for lunch in a downtown Chicago restaurant. (We were both practicing law in that city at the time.) I was then a counselor in the Sunday School superintendency of one of the wards in his stake. He called me to a stake mission and to serve as a counselor in the stake mission presidency. At that time, I was working all day and every evening of the week and all day Saturday--excluding Sunday, as has always been my practice. I was working morning, noon, and night six days a week on some very taxing assignments for the law firm that employed me. He called me on a stake mission and told me<i>--</i>as was his wont, perfectly unyielding, without any compromise--that I would be expected to give forty hours of proselyting time per month in addition to attending meetings, bringing investigators to church, and doing the gospel study I would need to qualify myself as a stake missionary. I said to myself at that time that this was a turning point in my life; this was a test of my faith. Would I have the faith necessary to accept that position in view of the requirements of my employment? Even at that time, but more surely as I have looked back on it, I could recognize this as one of those sharp agate points that Churchill identified. Fortunately for me I mustered the faith, accepted the call, and said to my president, "If the Lord wants me to serve in that position--and I do honor the calling as coming from the Lord through his servant--he will make it possible for me to do it. When do you want me to start?"<br><br>He said, "I have an appointment I'd like you to keep tonight."<br><br>I got my affairs in order and began that evening. Effective with that calling to a stake mission, I rarely ever worked after five o'clock again in the remaining course of my law practice, and still I realized greater success than I had ever realized by any measure that a young man could choose for success in his chosen profession. The Lord made it up to me in countless ways that I have no time and indeed no ability to particularize for you, but I can simply tell you that my faith was rewarded in every possible way.<br><br>More important to me, as I look back, is the certainty with which I can see that this calling to a stake mission changed the direction of my life and set me on a course that brought me here in measurable, deliberate, and direct steps to stand before you today. As I began to do the work of that missionary calling, I began to reevaluate the course on which I had set myself professionally, and I began to think about whether I wanted to spend the rest of my life in that particular law practice. Six months later, when I received a renewed offer of a position in law teaching, I accepted it. I would never have accepted that position if it had not been for my calling to a stake mission. That calling also offered me an opportunity to grow in faith and devotion and loyalty to the leadership of the Church. In every way I can measure it was a turning point in my life.<br><br>We have these sharp agate points. They may turn us for the better; they may turn us for the worse. The only thing you can be sure of is that, if you do what is right and make your decision prayerfully, you will make the right decision and will be able to look back on it and say, "That was a good decision in terms of the eternal course I pursue."<br><br>Robert Frost said it this way:<br><br><i>Two roads diverged in a wood, and I--</i><br><i>I took the one less traveled by,</i><br><i>And that has made all the difference.</i><br>["The Road Not Taken," st. 4]<br><h2><b>Accomplishment Through Personal Effort</b></h2><br>Accomplishment is pleasing to the Lord. He said, "Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven" (Matthew 5:16). The receipt of a Nobel Prize by a member of this faculty or a member of this student body would, I am sure, reflect great credit upon the University and the Church. Professor Kenneth R. Hardy of our faculty recently published an article in<i>Science Magazine</i>in which he pointed out that in several recent decades Utah was the most productive of all states in the Union in the number of doctoral-level persons produced. This state was the most productive of all fifty states by a wide margin. He attributed this statistic to a set of cultural values that promote scholarly and scientific activity. These values<i>--</i>including belief in a world governed by law, the dignity of man, personal dedication, democratic and equalitarian ideals–are clearly, he said, attributable to Mormon values ("Social Origin of American Scientist and Scholars,"<i>Science Magazine,</i>vol. 185, no. 4150 [9 August 1974]: 497–506). That is another blessing you enjoy by your membership in the Church and your faithful observance of the principles of the gospel.<br><br>Consider the parable of the talents in connection with the use of your own abilities and potential. You remember that the Master gave different talents to each of his servants, but he held them accountable for the use of what he had given them. The parable illustrates the point by the gift of worldly things, but I think the principle applies to the use of our personal talents not only in worldly but also in what we call spiritual things.<br><br>What proportion of your talents or potential do you use, my brothers and sisters? Do you fool yourself? You may fool yourself and one another, but you will not fool your Heavenly Father. He knows whether he gave you five talents or two talents or one talent. What proportion of your potential do you use? Are you satisfied with less than your best at anything you do? Indeed, do you ever do your best? Are you pushed by someone else? Do you push yourself to do your best? What separates people is, not so much intelligence or breaks, but determination<i>--</i>the proportion of their ability that they are determined to use.<br><br>The Lord taught us to "seek learning, even by study and also by faith" (D&amp;amp;C 88:118). The Lord has given us faith, and he expects us to cultivate it and use it. He has also given us talents, including the power to reason. He expects us to cultivate and educate those powers in seeking learning by study. There is no better confirmation than the example of the Prophet Joseph founding the School of the Prophets, struggling to learn Hebrew, striving to learn something about law, teaching his people under the inspiration of the Lord to study astronomy, geology, history, government, and every useful science and art. Despite the fact that he enjoyed direct communication with our Heavenly Father, the Prophet Joseph was out grubbing to learn all that he could by the worldly means at his disposal. How could any of us be justified in doing less? The Lord will bless us, but his blessings just follow our efforts. They rarely precede them.<br><br>One of the favorite sayings I brought from a classroom at Brigham Young University was a statement by Knute Rockne. (You remember him, the famous football coach at Notre Dame.) He said, "Prayers work best when players are big." Now, I offer that to you, not in a spirit of skepticism, but as an illustration of the proper balance of works and faith. The Lord's blessings normally don't come until we have expended every effort we can. Only when we have done all that we can does the Lord put us over the line.<br><br>Recall the rebuke that the Lord gave Oliver Cowdery when he was unable to translate: "You have supposed that I would give it unto you, when you took no thought save it was to ask me. ... You must study it out in your mind; then you must ask me if it be right" (D&amp;amp;C 9:7–8).<br><br>My brothers and sisters, we belong to a community of workers and doers, not to a community of dreamers or ascetics piously and passively waiting for the Millennium. We are working to bring it to pass. The Lord's blessings, including inspiration for direction and guidance, come to his children who are on the move. The Liahona came to Lehi and his children after years in the desert, not when they were in or just outside Jerusalem. The word of the Lord on the organization of the camp of Israel didn't come in Nauvoo. It came on the west bank of the Missouri near Omaha, almost a year after the Saints had left Nauvoo.<br><br>One of my favorite illustrations of this principle is the practical spirit of the founder of this University, Brigham Young, concerning the Martin and Willie handcart companies. (My wife's great-grandmother, Margetta Clark, who became the wife of Anson Call, was in that Martin handcart company.) Brigham Young stood up in conference on Sunday, October 5, 1856, and announced that these two handcart companies were in distress in Wyoming, six or seven hundred miles from Salt Lake City. He said that the text for those who spoke in that session of conference would be "to get them here!"<br><br><i>This is the salvation I am now seeking for, to save our brethren that would be apt to perish, or suffer extremely, if we do not send them assistance.</i><br><br><i>I shall call upon the Bishops this day</i>[the Sabbath],<i>I shall not wait until to-morrow, nor until next day, for sixty good mule teams and twelve or fifteen wagons ... twelve tons of flour and forty good teamsters....</i><br><br><i>I will tell you that all your faith, religion, and profession of religion, will never save one soul of you in the celestial kingdom of our God, unless you carry out just such principles as I am now teaching you. Go and bring in those people now on the Plains, and attend strictly to those things which we call temporal, or temporal duties, otherwise your faith will be in vain; the preaching you have heard will be in vain to you and you will sink to hell, unless you attend to the things we tell you.</i>[<i>Journal of Discourses</i>, 4:113]<br><br>You'd know that was Brigham Young if I hadn't told you.<br><br>Now, my brothers and sisters, we have men and women all over this campus who are working, who are applying the principles of which I have spoken, who recognize the gospel as a blessing, who recognize work as a privilege, and who recognize challenge as an opportunity. We have people whose efforts are going to bring about a hastening of the day of our Lord. We have people who are working on the technology to spread the gospel message. We have people who are working on programs to teach people ho to read and people who are working on how to translate languages by computers. These are faithful workers, and the Lord will bless them and inspire them, but those blessings and that inspiration will come to them as they study their work in their own minds and set about applying the best learning at their disposal.<br><br>And how about you, my fellow students? Sitting here are future government leaders, General Authorities, leaders of business, world-famous musicians and artists, and mothers and fathers of these and thousands more. You will receive blessings to use the skills you have obtained, but the Lord expects you to prepare yourself to be used by him. He will crown your efforts with blessings. He will not initiate the effort. If you would be an instrument in the hands of the Lord, put forth the effort to make yourself an instrument that is shiny and sharp. We are recipients of the blessings of commandments and of a philosophy that teaches us to aspire to the gods and promises us help in attaining our aspirations. Let us be off with renewed determination along the upward path of growth.<br><br>In the revelation from the Lord that speaks of blessing us with commandments not a few, the Lord gives us commandments to love our neighbor, to keep the Sabbath, and do much more. He tells us to do these things with thanksgiving, with a glad heart and a cheerful countenance. Then he says, "He who doeth the works of righteousness shall receive his reward, even peace in this world, and eternal life in the world to come" (D&amp;amp;C 59:23). May that be our happy lot I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Dallin H.

<h1>erefore Perfect - Spencer W. Kimball - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I am very grateful indeed for this recognition. Thank you for the Exemplary Manhood Award.<br><br>I recognized, when you stood and sang "We Thank Thee, O God, for a Prophet" as I came into this building this morning, that you are here to recognize the leadership of the Church you love so much and not me personally. I accept your tribute in that vein. This is a very kind remembrance, and I'll try to continue to use it and profit by it. Thank you very much.<br><br>My beloved brothers and sisters, young and older, it is a real privilege to meet with you on this occasion in this great edifice. I do appreciate, more than I can tell you, your presence and your interest and your support, which I feel very keenly.<br><br>A famous sculptor once said that there was nothing to art except just cutting away the marble that he didn't want there. There's nothing to attaining perfection either, except removing all the obstacles and the obstructions which defame or pollute it. We are on the road to perfection.<br><br>In one of the Lord's first sermons was the injunction to become perfect: "Be ye therefore perfect," he said, "even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect" (Matthew 5:48).<br><h2><b>Personal Integrity</b></h2><br>As we speak of perfection, there is much to consider. One must be the soul of honor, full of integrity, and above reproach. One must be true to himself, and, being thus, he cannot then be false to any man. We have made promises and covenants. The Lord has said, "I, the Lord, am bound when ye do what I say; but when ye do not what I say, ye have no promise" (D&amp;amp;C 82:10).<br><br>On the Los Angeles city hall I once read this:<br><br><i>He who violates his oath profanes the divinity of faith itself.</i><br><br>And again, we have from our Holy Bible:<br><br><i>When thou vowest a vow unto God, defer not to pay it, for he hath no pleasure in fools: pay that which thou hast vowed.</i><br><br><i>Better is it that thou shouldest not vow, than that thou shouldest vow and not pay.</i>[Ecclesiastes 5:4–5]<br><br>Now listen to the profound Moses:<br><br><i>If a man vow a vow unto the Lord, or swear an oath to bind his soul with a bond; he shall not break his word, he shall do according to all that proceedeth out of his mouth.</i>[Numbers 30:2]<br><br>It is my understanding that when one is called to the witness stand in a court of law he is required to accept this statement: "You do solemnly swear that the testimony you are about to give in the matter pending before this court shall be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God." The witness has his right hand to the square, and in some instances, in some states, he will probably have his left hand on the Holy Bible, which is a symbol of truth and holiness. Should his testimony be found to be untruthful, he lays himself liable for the penalties of the court.<br><h2><b>Commitment to BYU Standards</b></h2><br>It is my understanding that each student who enrolls in this great institution understands before coming here what he rules and regulations are, and he or she signs the enrollment sheet with a firm promise to obey those rules and regulations. There is no argument. It is definite and firm. Each student approaches the University on his own volition. There is no compulsion.<br><br>There are many other universities in the land, some of which have far less stringent regulations. Every student should consider this well; if he objects to the rules and is unwilling to follow them, he should look elsewhere. If the location, the faculty, the courses, the leadership, and all other conditions are agreeable to him, he should weigh them carefully, then sign the pledge or oath or promise only if willing to observe it strictly. He is most untrue to himself and to the institution to sign and then default.<br><br>When we enroll in this institution we accept the standards; that was not for the registration day only. They are to be effective so long as we retain a place in the student body of this institution. It is not a matter of whether or not one is totally converted to the rule. He or she has accepted the standards, whatever they be. We note that we signed this: "I hereby commit myself to conduct my personal life consistent with the standards of Christian living on and off campus, and I adhere to the code of honor and dress and grooming standards." If I could not agree with the rules of BYU, I would hand back the enrollment sheet and say, "No, since I cannot agree and since I intend not to live the rules, therefore I will not pledge something that I will not do"; or "I have decided to wear immodest dresses. Therefore, I will find a school which will accept my standards"; or "I will not keep the law of chastity. Therefore, I will seek a school which does not require me to so pledge. I will, therefore, not enroll. I will not sign to do one thing and then do another."<br><br>I know one man who nearly moved heaven and earth to get a position on this faculty, and then--having accepted the position, the salary, the requirements--he began at once fighting the rules, complaining at the salary, criticizing the leadership and the program. To me, he was not only unfair, but also immoral.<br><h2><b>Honor for One's Covenants</b></h2><br>Again, we return to the voice of the prophets:<br><br><i>When thou shalt vow a vow unto the Lord thy God, thou shalt not slack to pay it: for the Lord thy God will surely require it of thee; and it would be sin in thee.</i>[Deuteronomy 23:21]<br><br>Remember that the Lord extended to man his free agency. He told Enoch:<br><br><i>Behold these thy brethren; they are the workmanship of mine own hands, and I gave unto them their knowledge, in the day I created them; and in the Garden of Eden, gave I unto man his agency.</i>[Moses 7:32]<br><br>Then again:<br><br><i>For I, the Lord, have decreed in my heart, that inasmuch as any man belonging to the order shall be found a transgressor, or, in other words, shall break the covenant with which ye are bound, he shall be cursed in his life, and shall be trodden down by whom I will;</i><br><br><i>For I, the Lord, am not to be mocked in these things.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 104:5–6]<br><br>It's always refreshing to read the words of Brigham Young, who seemed always to hit the nail on the head. Listen to him. He is sharp and pointed. He says, "When you raise your hands to heaven and let them fall, then pass onward, your covenants unfulfilled, you will be cursed." I feel sometimes like severely lecturing men and women who enter into covenants without realizing the nature of the covenants they make and who use little or no effort to fulfill them. With agency one can murder, commit all the moral, sexual sins, steal, lie, use drugs, be unkind; he may hate, envy, swear, or do whatever he would like. One can hate, or one can love. One can curse, or one can bless. One can live in loneliness, or one can be promiscuous. One can help and assist, or one can hinder. One can blaspheme, or one can honor and bless and pray. One can believe in himself, or he can believe in an overall omniscient Being. One can do as he pleases. Free agency is his. Or he can live his life with the great Redeemer as the center of his life.<br><br>One can touch a hot wire, but he cannot stave off the certain death that results. One can step in front of a powerful oncoming train, but he cannot set aside the mangling that will follow. One can jump from a skyscraper, but he cannot control the results and save his body from the crushing effects of the fall and the abrupt contact with the hard pavement below.<br><br>I think of young people who have graduated from high school and are ready to enter the university as sane young folks who are approaching maturity. If they are mature, then they should not ever need to be reminded what is right and what is wrong and what they have covenanted to do. It would certainly show immaturity if a student should need to be reminded. Surely it would be sad if grown young people could not remember their vows. For a young woman to wear short skirts or other immodest wear when she has covenanted otherwise would not be a matter of cleverness in escaping detection but a definite blot on her character--a blot not easily erased, for it would remain to come into focus a number of times in her life. Should any young man promise a certain performance in clothes or hair or behavior and then evade those restrictions, certainly his error is deep-seated and is not just a difference of opinion. It is nothing to joke about but is a black mark on his character. The scripture says it is a sin when a man so violates his vow. How can any young person rationalize it?<br><h2><b>Importance of Appearance</b></h2><br>Why did devotees of female-styled hair for men struggle so fiercely to encourage an unnatural adornment? "Doth not even nature itself teach you," Paul asked, "that, if a man have long hair, it is a shame unto him?" (1 Corinthians 11:14). And the same Paul said, "But if a woman have long hair, it is a glory to her: for her hair is given her for a covering" (1 Corinthians 11:15). Not all men whose hair is tossed back and forth are effeminate, but surely there is some question about it. How far, we wonder, will men and women go to pay ovations to the god of style? Will men wear rings in their noses when style dictates? Will young people still fall prey to their god of style, which they worship? "Everybody does it."<br><br>Tell me: Is it not true that the dress, the grooming, paints an immediate picture and classifies a person? The famous Jerry Rubin says:<br><br><i>Young kids identify short hair with authority, discipline, unhappiness, boredom, hatred of life and long hair with just "letting go." Wherever we go, our hair tells people where we stand on Vietnam, lawless campus destructions, and drugs. We're living TV commercials for the revolution. Long hair is the beginning of our liberation from sexual oppression.</i><br><br>What group do you wish to follow and with which group do you wish to identify? Will you turn down authority and discipline and rebel against everything that is? Do you wish to be in classes with men who look manly or men who look effeminate?<br><br>Now, beloved youth, we love you. We believe you are strong enough and smart enough to do the thing that will make you manly and godly for the men and sweet and feminine for the women. Remember, you can still do as you wish: buck all the conventions; rebel at all disciplined authority. But remember, others have learned their lessons early in their lives and profited thereby: "Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven if perfect," says the divine authority.<br><br>Do you remember the story of Saul, the king of Israel? Saul had rationalized that his own judgments were superior to those of the Lord. He was chastised severely by the prophet Samuel, who brought forth this powerful lesson:<br><br><i>Hath the Lord as great delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of the Lord? Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of rams.</i><br><br><i>For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry.</i>[1 Samuel 15:22–23]<br><h2><b>Roles of Men and Women</b></h2><br>Now, while we are speaking of these fads and styles, may I say that it is hard for me to understand why men wish to resemble women and why women desire to ape the men. The Lord said, "And I, God, created man in mine own image, in the image of mine Only Begotten created I him; male and female created I them" (Moses 2:27). Man should be productive: "In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground" (Genesis 3:19), Adam was told. And unto the woman the voice of the Lord was saying, "In sorrow [or pain or distress or waiting] thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee" (Genesis 3:16)--or, I like the term "preside over thee."<br><br>Then we're appalled to find an ever-increasing number of women who want to be sexually men and many young men who wish to be sexually women. What a travesty! I tell you that, as surely as they live, such people will regret having made overtures toward the changing of their sex. Do they know better than God what is right and best for them?<br><br>Now, it is wise for every young woman to be grateful for her womanhood and her privilege to create, with her husband and the Eternal God as her partners. To be a mother, to be a wife of a good man--what a great joy! While she is waiting for that holy, sacred hour, let her be happy and content to develop her mind and accumulate knowledge and prepare herself emotionally and spiritually for the happy times.<br><br>For the young man, his education is important, his mission vital; but his proper marriage and his proper life to be a righteous father and to properly provide for and give leadership to a family--that is wonderful, a wonderful role in life to play.<br><br>Let me say, then, that perfection is still our goal. It is reached by climbing steadily upward, controlling all our desires, impulses, and urges. It is possible. Remember that the Lord gave us Abraham as an example and quoted him often: "Abraham received all things, whatsoever he received, by revelation and commandment, by my word, saith the Lord, and hath entered into his exaltation and sitteth upon his throne" (D&amp;amp;C 132:29). This is not a promise; it is a reality. "Go ye, therefore, and do the works of Abraham; enter ye into my law and ye shall be saved" (D&amp;amp;C 132:32).<br><br>I am shocked frequently to see people who wear the worst they possess instead of their best. Grubby clothes certainly have some relationship to grubby people. There is something uplifting when people dress up and attempt to be seen at their best.<br><h2><b>Attaining Goals</b></h2><br>Again, as we enroll in this University, we covenant, as stated before, "I hereby pledge to conduct my personal life consistent with the standards of Christian living taught by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints both on and off campus." And so when one breaks the law of the Word of Wisdom, the law of chastity in any form, the law of the Sabbath, or any of the other laws of the Church, he or she violates the covenant made. Certainly this is a difficult role to play and a difficult goal to attain, but the path has been charted and the way has been found. Man is left without excuse if he does not follow it.<br><br>During our youth and young maturity time flies with great speed. To travel listlessly is just futile. One should have a destination and a goal to reach. One should determine what he wants out of life and then bend every effort toward reaching that goal. He must realize that life is more than meat and drink and fun and fortune. However, it is often easy for us as young people to follow the line of least resistance and, like the Nephites and Lamanites on the eve of the last battle, to be found to be "even as chaff is driven before the wind, or as a vessel is tossed about upon the waves, without sail or anchor, or without anything wherewith to steer her" (Mormon 5:18).<br><br>Paul indicated that all could attain perfection. The fact that most of us are far from perfection is not to say we can't, but we don't. Christ became perfect. He overcame. He suffered hunger, thirst, cold, heat, pain, sorrow, and all that life has to offer in suffering. Each time he overcame, he become more nearly perfect. Paul said:<br><br><i>And being made perfect, he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him.</i>[Hebrews 5:9]<br><br><i>For it became him, for whom are all things, and by whom are all things, in bringing many sons unto glory, to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings.</i>[Hebrews 2:10]<br><br>Perfection is a long, hard journey with many pitfalls. It's not attainable overnight. Eternal vigilance is the price of victory. Eternal vigilance is required in the subduing of enemies and in becoming the master of oneself. It cannot be accomplished in little spurts and disconnected efforts. There must be constant and valiant, purposeful living--righteous living. The glory of the Lord can be had only through correct and worthy marriage and living a clean, worthy life.<br><br>In Psalms we read, "I am a worm, and no man; a reproach of men, and despised of the people" (Psalms 22:6). This is diametrically opposed to our philosophy. Certainly one is not likely to rise high who has that kind of an opinion of himself. Better far is the Psalm which places man on a higher level:<br><br><i>What is man, that thou art mindful of him? and the son of man, that thou visitest him?</i><br><br><i>For thou hast made him a little lower than the angels, and hast crowned him with glory and honor.</i><br><br><i>Thou madest him to have dominion over the works of thy hands; thou hast put all things under his feet.</i>[Psalms 8:4–6]<br><br>Then, from the worm to the god is the potential of man. When he was created, there were put into him the seeds of godhood, the power to think and to reason, the power to lift himself from beasthood to godhood, the power to heal himself and elevate himself.<br><h2><b>Overcoming One's Environment</b></h2><br>There are those today who say that man is the result of his environment and cannot rise above it. Those who justify mediocrity, failure, and even weakness and criminality are certainly misguided. Surely the environmental conditions found in childhood and youth are an influence of power. But the fact remains that every normal soul has its free agency and the power to row against the current and to lift himself to new planes of activity and thought and development. Man can transform himself. Man must transform himself.<br><br>Abraham did. He came out of an idol-worshiping family; yet he headed a dispensation of worshipers of the true and living God. Moses was born to poverty and slavery, was reared in luxury and court honors, and had great opportunities. He came to the heights which man can attain and walked and talked with God. Saul of Tarsus was born and reared and trained, but he completely transformed himself and became an apostle of God. Saul, the king of Israel, came of humble birth, but when Samuel had dealt with him and anointed him and trained him, he became another person. God gave him another heart and turned him into another man.<br><br>Arnold Bennett is quoted as saying:<br><br><i>The real tragedy is the tragedy of a man who never in his life braces himself for his one supreme effort, who never stretches to his full capacity, never stands up to his full stature. To lie down and moan and whine about limited opportunities is the part of weaklings. To grasp the opportunities at hand and walk forward is the way of the strong.</i><br><br>To the Corinthians Paul said this: "And every man that striveth for the mastery is temperate in all things. Now they do it to obtain a corruptible crown; but we an incorruptible" (1 Corinthians 9:25). Self-mastery, then, is the key, and every person should study his own life, his own desires and wants and cravings, and bring them under control.<br><br>Man can transform himself and he must. Man has in himself the seeds of godhood, which can germinate and grow and develop. As the acorn becomes the oak, the mortal man becomes a god. It is within his power to lift himself by his very bootstraps from the plane on which he finds himself to the plane on which he should be. It may be a long, hard lift with many obstacles, but it is a real possibility.<br><br>We are not sure of the author of these lines, but let us contemplate them for just a moment:<br><br><i>You may be what you will be,</i><br><i>But cowards find their false content</i><br><i>In that poor word, environment,</i><br><i>But spirit scorns it and is free.</i><br><br><i>It conquers time; it masters space,</i><br><i>It cows the boastful trickster chance</i><br><i>And bids the tyrant circumstance</i><br><i>Uncrown and find a servant's place.</i><br><br><i>The human will, that force unseen,</i><br><i>The offspring of a deathless soul,</i><br><i>Can hew its way to any goal,</i><br><i>Though walls of granite intervene.</i><br><br>In other words, environment need not be our limit. Circumstance may not need to be our ruler, nor do granite walls or walls of steel need be our prison. In the Doctrine and Covenants we read that<br><br><i>no man is possessor of all things except he be purified and cleansed from all sin.</i><br><br><i>And if ye are purified and cleansed from all sin, ye shall ask whatsoever you will in the name of Jesus and it shall be done.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 50:28–29]<br><h2><b>Beginning to Become Perfect</b></h2><br>To be perfect, then, one must begin early in his life. He or she must become the perfect husband, the perfect wife, the perfect father, the perfect mother, the perfect leader, and the perfect follower. One's marriage must be perfectly performed and perfectly kept on a hallowed plane. One must keep his life circumspect. Each person must keep himself clean and free from lusts. He must shun ugly, polluted thoughts and acts as he would an enemy. Pornographic and erotic stories and pictures are worse than polluted food. Shun them. The body has power to rid itself of sickening food. That person who entertains filthy stories or pornographic pictures and literature records them in his marvelous human computer, the brain, which can't forget this filth. Once recorded, it will always remain there, subject to recall--filthy images.<br><br>As we have stated before, the way to perfection seems to be a changing of one's life--to substitute the good for the evil in every case. Changes can come best if we take one item at a time. For instance, it's not difficult to be prefect in tithe paying, for if one pays one-tenth of his income annually, he is perfect in that respect. It is not difficult to become perfect in avoiding a swearing habit, for if one locks his mouth against all words of cursing, he is en route to perfection in that matter. If one studies the scriptures with all reasonable devotion, he has approached the perfection in that matter also.<br><br>Now, young brothers and sisters and all our friends, we love you. We appreciate you. We sing frequently the song "Shall the Youth of Zion Falter?" and then we stand almost spellbound as we hear the great chorus of numerous voices saying, "No!" We're proud of you. We love to hear your testimonies. We're glad to see you, your faith in the great restoration of the gospel, and all that pertains to it. We proclaim this to be the true gospel of Jesus Christ, the maker of heaven and earth. He is our light and our life. This is his church. We praise and honor and worship him. He lives. That I know, and I bear that witness to you, with all my affection for you, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Spencer W.

<br>
<br>
It surely is inspirational to see this building so completely filled with you wonderful young people. I am humbled in your presence. I am humbled every time I come to this great University. I love it wholeheartedly. I love and respect most highly the great men who operate this school, and I would like to say in the presence of President Oaks how much we love and admire him. I want you to know that we at the Church offices fully and completely sustain him. We hope that you will do likewise.<br><br>Tonight I would like to talk with you about the restoration of the gospel. That is why we are here, because there has been a restoration of the gospel. I would like to talk with you from the standpoint of seeing the Restoration in the true perspective that we Latter-day Saints should understand--a perspective of some two thousand years.<br><br>You remember that the Lord Jesus Christ established the truth when he was on the earth. We Latter-day Saints believe in the Lord Jesus Christ as the Savior of the world, as the Son of God, and as the Creator of all things. We are committed to the doctrine of a special creation, and we believe that Jesus, under the direction of his Father, was the Creator. As John said, "All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made" (John 1:3). Christ came to the earth and gave to us his gospel.<br><h2><b>Apostasy During the Savior's Day</b></h2><br>But it seems that always with the Christians there has been a spirit of dissension and division. Apostasy started even in the Savior's own day. You remember that as early as the events that are recorded in the sixth chapter of John apostasy was evident. The people of his day professed to believe in the law of Moses, but as the Savior himself said, none of them lived it. When Christ began to preach his true and pure doctrines to the people of that day, in contrast to the false teachings of the Pharisees, the Sadducees, the Essenes, and the other<i>-enes</i>that were there, the people got angry with him. Do you remember that some of them sought to take his life? Do you remember too that many who had been following him fell away from him? As the scripture says:<br><br><i>From that time many of his disciples went back, and walked no more with him.</i><br><br><i>Then said Jesus unto the twelve, Will ye also go away?</i><br><br><i>Then Simon Peter answered him, Lord, to whom shall we go? thou hast the words of eternal life.</i><br><br><i>And we believe and are sure that thou are that Christ, the Son of the living God.</i>[John 6:66–69]<br><br>Jesus continued in his work. He fed the four thousand. He fed the five thousand. But you remember that, when the time came for the first meeting on the day of Pentecost following the Crucifixion and the Resurrection, only 120 people came. That is all. The only ones who had the courage and the faith to come to the meeting were 120 people.<br><br>But then the missionary work got underway, and in one day after Peter's great sermon three thousand people were converted to the truth. Missionaries went abroad. The Savior had commanded that they go abroad unto all the nations kindreds, tongues, and people. They began to preach, and many converts were made; but almost as rapidly as conversions were made, apostasies likewise occurred.<br><br>Do you remember what happened in Corinth? The people there began even to repudiate the Christ and no longer believed in his resurrection. Paul argued with them about the Resurrection and testified that Christ truly was resurrected and that "as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive" (1 Corinthians 15:22). Paul reminded them that in Corinth at least four different denominations had started even in Paul's own day.<br><br>The idea that there was just one Christian church in those early centuries is one of the great mistakes that people make. Within the first hundred years after Christ, Christianity was so splintered that there were about thirty different denominations, each one opposed to the others.<br><br>In Corinth at the time Paul wrote, some said, "I am of Paul"; others said, "I am of Apollos"; others, "I am of Cephas"; and there were some who said, "I am of Christ." Paul upbraided them and said, "I beseech you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye all speak the same thing, and that there be no divisions among you; but that ye be perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment. . . . Is Christ divided?" (1 Corinthians 1:10, 13). Christ wasn't divided, but his so-called followers certainly were, and they have been splintered and divided ever since.<br><h2><b>Predictions of the Great Apostasy</b></h2><br>This great apostasy was predicted, as you know very well. The people of that day had the idea that the second coming of Christ was going to take place in the day in which they themselves lived. The apostles began to dissuade them from this position and told them that there should come a great apostasy before the second coming of Christ. Paul wrote to the Thessalonians, "Let no man deceive you by any means: for that day shall not come, except there come a falling away first" (2 Thessalonians 2:3).<br><br>I have been very interested in the way the newest Catholic Bible puts this. The Catholics published a Bible just two years ago called the New American Bible. This verse in that version says, "We beg you brothers not to be so easily agitated or terrified into believing that the day of the Lord is here. Let no one seduce you, since the mass apostasy has not yet occurred." As you know, the Catholics put footnotes at the bottom of their pages, and the footnote on the particular scripture says, "They should not allow themselves to be duped into this way of thinking, for a religious apostasy is destined to precede the Lord's second coming."<br><br>When I was in England, I bought two or three of the Bible versions that the Catholics put out over there. One of them was published in 1947, and to this particular scripture it has this footnote: "This seems to refer to a great apostasy from the Christian faith preceding Christ's return." I thought that was very interesting.<br><br>In 1955 the Catholic church in Great Britain published the Knox version of the Bible, and I will read you just a verse from that version on this reference: "Do not let anyone lead you astray, the apostasy must come first." You see, it was well established that there would be a great--to use the Catholics' word, a<i>mass</i>--apostasy from the Christian faith before the Second Coming.<br><br>These early brethren were also quite explicit in saying that likewise there would be a great restoration of the gospel before the Second Coming should take place. The Lord would not leave us without his truth. He knew by his foreknowledge that there would be this mass apostasy, but he also provided that there should be a restoration of the gospel preparatory to his second coming. And so a great new restorer came to the earth.<br><br>You remember what Peter said. He and John had come to the temple and had entered by the gate beautiful, where they saw a man begging who had been crippled from birth. Peter healed the man, attracting a great crowd. Peter, being the great advocate that he was, took advantage of this opportunity, called the people to repentance, and told them that the same Christ whom they had rejected would come again. His second coming, however, would not take place "until the times of restitution of all things, which God hath spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets since the world began" (Acts 3:21).<br><br>I was interested to look up some of the other Bible translations to see whether the King James was on target there also, and of course it was. The Knox Catholic Bible puts it this way: "Then he will send out Jesus Christ, who has now been made known unto you, but must have his dwelling place in heaven until the time when all is restored anew." Isn't that interesting? "Until all is restored anew."<br><br>The Catholic Bible of 1947, to which I first referred, says, "Whom heaven indeed must receive until the times of the restitution of all things which God has spoken by the mouth of his holy prophets from the beginning of the world."<br><br>The Revised Version of the Protestant Bible says, "Whom heaven must receive until the time for establishing all that God spoke by the mouth of his Holy Prophets from of old."<br><br>The Rotherham Version uses the phrase "the new establishment of all things"; the Twentieth-century Version, "the universal restoration"; the Weymouth Version, "the reconstitution of all things"; and our King James version, which we love best of all, uses the phrase "the times of restitution of all things, which God hath spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets since the world began.<br><h2><b>Preparing the Earth for the Restoration</b></h2><br>We Latter-day Saints must realize that the restoration of the gospel was a mighty drama, the first steps having been taken long before Joseph Smith. If God was going to restore the gospel in the last days, where would it take place and under what conditions?<br><br>Of course, the scripture says that an angel would fly through the midst of heaven bringing the everlasting gospel back to the earth. The scripture says there would be a latter-day restorer, that the Lord would send forth his messenger, and that then he himself would suddenly come to his temple. We know these things, but the world doesn't. Too often we don't put this knowledge in its proper perspective. I would like you to see how the Lord prepared to restore the gospel step by step over a period of hundreds and hundreds of years--literally eighteen centuries.<br><br>The Lord knew that he could not restore the gospel for several centuries in any of the countries of the world. They were controlled by dictators or monarchs who were absolute rulers, and they prohibited religious freedom.<br><br>When my wife and I one day drove into a little town in England, we saw a public square. In it was a beautiful monument, about twenty feet high, a shaft of granite. We were curious and went over to look at that shaft. There on the tablet affixed to it was a statement that this monument marked the place where a seventeen-year-old boy was burned at the stake because he had read the Bible. As my wife and I stood there, I turned to her and said, "What in the world would they have done to a boy who said he had seen God?"<br><h2><b>Preserving the Western Hemisphere</b></h2><br>There was no religious freedom for many years, and God knew that. But he knew also that this restoration of the gospel was to come, and he prepared for it by reserving the Western Hemisphere as a place where he would work out the conditions under which the gospel could be restored. He did not allow any colonization of the Western Hemisphere until he was ready for it.<br><br>We know that various explorers discovered America anciently, well before Christopher Columbus. The Norsemen came over to what they called Vinland, as you remember, and there were others. It is interesting to read about them, but, mark you, not one of them established permanent colonies. God would not allow them here. Colonization was reserved for the people whom the Lord himself would bring to this country. Even though there were earlier discoveries of America, none of them counted so far as God was concerned because he had his eye upon Columbus.<br><br>I hope that when you read the Book of Mormon you will read carefully the last chapter of first Nephi, which refers to the day in which we are living. In this chapter Nephi talked about this land and the gentiles who in latter days would be brought here. Then he said:<br><br><i>And it meaneth that the time cometh that after all the house of Israel have been scattered and confounded</i>[the scattering of the ten tribes and the Jews to all parts of the world],<i>that the Lord God will raise up a mighty nation among the Gentiles, yea, even upon the face of this land</i>[the United States];<i>and by them shall our seed be scattered.</i>[Through the Indian wars the Indians were scattered by the early Americans.]<br><br><i>And after our seed is scattered the Lord God will proceed to do a marvelous work among the Gentiles, which shall be of great worth unto our seed; wherefore, it is likened unto their being nourished by the Gentiles and being carried in their arms and upon their shoulders.</i><br><br><i>And it shall also be of worth unto the Gentiles; and not only unto the Gentiles but unto all the house of Israel, unto the making known of the covenants of the Father of heaven unto Abraham, saying: In thy seed shall all the kindreds of the earth be blessed.</i>[1 Nephi 22:7–9]<br><br>What does that language mean? It means that in the latter days upon this Western Hemisphere a great nation of the gentiles would be established and that from this nation of the gentiles the true restored gospel would be taken to all the house of Israel all over the world. The Savior said essentially the same thing, and I would like to read just one verse that he said in regard to this subject. He also was talking about the gentiles who would occupy this land in these latter days:<br><br><i>For it is wisdom in the Father that they</i>[the gentiles]<i>should be established in this land, and be set up as a free people by the power of the Father, that these things</i>[the gospel]<i>might come forth from them unto a remnant of your seed, that the covenant of the Father may be fulfilled which he hath covenanted with his people, O house of Israel.</i>[3 Nephi 21:4]<br><br>Here is the Savior of the world talking to these Nephites in America after his resurrection, telling them that in the latter days many gentiles would come to this land and that the Lord God would establish a mighty nation among them here in this land for one purpose: that these gentiles to whom the gospel would be restored would take it to the rest of the world. Isn't this significant scripture?<br><h2><b>Columbus's Inspired Mission</b></h2><br>How did all of this come about? Nephi gave us some further explanation when he told about the vision that he was given by the Lord at that time. One of the first things that he said, as he talked about the gentiles in Europe, was this:<br><br><i>And I looked and beheld a man among the Gentiles</i>[in Europe],<i>who was separated from the seed of my brethren by the many waters; and I beheld the Spirit of God, that it came down and wrought upon the man; and he went forth upon the many waters, even unto the seed of my brethren, who were in the promised land.</i>[1 Nephi 13:12]<br><br>Now the time had come. The Lord had control of the discovery and the colonization of America. Nephi was told that there was a man among the gentiles who was "wrought upon" by the Spirit of God, and under that inspiration he came to America. Here is what Columbus himself said about his being guided from on high:<br><br><i>I have seen, and truly I have studied all books and cosmographies, histories, chronicles, and philosophies and other arts for which our Lord with provident hand unlocked my mind, sent me upon the seas and gave me fire for the deed. Those who heard of my enterprise called it foolish, mocked me, and laughed, but who can doubt but that the Holy Ghost inspired me?</i>[Jacob Wasserman,<i>Columbus, Don Quixote of the Seas,</i>p. 18]<br><br>When Columbus went to King Ferdinand, he said, "I came to Your Majesty as the emissary of the Holy Ghost." When he stood before the clergy of San Esteban, he insisted to them that he must be regarded as a man inspired.<br><br>Columbus's own son, Fernando, in a biography of his father, quotes the discoverer as saying on one occasion, "God gave me the faith and afterward the courage so that I was quite willing to undertake the journey." And the last will and testament of Christopher Columbus includes this expression: "In the name of the Most Holy Trinity, who inspired me with the idea and afterward made perfectly clear to me that I could navigate and go to the Indies from Spain by traversing the ocean westward" (Wasserman,<i>Columbus,</i>pp. 46, 61). Columbus was inspired, and Nephi looked upon him and beheld him coming to the Western Hemisphere.<br><br>"And it came to pass that I beheld the Spirit of God, that it wrought upon other Gentiles; and they went forth out of captivity, upon the many waters" (1 Nephi 13:13). Under the direction of the Almighty, colonization began. What kind of people did the Holy Spirit influence? Why, the Pilgrims and the Puritans and others like them! Weren't they worthy of the direction of the Spirit of God? They and many others came to America under divine guidance. Nephi said he saw that "they [the gentiles] did prosper and obtain the land for their inheritance; and I beheld that they were white, and exceeding fair and beautiful, like unto my people before they were slain" (1 Nephi 13:15).<br><h2><b>Establishing Political and Religious Freedom</b></h2><br>Then Nephi saw the Revolutionary War, through which God was planning to set up this nation. He first reserved the land so that undesirables did not colonize here, then sent his own man to discover it, then brought the colonization effort on, and after that gave to the colonists their political freedom.<br><br>Nephi said, "And I beheld that their mother Gentiles were gathered together upon the waters, and upon the land also, to battle against them" (1 Nephi 13:17). Who was the mother country? It is Great Britain, of course. Nephi knew that the mother country would battle against the colonists, and he knew that they would come by land and by sea. I still enjoy reading "Paul Revere's Ride." Do you enjoy reading it? Do you remember the lanterns--one if by land and two if by sea? The British came both ways, by land and by sea, according to both history and prophecy.<br><br><i>And I beheld that the power of God was with them</i>[the colonists]<i>, and also that the wrath of God was upon all those that were gathered together against them to battle.</i><br><br><i>And I, Nephi, beheld that the Gentiles that had gone out of captivity were delivered by the power of God out of the hands of all other nations.</i>[1 Nephi 13:18–19]<br><br>God gave the colonies liberty. If I had another hour here, I would read to you what George Washington and some of the other patriots said about how God gave them the victory, this being in fulfillment of Nephi's vision.<br><h2><b>Constitutional Government</b></h2><br>But just being set free wasn't enough. They had to have a government, and so God provided that government also. You remember that it was a constitutional form and that God raised up the men to write the Constitution:<br><br><i>According to the laws and constitution of the people, which I have suffered to be established, and should be maintained for the rights and protection of all flesh</i>[free agency for everybody],<i>according to just and holy principles;</i><br><br><i>That every man may act in doctrine and principle . . . according to the moral agency which I have given him, that every man may be accountable for his own sins in the day of judgment.</i><br><br><i>Therefore, it is not right that any man should be in bondage one to another.</i><br><br><i>And for this purpose have I established the Constitution of this land, by the hands of wise men whom I raised up unto this very purpose, and redeemed the land by the shedding of blood.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 101:77–80]<br><br>Do you understand the steps that were taken? There was the great apostasy, then the preservation of the Western Hemisphere, next Columbus and the colonization movement, the Revolutionary War to set the colonists free, and then a constitutional form of government which guaranteed free speech and free religion, free assembly and free press.<br><br>All of these events were acts of God leading up to one thing--the restoration of the gospel. It was only half a dozen years or so after America was established as a free constitutional nation that one of the great spirits in the preexistence was sent to earth to be born on December 23, 1805, in a little farmhouse; and he was named Joseph Smith.<br><br>Joseph Smith was given this great and mighty mission. What a wonderful thing it was! It was under the umbrella of a marvelous, inspired constitution that this Church was restored. It couldn't have been restored anywhere else because of the lack of religious freedom. God raised up Joseph Smith for the marvelous purpose of restoring the gospel.<br><h2><b>Spreading the Gospel Abroad</b></h2><br>And now what is happening? The gospel is being taken from this nation to the other nations. We have missionaries in 52 nations, but there are 145 independent nations plus 75 other political units. The scripture says that we are to preach the gospel to every nation, kindred, tongue, and people, and then shall the end come. Then will the Savior come.<br><br>The Book of Mormon has been translated into 39 languages and published in 25. But the Bible has been printed in ten times that many languages. The entire Bible has been published in 253 languages and portions of it, such as the New Testament, in 1,457 tongues and dialects.<br><br>We have a long way to go, but the Lord will shorten his work, he tells us. It hasn't been so very long ago that we had merely a handful of missions in the world. Today we have 112, and if you don't think the Lord is hastening his work, just realize that in the last two years 11 new missions have been organized. Since last Christmas, 6 new missions have been organized.<br><br>Now let us consider another prophecy. Micah said:<br><br><i>In the last days it shall come to pass, that the mountain of the house of the Lord shall be established in the top of the mountains, and it shall be exalted above the hills; and people shall flow unto it.</i><br><br><i>And many nations shall come, and say, Come, and let us go up to the mountain of the Lord and to the house of the God of Jacob; and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths; for the law shall go forth of Zion, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem.</i>[Micah 4:1–2]<br><br>Who is going to build the new Zion? We will, here in the United States, in Jackson County, Missouri. Some people are frightened of the United States collapsing. The United States will not collapse! The wicked in the United States will be destroyed. The Lord has said that, but the Lord will preserve the righteous, and the righteous will carry on until the second coming of Christ:<br><br><i>And he shall judge among many people, and rebuke strong nations afar off; and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruninghooks: nation shall not lift up a sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more. . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . and the Lord shall reign over them in mount Zion from henceforth, even for ever.</i>[Micah 4:3, 7]<br><br>Nephi also prophesied that destruction would come to the wicked here in this land, but he said:<br><br><i>Wherefore, he will preserve the righteous by his power, even if it so be that the fulness of his wrath must come, and the righteous be preserved, even unto the destruction of their enemies by fire. Wherefore, the righteous need not fear; for thus saith the prophet, they shall be saved, even if it so be as by fire. . . .</i><br><br><i>For behold, the righteous shall not perish; for the time surely must come that all they who fight against Zion shall be cut off. . . .</i><br><br><i>And the righteous need not fear, for they are those who shall not be confounded. But it is the kingdom of the devil, which shall be built up among the children of men, which kingdom is established among them which are in the flesh</i>--<br><br><i>. . . and those who belong to the kingdom of the devil are they who need fear, and tremble, and quake; they are those who must be brought low in the dust; they are those who must be consumed as stubble; and this is according to the words of the prophet.</i>[1 Nephi 22:17 ,19, 22, 23]<br><br>How long will the United States stand? Keep in mind that the United States was established in order to provide the conditions under which the Lord would restore the gospel. The United States was established in order that the true church could be again on the earth, that it could be restored in our day here in this great nation of the gentiles.<br><br>Remember what the Savior said and what Nephi said: that this nation was to be set up with this one purpose in mind--bringing the gospel to the rest of the world. That is being done. The righteous will be preserved here in this land to do it, and this nation will be preserved although the wicked will be destroyed.<br><br>How long will the United States last? As long as the Lord needs a home base for carrying forward his work in the earth. America is home base. You from other lands don't need to become jealous of America. Who is jealous of Palestine, where Jesus was born? We are not jealous of that country; we merely recognize the hand of God in sending him there. We must also recognize the hand of God in sending the gospel here to this land. Learn to love America because it is God's land.<br><br>What does Brigham Young have to say about how long there will be an America?<br><br><i>When the day comes in which the Kingdom of God will bear rule, the flag of the United States will proudly flutter unsullied on the flagstaff of liberty and equal rights, without a spot to sully its fair surface; the glorious flag our fathers have bequeathed to us will then be unfurled to the breeze by those who have the power to hoist it aloft and defend its sanctity.</i><br><br><i>How long will it be before the words of the prophet Joseph will be fulfilled? He said if the Constitution of the United States were saved at all if must be done by this people. It will not be many years before these words come to pass. . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . if it is sustained on this land of Joseph, it will be done by us and our posterity.</i>[<i>Discourses of Brigham Young</i>(Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Co., 1973), pp. 360, 361]<br><br>So what is our situation? It is that we are the covenant people of God, and the Lord depends on us to do this work. We must take the gospel to all the world, to all these scores of nations we haven't yet even touched. We will do it! You will do it! You are missionaries! You are under covenant with God, aren't you? Every one of you who has been baptized is under covenant with God; you have taken upon yourselves the name of Christ.<br><br>When you have partaken of the sacrament of the Lord's supper, you have pledged to high heaven that you will be true to him, taking his name on you, keeping his commandments, always remembering him, never forgetting him, and being willing to do the work that must be done.<br><br>So what must you do? You must seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness. Of course, seek careers as well. We need to build the kingdom, we need strength, and we need careers in the world to help us to do that. But remember that earthly careers must be secondary to the great career, which is to be the Latter-day Saints who are to prepare the way for the second coming of Christ. That is our great career--to be good Latter-day Saints, to build the kingdom, to prepare for the second coming of Christ.<br><br>Let us be true to our covenants. Let us never forget that we have taken upon ourselves the name of Christ and that we have pledged in a most sacred manner always to remember him, always to keep his commandments which he has given us, that we may always have his Spirit to be with us. That we may be thus true I earnestly pray in the sacred name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Mark E.

<h1>ts in the Ninety-Nine-Year History of BYU - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
<h2></h2><br>I find that the writing of<i>Brigham Young University Centennial History</i>is in some respects more difficult than being its President for a period of twenty years. While President, I could, within limitations of the rulings of the Board of Trustees, make my own decisions and let others either praise or gripe about them. As historian, I have become the critic and appraiser of eight Presidents whose terms of office have spanned one hundred years, with a student body beginning with 29 elementary students and now enlarged to over 25,000 college resident students and 247,000 involved in off-campus programs of various sorts. You will appreciate that to put this one hundred years of history in a forty-minute talk will require a great deal of condensing. All I can hope to do is to give certain distinctive characteristics of each administration. But here goes.<br><h2><b>Preludes to BYU</b></h2><br>The founding of Brigham Young Academy, the predecessor of Brigham Young University, was preceded by two elementary schools, one after the other, founded by Warren and Wilson Dusenberry, two brothers who were non-Mormons. They were later converted to the Church. Their school, known originally as the Dusenberry School, became so successful and popular that the latter one was taken over as a branch by the University of Deseret, the predecessor of the University of Utah. After two or three years it had 300 students. This dwindled to 221, but even then the Dusenberry School was twice the size of the mother institution in Salt Lake City, which had only 116. Because, however, the lack of support by the University of Deseret and inability to generate enough tuition to carry on, it was forced to close.<br><h2><b>Founding of BYA</b></h2><br>Fortunately, Brigham Young had for some time been contemplating the founding of a school to be given his name. He now came forward and in October of 1875, ninety-nine years ago this month, made a gift by deed of trust of 2.1 acres of land in the center of Provo to establish Brigham Young Academy. Warren Dusenberry, one of the two brothers who founded the Dusenberry School, was elected its principal with the understanding that he would be only temporary and would be succeeded by a permanent principal. A local Board of Trustees was set up to manage the affairs of the institution. It was to be a private school, not an institution of the Church, although in reality and actual practice it relied on either Brigham Young or the Church primarily for support.<br><h2><b>Calling of Maeser</b></h2><br>Dusenberry had begun the practice of law and did not have much time to give to the school. He himself proposed Karl G. Maeser as the first permanent principal. While President Brigham Young was deciding whether to ask Maeser or someone else to become principal, there was a terrific explosion in the northern part of Salt Lake City, which practically destroyed the rooms in a ward meetinghouse where Karl G. Maeser, the first convert to the Church from Saxony, Germany, was teaching. He sought out his bishop, a Brother Sharpe, and found him in the office of Brigham Young. Without any formalities, he bolted into the office to tell of the tragedy, which would deprive him of teaching. Brigham Young immediately looked at him and said, "That is all right, Brother Maeser; we have another mission for you." Having served three missions already, Maeser later explained that he wanted to drop through the floor, but Brigham then explained that he had started a school in Provo and wanted him to go there as its principal. Maeser came back the next day and accepted. When he asked Brigham Young for instructions, the only reply was "You are not to teach even the multiplication tables without the inspiration of the Lord. That is all. God bless you. Goodbye." That has, ever since, been the hallmark of this institution.<br><h2><b>Calling of Abraham O. Smoot</b></h2><br>Since the school, however, was not Church supported, President Young knew that it was necessary for him to have a Board of Trustees with a very strong man as chairman, to whom he could give the financial responsibility for the operation of the school. Some years earlier, President Young had called to his office Abraham O. Smoot and told him he wanted him to go to Provo and help to colonize that place and become president of the stake. Brother Smoot indignantly demurred. He pointed out that he was mayor of Salt Lake City, to which office he had been reelected several times, he was a federal officeholder, he had already served three missions for the Church, and now for the first time in his life he had been able to build a home in which his family was comfortably situated. He had also engaged in several explorations and settlements for the Church. He thought that Brigham had a lot of nerve in asking him to go and build up a new city in Zion. Brigham, who was not accustomed to members of the Church taking exception to what he said, looked him straight in the eyes and said, "Brother Smoot, you can either go to Provo or you can go to hell." Smoot decided to go to Provo. (Some of the Smoot family afterwards moved to Texas and came up with a different version of what Brigham said. They claim that Brigham said, "You can either go to Provo or you can go to Texas or you can go to hell." Some have questioned whether the addition of Texas gave him any more latitude.)<br><br>With the calling of Brother Maeser, President Young made Smoot chairman of the Board of Trustees and gave him the added responsibility of financing Brigham Young Academy. Dusenberry served until the early part of 1876, when Maeser assumed the principalship of the new school.<br><h2><b>The Maeser School</b></h2><br>Maser started with twenty-nine students and served for a period of sixteen years, until 1892. These were all either elementary or high school students. One of the first ones to enroll was George Sutherland, a non-Mormon who later became an associate justice of the United States Supreme Court. In an address which he gave to the graduating class of BYU in 1941, Sutherland described the students in those pioneering days as follows:<br><br><i>Their weekday attire at the maximum consisted of a hat of ancient vintage, sometimes with a well-developed hole through the crown of which a lock of hair might be made to wave like the plume of an Indian on the warpath; a hickory shirt the worse for wear; a pair of pants handed down, perhaps, from a former tenant or series of tenants, held in place (the pants, not the tenants) by one suspender, or allowed to defy the force of gravity with the sole and precarious support afforded by the contours of an immature body. For one to appear among his fellows with any marked elaboration upon his attire was to invoke ironic, not to say insulting comment, often so caustically phrased as to send the misguided lad to the shelter of his home in tears.</i><br><br><i>Nobody worried about child labor. The average boy of ten worked--and often worked very hard--along with the older members to support the family. He milked, cut and carried in the night's wood, carried swill to the pigs, curried the horses, hoed the corn, guided the plow or, if not, followed it in the task of picking up potatoes which had been upturned, until his young vertebrae approached dislocation and he was ready to consider a bid to surrender his hopes of salvation in exchange for the comfort of a hinge in the small of his back.</i>["A Message to the 1941 Graduating Class of Brigham Young University from Mr. Justice George Sutherland," p. 4]<br><br>(May I say that this attire was no more freakish in nature than the present attempt by a few male students to prove their masculinity by growing a beard and by trying at the same time to qualify as one of the fairer sex by growing straggly long hair. But I haven't seen one yet who could compete with a woman in a beauty contest. Rather, each one of them ought to enter the contest for the ugliest male on the campus.)<br><br>The sixteen-year period of Maeser's administration was a struggle for survival. On a number of occasions the Board of Trustees did not know where they could raise enough funds to carry on. One year the faculty served without any salary. Tuition was generally paid in vegetables and other produce, and the teachers had to go around to the different homes to collect this in their wheelbarrows. But no one had a deeper devotion to the Church than Karl G. Maeser. He was the spiritual architect of the Academy. Abraham O. Smoot was its financial savior. Without the latter's personal fortune, which he used whenever the Church permitted him, the school would never have survived. On several occasions the school was threatened with closing, but Smoot never permitted that to happen. Without Abraham Smoot, neither the school nor Maeser would have survived.<br><br>In addition to the academic poverty, Maeser found that he had to compete with a large number of denominational schools throughout the territory of Utah founded by the Presbyterians, Methodists, Baptists, and Congregationalists. The competition was keen because these sects had raised millions of dollars in a campaign throughout the United States for these schools to convert the benighted Mormons to Christianity. As a matter of fact, by 1888 there were eighteen academies plus seventy-two elementary schools founded by these denominations in Utah, as compared to only ten academies maintained by the Church, of which BYA was the main one. The leaders of these Protestant schools, however, soon came to realize that Mormon students came to their schools, enjoyed all their educational facilities, and then went back to their ward as leaders in the Mutual Improvement Association and other auxiliary organizations of the Church, so most of these competing schools were gradually discontinued. Mormon students accepted the educational training of the other denominations but rejected their brand of Christianity.<br><br>Maeser also had other trials and tribulations. One night at the beginning of one of the school terms in 1884, the Academy, which was located on what is now Center Street and Third West, burned to the ground. The next day Reed Smoot, a son of Abraham O. Smoot, who some twenty years later became U.S. senator, saw Brother Maeser on the street and said, "Brother Maeser, I am sorry to know that Brigham Young Academy is burned."<br><br>Brother Maeser looked up and said, "No, Brother Smoot, only the building is burned," and in two days they had rented space to carry on another school.<br><br>These were also the days when there were fierce prosecution and persecution of the Saints who practiced polygamy, and Brother Maeser, in response to a request of the leaders of the Church the very year that he became principal, had taken a second wife. He had not wanted to do so, but was so loyal to the Brethren that he accepted their advice. What is generally not understood about polygamy is that in many instances polygamy was entered into to provide homes for women who would otherwise remain single, not for the reasons the gentiles ascribed to its practice. In common with hundreds of others, Karl G. Maeser was arrested and tried for polygamy. He pleaded guilty before Judge Dusenberry the predecessor who had actually recommended Maeser as his successor. Many of the stalwart citizens of Provo, including George Sutherland, pleaded that he not be given a prison sentence. The judge followed his recommendation but gave him the maximum fine of three hundred dollars. The next day the students at BYA, in a devotional assembly, raised the three hundred dollars and paid his fine.<br><h2><b>Maeser as Superintendent of Church Schools</b></h2><br>In 1888 Maeser was appointed superintendent of Church schools and began to organize Church schools in various parts of the territory in competition with BYA. This inflamed Smoot, who though a man could not serve two masters. So in 1890 it was agreed that in 1892 Maeser would retire as principal and devote his entire time to being superintendent of Church schools.<br><h2><b>Cluff Administration</b></h2><br>In looking for a successor to Maeser, the Board chose a convert from England, then twenty-seven years of age, who had been on the faculty since he was twenty years of age and who was probably the most brilliant and at the same time faithful member of the Church on the faculty. His name was James E. Talmage, but before public announcement of this decision the Brethren in Salt Lake City had selected Talmage as president of the LDS College in Salt Lake City. So he never served as principal of Brigham Young Academy. The Board then chose Benjamin Cluff, Jr., who had just obtained his bachelor's degree from the University of Michigan, as assistant principal with the understanding that when Maeser retired he would be the principal.<br><br>Except for their dedication to the Church, Maeser and Cluff were extreme opposites. Maeser was sixty-three years old, staid in appearance, an adherent of Prussian methodology in education, conservative, and sober in his demeanor; while Cluff was only thirty-four, vibrant, impetuous, and imbued with new educational ideas he had brought from Ann Arbor. Maeser advocated a closed society; Cluff gloried in his stay at the University of Michigan and his association with the faculty there. To Maeser, "evolution was taboo," and psychology was "the chimera of the human mind." Cluff's mind was open to new ideas. Maser thought the Church Educational System, especially Brigham Young Academy, could produce sufficient teachers to supply the needs of the Church, while Cluff felt there was much in the gentile world which the Church could use. Maeser had begun his educational training at sixteen and received a sound German education with a rich classical background. Cluff, a product of pioneer Utah, had not entered the University of Michigan until he was twenty-nine. Maser was harnessed and broken in; Cluff seemed almost like an unbroken colt. Maeser had become accustomed to the deliberate and often slow speed of Church machinery; Cluff was impatient with delay.<br><br>At the beginning of 1892 the school moved from downtown into the new Educational Building on the lower campus, which was the first building on that block. Maeser bowed out as principal and Cluff took over. A few years later Cluff returned for a year to the University of Michigan for a master's degree, which was the highest degree then held by anyone on the faculty of BYA.<br><br>Cluff brought some innovations to BYA which he had picked up in Michigan. He began real college work and separated the high school from the college students so that they had different classes and different training. He introduced college yells, which were an abomination to Maeser and certain members of the Board of Trustees. He introduced athletics, which Maeser, who was a member of the Board of trustees, required him to abandon. Maeser's point of view was, in effect, the prevailing view of university presidents of the time. The president of Cornell was requested to allow a group of students at that institution to go to Michigan to play a football game. He refused the invitation on the following grounds: "I refuse to let forty of our boys travel four hundred miles merely to agitate a bag of wind."<br><br>Like Maeser's sixteen years with the Academy as principal, Cluff's twelve years represented a fight for survival. For in 1895 Abraham O. Smoot died and the school no longer could rely on help from him in its emergencies. One year later, in 1896, Cluff proposed that the Church incorporate BYA as an auxiliary organization. This had been proposed before but refused. This time it was approved, and for the first time in the school's twenty-one-year history, the Church had legal control of the Academy and by the same act was financially responsible for its operation.<br><br>After being vice-principal or President for about ten years, Cluff, with the express approval of the Board of Trustees, organized an expedition to travel to South America for the purpose of proving the authenticity of the Book of Mormon. Besides himself, there was only one other faculty member in the party; the others were students. While the Church leaders gave their consent, it was not to be a Church expedition, but one merely sponsored by Brigham Young Academy, which contributed the magnificent sum of two hundred dollars for this expedition. The members had to supply their own horses or donkeys and other equipment. There were twenty-three members in the party. (George H. Brimhall was left in charge of Brigham Young Academy.) When the party arrived at Nogales, the entrance to Mexico, they were denied admission except upon payment of a large customs fee. While President Cluff was negotiating among the Mormon colonies in Juarez for help in raising this fee and also in trying to have it reduced, Brother Heber J. Grant, a member of the Council of the Twelve, visited the party at Nogales. President Cluff and his assistant, Walter Wolfe, were in Juarez at the time making further negotiations for entrance into Mexico. Brother Grant became convinced that these young men in the party did not have the experience necessary to enter foreign countries like Mexico, Guatemala, and Colombia, where there were constant revolutions. He feared for their lives. He thought, for one thing, that they didn't have the proper leadership, and he had heard reports that the young men in their overland travels from Provo to Nogales had not always acted with proper decorum. He, therefore, returned to Salt Lake City and proposed to the First Presidency and Council of Twelve that the expedition be called off; the General Authorities agreed and had Joseph F. Smith, who was a counselor in the First Presidency and who was on his way to Mexico, report to Cluff that it was the advice of the General Authorities that the trip be abandoned. But Cluff and some of his men were obdurate. They said they would rather die in the attempt than give up. So they were given permission for a much smaller party to continue on their own responsibility but without any sponsorship or help from the Church or Academy. Of the original party of twenty-three, fifteen therefore returned to Utah and the other eight took 11/2 years to make the balance of the journey into Colombia, where they hoped to discover Zarahemla.<br><br>During this time they suffered all kinds of hardships, privations, starvation, and serious illnesses. Cluff himself nearly lost his life trying to ford a river. Others were bitten by scorpions and snakes, which made it impossible for them to travel for many days. At one place they were actually arrested and thrown into jail and accused of murder. Finally, however, they arrived in Colombia. But that country was then in the midst of a revolutionary war, and the government denied them the right to pursue further their journey for fear that they would be murdered. Disillusioned, discouraged, famished, and heartbroken, they finally had to abandon the expedition and return to Provo by ship by way of Cuba. One of the hardy souls, Chester Van Buren, stayed on alone to gather botanical specimens for Brigham Young Academy. Had they followed the advice of Brother Grant, they would have saved themselves eighteen months of disease and torture, but they had been given their free agency and they had exercised it.<br><br>Cluff returned to Provo in 1902. During the two years he was away from Provo, many of the leaders of the Church under whom Cluff had served had died, including Karl G. Maeser, President Lorenzo Snow, and President George Q. Cannon, who had originally urged Brigham Young to found the Academy and who for over twenty-five years had been the main supporter of the institution in Salt Lake City. The school Cluff found when he returned from South America was far different from the one he had left. It was enlarged in every way, including a new building. Nevertheless, Brimhall willingly surrendered his office to President Cluff, his former teacher, who again took up the presidency. Cluff had a very successful administration for the next two years. During his entire administration the faculty grew from 21 to 59 and the student body grew from 275 to 1,622.<br><br>Tragically, Walter Wolfe, who was Cluff's assistant on the expedition but who had left the party before they arrived in Colombia, then preferred certain charges of misconduct against Cluff, including (1) mismanagement, (2) misrepresentation, (3) misappropriation of funds, and (4) immorality, which allegedly occurred during his Mexican expedition. He was then tried by the Board of Trustees. The charges so shocked him that he made no defense. Nevertheless, he was exonerated of all charges. However, the stigma attached to his public image was so great that even though he had been found innocent Cluff resigned the presidency to return to Mexico as manager of a large rubber plantation. As one of his final acts at the Academy (November 1903), he proposed to the Board that it change the name of the school to Brigham Young University, which had been his aim all fourteen years of his administration. There followed a vigorous dispute over this proposal. Thinking the school was not qualified to become a university, Anthon H. Lund of the First Presidency vigorously opposed it but was outvoted by his brethren. In his diary for the day President Lund recorded, "I hope their head will grow big enough for their hat." Wolfe went to Washington, where he testified against the seating of Reed Smoot as a senator. He later resigned form the Academy.<br><h2><b>Administration of Brimhall</b></h2><br>With Cluff's resignation, the Board began its search for a new President. Very shortly after Cluff's return, Brimhall had taken seriously ill and spent most of two years in California and Canada trying to recuperate. But he had been so successful during the expeditionary absence of Cluff that many of the Board thought he should be recalled. Others thought that Joseph B. Keeler, who had been his first assistant, should be appointed. In a vote of the Board, each man received an equal number of votes. However, one of the Board members, Stephen Chipman, changed his vote in favor of Brimhall, who was formally elected as President.<br><br>Brimhall was largely a self-educated man. He had never had the academic training of either of his predecessors. He had not entered BYA as a student until he was forty years of age. His education began and ended at BYA before the school had really achieved university status. But he was a dynamic speaker and had a certain homespun manner that appealed very much to the people of his generation. He was a combination of both Maeser and Cluff. While these two men never got along with each other, Brimhall got along with both. He began immediately to engage a brilliant faculty, a number of whom had their Ph.D.'s, which gave the faculty new scholastic credentials. But by about 1910, Brimhall, in common with many university presidents, had allowed his faculty to assume so many administrative duties that the administration was to a large extent in the hands of the faculty. The new Ph.D. members, who were probably the most popular members of the faculty, began forthrightly to teach the doctrine of organic evolution with all of its implications. This brought violent controversy on the campus in which the Board of Trustees intervened. Two of the most vocal advocates of the doctrine were discharged; others subsequently resigned.<br><br>Many thought BYU would not survive this crisis. The newspapers and event he faculty assumed that the teachers were discharged because they had taught evolution. Your centennial history staff has researched this carefully and found that the teaching of evolution per se was not the real cause of their dismissal. They were discharged because they were as intolerant of others' views as others were intolerant of theirs. The controversy was settled by President Joseph F. Smith, who in a diplomatic article explained that the Church had no philosophy about the "modus operandi" employed by the Lord in his creation of the world. He advised, however, that because of the immaturity of the students it would be wise as a matter of "propriety," not as "belief," to leave evolution out of discussion in the Church schools. Otherwise we would develop a "theological aristocracy in the Church." This pretty much brought the controversy to an end; and, despite gloomy forebodings, during the next approximately ten years of the Brimhall administration the school continued on its course although again it was always in financial trouble. The Church itself during this period had some rough financial years and was unable to give much support to the school. Because of the evolution controversy, Brimhall from then on pursued a very conservative policy and never again embarked into controversial fields.<br><br>With the departure of those whose services were terminated and others who left in sympathy with them, Brimhall was once again able to assume the authority that should always have gone with his office. There are a number who think that Brigham Young University during the closing years of Brimhall's administration was nothing more than a religious seminary. This was only partially true, for during that period of time Brigham Young University turned out some of its most renowned graduates, such as Franklin S. Harris, who succeeded Brimhall as President of BYU; Harvey Fletcher, who became second in command at Bell Laboratories; Vern Knudsen, who was later chancellor of the University of California at Los Angeles; Henry Aldous Dixon, who became president successively of Weber College, Utah State Agricultural College, and a congressman from Utah; David J. Wilson, who became a federal judge in New York City; G. Oscar Russell, who became head of the largest phonetics laboratory of the country (at that time stationed at Ohio State University); A. Ray Olpin, who later became president of the University of Utah; Robert Hinckley, who was chairman of the Civil Aeronautics Authority in charge of all civil aviation in the country; and a number who became members of the faculties of different universities in the country, including Wayne Hales and Vasco Tanner of this University.<br><br>Brimhall, during his administration, chose as his first counselor Joseph B. Keeler, who had been his rival for the presidency, and Edwin S. Hinckley as his second counselor. Although passed over for the presidency, Keeler was very loyal to Brimhall. In addition to his teaching load, he took care of the finances and kept the University on an even keel. Hinckley, who like Brimhall was a great orator, dreamed of the future. At about the time that Orville and Wilbur Wright took their first heavier-than-air machine flight at Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, Hinckley predicted to his class that he would live to see the day when a man would have breakfast in New York and have dinner in San Francisco. He was scoffed at by members of the faculty. Brother Keeler reprimanded him but said he supposed Hinckley had done no lasting harm because no one would believe such a fantastic story. Hinckley lived to see that dream come true when Lieutenant Russell Maughan of Logan actually carried out that flight. Unfortunately, he died before his son Robert, who was also a student at Brigham Young University during the Brimhall Administration, was appointed chairman of the Civil Aeronautics Authority in charge of all commercial aviation in the United States.<br><br>President Hinckley also forecast that the time would come when the University, which was then still on the lower campus, would extend all the way to Squaw Peak. Including the Language Training Mission, it is now that far. Hinckley's children, led by Robert, have now set up a large scholarship fund for students at Brigham Young University.<br><br>During the closing years of Brimhall's administration, he was physically so incapacitated with heart trouble that, in order to preside over the student body assemblies held in old College Hall, he was carried up the stairs by Ed Hinckley, one of his counselors, through a back stairway so that he could not be seen.<br><br>At that time the school also lost its momentum and had fewer graduates than in prior years. I had the privilege of graduating in the last class under Brimhall. There were only twelve graduates, so you can see why it was possible for me to be president of my class and editor of the school paper--the students didn't have many choices.<br><h2><b>Administration of Franklin S. Harris</b></h2><br>Brimhall was succeeded at BYU by Franklin S. Harris, who had graduated form the institution during Brimhall's presidency. As Cluff was the complete opposite of Maeser, so Harris was the antithesis of Brimhall. Whereas Brimhall had no orthodox earned degree of any kind, Harris was the first President to have a doctorate degree, having graduated with a Ph.D. from Cornell. He had been one of the top officers at Utah State Agricultural College before being appointed President of BYU.<br><br>At the time Harris became President, the school was really not organized as a university. He changed this by reorganizing three loosely organized colleges and by creating two new colleges. Also at the time he became President, BYU had not been accredited by any of the accrediting associations. He immediately began to work for accreditation, and during the first six or seven years of his administration he had so improved the organization of the school, the quality of the faculty and curriculum, and established such improved scholarship standards for students that Brigham Young University became accredited by all of the prominent accreditation agencies. This was a major accomplishment and changed the school from what some thought was nothing but a glorified high school to a recognized university.<br><br>He also was responsible for the enlargement of the Brimhall Building and the construction of the Heber J. Grant Library, the Joseph Smith Memorial, and other buildings. But the depression of the thirties prevented the ultimate realization of his goals.<br><br>Harris was a great internationalist and world traveler--more so than any other President of the University. On one occasion he was invited by the International Jewish Organization to investigate the prospects of Jewish colonization in Russia. He was chairman of the delegation which went there and spent over six months touring that country and making a careful examination. He recommended the establishment of a separate Jewish state in the Soviet Republic. His recommendations were accepted by the leaders of the Soviet Union, and the state of Biro-Bidjan, which was established for that purpose, still functions in Russia. Even so, the Jews form only a minority of this particular state, which has survived as a state in the Soviet Republic for the last forty-four years.<br><br>In 1926 President Harris was invited to read a paper at a world conference for leaders in agriculture in Tokyo. With the consent of his Board, he used this as a beginning of a trip around the world which lasted for nearly one year, during which time he visited a great many universities to obtain ideas for Brigham Young University.<br><br>Finally, he was invited by the Iranian government to come to that country and to organize their department of agriculture. This assignment also lasted a year. As a result of these trips around the world, Brigham Young University became well known, and in some respects better known, internationally than in the United States.<br><br>In 1945 Franklin S. Harris resigned to become president of Utah State Agricultural College, being convinced that as an agriculturist he could probably do more good, for the rest of his career, in Logan than in Provo. Indeed, his greatest friend on the Board of Trustees, John A. Widtsoe, advised him that this appointment would cap a brilliant career.<br><br>Harris served as President of BYU for twenty-four years--longer than any other President. In order to equal that record, President Oaks will have to remain as President until 1996, which under present rules would be his age of retirement.<br><h2><b>Administration of Howard S. McDonald</b></h2><br>President Harris was succeeded by President Howard S. McDonald. Since Harris's resignation was known well in advance of his leaving the school, there was a great deal of speculation among the faculty as to who his successor would be. Dean Carl Eyring quipped that from the gossip of the faculty he had heard of several men who had already been appointed President.<br><br>McDonald had his doctorate degree from the University of California. His appointment was of the "dark horse" variety. He had been superintendent of schools in Salt Lake City for only a short time and had not been mentioned among the dozens who were ambitious to be President of BYU or who had been named by their friends. The Second World War ended just before McDonald took charge, and he was faced with a deluge of students which BYU was not prepared to take. In fact, student enrollment jumped from 1,508 to 5, 440 during the four years he was here. He managed to take care of these students by obtaining surplus property from an air base in Ogden, which he converted into residence halls, and by appealing to the loyalty of the citizens in Provo to take in as many students as they could accommodate.<br><br>He served for four years and then resigned to become president of Los Angeles City College and Los Angeles State College of Applied Sciences, which had an enrollment about three times that of BYU. McDonald, who was a devoted Church member, was accustomed to working in state universities where the trustees made certain overall decisions and then left the administration entirely to the President. His association with BYU's Board of Trustees, in which the Board took part in the day-to-day administration of the school, was a new adventure to which he did not adjust readily.<br><br>He was a very vigorous man and didn't like the Board to turn down any of his recommendations. At one time he made a recommendation for the expenditure of several million dollars for a building program, as a result of which some members of the Board called him "the spendthrift from California." Compared to his successor, he was a "piker." At one time also he proposed a 25 percent increase in salaries. This was really more than the Board could take.<br><br>During the short four years he was at BYU, President McDonald did accomplish many things:<br><br>1. In response to an assignment given him by the First Presidency of the Church at the time of his appointment to study whether BYU should be abandoned, he reported it should not, thus ending the last of many challenges to the continued existence of the Y.<br><br>2. He took care of the phenomenal increase in students.<br><br>3. He established a modern health center for the care of the students in times of illness or accident.<br><br>4. He made a study of faculty salary schedules of surrounding schools which made the Board conscious of the low salaries of the faculty.<br><br>5. He aroused the Board of Trustees to a sharp realization of the need for new permanent buildings; they in turn authorized the Eyring Science Center and the George Albert Smith Fieldhouse, which set the stage for the greatly increased building program under my administration.<br><br>6. He was also responsible for persuading the Board of Trustees to have a Utah County stake establish Church branches on the campus. Finally he made a major reorganization of the entire student personnel organization so that it more nearly met the needs of a growing student body.<br><br>There was a period of 11/2 years between the time of McDonald and my administration which was presided over in a very dignified manner by Christen Jensen, who had been called out of retirement for that purpose.<br><h2><b>Administration of Ernest L. Wilkinson</b></h2><br>McDonald was succeeded in 1951 by my administration. I had three distinct advantages over prior Presidents:<br><br>1. My philosophy accorded entirely with the philosophy of the Board of Trustees, which was that the Board should set the policy, the President should administer that policy, and the faculty should be involved in administrative matters only to the extent that the President requested, and even then their decisions were only advisory. This got me off to a great start with the Board of Trustees.<br><br>2. My predecessors had laid a good foundation for future growth, especially Presidents Harris and McDonald.<br><br>3. The Church for the first time was not in financial difficulty and could, therefore, spend more on education. Fortunately, this period coincided with the administration of President McKay who was a great champion of education.<br><br>As to the accomplishments which occurred during my twenty years as President, suffice it to say I have been given much more credit than that to which I am entitled, for the credit belongs largely to the Board of Trustees and the faithful tithe payers of the Church, who have paid the bill. During that period the student body increased in size six times, the faculty five times, the budget seven times, and a building program which cost well over $100 million was completed. In my opinion, the five main accomplishments during the twenty years of my administration in the order of their importance were (1) the founding of ten stakes composed of over one hundred wards on the campus to serve the religious needs of the students; (2) the distinction of becoming, not only the largest Church-related university, but also the largest private institution in the country; (3) the vast improvement of scholarship among the students, which according to a survey at one time increased as dramatically as did the size of the student body; and (4), which is less important, but which was indispensable for the other three accomplishments--the development of a great campus claimed by many to be the most beautiful campus in America; and (5) the authorization to found a law school.<br><h2><b>Oaks Administration</b></h2><br>Neither time nor duration of his present tenure permits even a summarization or appraisal of the Oaks administration. Suffice it to say that he is carrying on in fulfillment of the prophetic utterances of Maeser, Cluff, Brimhall, Harris, McDonald, and myself. In my humble judgment, Presidents of this University have the same prophetic powers with respect to BYU as the President of the Church has with respect to the Church as a whole. Principal Maeser likened BYU to a banyan tree which would spread its branches far and wide to "take roots for themselves." Given the right kind of soil and nourishment, it could thus spread to the entire world.<br><br>President Cluff, in a letter of November 5, 1893, from Ann Arbor, where he was earning his master's, wrote to acting President Brimhall that he was<br><br><i>well pleased with the way you are conducting the school. I think that it is now fully demonstrated that it is not so much the man who stands at the head of the Academy as it is the spirit that actuates the school. For in my hands it did not lose much of its importance and now in yours it continues steadily in its onward course.</i><br><br>President Brimhall prophesied:<br><br><i>The time will come when the cry will not be where shall we get the money but how shall we sue the money that we have.</i>["BYU Faculty Minutes," 23 May 1895]<br><br>(This utterance, President Oaks claims, has not yet been fulfilled.)<br><br>President Harris, in one of his initial addresses, exclaimed: "Behold the greatest university campus in all the world--in embryo" (Daily Herald, 16 October 1923). We then had only the Maeser and Brimhall buildings on this upper campus.<br><br>President McDonald prophesied "that under the leadership of inspired men BYU was destined to become a great university" ("Faculty Meeting Minutes," 3 October 1949).<br><br>In 1954 I bore my testimony to the faculty in the following words:<br><br><i>No one who accepts the Restored Gospel will question the prophecies of the Prophet of the Lord that this will some day have on it the greatest body of scholars in the world because they will have as their sources of knowledge the learning not only of men, but the source of all knowledge, revelation from our Heavenly Father, and because they will be responsive not only to the scholarship of men, but to the testimony and promptings of the Holy Spirit.</i>["Preschool Faculty Workshop Address, 17 September 1954]<br><br>The faculty at that time had only begun to assume its present scholastic status.<br><br>In 1971, in another address to the faculty, I expressed the hope that<br><br><i>all who are associated with this University will never forget that it was started by a prophet of God and that prophets still guide its destiny. No statement that I can make to you gives me more satisfaction than to say that BYU is now the University many dreamed it would become.</i><br><h2><b>Future of BYU</b></h2><br>President John Taylor, the successor to Brigham Young, long before the close of the last century predicted, "Zion will be as far ahead of the world in everything pertaining to learning of every kind as we are today in regard to religious matters" (<i>Journal of Discourses</i>, 21:100).<br><br>Later, Francis M. Lyman, President of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, proclaimed, "This School will be needed in the Millennium."<br><br>We now aspire to fulfill the dream of the Honorable Charles H. Malik, former president of the United Nations General Assembly, who voiced the fervent hope that someday<br><br><i>a great university will arise somewhere--I hope in America--to which Christ will return in His full glory and power, a university which will, in the promotion of scientific, intellectual and artistic excellence, surpass by far even the best secular universities of the present, but which will at the same time enable Christ to bless it and act and feel perfectly at home in it.</i>["Education in Upheaval: The Christian's Responsibility,"<i>Creative Help for Daily Living</i>21, no. 18 (September 1970)]<br><br>That Brigham Young University will become that university I pray in his name. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Ernest L. Wilkinson was president of Brigham Young University from 1951 to 1971. This Founder's Day address was given on 10 October 1974.</i></i><br><br><i>© Brigham Young University. All rights reserved.</i>

<h1>Your Heart Be Troubled: Staying Positive - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
It is good to be here with you this morning, my dear young friends. I ask that the Lord will help me to say something that will help you.<br><br>Recently I spent the better part of a week in Washington, D.C., living in a hotel room. Each morning I watched the early news on television and then read the morning paper while eating breakfast. President Ford had just granted a pardon to his predecessor. The amount of venom that spewed from the mouths and pens of the commentators was unbelievable. They were aflame with indignation. In all that week of morning watching and reading I never heard nor read among the commentators and editorialists a single paragraph of positive thought. The speakers were brilliant. They were men of incisive language, scintillating in expression. The columnists were masters of the written word. With studied art they poured out the sour vinegar of invective and anger, judging as if all wisdom belonged to them. At the conclusion of that week, I too made a negative observation. Said I, "Surely this is the age and place of the gifted pickle sucker."<br><br>The tragedy is that this spirit is epidemic. Criticism, fault-finding, evil speaking--these are of the spirit of the day. They are in our national life. To hear tell these days, there is nowhere a man of integrity among those holding political office. In many instances this spirit has become the very atmosphere of university campuses. The snide remark, the sarcastic gibe, the cutting down of associates--these, too often, are of the essence of our conversation. In our homes wives weep and children finally give up under the barrage of criticism leveled by husbands and fathers. Criticism is the forerunner of divorce, the cultivator of rebellion, sometimes a catalyst that leads to failure. Even in the Church it sows the seed of inactivity and finally apostasy.<br><br>I come this morning with a plea that we stop seeking out the storms and enjoy more fully the sunlight. I am suggesting that we "accentuate the positive." I am asking that we look a little deeper for the good, that we still our voices of insult and sarcasm, that we more generously compliment virtue and effort. I am not asking that all criticism be silenced. Growth comes of correction. Strength comes of repentance. Wise is the man who can acknowledge mistakes pointed out by others and change his course. I am not suggesting that our conversation be all honey and blossoms. Clever expression that is sincere and honest is a skill to be sought and cultivated.<br><br>What I am suggesting and asking is that we turn from the negativism that so permeates our society and look for the remarkable good in the land and times in which we live, that we speak of one another's virtues more than we speak of one another's faults, that optimism replace pessimism, that our faith exceed our fears.<br><br>When I was a boy our father often said to us:<br><br><i>Cynics do not contribute.</i><br><i>Skeptics do not create.</i><br><i>Doubters do not achieve.</i><br><h2><b>Challenges to Our Political System</b></h2><br>I should like to say a few words about America. I know that there are many here who come from other lands. I think I have been in all of the lands from which you come. I appreciate your people, their innate goodness, their art, their industry, their strength. I have marveled at the beauty of the earth, the wonder and magnificence of God's creations, as I have seen them in every part of the world. No land is without its beauty, no people without their virtues, and I hope that you who come from elsewhere will pardon my saying a few words concerning my own native land, America. I know that she has problems. We have heard so much of them for so long. But surely this is a good land, a choice land, a chosen land. To me it is a miracle, a creation of the Almighty. It was born of travail. The Constitution under which we live is the keystone of our nation. It was inspired of God. Of it, the great Gladstone said, "As the British Constitution is the most subtle organism which has proceeded from progressive history, so the American Constitution is the most wonderful work ever struck off at a give time by the brain and purpose of man" ("Kin Beyond the Sea,"<i>North American Review</i>, September 1878).<br><br>In a few months we shall celebrate the two hundredth anniversary of the founding of the nation. Is it not a miracle that through these two centuries of time our system of government has remained intact, our Constitution has held while storms have beaten about us from within and without?<br><br>There is too much fruitless, carping criticism of America. Perhaps the times are dark. There have been dark days in every nation. I should like to repeat the words of Winston Churchill spoken exactly thirty-three years ago today. Bombs were then dropping on London. The German juggernaut had overrun Austria, Czechoslovakia, France, Belgium, Holland, Norway, Russia. All of Europe was in the dread grasp of tyranny, and England was to be next. In that dangerous time, when the hearts of many were failing, this great Englishman said:<br><br><i>Do not let us speak of darker days; let us speak rather of sterner days. These are not dark days; these are great days--the greatest days our country has ever lived; and we must all thank God that we have been allowed, each of us according to our stations, to play a part in making these days memorable in the history of our race.</i>[Address at Harrow School, 29 October 1941]<br><br>Earlier he had said to his people and to the whole world, following the catastrophe at Dunkirk when the prophets of doom foretold the end of Britain:<br><br><i>We shall not flag or fail. ... We shall fight in France, we shall fight on the seas and oceans, we shall fight with growing confidence and growing strength in the air, we shall defend our island, whatever the cost may be, we shall fight on the beaches, we shall fight on the landing grounds, we shall fight in the fields and in the streets, we shall fight in the hills; we shall never surrender.</i>[Speech on Dunkirk, House of Commons, 4 June 1940]<br><br>It was such talk as this, and not the critical faultfinding of glib cynics, that preserved the great people of Britain through those dark and deadly days when all the world thought their little island would go under.<br><br>It shall be so with America if we will do less speaking of her weaknesses and more of her goodness and strength and capacity. I was stirred in my heart by the words of our late, great President Harold B. Lee, who, speaking to a group such as this, said:<br><br><i>This nation, founded on principles laid down by men whom God raised up, will never fail. ... I have faith in America. You and I must have faith in America if we understand the teachings of the gospel of Jesus Christ.</i>[<i>Deseret News</i>, 27 October 1973]<br><br>I doubt not that we shall have days of trial. I am confident that so long as we have more politicians than statesmen, we shall have problems. But I am certain that if we will emphasize the greater good and turn our time and talents from vituperative criticism, from constantly looking for evil, and lift our sights to what may be done to build strength and goodness in our nation, America shall continue to go forward with the blessing of the Almighty and stand as an ensign of strength and peace and generosity to all the world.<br><h2><b>Economic Challenges</b></h2><br>We hear much talk of economic depression these days. Heaven forbid that we should ever slip again into the kind of monetary quagmire through which we struggled in the 1930s. Those were the days of the long soup lines, of suicides that came of discouragement, of a bleakness of life which few of you can understand. I hope and pray that such hard times will never come again. But I think it not impossible or even improbable if enough people, in the spirit of negativism and defeatism, talk about it and predict it. We are the creatures of our thinking. We can talk ourselves into defeat or we can talk ourselves into victory.<br><br>Likewise, it is so in the Church. We even have some who quibble and fret over little things, evidently totally unaware of the majestic destiny of this, the work of God.<br><br>When gold was discovered in California in January of 1848, men of the Mormon Battalion were there and participated in the discovery. Completing their contract, they came to the Salt Lake Valley to join their families. Some of them brought with them gold, and in the hard and desperate days that followed, particularly in the bitter winter if 1848–49, many wanted to go to California, where life was easier and gold was to be picked from the riverbeds. In that time of gloom, Brigham Young stood before the people in the old Bowery on Temple Square and said:<br><br><i>Some have asked me about going. I have told them that God has appointed this place for the gathering of his saints, and you will do better right here than you will by going to the gold mines. ... We have been kicked out of the frying pan into the fire, out of the fire into the middle of the floor, and here we are and here we will stay. God has shown me that this is the spot to locate his people, and here is where they will prosper. ... We shall build a city and a temple to the most high god in this place. We will extend our settlements to the east and west, to the north and south, and we will build towns and cities by the hundreds, and thousands of the saints will gather in from the nations of the earth. This will become the great highway of the nations. Kings and emperors and the noble and wise of the earth will visit us here, while the wicked and ungodly will envy us our comfortable homes and possessions.</i>[<i>Autobiography of James Brown</i>, pp. 119–23, cited by Preston Nibley,<i>Brigham Young, the Man and His Work</i>(Salt Lake City: Deseret News Press, 1936), pp. 127–28]<br><br>What a remarkable statement under such circumstances!<br><br>My heart goes out to those who were cold and hungry that winter. I am sure there was much of grumbling and criticism, and understandably so. But how marvelous when a man looked beyond the winter and spoke as a prophet, under the power of the Holy Spirit, of better days to come.<br><br>Those days have come. Last year more people visited Temple Square in Salt Lake City than visited Yellowstone Park. This<i>has</i>become the great highway of the nations. Kings and emperors and the noble and wise of the earth constantly visit us here.<br><br>Brigham Young went on to say on that occasion:<br><br><i>It is our duty to preach the gospel, gather Israel, pay our tithing, and build temples. The worst fear that I have about this people is that they will get rich in this country, forget God and his people, wax fat, and kick themselves out of the Church and go to hell. This people will stand mobbing, robbing, poverty and all manner of persecution, and be true. It my greater fear for them is that they cannot stand wealth; and yet they have to be tried with riches, for they will become the richest people on this earth.</i>[Nibley,<i>Brigham Young</i>, p. 128]<br><br>To which I can hear many of you say, "Hasten the day."<br><br>I believe that day, spoken of by Brigham Young with a voice of prophecy that rose above the voices of defeat and criticism, has come. We have been blessed with the bounties of heaven and the bounties of earth. Oh, how magnificently and munificently we have been blessed! Now, with gratitude in our hearts, let us not dwell upon the few problems we have. Let us rather count our blessings and in a great spirit of gratitude, motivated by a great faith, go forth to build the kingdom of God in the earth.<br><h2><b>Educational Challenges</b></h2><br>Likewise, in our life on this campus, let us look for and cultivate the wonders of our opportunity, here to partake of learning, here to enjoy marvelous associations, here to develop great loyalties. It is so easy, under the pressure of the daily grind, to become negative and critical, to be shortsighted and go down in defeat. I have been touched by these words spoken by Benjamin Ide Wheeler, who at one time served as president of the University of California. Said he to a group of students:<br><br><i>This university shall be a family's glorious old mother, by whose hearth you shall love to sit down. Love her. It does a man good to love noble things, to attach his life to noble allegiances. It is a good thing to love the Church, it is a good thing to love the State. It is a good thing to love one's home, it is a good thing to be loyal to one's father and mother. And, after the same sort, it is good to be loyal to the university, which stands in life for the purest things and the cleanest, loftiest ideals. Cheer for her; it will do your lungs good. Love her; it will do your heart and life good.</i><br><br>In your associations one with another, build and strengthen one another. "No man is an island; no man stands alone." We so need help and encouragement and strength, one from another.<br><br>On one occasion when the Savior was walking among a crowd, a woman who had been long sick touched his garment. He perceived that strength had gone out of him. The strength that was his had strengthened her. So it may be with each of us. Let me urge you to desist from making cutting remarks one to another. Rather, cultivate the art of complimenting, of strengthening, of encouraging. What wonders we can accomplish when others have faith in us. No leader can long succeed in any society without the confidence of the people. It is so with us in our daily associations. Said the Lord to Peter, "Simon, Simon, behold Satan hath desired to have you, that he might sift you as wheat: But I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not: and when thou art converted, strengthen thy brethren" (Luke 22:31–32). Declared Paul, "We then that are strong ought to bear the infirmities of the weak." And then he adds, "and not to please ourselves" (Romans 15:1).<br><br>It is a responsibility divinely laid upon us to bear one another's burdens, to strengthen one another, to encourage one another, to lift one another, to look for the good in one another, and to emphasize that good. There is not a student in this assembly who cannot be depressed on the one hand, or lifted on the other, by the remarks of his associates.<br><br>I was impressed with a Sydney Harris column that I clipped from the<i>Deseret News</i>some years ago. Said this eminent writer:<br><br><i>Sir Walter Scott was a trouble to all his teachers and so was Lord Byron. Thomas Edison, as everyone knows, was considered a dullard in school. Pestalozzi, who later became Italy's foremost educator, was regarded as wild and foolish by his school authorities.</i><br><br><i>Oliver Goldsmith was considered almost an imbecile. The Duke of Wellington failed in many of his classes. Among famous writers, Burns, Balzac, Boccaccio, and Dumas made poor academic records. Flaubert, who went on to become France's most impeccable writer, found it extremely difficult to learn to read. Thomas Aquinas, who had the finest scholastic mind of all Catholic thinkers, was actually dubbed "the dumb ox" at school. Linnaeus and Volta did badly in their studies. Newton was last in his class. Sheridan, the English playwright, wasn't able to stay in one school more than a year.</i><br><br>All of this seems to say to me that each of these men, every one of whom later become great, might have done much better in his studies had he received less of criticism and more of encouragement.<br><br>Two students of this University came to see me awhile ago. Six months earlier they had been married. They had declared their love one for another. They had pledged their loyalty one to another for time and eternity. Now, the young man came first. He was disillusioned. He was bitter. He was heartbroken. His wife, he said, did this and did that--simple little things of small consequence, such as leaving the dishes undone when she left for school in the morning. And then came his wife, a beautiful girl of great talent. She spoke of her husband's faults. He was stingy. He did not pick up his clothes. He was careless. Each had his or her faults. Every one of those faults was easily correctable. The problem lay in the fact that there was a stronger inclination to emphasize the faults than there was to talk of the virtues. With a little discipline, each could have changed. With a little desire, each could have spoken with a different tone. But neither was willing. They had permitted a negative attitude to destroy the sweetest, richest association of life. They had thrown away with careless and sour words the hopes and dreams of eternity. With criticism and shouting, they had violated the sacred promises that might have taken them on to exaltation.<br><br>My dear young friends, don't partake of the spirit of our times. Look for the good and build on it. Don't be a "pickle sucker." There is so much of the sweet and the decent and the good to build on.<br><br>You are partakers of the gospel of Jesus Christ. The gospel means "good news." The message of the Lord is one of hope and salvation. The voice of the Lord is a voice of glad tidings. The work of the Lord is a work of glorious and certain reward. I do not suggest that you simply put on rose-colored glasses to make the world look rosy. I ask, rather, that you look above and beyond the negative, the critical, the cynical, the doubtful, to the positive. I carry with me a statement that I took from an article published some years ago on Commander William Robert Anderson, the man who took the submarine<i>Nautilus</i>under the North Pole from the waters of the Pacific to the waters of the Atlantic. In his wallet he carried a tattered card with these words: "I believe I am always divinely guided. I believe I will always take the right road. I believe God will always make a way where there is no way" (quoted in<i>Look</i>, 20 April 1971, p. 48).<br><br>Said the Lord in a dark and troubled hour to those he loved, "Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid" (John 14:27). May the Lord bless you, each of you, with faith, with affection, with hope, with charity, I ask humbly in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Gordon B.

<h1> Sign:Giving Your Best - Paul H. Dunn - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
What a wonderful sight you are, my brothers and sisters. It is indeed an honor to accept an invitation to come back to this great institution. Your appearance is wonderful. Your influence is great. Your spirit is terrific. You bring to my mind a little story that one of my brethren told not long ago. It seems that a lady and her devoted husband, who had been married some forty years, had parted because of the death of the husband. He had gone bald early in his career and had relented to a hairpiece. Knowing that he was very fastidious and careful about his appearance, his wife wanted to make sure that in his final hours of being on display he would look proper, so she made it very explicit to the mortician that the hairpiece be properly placed. The mortician assured her. Not feeling quite certain yet, she called him back on the phone and said, "Are you sure that this will not be an embarrassment either to my husband or to me?"<br><br>He said, "Madam, I assure you we know what we are doing."<br><br>A little later she called again and said, "Now, I just want to be doubly sure that he's going to appear the way we want him to appear."<br><br>He said, "Madam, let me put your mind at rest. Don't you worry one minute. We have nailed it on." Well, your appearance is all that it ought to be, and we're grateful for your image, for your impact, and for the great influence you are upon the world.<br><br>Now let me put the introduction given me into proper perspective if I might. Maybe the best way to introduce me would be through my mother. Mothers know us as we really are. Recently, when a new book of mine came off the press, a lady friend in Los Angeles approached my mother and said, "Sister Dunn, I see your boy has written another book."<br><br>"Yes," my mother replied, remembering my earlier school days, "but I doubt if he can read it."<br><br>I just want to share another thought or two. (I guess it's all right in a devotional to tell a story or two.) All of these meetings remind me of the father and young son standing in the church foyer. Noting a plaque on the wall, the boy asked his father what it was. "That was put up in memory of all the brave men who died in the service."<br><br>"Morning or evening?" asked the boy.<br><br>I told another BYU audience that about a year and a half ago I was honored as the alumnus of the year at my old high school in California. I won't plague you with the details, but going back to my campus for the first time in almost twenty years made me very reminiscent of wonderful days. I walked around the campus, through the halls of learning, and even felt a little nostalgia to go to my homeroom class, which I did. Lo and behold, I found my desk just as I had left it. Do you know how I recognized it? I'm embarrassed to tell you. I'd carved a little remembrance on the top. It was a beautifully designed tombstone. On it I had inscribed these words: "Here lies Paul Dunn, who died waiting for the bell to ring."<br><br>I can't help sharing one other story. Asking his religion class here one day where one could find the Beatitudes, the teacher got this thoughtful reply and suggestion from one of his students: "Have you tried the yellow pages?"<br><br>My daughter, who is just in the bloom of her sixteenth year, is busy now with the holiday spirit. This morning we had frost in Salt Lake, and I gather you've had a little experience with it here. It is time now for the holiday season to begin. I was interested, as I was going through my notebook in preparation for the holiday spirit, to come across some delightful letters from young people to Santa. To put you in the festive mood a little early, let me share a few of these with you. These are real letters that were sent to Santa Claus in care of the North Pole, USA:<br><br><i>Dear Santa, how can you tell who are the good children and who are the bad? Please tell me as quick as you can.</i><br><br><i>Dear St. Nick, could you send me a snorkel and some flippers? I am learning to be a deep-sea diver in the bathtub.</i><br><br><i>Dear Santa Claus, I love Christmas because at Christmas there's pretty white snow and everybody is nice to everybody, even grown-ups.</i><br><br><i>Hi, Santa, could you leave me a nice doll for my sister, so she will have something to play with? My mother always makes</i>me<i>play with her.</i><br><br><i>Dear Santa, can you give a pretty present to my teacher, Miss Lewis, and tell her it came from me, Jeffrey? I think it would help a lot.</i><br><br><i>Dear Santa Claus, I think you should leave a great big present for my grandma. She knew you when you were a kid.</i><br><br><i>Hello, Santa Claus, I wrote to you last year that I wanted a surprise, and you left a book. I don't want any more surprises.</i><br><h2><b>Intellectual and Spiritual Education</b></h2><br>Let me shift the scene now for a moment. We are in, I think, the world's greatest university, presided over by a Board of Trustees who are committed, along with your administrators, to the glory of God, which is intelligence. I want to congratulate personally each one of you who has found it in your heart to come here to learn, to worship, and to understand. You don't need a lecture from me today on the importance of an education, or you wouldn't be here. I just want you to know that the world, as well as the Church, is counting on the product that you will produce. I see two primary reasons why you and I are here this morning seeking an education and learning more of the Spirit. First of all, the scriptures are rather direct when they say that no man and/or woman can be saved in ignorance. It's impossible. The Savior pointed out that it was truth that would make us free. Ignorance would cast us down. We're here then, basically, to learn how to save ourselves, our families, and our loved ones. That's our primary prerequisite, as I see it, for an education. Second, once that education is gained--and it's an ongoing process, to be sure--you and I have the moral and spiritual responsibility to give that which we have come to know to others. In a very real sense, we are truly a missionary church. I'd like to talk about those two things this morning.<br><h2><b>Overcome Discouragement</b></h2><br>This is the time now when the newness of the year has worn a little thin. Drudgery, if you're not careful, has set in. You're in the routine. Chances are that there are a few of you in this great congregation who might be a bit discouraged--particularly during test and grade time. That's normal. There are those who might become so despondent that they feel dropping out is the answer to their prayers. Please hesitate and consider carefully, cautiously, with your counselors, your parents, and others. We need you and you need us. Sometimes discouragement, as you know, is the adversary's greatest tool to thwart your progress and the work of the Lord. If he can keep you in ignorance and not dedicated to building the kingdom, he has literally won a battle. Our desire is to help you win in every respect, with yourself as well as with the world.<br><br>Let me share an experience I had out in the South Pacific some years ago as an infantry soldier. This has to do, I think, with discouragement, the feeling of inadequacy at times or wonderment as to whether or not one can persevere to the end. To those of you who are not familiar with military terms, let me explain. As infantrymen out in the Pacific, we used to make what we'd call a dry run on isolated beaches. We'd take an innocent island and, with LCVPs (landing craft vehicles), make a practice assault on the beach in order to get the feel of what combat would be like. We selected an island way out in the middle of the ocean on one occasion. Our particular regiment went ashore. We were to simulate combat conditions, so I was assigned to take a patrol into the shrubs. Lo and behold, about five hundred yards inland, we came upon a very friendly native village. But a very interesting sight was noted by all of us. Every man, woman, child, and beast, including dogs and cattle, was wearing green beads with three tiny shells attached to the end. That naturally created curiosity in the infantrymen's minds.<br><br>Later we learned from a Baptist minister who had been serving in that vicinity that the people were very religious and superstitious. The beads were to ward off evil or failure or discouragement or even the temptation of death. The people used these beads as their good luck charms. At the time, the beads recalled to my memory the days when some of us as kids carried a good luck charm or a rabbit's foot in our pockets. Some of us back on the farm were perhaps superstitious enough to hang horseshoes on the barn door or use a hundred other symbols to keep off the evil eye of failure or accident. I remember so well a common superstition of all ball players never to step on another player's mitt while it lay on the ground. To do so was certain to bring failure and defeat.<br><h2><b>Give Your Best Efforts -- Plus</b></h2><br>This morning, I would like to give you a new good luck charm--one that is guaranteed to help you throughout your entire life, every month, every day, every hour, protecting you from all the bad-luck episodes of your life. It is guaranteed to protect your health and make you more likeable in your associations with people and more successful in your job and in your schoolwork. It will insure greater success in your daily work and bring you home to your dwelling place every evening with a sense of "well done, good and faithful servant." (Incidentally, I have to read that with a little more caution than most of you. If you change the punctuation, you can hear the Lord say, "<i>Well</i>, Dunn!")<br><br>Right now, wherever you are, picture in your mind a horizontal line. Do you see it? Now cross it with a vertical line. Do you get the picture? Note that it is not a cross, but a plus sign. It is the sign that protected Charles Lindbergh on his perilous journey across the ocean after he had previously taken the extra pains to shut himself up in a small sedan and sit at the wheel without rest or sleep for forty-eight hours in order to study the effects upon himself of confinement, vibration, and motor lullaby.<br><br>This is the sign that brought popularity and wealth to all of the great athletes, musicians, scientists, writers, and business executives of this country who, after many efforts, finally succeeded. Scientists have said that the average person uses only about one one-hundredth of the capacity that God has given him. We know that one plus one equals two. Five plus five equals ten. But it takes the plus sign to do the trick. It gives extra hope for those of us who are discouraged, who sometimes get down in the dumps. A little added patience and determination when all seems lost may turn the advancing army of decay and start the forward march that leads to victory and our abounding triumph as a person in life, as a leader, as a student, or whatever our callings might be. If there is one person in this audience today, man or woman, who is discouraged because of failure, seemingly on his part, to obtain his ideals or some special goal and who is just about ready to give up because of continued loss and discouragement, let him remember the counsel of Elbert Hubbard, who told us that the line between failure and success is so fine that often a single extra effort is all that's needed to bring victory out of apparent defeat.<br><br>History tells us that George Washington lost nine consecutive battles, but by winning the tenth he won the war and the liberty of this great country. F. W. Woolworth made a failure of his first three stores, but the plus sign of the fourth did the trick. Henry Ford was once asked, "What would you do if you lost everything you had?"<br><br>He replied, "Give me ten years and I would build it all back again."<br><br>Each of us might well ask, "Why do I have so many problems? Why is life always such a struggle? I seem to have more bad days than good days." The plan of salvation as given by our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, was intended to build our spiritual strength and character through trials and hardships. It's the sweet reward of adversity.<br><br>Some of you may find yourselves in the position of my daughter, if I might refer to her again. One night not too long ago, as we were having a family discussion and having the exchange that parents and children hopefully do, she was complaining that we were just a little too vigorous in her life with Church and other activities. "That's all we do around here," she said, "church, church, church."<br><br>I said, "Now look, honey," trying to be the teacher-father, "before you get too complaining, just remember that you are here because you wanted to be. Don't blame me. You sat in that great council and everybody here sat in that great council and voted to come here. I am just your father--here to enforce your vote."<br><br>You know what she said? "Let's put it to another vote."<br><br>But the point is that we're here! The challenge is, what are we going to do about it?<br><br>The sweet reward of adversity is illustrated in this story. As a young woman of eighteen, a pretty model found her dreams shattered by an automobile accident that confined her to a wheelchair with partially paralyzed legs. Because of the accident she learned to play the piano. Because of the accident she learned to develop a sense of humor and to find that there's a funny viewpoint to almost every subject. In time her legs regained their strength and she became an actress, gifted with a sense of humor that made her one of the outstanding comediennes of our time. You've heard her on the radio. You've seen her in motion pictures and particularly on television. You know that Lucille Ball was not stopped by adversity. On the contrary, it was the plus sign that made the difference.<br><br>Randolf Eyre tells a story about the town of Enterprise, Alabama, which has raised a monument, if you can imagine, in honor of the boll weevil--the dreaded insect pest of the cotton country that once threatened to ruin this important crop. You would naturally wonder why anyone would want to erect a monument to a pest. Then you discover that the inroads and destruction of the boll weevil resulted in the planting of other crops and that the sweet potato and the peanut in particular have been of vast importance in the development of the south. The diversification of crops made the South versatile. The people learned that everything did not hinge on cotton, nor did they have to rise or fall with it. This meant a more stable and prosperous economy. In other words, an enemy did the South a good turn. The bad break became a good one. The bad luck turned to good luck. Hardships, trials, and tribulations, then, have their places in the great plan of life. So I say, whatever the battle in which we are engaged--and, no doubt, all of us have some difficulties to face--better than all the beads, seashells, buckeyes, horseshoes or other modern charms is the armor on which is painted with our own blood the plus sign. That sign means that with each crushed hope there is another hope and stronger faith. With each fall in the road, another trial. Someone has said, "I am never licked until I give up."<br><br>The apostle Paul tells us that to him who overcomes (and it doesn't matter where he started in life's race) shall be given the crown of life. It is the plus sign, the sign that always points upward and forward, not backward, the sign that recognizes defeat as an opportunity for further effort in the future. By this sign you and I can conquer.<br><br>I have a very successful business friend in Los Angeles. I sat with him one day and asked, "What's your formula for succeeding--the criteria for success being a happy home and good relationships with people, tremendous church service, and then business genius and other rewards?"<br><br>He said, "I can sum it up, Brother Dunn, in three words." Let me share his formula with you. He said, "The three words are<i>and then some</i>. I discovered at an early age that most of the differences between average people and top people can be explained in these words. The top people do what is expected of them, and then some. They are thoughtful and considerate of others, and then some. They meet their obligations and responsibilities fairly and squarely, and then some. They are good friends to their friends, and then some. They can be counted on in an emergency, and then some." So it is when we do what is assigned to us in our lives and in the Church, and then some. Then the Lord pays in full, and then some. Would you think about this formula, analyze it, and more importantly, use it--and then some?<br><h2><b>Share the Gospel</b></h2><br>You are getting an education. What are you going to do with it? Hopefully you'll succeed, and I'm sure you will, because that's basic to what we're discussing, but I hope and pray that you'll never reach the point where you will fail to share this most glorious of all gospels with your neighbor.<br><br>We are in a rebirth of the missionary era. I don't need to convince this audience that--once we have found ourselves, have in a sense saved ourselves and our families--we have an obligation to give the gospel to our neighbors. We have at the present time 18,600 full-time missionaries throughout the Church. President Kimball has sent out the call to send more. Now, at BYU you have a set of special problems. It's interesting. Right here on this campus we have eight thousand plus returned missionaries and many more who are preparing to go. And yet we've got you in a tiny pocket, and there are not that many to teach. We're asking now that you consider how you might prepare not only to go on missions, but also to utilize the great strength that you have on this campus and at this great University.<br><br>Let me just review with you President Kimball's comment about missionary work. I guess you read it in your<i>Ensign</i>last month:<br><br><i>Today we have 18,600 missionaries. We can send more, many more.</i>[I hope that's part of the preparation of this congregation.]<i>I am asking for missionaries who have been carefully indoctrinated and trained through the family and the organizations of the Church. Every able, worthy man should shoulder the cross. What an army we should have teaching Christ and him crucified. We will need to make a full and prayerful study of the nations of the world which do not have the gospel at this time.</i>[I might observe we're doing that.]<i>I believe that the Lord is anxious to put into our hand inventions of which we laymen have hardly had a glimpse. He will open the gates and make possible the proselyting. Of that I have great faith. I believe the time has come when we must change our sights and raise our goals.</i><br><br>I'd like to give that statement to you as a personal challenge here. For example, in the next few weeks there will be a mass migration away from here to your various homes for Thanksgiving and Christmas. That's wonderful. You eight thousand missionaries, wherever you are, and you know who you are, could I give you a personal challenge? There are many things we could talk about in this particular field. Let me mention four. First, when you go home, even if it's just for two or three days, will you find a family and give a referral to the local stake mission or to the full-time missionaries in your town? That's not asking too much. You're already equipped. You know how to do it. Do you remember how you used to hit the General Authority when he'd come to your mission? "Oh, President," you'd say, "can you shake the people?" Many times a missionary in the field has come to me and said, "President Dunn, when you get up to speak in the morning, remind the people.<i>Move</i>them.<i>Motivate</i>them. Why they're<i>dead</i>out here." Then the missionary comes home--and spiritually dies.<br><br>When's the last time you gave a referral? Are you part of the problem or the solution? Could I give you the challenge to go home and find a family? You're equipped to do it. I'd like to give you a second challenge. While there, and this is perfectly legitimate, volunteer to teach with the full-time and the stake missionaries two, three, or four nights. Wouldn't you like that spirit again? Get out and visit. You've got expertise and training that some of them don't have. Get back into the field. I wish we could do that on a more vigorous scale here in Provo, but you outnumber the contacts.<br><br>Third, and I say this to my missionaries as well who are sitting in this congregation, would you write to the current mission president of the mission where you served and give him a referral of the golden contact (or two or three or four) that you had who was not baptized? How many times I've found as a mission president, by a follow-up from a missionary who had a contact that our records no longer showed, that we were able to move in and be successful. Keep in contact with your mission. Let it be a glorious experience both ways.<br><br>Fourth, find that prized teaching moment--even here--and share the gospel. I know there's a young lady sitting in the congregation who's been touched by many of you. I hope she won't be embarrassed. Barbara May was baptized just this week. I attended her baptism. She came here frightened to death, worried about her acceptance as one of the few nonmembers amongst the great majority. You touched her, and she has entered the waters of baptism as countless scores do because of your wonderful appearance, your example, and your desire to assist other people. There are others here. There are others in the city proper that through your priesthood organizations and channels you can help contact and reach.<br><br>Now, some of you who have not had the missionary experience are a little fearful. I can see it in your faces: "You know I believe, Brother Dunn, but I don't know how to be a missionary." And so you kind of excuse yourself. We're not too concerned about the method. The principle is very well stated in the 88th section of the Doctrine and Covenants--to warn your neighbor. Now, I don't know how you warn him. There are as many methods as there are people doing it. I've shared a few here before. Maybe one in particular would be appropriate. For example, some of you are a little fearful to ask the golden questions. Maybe you're embarrassed, not sure how someone will respond, or you don't want to push your religion on him. Some of you would be scared to death to knock on a door. You don't know what to do or how to do it. Others would be equally fearful of simply sitting down and writing or telephoning somebody. Find that which is conducive to your personality. I found as a mission president that, if we could get each missionary to find his own strengths and apply them, then we had something concrete.<br><br>For example, I have a hard time asking the golden questions. I'll ask them, but my way. I travel a lot, so my neighbor is everybody out there. I carry with me in my pocket as I travel this little tube of ozium. Ozium is an air freshener. I love it. You know, if you travel from here to Arizona to give a talk before some delightful young people, you get off the plane smelling as if you'd dealt the last hand of a poker game. The kids don't always understand. So when I get off the plane, I just spray myself and then I'm sweet and wholesome and ready to do Church work.<br><br>Well, I have learned that clearing the air on a plane is a great way to start a conversation. Stewardesses are intrigued by it. People who sit next to me want to know what I'm doing. I just say, "I'm just clearing the smoke out." That gets me talking about the Word of Wisdom. You know, I have become so proficient with this particular tube of ozium that I can put a cigarette out at ten feet.<br><br>I can't resist telling you about one little experience. I was traveling back from somewhere to Salt Lake City, and it was a particularly heavily smoke-filled flight. My lungs had taken about all they could handle. I'm a fighter at heart, and I hope I do this in a Christian, Latter-day Saint way, so I took out my ozium and sprayed the culprit sitting in front of me. His air jet was fixed so that every time he would exhale I got it. I thought, "Well, it's really self-defense rather than a missionary effort at this point." I shot a spray over his head, and after about the third spray the mist settled on him. He got a little concerned, and I don't blame him. He got up, turned around, and said, "What in the world are you doing?"<br><br>"I'm trying to nullify what you're doing to me."<br><br>"What am I doing?"<br><br>I said, "I'm sure it's not intentional, but I seem to be getting the ill effects of your habit, and it's not comfortable." Then I got bold. I said, "I'm surprised that a man with your intelligence would smoke in the first place."<br><br>He got a little defensive. "Well, the medical reports aren't that conclusive."<br><br>I said, "I have a medical report in my briefcase that's very conclusive. Would you like to read it?" He said he would, and I said, "Can I sit with you?" So we got up and changed seats with a couple of people. I sat down and took out the Doctrine and Covenants, and I turned to--guess what section? I read him parts of the 89th section. He couldn't have handled all of it. But I did read him what the Lord said about tobacco--that it was not good for man but for sick cattle. Then I read him the promise at the end. I turned to him, closed the book, and said, "Now, sir, I have just read you the truth, and you know it, don't you?"<br><br>His head went back, and he said, "I believe I do."<br><br>I said, "Would you be offended if I found out where you lived?"<br><br>"No." He lived in Minnesota.<br><br>I took his name and address and said, "You'd like to know a little more about this, wouldn't you?"<br><br>"Yeah."<br><br>So I sent a referral to a mission president in Minnesota. Have you ever heard of that in the Church? And I was pleased to learn some three or four weeks later that he'd been baptized.<br><h2><b>Be a Good Example</b></h2><br>Who is your neighbor? Oh, we could talk about countless stories like this. Here's one other, very quickly. Many of you are missionaries by your image and example. One of the great example scriptures of all time appears in the Book of Mormon. We often share this with our missionaries. Listen to what a great father tells his son: "Suffer not yourself to be led away by any vain or foolish things; suffer not the devil to lead away your heart again after those wicked harlots. Behold, O my son, how great iniquity ye brought upon the Zoramites; for when they saw your conduct they would not believe in my words" (Alma 39:11). Do you get the message? You and I can go out and preach all we want, but what's the real testifier or example? The lives we live. Many have joined the Church on this campus because of your example.<br><br>Once in a while, however, we have a little problem in the department of example. Here today is a great friend of mine, Guy Davis, a member of your faculty. I knew him when he was a Methodist minister teaching at Chapman College. He has been a teacher for a number of years. One day he said, "Paul, I handle the young marrieds out at the First Methodist Church in Glendale, California. We're studying other religions right now. Would you mind coming out and giving a talk on what Mormons are and what they believe?"<br><br>I saw a chance to raise my grade so I grabbed it. I said, "Yes, sir. I'd be honored."<br><br>The appointed day came, and on a Sunday morning I drove out to Glendale. There was an impressive church. Traffic was very heavy. I drove around the block two or three times as one does in a strange area, and as I pulled around the third time, there was a fellow standing at the curb waving me down. I'd never seen him before. I wound down the window. He poked his head in and said, "Are you Mr. Dunn?"<br><br>I said yes.<br><br>He said, "Mr. Davis has asked that we look for you, and he described your car."<br><br>I said, "Well, thank you." I got out, and they parked my car. I was escorted into the building by another man. We walked down the long corridor into the basement area where the class was to be held. Before I got to the appointed room, guess what met my ears? On the organ someone was playing "Come, Come, Ye Saints." I wondered what ward it was. I started to enter the room, and I saw seated before me about 150 young married couples. They were observing a very interesting picture, a reproduction of the Salt Lake Temple and Tabernacle on Temple Square. It was hung graciously over the fireplace in their little cultural hall. They were honoring a Latter-day Saint about his religion that day and they did it very gracefully.<br><br>I was given a flowery introduction, and then I gave my little talk. We opened it up for questions and answers. Here was an intelligent group of people really wanting to know. At the end I was escorted to the back of the hall, and they passed along one at a time and shook my hand and were very courteous and generous in their comments. I got one of the finest letters I have ever received from the officers of the group. For years, and still now, every time I hear the word "Methodist" I feel a warm glow in my heart because of an experience I had as a visitor.<br><br>It so happened a few weeks later that one of the bishops in southern California called me and said, "I understand you're a student down at Chapman."<br><br>"Yes, sir."<br><br>He said, "Do you suppose you could get one of those other ministers to come and talk about other religions in our special interests group?" I had one in mind--to pay him back.<br><br>I invited my friend to come and speak in my ward. We appointed a time. He had to cancel some other very important appointments. In other churches, as you know, the clergy is paid. We don't think of that, ofttimes. He canceled a presentation he was going to give that week for about one hundred dollars in order to come and speak for punch and cookies at a Mormon function.<br><br>We arranged for it, and I picked him up on the appointed night. We drove over to the building where the class was to be held. I got there about fifteen minutes beforehand. Lo and behold, the church was dark. Sound familiar? I wondered if I had the right building. I said, "Wait a minute," and explained that one of the great Mormon principles of lay leadership is that we move by the Spirit. About twenty-five minutes after the hour, the spirits started to move. Out of the shrubs and the bushes came Latter-day Saints everywhere. The lights went on, and people were starting to flock. I went in with my guest, our guest, and stood in the foyer. Latter-day Saint after Latter-day Saint, not meaning to, passed us. Not one came over to see who we were. I tried to give Mr. Davis another little sermon on Latter-day Saint philosophy. Finally it was time to start, and we were about fifteen minutes late. We moved into the Relief Society room. Somebody picked up a songbook and said, "What song should we sing?" In a very informal way the meeting got underway. Then my friend gave one of the finest lectures on the New Testament I've ever heard. He was very sensitive to a Mormon audience and tried not to say anything that would offend. Then we opened it up for questions, and I don't dare repeat the rest. I'm sure what happened kept my friend from being associated with this Church sooner than he could have. I don't know. I haven't analyzed it with him. But I often have wondered--if I were a Presbyterian or a Catholic or a Baptist or an atheist, having experienced those two things--which church would I join? You see, our conduct, our image, our example, brothers and sisters, are great, great missionary tools.<br><br>I challenge all of you to reanalyze your lives, to find out just exactly where you fit in. Would you take the challenge today to give all that you have to the building of the kingdom as you have come to find it and to know it in your own heart? God bless you. You're a great congregation. You're a special group. I want you to know that I know God lives and that Jesus is the Christ. Just recently I've been in the valley of death, and I know just a little bit more about what we're here trying to study and learn about. I know the feeling of having a prophet place his hands upon my head. I know this is the true church. I know the presence of the Savior. To those of you who do not yet know, listen with your spirits, for I testify he lives. This really is his church. May you and I recommit this hour to go teach Jesus Christ and him crucified I pray in the sacred name of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Paul H. Dunn was a member of the First Quorum of the Seventy of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when this devotional address was given at Brigham Young University on 5 November 1974.</i><br><br><i>© Intellectual Reserve, Inc.

<h1>Your Minds - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I would like to express my appreciation and commendation to the musicians, to the brother who offered the prayer, and particularly to you people who had the courage to come out to listen to me. This is a great audience. I hope the Lord will bless you while I talk that we may be edified.<br><br>Brothers and sisters, my effort today will be to induce you to make up your minds, with a real commitment, on several important issues. We are privileged to live in one of the most momentous periods in the history of the world. The signs of our times portend the second coming of the Savior. His gospel has been restored that men might know how to prepare themselves to receive him. We are among the elect who know what we must do to receive the blessings of the great millennium which approaches. The question for each of us to respond to is "Will we do what we know must be done?"<br><br>Edgar A. Guest has expressed this idea in these lines:<br><br><i>You are the fellow who has to decide</i><br><i>Whether you'll do it or toss it aside.</i><br><i>You are the fellow who makes up your mind</i><br><i>Whether you'll lead or will linger behind--</i><br><i>Whether you'll try for the goal that's afar</i><br><i>Or just be contented to stay where you are.</i><br><i>Take it or leave it. Here's something to do!</i><br><i>Just think it over. It's all up to you!</i><br><i>Nobody here will compel you to rise;</i><br><i>No one will force you to open your eyes.</i><br><i>No one will answer for you, yes or no,</i><br><i>Whether to stay there or whether to go;</i><br><i>Life is a game, but it's you who must say</i><br><i>Whether as cheat or as sportsman you'll play.</i><br><i>Fate may betray you, but you settle first</i><br><i>Whether to live to your best or your worst.</i><br><br><i>So whatever it is you are wanting to be,</i><br><i>Remember, to fashion the choice you are free.</i><br><i>Kindly of selfish, or gentle or strong,</i><br><i>Keeping the right way or taking the wrong.</i><br><i>Careless of honor or guarding your pride,</i><br><i>All these are questions which you must decide,</i><br><i>Yours the selection, whichever you do;</i><br><i>The thing men call character's all up to you.</i><br><h2><b>Choose Good and Forsake Evil</b></h2><br>Our individual success or failure in this life and in the life to come depends on whether or not we<i>make up our minds to choose the good and eschew the evil.</i>Let us face up to this fact and not deceive ourselves by pretending that we cannot distinguish between right and wrong. Every normal person instinctively knows good from evil. Mormon, in teaching this great principle, said:<br><br><i>Take heed, my beloved brethren, that ye do not judge that which is evil to be of God, or that which is good and of God to be of the devil.</i><br><br><i>For behold, my brethren, it is given unto you to judge, that ye may know good from evil; and the way to judge is as plain, that ye may know with a perfect knowledge, as the daylight is from the dark night.</i><br><br><i>For behold, the Spirit of Christ is given to every man, that he may know good from evil; wherefore, I show unto you the way to judge; for everything which inviteth to do good, and to persuade to believe in Christ, is sent forth by the power and gift of Christ; wherefore ye may know with a perfect knowledge it is of God.</i><br><br><i>But whatsoever thing persuadeth men to do evil, and believe not in Christ, and deny him, and serve not God, then ye may know with a perfect knowledge it is of the devil; for after this manner doth the devil work, for he persuadeth no man to do good, no, not one; neither do his angels; neither do they who subject themselves unto him.</i><br><br><i>And now, my brethren, seeing that ye know the light by which ye may judge, which light is the light of Christ, see that ye do not judge wrongfully; for with that same judgment which ye judge ye shall also be judged.</i>[Moroni 7:14–18]<br><br>Some people call this facility to judge between good and evil a conscience. Whatever its name, however, every person has one. The Lord confirmed this truth in this dispensation when he said in the Doctrine and Covenants, "The Spirit [of Christ] giveth light to every man that cometh into the world; and the Spirit enlighteneth every man through the world, that hearkeneth to the voice of the Spirit. And every one that hearkeneth to the voice of the Spirit cometh unto God, even the Father" (D&amp;amp;C 84:46–47).<br><br>Knowing good from evil, my young friends, you just cannot be happy doing evil. We all accept the truth so simply and yet beautifully expressed in the lovely Primary song "I Am a Child of God":<br><br><i>I am a child of God,</i><br><i>And he has sent me here,</i><br><i>Has given me an earthly home</i><br><i>With parents kind and dear.</i><br><br><i>I am a child of God,</i><br><i>And so my needs are great;</i><br><i>Help me to understand his words</i><br><i>Before it grows too late.</i><br><br><i>I am a child of God,</i><br><i>Rich blessings are in store;</i><br><i>If I but learn to do his will</i><br><i>I'll live with him once more.</i><br><h2><b>Pray</b></h2><br>Because we know that we are the children of God, one of the most important things we must<i>make up our minds</i>to do on our way to success and happiness is<i>to pray</i>regularly and fervently to him for guidance and strength. Long before the Church was organized, the Lord emphasized the importance of prayer in speaking to the Prophet Joseph. He said, "Pray always, that you may come off conqueror; yea that you may conquer Satan, and that you may escape the hands of the servants of Satan that do uphold his work" (D&amp;amp;C 10:5). Later on, but still before the Church was organized, he said to Martin Harris, "And again, I command thee that thou shalt pray vocally as well as in thy heart; yea, before the world as well as in secret, in public as well as in private. . . . Pray always, and I will pour out my Spirit upon you, and great shall be your blessing--yea, even more than if you should obtain treasures of earth and corruptibleness to the extent thereof" (D&amp;amp;C 19:28, 38). In September 1830 the Lord counseled Thomas B. Marsh to "pray always, lest you enter into temptation and lose your reward. Be faithful unto the end, and lo, I am with you. These words are not of man nor of men, but of me, even Jesus Christ, your Redeemer, by the will of the Father" (D&amp;amp;C 31:12–13).<br><br>I suppose you are all acquainted with Amulek's moving exhortation to pray as recorded in the thirty-fourth chapter of Alma. Personally, I never tire of his admonition:<br><br><i>Therefore may God grant unto you, my brethren, that ye may begin . . . to call upon his holy name, that he would have mercy upon you;</i><br><br><i>Yea, cry unto him for mercy; for he is mighty to save.</i><br><br><i>Yea, humble yourselves, and continue in prayer unto him.</i><br><br><i>Cry unto him when ye are in your fields, yea, over all your flocks.</i><br><br><i>Cry unto him in your houses, yea, over all your household, both morning, mid-day, and evening.</i><br><br><i>Yea, cry unto him against the power of your enemies.</i><br><br><i>Yea, cry unto him against the devil, who is an enemy to all righteousness.</i><br><br><i>Cry unto him over the crops of your fields, that ye may prosper in them.</i><br><br><i>Cry unto him over the flocks of your fields, that they may increase.</i><br><br><i>But this is not all; ye must pour out your souls in your closets, and your secret places, and in your wilderness.</i><br><br><i>Yea, and when you do not cry unto the Lord, let your hearts be full, drawn out in prayer unto him continually for your welfare, and also for the welfare of those who are around you.</i>[Alma 34:17–27]<br><br>Now, young folks, when you pray, follow the counsel Jesus gave to his disciples on the mount when he said:<br><br><i>And when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the hypocrites are: for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.</i><br><br><i>But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret; and thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly.</i>[Matthew 6:5–6]<br><br>I have found in my life that there is great power in secret prayer. There is, of course, power in family prayer and prayers in groups anywhere. But when we pray in the presence of others, our words may be tempered to their ears. When we pray in secret, we know that only our Father can hear. It always humbles me to seek and obtain a private interview with him. Make up your minds to pray with such humility, earnestness, and faith that you can intimately commune with the Lord.<br><h2><b>Observe the Word of Wisdom</b></h2><br>Another thing you must do if you would merit the blessings of the great millennium is to<i>make up your minds to live the Word of Wisdom.</i>Make up your minds to implement its positive counsel, as well as to avoid the use of liquor, tobacco, and all other drugs. Consider for a moment the greatness of the need for the blessings promised to those who live the Word of Wisdom. Listen to these blessings and ponder them:<br><br><i>All saints who remember to keep and do these sayings, walking in obedience to the commandments, shall receive health in their naval and marrow to their bones;</i><br><br><i>And shall find wisdom and great treasures of knowledge, even hidden treasures;</i><br><br><i>And shall run and not be weary, and shall walk and not faint.</i><br><br><i>And I, the Lord, give unto them a promise, that the destroying angel shall pass by them, as the children of Israel, and not slay them. Amen.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 89:18–21]<br><br>Each of these four promised blessings--health, wisdom, strength, and protection against the destroying angel--is invaluable. I shall comment on but one of them, "wisdom and great treasures of knowledge." Our civilization is disintegrating for want of wisdom. The wisdom of our wise men has perished, and the understanding of our prudent men has come to naught. The seriousness of our plight is widely acknowledged. For example, speaking at the University of Utah Hinckley Institute of Politics just a week ago, Dr. Benn Wood, a Columbia University professor, said:<br><br><i>Unless we develop politicians who are both wise and honest, we may be doomed as surely as were the dinosaurs who once were the overlords of</i>[this]<i>earth.</i><br><br><i>. . . problems that now threaten the world have the possible outcome of a major atomic war.</i><br><br><i>We have to realize and keep in mind that we are all citizens of the world. We are on a boat in space, and if the boat goes down</i>[we're]<i>lost no matter which end of the boat</i>[we]<i>happen to be in.</i>[<i>Deseret News,</i>17 October 1974]<br><br>Kurt Waldheim, secretary-general of the United Nations, spoke in a like vein in introducing his report on the work of the United Nations, issued on August 30 of this year:<br><br><i>I do not wish to conceal . . . my profound concern about the situation which now prevails in the world, a concern which I know to be shared by responsible people everywhere. There is an almost universal sense of apprehension about where the tumultuous developments of our time may take us, a sense of deep anxiety</i>[of]<i>phenomena which we do not fully understand, let alone control. In all the speculation, much of it depressing, about the shape of the future, there recurs a note of helplessness and fatalism which I find deeply disturbing. This is not a new phenomenon. Dire prophecies have often before been the symptoms of periods of transition and change in human society. What is new is the scope and scale of the problems which give rise to these apprehensions. They are problems of the world as a whole. . . .</i><br><br><i>Many great civilizations in history have collapsed at the very height of their achievement because they were unable to analyse their problems, to change direction, and to adjust to the new situations which faced them by concerting their wisdom and strength. Today the civilization which is facing such a challenge is not just one small part of mankind--it is mankind as a whole.</i>[In "Introduction to the Report of the Secretary-General on the Work of the Organization," 30 August 1974]<br><br>If you were to go into the councils where the decisions for ruling the nations of the earth today are made, you would find precious few men in them who could claim the blessings of "wisdom and great treasures of knowledge, even hidden treasures," by reason of having obeyed the Word of Wisdom.<br><h2><b>Pay Your Offerings</b></h2><br>Now, having made up your minds to pray and to obey the Word of Wisdom, make up your minds to be honest with your Heavenly Father in paying your tithing. One of the sisters told me not to preach about tithing tonight, nor about the paying of fast offerings. Well, double your fast offerings and now listen to this on tithing. Tithing is a debt which we owe to the Lord. It's not merely a voluntary offering. Great are the promised rewards for paying tithing. Here is one which the Lord gave through the prophet Malachi:<br><br><i>Bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse, that there may be meat in mine house, and prove me now herewith, saith the Lord of hosts, if I will not open you the windows of heaven, and pour you out a blessing, that there shall not be room enough to receive it.</i><br><br><i>And I will rebuke the devourer for your sakes, and he shall not destroy the fruits of your ground; neither shall your vine cast her fruit before the time in the field, saith the Lord of hosts.</i><br><br><i>And all nations shall call you blessed: for ye shall be a delightsome land, saith the Lord of hosts.</i>[Malachi 3:10–12]<br><br>That this promise of a material reward for the payment of tithing has universal application is evidenced by the fact that it was repeated by the resurrected Lord himself to the Nephites and by the further fact that he instructed them to write what he said in their records so that it might come down to us in the Book of Mormon (3 Nephi 24). Furthermore, when Moroni visited the Prophet Joseph Smith on the evening of September 21, 1823, he quoted to him "part of the third chapter of Malachi," which is the chapter in which this promise is made. In harmony with this scripture, I have heard President J. Reuben Clark, Jr., a modern prophet, say that the Lord would never let any of his Saints who had been faithful in the payment of tithes and offerings go without the necessities of life. That the Lord faithfully fulfills this promise is witnessed by all peoples who have obeyed the law. The record, as far back as 700 B.C., says that Hezekiah<br><br><i>Commanded the people that dwelt in Jerusalem to</i>[pay tithes and offerings]. . . .<br><br><i>And . . . the children of Israel brought in abundance . . . the tithe of all things . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . and laid them by heaps. . . .</i><br><br><i>Then Hezekiah questioned with the priests and the Levites concerning the heaps.</i><br><br><i>And Azariah the chief priest . . . answered him, and said, Since the people began to bring the offerings into the house of the Lord, we have had enough to eat, and have had plenty: for the Lord hath blessed his people; and that which is left is this great store.</i>[2 Chronicles 31:4, 5, 6, 9–10]<br><br>I myself, and I have no doubt that you also, have heard many people tell of temporal blessings resulting form the payment of tithing.<br><br>Another blessing for paying tithing is immunity from the burning which is to accompany the Lord's imminent second advent:<br><br><i>Behold, now it is called today until the coming of the Son of Man, and verily it is a day of sacrifice, and a day for the tithing of my people; for he that is tithed shall not be burned at his coming.</i><br><br><i>For after today cometh the burning--this is speaking after the manner of the Lord--for verily I say, tomorrow all the proud and they that do wickedly shall be as stubble; and I will burn them up, for I am the Lord of Hosts; and I will not spare any that remain in Babylon.</i><br><br><i>Wherefore, if ye believe me, ye will labor while it is called today.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 64:23–25]<br><h2><b>Be Chaste</b></h2><br>Another must for us Latter-day Saints is to<i>make up our minds to obey the sixth commandment, "Thou shalt not commit adultery"</i>(Exodus 20:14). In this connection, let us remember that the Lord has made no fine distinction between adultery and fornication. Alma, speaking to his son Corianton, emphasized the importance of this great commandment:<br><br><i>And this is not all, my son. Thou didst do that which was grievous unto me; for thou didst forsake the ministry, and did go over into the land of Siron, among the borders of the Lamanites, after the harlot Isabel.</i><br><br><i>Yea, she did steal away the hearts of many; but this was no excuse for thee, my son. Thou shouldst have tended to the ministry wherewith thou wast entrusted.</i><br><br><i>Know ye not, my son</i>["Know ye not?" young folks],<i>that these things are an abomination in the sight of the Lord; yea, most abominable above all sins save it be the shedding of innocent blood or denying the Holy Ghost?</i>[Alma 39:3–5]<br><br>Pornography, sex permissiveness and perversion, fornication, adultery, and abortion will lead every person and community that surrenders to them to perdition. Make up your minds to avoid them at the price of your lives if need be. Remember President Clark's powerful plea:<br><br><i>And now you young people--May I directly entreat you to be chaste. Please believe me when I say that chastity is worth more than life itself. This is the doctrine my parents taught me; it is truth. Better die chaste than live unchaste. The salvation of your very souls is concerned in this. . . .</i><br><br><i>To you young men I say that any woman who comes to you offering her person outside of legal wedlock, is playing the harlot.</i><br><br><i>I ask you young women to believe me . . . when I say that any young man who demands your chastity as the price of his love, is spiritually unclean, and is offering something that is not worth the purchase price; his love will turn to ashes under your touch; it will lead you to misery and shame; and too often it will curse you with dread disease.</i>[<i>Conference Report,</i>October 1938, p. 138]<br><br>Ella Wheeler Wilcox emphasizes this penalty of disease in her poem "The Price He Paid":<br><i>I said I would have my fling,</i><br><i>And do what a young man may;</i><br><i>I didn't believe in a thing</i><br><i>That the preachers had to say.</i><br><i>And I didn't believe in a God,</i><br><i>That give us blood and fire,</i><br><i>Then flings us into hell</i><br><i>Because we follow the call of Desire.</i><br><br><i>And I said, Religion is rot--</i><br><i>And the laws of the world are nil;</i><br><i>And the bad man is he who is caught;</i><br><i>And cannot foot the bill.</i><br><i>And there is no such place called hell,</i><br><i>And heaven is only a truth,</i><br><i>When a man has his way with a maid</i><br><i>In the fresh keen hours of youth;</i><br><br><i>"And the money can buy us grace</i><br><i>If it rings on the plate of the church;</i><br><i>And money can quickly erase</i><br><i>Each sign of a sinful smirch."</i><br><i>For I saw men everywhere</i><br><i>Hot-footing the road to vice;</i><br><i>And women and preachers smiled on them</i><br><i>So long as they paid the price.</i><br><br><i>So I had my joy of life</i><br><i>And I went the pace of the town,</i><br><i>And then I took me a wife</i><br><i>And started to settle down.</i><br><i>I had gold enough to spare</i><br><i>For all of the simple joys</i><br><i>That go with a house and a home</i><br><i>And a brood of girls and boys.</i><br><i>I married a girl with health,</i><br><i>And virtue, and spotless fame;</i><br><i>I gave in exchange my wealth,</i><br><i>And a proud old family name.</i><br><i>And I gave her the love of a heart</i><br><i>Grown sated and sick of sin,</i><br><i>My deal with the devil was up,</i><br><i>And the last bill handed in.</i><br><br><i>She was going to give me a child;</i><br><i>And when in anguish she cried</i><br><i>With love and fear I was wild;</i><br><i>But now, I wish she had died;</i><br><i>For the son she bore me was blind,</i><br><i>And crippled, and weak, and sore</i><br><i>And the mother was left a wreck.</i><br><i>Aye it was so, she had settled my score.</i><br><br><i>I said I would have my fling,</i><br><i>And they knew the paths I would go.</i><br><i>But no one told me a thing,</i><br><i>Of what I needed to know.</i><br><i>Folks talk too much of a soul,</i><br><i>From heavenly joys debarred;</i><br><i>But not enough of the babes unborn,</i><br><i>By the sins of their father scarred.</i><br><br>Another poem, "To Be Happy," emphasizes the importance of high standards:<br><br><i>You've go to be straight to be happy,</i><br><i>You've go to be square as a die.<br>Through wrong may come infinite pleasures,<br>But they fade, and they fly.<br><i>You've got to take life at its noblest</i><br>If you want to have gladness that counts,<br>Want the verve and the zeal of the spirit<br>That lifts you along as it mounts.<br>And, Oh! how it pays out of goodness<br>To draw for each day as we strive<br>Some measures of clean, healthy gladness,<br>In our work, and for being alive!<br><i>You've got to be true to be happy,</i><br>Be true to yourself over all,<br>And be blind to the lure of evil,<br>And deaf to its powerful call.<br>To set up high standards and keep them,<br>With the records so straight and so true,<br>For nothing can ever condemn them,<br>If that is your creed, it will do.<br><i>You've got to be clean to be happy,</i><br><i>You've go to be steadfast and pure.</i><br>If you want what life gives that is earnest,<br>That will help, and will hold, and endure.</i><br><br>[Author unknown, quoted from the<i>Baltimore Sun;</i>emphasis added]<br><br>No matter what others say and do, our own consciences are the final arbiters. We will never be happy living below our own personal standards. That each of us will make up our minds, with real intent, to pray, live the Word of Wisdom, be an honest tithe payer, and strictly obey the sixth commandment, I humbly pray. leave you my blessings, my beloved young folks, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Marion G.

<h1>eness of Zion: Joseph Smith and the Lighter View - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
This morning I should like to say a few words about things we have found in the documents in the Church Archives that bear on the life and character of Joseph Smith. During the past two years I have had the opportunity of going through the diaries, letters, and histories of the Prophet and of those associated with him. This has given me an added appreciation of Joseph Smith as a person and leader.<br><br>With respect to his life as a boy, the evidence accumulated by Richard Anderson, Marvin Hill, Dean Jessee, Ivan Barrett, and others shows that the family in which he grew up were hard workers, intelligent people, but not highly educated. They apparently prayed as a family every morning and evening, enjoyed singing hymns, read the Bible together, and were very interested in religion. The boys enjoyed homemade sports such as playing ball, wrestling, and pulling sticks. One neighbor described Joseph as "a real clever, jovial boy"; another neighbor said that the Smiths were "the best family in the neighborhood in case of sickness," and said that Young Joe, as he called him, worked for him "and he was a good worker" (William H. and E. L. Kelley interviews,<i>Saints' Herald</i>[1881], 161–68, quoted in Richard L. Anderson, "A Corrected View of Joseph Smith's New York Reputation").<br><br>Joseph's father, it appears, reacted against the strict discipline required by the contemporary religions of the day. The devout people of his day were not many generations removed from the Puritans, and the goal set up by the ministers of the time was that each church member should become a spiritual athlete--that is, work unceasingly at being a religious person. Brigham Young, who was five years older than the Prophet, described how he was brought up:<br><br><i>When I was young</i>[he said],<i>I was kept within very strict bounds, and was not allowed to walk more than half-an-hour on Sunday for exercise.</i>[In fact, he said<i>], the proper and necessary gambols of youth</i>[were]<i>denied me. . . . I had not a chance to dance when I was young, and never heard the enchanting tones of the violin, until I was eleven years of age; and then I thought I was on the high way to hell, if I suffered myself to linger and listen to it. . . . The Christian world of my youth considered it very wicked to listen to music and to dance.</i>[<i>Journal of Discourses</i><em>,</em> 2:94]<br><br>He went on to say that the parents of his day whipped their children for reading novels, never let them go to the theater, and prohibited them from playing or associating with other children. In his words, "They bind them to the moral law." The consequence was that duty became "loathsome," he said; "when they are freed by age from the rigorous training of their parents, they are more fit for companions to devils, than to be the children of such religious parents" (<i>Journal of Discourses</i>, 2:94).<br><br>The result of this strictness, he said, was that when such a child was in his late teens he tended to "steal away from father and mother; and when he has broken his bands," he said, "you would think all hell was let loose, and that he would compass the world at once" (<i>Journal of Discourses</i><em>,</em> 2:94). He left the church and ended up not belonging to any church. (I think Milton Backman has discovered that something like 90 percent of Joseph Smith's and Brigham Young's parents' generation did not belong to any church [Milton V. Backman, Jr.,<i>American Religions and the Rise of Mormonism</i>(Salt Lake City, 1965), p. 283].) As for those who did belong to churches, they were so conditioned by their early repressive experience that they felt guilty if they enjoyed the ordinary things of life and expressed that guilt in a sanctimonious demeanor and grave countenance.<br><h2><b>"Man Is that He Might Have Joy"</b></h2><br>It was in such an environment that Joseph Smith grew up. But before he went through the stage of rebellion, before the development of a guilt complex, the Lord granted to him, at the age of fourteen, that glorious First Vision. The Lord got to him, in other words, before the religions of the day were able to deaden his youthful exuberance and openness, his capacity for enjoying the mental, cultural, and physical aspects of life. He thus avoided the artificially severe, ascetic, fun-abhorring mantle that contemporary religion seemed to insist upon. He was pious, but not inhibited; earnest, but not fanatical; a warm, affectionate, and enjoyable personality--a prophet who was both serious and playful--a wonderful exemplar of the precept "Man is that he might have joy."<br><br>Jedediah M. Grant, who knew the Prophet well, underscored this point when he declared that Joseph Smith preached against the "super-abundant stock of sanctimoniousness" that characterized contemporary religion. According to Elder Grant, a certain minister, out of curiosity, came to see the Prophet in Nauvoo and carried this sanctimonious spirit so far that the Prophet finally suggested to the minister that they engage in a little wrestling. The minister was so shocked that he just stood there rigid and dumbfounded, whereupon the Prophet playfully acted as though to put him on the floor and help him get up and then called attention to the so-called Christian "follies" of the time, the absurdity of the long, solemn, "asslike" tone of speaking and acting, and the dangers of excessive piety and fanaticism (<i>Journal of Discourses</i><em>,</em> 3:66–67).<br><br>In other words, the Prophet recognized as unhealthy the mind which lacked balance, perspective, and humor. In the society of his day there were many earnest people who habitually looked on the serious side of things that had no serious side, who regarded humor as incompatible with religion. It was common for these descendants of the Puritans to see displays of humor as a mark of insincerity, for humor suggested that nothing really mattered and that life was basically comic. To be overly humorous, they thought, was to be cynical toward life. But Joseph Smith saw humor and religion as quite reconcilable. As he saw it, once one acknowledges that there is something beyond laughter--a core of life that is solemn, serious, and tender--there is still plenty of room for jesting. At least, that is the way he was--"a jolly good fellow," as one contemporary described him.<br><br>That this is the way Joseph Smith turned out there can be no doubt. We have a number of contemporary descriptions of him. One person, after meeting him, said, "He possesses the innate refinement that one finds in the born poet or in the most highly cultivated intellectual." Another found him a "sociable, easy, cheerful, obliging, kind, and hospitable person." Another described him as "kind and considerate, taking a personal interest in all people, considering everyone his equal." Still another describes him as "a fine, noble looking man." All of this suggests that he had a balanced, well-adjusted, healthy personality and that people enjoyed being around him and he them.<br><h2><b>The Prophet's Jovial Nature</b></h2><br>Joseph was confident and sure of himself but did not take himself more seriously than the circumstances warranted. As recorded in the Sermons of Joseph Smith file at the Church Archives, he said in 1843, "I am not a very pious man [in terms of the superpiety of Christian ministers of his day]. I do not wish to be a great deal better than anybody else" (compare<i>History of the Church</i><em>,</em> 5:401). Then he went on to explain that he enjoyed being with people, wanted to be with them as well in the hereafter, and thus did not wrap himself in a pious rectitude which would separate him from his brothers and sisters.<br><br>Emma's lot must have been a difficult one, for he was always bringing home a group to dinner. But she was a good cook. "When I want a little bread and milk," Joseph told William W. Phelps, "my wife loads the table with so many good things it destroys my appetite."<br><br>The Prophet enjoyed his family. There are dozens of references in his official diary that read like this one of March 27, 1834: "Remained at home and had great joy with my family." Indeed, according to a cousin, George A. Smith, one convert family apostatized because, when they arrived in Kirtland from the East, Joseph came downstairs from the room "where he had been translating by the gift and power of God" and began to romp and play with his children (<i>Journal of Discourses</i>, 2:214). In their view, this was not proper behavior for a prophet! The Prophet's journal mentions going with his family to musical concerts, the theater, and circus performances, and taking excursions on Mississippi riverboats.<br><br>Joseph's well-adjusted nature was infectious. Those brought up in the strict, long-faced, pious tradition soon found themselves liberated so they could fulfill their foreordained roles of being leaders of the Saints. Converts who had been brought up with less enjoyment of life and spontaneity were unfrozen; their experiences and enjoyments were expanded. The wholesome healthiness of Joseph Smith, in other words, brought changes in the unhealthy piety and smugness and sanctimoniousness of others who were benefited by association with him. Religion was not to<i>confine</i>spirits, he pointed out, but to<i>expand</i>them. Direct experience with the Prophet gave them reassurance of the fuller and more joyful life the gospel called for them to live.<br><br>Brigham Young, for example, despite his pious upbringing, learned to dance, very stately to be sure, learned to be an actor (he played the part of the High Priest in "Pizarro"), and in short enjoyed life and helped those associated with him to enjoy life, despite their many trials and problems. No wonder Brigham Young said, "I feel like shouting hallelujah, all the time, when I think that I ever knew Joseph Smith, the Prophet" (<i>Journal of Discourses</i><em>,</em> 3:51).<br><br>Because of this spontaneity, joviality, and combination of seriousness of purpose and good humor, everybody was quickly attracted to Joseph Smith. His religion, revelations, and spirituality attracted them, of course, but so did his person, and converts did not fail to mention this in their diaries and letters. In fact, meeting him for the first time was such a momentous occasion that nearly everyone who kept a diary or wrote his life history recorded that first encounter, as if it were the greatest event of their lives--which, of course, for many of them it was!<br><h2><b>Work and Recreation in the Early Church</b></h2><br>When Brigham Young and his brother Joseph Young went to see Joseph Smith in 1832, "they found him chopping wood, for [as Wilford Woodruff said] he was a labouring man, and gained his bread by the sweat of his brow." The Prophet, according to the account of this meeting, "received them gladly, invited them to his house, and they rejoiced together in the Gospel of Christ, and their hearts were knitted together in the spirit and bond of union" (<i>Journal of Discourses</i><em>,</em> 7:100).<br><br>When Wilford Woodruff first met the Prophet in April 1834 at Kirtland, he wrote:<br><br><i>I saw him out in the field with his brother Hyrum: he had on a very old hat. . . . I was introduced to him, and he invited me home with him.</i><br><br><i>I accepted the invitation, and I watched him pretty closely, to see what I could learn. He remarked, while passing to his house, that this was the first hour he had spent in recreation for a long time.</i><br><br><i>Shortly after we arrived at his house, he went into an adjoining room, and brought out a wolf-skin, and said, "Brother Woodruff, I want you to help me to tan this." So I pulled off my coat, went to work and helped him, and felt honoured in so doing. He was about going up with the brethren to redeem Zion, and he wanted this wolf-skin to put upon his waggon seat, as he had no buffalo robe. . . . Well, we tanned it, and used it. . . . This was my first introduction to the Prophet Joseph Smith. . . . I rejoiced to behold his face and to hear his voice. I was fully satisfied that Joseph was a Prophet</i>. [<i>Journal of Discourses</i><em>,</em> 7:101; also<i>Millennial Star</i>53 (1891): 627–28]).<br><br>Brother Woodruff had reason later on to expand that first impression. After long association with the Prophet, he wrote: "I have felt to rejoice exceedingly in what I saw of brother Joseph, for in his public and private career he carried with him the Spirit of the Almighty, and he manifested a greatness of soul which I had never seen in any other man" (<i>Journal of Discourses</i><em>,</em> 7:101).<br><br>Joseph Smith had a humanizing influence on others, like Parley and Orson Pratt and Orson Hyde. Orson Hyde, for example, began one of his sermons by admitting that he had sometimes spoken too loudly and energetically and promised:<br><br><i>I shall endeavor, the Lord being my helper, to modulate my voice according to the Spirit of God that I may have when speaking, and not go beyond it, neither fall short. At the same time, I do not want my mind so trammeled as brother Parley P. Pratt's once was, when dancing was first introduced into Nauvoo among the Saints. I observed brother Parley standing in the figure, and he was making no motion particularly, only up and down. Says I, "Brother Parley, why don't you move forward?" Says he, "When I think which way I am going, I forget the step; and when I think of the step, I forget which way to go."</i>[<i>Journal of Discourses</i><em>,</em> 6:150]<br><br>The apostasy of people who saw the Prophet interspersing times of spiritual communion with periods of boisterous activity is an illustration of the teachings of his time about levity supposedly being in conflict with piety. In contrast, thousands of converts found the experience of living with the Saints in Kirtland and Nauvoo and in the Salt Lake Valley to be exhilarating. Mormonism loosened them up, as it were. From the tense and humorless pursuit of immediate goals, it gave them balance and caused them to enjoy earthly life, even when filled with sorrow and frustration. The atmosphere around Joseph was one of hope and buoyancy, of optimism and faith, of wholesome righteousness, and yet there was a loosening of the strict bonds of contemporary Calvinism.<br><br>Joseph Smith helped teach people what true religion was, and he taught them very graphically that it was<i>not</i>sanctimoniousness (<i>Journal of Discourses</i><em>,</em> 3:66–67). Not only that, he taught them that it was something which expanded their lives and potentials in the way his was expanded.<br><br>Listen to the kind of recreation the Saints held under the Prophet's direction in Nauvoo: On February 20, 1843, a "wood-cutting bee" was held at the Prophet's home. Seventy brethren attended. They sawed, chopped, split, and piled up a large stack of wood in the yard, which served not only the Prophet's family, but also the many persons they helped out. "The day was spent by them with much pleasantry, good humor and feeling," says the record. "A white oak log, measuring five feet four inches in diameter was cut through with a cross-cut saw, in four-and-a-half minutes, by Hyrum Dayton and brother John Tidwell." This tree had been previously cut by the Prophet himself, and he had hauled it to the yard with his team (Joseph Smith,<i>History of the Church</i><em>,</em> 5:282).<br><br>Joseph said that once when he was in his office, he saw two boys fighting in the street. He ran out, "caught one of the boys (who had begun the fight with clubs,) and then the other; and, after giving them proper instruction," as he termed it, "gave the bystanders a lecture" for egging the boys on instead of stopping the fight, and finally concluded the matter by saying that nobody was allowed to fight in Nauvoo but himself (<i>History of the Church</i><em>,</em> 5:282–83). Joseph Smith favored music, drama, debating, hiking, boating, athletics, parties, dancing, and picnics. He liked going for long walks, horseback riding, and getting out into the beauty of nature. Here is the account of his activities for Wednesday, February 8, 1843:<br><br><i>This morning, I read German, and visited with a brother and sister from Michigan, who thought that "a prophet is always a prophet;" but I told them that a prophet was a prophet only when he was acting as such. After dinner Brother Parley P. Pratt came in: we had conversation on various subjects. At four in the afternoon, I went out with my little</i>[son]<i>Frederick, to exercise myself by sliding on the ice.</i>[<i>History of the Church</i><em>,</em> 5:265]<br><h2><b>The Balance of Seriousness and Humor</b></h2><br>One could misunderstand all this. It is easy to carry the epicurean philosophy too far. One needs the help of the Spirit in drawing the line between living the fuller life to which we are called by the gospel and indulging in licentious behavior. The Prophet himself prayed for guidance on this principle. As with all of us, this greatest of all prophets prayed for forgiveness of his excesses, for his personal salvation. To use his own expression in a letter to Emma, "I pray that I may steer my own bark safe" (Joseph Smith to Emma Smith, 21 March 1839, Church Archives). The point I am making is that the Prophet was also concerned about extremes--becoming so concerned about the danger of overexuberance that one swings the pendulum back and focuses too heavily on repressing wrong desires. For Joseph did insist on self-control and righteous living. He was not the happy-go-lucky companion who would let his friends get away with anything: "The Saints need not think because I am familiar with them and am playful and cheerful, that I am ignorant of what is going on," he said on one occasion. "Iniquity of any kind cannot be sustained in the Church, and it will not fare well where I am; for I am determined while I do lead the Church, to lead it right" (quoted in Wilford Woodruff journal,<i>History of the Church</i><em>,</em> 5:411).<br><br>Certainly the calling of prophet was one of such high seriousness that its responsibilities could well have weighted down a less vital mind. But it was humor which helped Joseph to dispose of conflicts and problems that did not really matter. The Prophet was deeply serious, but he was not solemn; he believed an unduly solemn person had lost something of the image of his Creator.<br><br>What he was teaching the Saints in all of this, it seems to me, is something equivalent to what psychologists have referred to as the principle or law of reversed effect. This says that often our efforts to keep from doing a wrong thing are so tense and determined that they magnify our chances of doing that very thing. Paul discovered this principle when he wrote to the Romans, "I find then a law, that, when I would do good, evil is present with me" (Romans 7:21). Our difficult moral struggles require a certain relaxation and surrender. We should give the Lord and the Holy Ghost a chance to do the refreshing. This principle of relaxed enjoyment and acceptance of life, rather than tense struggle to achieve perfection, fits in with the design of the Lord's purpose, "Man is that he might have joy." This, it seems to me, is one of the things the Prophet was trying to get across. And this principle is particularly important to those of us who are a little older--as, for example, graduate students, for it is at this time that we are likely to discover the gap between our earlier aspirations and our abilities. We all have exaggerated expectations of life, and sooner or later we discover that we are less clever than we had thought, that we have to be satisfied with less income, less popularity, even a less ideal marriage than we had hoped for. In an unhealthy situation this leads to resentment, projection of blame, distress, and maladjustment. The Latter-day Saint has an ideal background for coping with this situation as he adjusts his ambitions to the place in life which the Lord has in store for him.<br><br>I pray that as individuals and as families we may laugh together, just as we pray together; that we may recognize our heritage, its few weaknesses along with its great strengths, without fear; that we may develop the cultural pride which others will expect of the Lord's chosen people; that we may appreciate the wonderfully warm and engaging persons that all of our prophets have been; and that we may continue to exhibit that loyalty to the principles of the gospel that would make the angels in heaven rejoice. And I pray this in the name of Jesus, the Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Leonard J.

<h1>ions and Gifts of Jesus Christ - Ezra Taft Benson - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
My beloved brothers and sisters, humbly and gratefully I stand before you this morning, humbled by your presence, grateful for the gospel that makes this great University possible. I hope I'll be given the strength today to say what I know the Lord wants me to say.<br><br>As we enter this Christmas season, a season of getting and giving, I would like to talk to you about a few of the many gifts we have received from our Lord, Jesus Christ, and what we in turn might give to him.<br><h2><b>Christ Gave Us His Life as a Model</b></h2><br><i>First</i>, he gave us the perfect model--himself--after which we are to pattern our lives. He said, "Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends" (John 15:13). Not only did he lay down before us the perfect example for earthly living, but for our sake he willingly gave us his life. He went through an agony both in body and spirit, of which we cannot comprehend, to bring to us the glorious blessing of the Atonement and the Resurrection (see D&amp;amp;C 19:15–19).<br><br>Some men are willing to die for their faith but will not fully live for it. Christ both lived and died for us. By walking in his steps and through his atonement we can gain the greatest gift of all--eternal life--which is that kind of life of the great Eternal One, our Father in heaven.<br><br>Christ asked the question as to what manner of men ought we to be. He answered by saying we ought to be even as he is (see 3 Nephi 27:27). That man is greatest and most blessed and joyful whose life most closely fits the pattern of the Christ. This has nothing to do with earthly wealth, power, or prestige. The only true test of greatness, blessedness, joyfulness is how close a life can come to being like the Master, Jesus Christ. He is the right way, the full truth, and the abundant life.<br><br>The constant and most recurring question in our minds, touching every thought and deed of our lives, should be "Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?" (Acts 9:6). The answer to that question can come through the Light of Christ and the Holy Ghost. Fortunate are those who so live that their beings are filled with both of them.<br><br>We have a work to do, to follow him.<br><br><i>Who does God's work will get God's pay,</i><br><i>However long may seem the day,</i><br><i>However weary be the way,</i><br><i>He does not pay as others pay,</i><br><i>In merely gold or raiments gay.</i><br><i>In only goods that will decay,</i><br><i>But His high wisdom knows a way,</i><br><i>And this is sure, let come what may,</i><br><i>Who does God's work will get God's pay.</i><br><br>I testify to you that his pay for his work is the best pay that you can get in this world or any other.<br><h2><b>Christ Gave Us a Prophet</b></h2><br><i>Secondly</i>, in addition to Christ providing us the gift of his life as a model, he has provided us the gift of a prophet. Of all mortal men, we should keep our eyes most firmly fixed on the captain, the prophet, seer, and revelator, and President of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. This is the man who stands closest to the fountain of living waters. There are some heavenly instructions for us that we can only receive through the prophet. A good way to measure your standing with the Lord is to see how you feel about, and act upon, the inspired words of his earthly representative, the Prophet-President. The inspired words of the President are not to be trifled with. All men are entitled to inspiration, and various men are entitled to revelation for their particular assignments. But only one man stands as the Lord's spokesman to the Church and the world, and he is the President of the Church. The words of all other men should be weighed against his inspired words.<br><br>Although his prophet is mortal, God will not let him lead his Church astray. God knows all things, the end from the beginning, and no man becomes President of the church of Jesus Christ by accident, nor remains there by chance, nor is called home by happenstance (<i>The Discourses of Wilford Woodruff</i>, ed. G. Homer Durham [Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1946], pp. 212–13).<br><br>The most important prophet, so far as we are concerned, is the one who is living in our day and age. This is the prophet who has today's instructions from God to us. God's revelation to Adam did not instruct Noah how to build the ark. Every generation has the need of the ancient scripture, plus the current scripture from the living prophet. Therefore, the most crucial reading and pondering which you should do is the latest inspired words from the Lord's mouthpiece. That is why it is essential that you have access to and carefully read his words in Church periodicals.<br><br>Yes, we thank thee, O God, for a prophet to guide us in these latter days.<br><h2><b>Christ Gave Us His Church</b></h2><br><i>Thirdly</i>, in addition to the gifts of the life of Christ and his prophet is the gift of his church, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, "the only true and living Church upon the face of the whole earth" (D&amp;amp;C 1:30). There is no salvation nor exaltation for us outside of the Church. Through it we receive baptism, priesthood, celestial marriage, and other sealing powers. It is the organized means which God is using to establish and expand his work. We must work with it and in it, build it up and move it forward. We should be willing to give generously of our time, talents, and means for the Church. No matter what happens to the world, the Church will grow in strength and will be intact when the Lord comes again.<br><br>God has assured us that the Church will never again be taken from the earth because of apostasy. He has said that he is pleased with the Church, speaking collectively and not individually (D&amp;amp;C 1:30). This means that certain individuals within the Church may go astray and even fall away. This may happen even to a person in the Church who is in a position of some influence and authority. It has happened in the past. It will happen in the future. If our faith is in Jesus Christ and not in the arm of flesh, then we will know that we are members of the church of Jesus Christ and not the church of men.<br><br>If you see some individual in the Church doing things which disturb you, or you feel the Church is not doing things the way you think they could or should be done, the following principles might be helpful.<br><br>God has to work through mortals of varying degrees of spiritual progress. Sometimes he temporarily grants to men their unwise requests in order that they might learn from their own sad experiences. Some refer to this as the "Samuel principle." The children of Israel wanted a king, like all the nations. The prophet Samuel was displeased and prayed to the Lord about it. The Lord responded by saying to Samuel, "They have not rejected thee, but they have rejected me, that I should not reign over them." The Lord told Samuel to warn the people of the consequences if they had a king. Samuel gave them the warning, but they still insisted on their king. So God gave them a king and let them suffer. They learned the hard way. God wanted it to be otherwise, but within certain bounds he grants unto men according to their desires. Bad experiences are an expensive school that only fools keep going to (see 1 Samuel 8).<br><br>Sometimes in our attempts to mimic the world, contrary to the prophet's counsel, we run after the world's false educational, political, musical, and dress ideas. New worldly standards take over, a gradual breakdown occurs, and finally, after much suffering, a humble people are ready to be taught once again a higher law.<br><br>Now, during all this gradual lowering of standards, the righteous should be living up to the highest personal standards they can--not forcing those standards on others but preparing for and awaiting a better day which surely must come. This leads me to another principle: that a leader cannot lead without followers. If better standards are to be observed, there must be a better people to do it.<br><br>The Book of Mormon talks about "clearing" away the branches<br><br><i>which bring forth bitter fruit, according to the strength of the good and the size thereof; and ye shall not clear away the bad thereof all at once, lest the roots thereof should be too strong for the graft, and the graft thereof shall perish. . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . wherefore ye shall clear away the bad according as the good shall grow, that the root and the top may be equal in strength until the good shall overcome the bad.</i>[Jacob 5:65, 66]<br><br>Only a Zion people can bring in a Zion society. And as the Zion people increase, so we will be able to incorporate more of the principles of Zion until we have a people prepared to receive the Lord.<br><br>This means that on this campus, in due time, there will be an increasing number of textbooks written by inspired men of the Church. There will be less and less a tendency to subscribe to the false teachings of men. There will be more and more a tendency first to lay the groundwork of the gospel truth in every subject and then, if necessary, to show where the world may fall short of that standard. In due time there will be increased teaching by the Spirit of God, but that can take place only if there is a decreased promotion of the precepts of men.<br><br>We seek that which is praiseworthy, lovely, virtuous, and of good report; and we salute Beethoven, Shakespeare, Rembrandt, and Michelangelo. In due time, we will also have more of our own giants--particularly great father-patriarchs and noble companions and mothers of men. There is certain music heard and art seen and clothes worn on this campus that must pass away--not because the styles change but because our standards will be improved.<br><br>When individual actions of some Church members disturb you, here's another principle to consider. This is the principle of stewardship. As the kingdom grows larger, more and more responsibilities have to be delegated and stewardships handed out. Men respond in different degrees of valiancy to their stewardships. God is very patient and long-suffering as he waits for some of us to rise to our responsibilities. He usually gives a man a long enough rope and a long enough time either to pull himself up to the presence of God or to drop off somewhere below. But while God is patient, no puny arm of man in his stewardship can long impede or pervert the work of the Lord. The mills of God grind slowly, but they grind ever so finely.<br><br>Because God has given men their agency, there will always be those who will misuse it. The gospel net draws in the good and the bad, the best and the worst--the worst because the devil, before the final cleansing, puts some of his followers within the kingdom in order to try and destroy it. We have some of them within the kingdom today, and in due course their number shall be known. Time has a way of taking care of all things, of elevating the good and bringing down the bad. If we see things going on within the kingdom that disturb us, we might first resolve if the matter falls within our stewardship. We then might go to the person or people involved. If it is of such a nature that we think it should be called to the attention of higher authority, then we can, in a kindly and quiet manner, take the necessary steps at the proper level.<br><br>To publish differences we may think we have with the leaders of the Church, to create strife and division, is a sure road to apostasy. Our task is to stick with the kingdom, not to let anything or anybody disaffect or sour us toward that great gift which Christ has given us--his church.<br><br>The Church is true. Keep its laws; attend its meetings; sustain its leaders; accept its callings; get its recommend; enjoy its blessings.<br><h2><b>Christ Gave Us the Scriptures</b></h2><br><i>Fourthly</i>, in addition to the gifts of the life of Christ, his prophet, and his church is the gift of scripture, particularly the Book of Mormon.<br><br>In his dedicatory prayer for the Washington Temple, President Kimball referred to the Book of Mormon, as did the Prophet Joseph, as the most correct book. The Prophet Joseph Smith also called it the keystone of our religion. He said that "a man would get nearer to God by abiding by its precepts, than by any other book" (<i>History of the Church</i>, 4:461). That book was written for our day. Mormon, who compiled it, saw us in vision and was directed to put into the book those things God felt we would especially need in our time. There was inspiration in making the Book of Mormon a required religion class on this campus. The faculty and student body should know the Book of Mormon better than any other book. Not only should we know what history and faith-promoting stories it contains, but we should also understand its teachings. If we really did our homework and approached the Book of Mormon doctrinally, we could expose the errors and find the truths to combat many of the current false theories and philosophies of men, including socialism, humanism, organic evolution, and others.<br><br>I have noted within the Church the difference in discernment, in insight, in conviction, and in spirit between those who know and love the Book of Mormon and those who do not. That book is a great sifter.<br><h2><b>Christ Gave Us the Constitution</b></h2><br><i>Fifth</i>, in addition to the gifts of the life of Christ, his prophet, his church, and the Book of Mormon is the gift of his Constitution. The Lord said, "I established the Constitution of this land, by the hands of wise men whom I raised up" (D&amp;amp;C 101:80). Among the opening words of his dedicatory prayer at the Washington Temple, President Kimball referred to our inspired Constitution.<br><br>The elders of this Church have a prophetic mission yet to perform so far as the Constitution is concerned. In a discourse on July 19, 1840, Joseph Smith said, "Even this nation will be on the very verge of crumbling to pieces and tumbling to the ground, and when the Constitution is upon the brink of ruin, this people will be the staff upon which the nation shall lean, and they shall bear the Constitution away from the very verge of destruction" (M8d 155, Bx4, Joseph Smith, Church Historian's Library).<br><br>Now, how are the elders going to prepare for that mission? How are they going to know what the Constitution is, so they will know when it is on the brink of ruin? In many of the law schools of today you will hear that the Constitution is whatever the Supreme Court says it is. Could it be that the Supreme Court, which President McKay said is leading this nation down the road to atheism, is the agency to tell us what this divine document is (David O. McKay, Church News, 22 June 1963; Jerreld Newquist, comp.,<i>Prophets, Principles, and National Survival</i>, pp. 187–88)? Can we learn best how to preserve it by studying what it is at the hands of some of those who are seeking to destroy it?<br><br>But President McKay had a better approach when he encouraged us to support good and conscientious candidates who are truly dedicated to<i>the Constitution in the tradition of our founding fathers</i>. They are the ones the Lord referred to as wise men. It is to them, the Lord, and his prophets that we should go to determine what the Constitution is. There must have been a tradition of our founding fathers, or President McKay would not have referred to it. (One of the best books on this subject was written by Clarence Carson, entitled<i>The American Tradition</i>, distributed by The Foundation for Economic Education at Irvington-on-Hudson, New York. President J. Reuben Clark served on their board of trustees for some time. I now have the honor of so serving.) To the Lord, his prophets, and the founding fathers we must go to learn of this divine document so that our efforts will be to preserve and not to destroy the Constitution.<br><br>The Prophet Joseph Smith said in a great discourse in Nauvoo on February 7, 1844, "Were I the president of the United States . . . I would honor the old paths of the venerated fathers of freedom; I would walk in the tracks of the illustrious patriots who carried the ark of the Government upon their shoulders with an eye single to the glory of the people" (<i>History of the Church</i>, 6:208).<br><br>Said President George Albert Smith, "I am saying to you that to me the Constitution of the United States of America is just as much from my Heavenly Father as the Ten Commandments. When that is my feeling I am not going to go very far away from the Constitution and I am going to try to keep it where the Lord started it, and not let anti-Christ come into this country" (<i>Conference Report</i>, April 1948, p. 182).<br><br>And speaking of anti-Christ, I would like to tell you, if you want to get some idea of how we are flaunting the Constitution, see how the Constitution defines treason. Then observe what we are doing to build up the enemy in this totally anti-Christ conspiracy. If we continue on this tragic course of aid and trade to the enemy, then the Lord has warned us of the consequences which will follow in chapter eight of Ether in the Book of Mormon.<br><br>Thank God for the Constitution, which made it possible for the Lord to establish his church and base of operations here in the United States for these last days. And may God bless the elders of Israel so that when, as President John Taylor said, "the people shall have torn to shreds the Constitution of the United States the Elders of Israel will be found holding it up to the nations of earth and proclaiming liberty" (<i>Journal of Discourses</i>, 21:8).<br><br>Now, Christ's life, his prophet, his church, the Book of Mormon, the Constitution of the United Sates are but a few of the gifts of Christ to bless us, not only at this season, but also throughout our lives.<br><h2><b>Our Gifts to Christ</b></h2><br>And now, my friends--what can we possibly give to the Lord this Christmastime? In consideration of all that he has done and is doing for us, there is something that we might give him in return.<br><br>Christ's great gift to us was his life and sacrifice--should that not then be our small gift to him--our lives and sacrifices, not only now, but in the future? A few years ago, my colleague, Elder Boyd Packer, said this:<br><br><i>I'm not ashamed to say that . . . I want to be good. And I've found in my life that it has been critically important that this was established between me and the Lord so that I knew that He knew which way I committed my agency. I went before Him and said, "I'm not neutral, and you can do with me what you want. If you need my vote, it's there. I don't care what you do with me, and you don't have to take anything from me, because I give it to you--everything, all I own, all I am." And that makes the difference.</i>[Seminary and Institute conference, summer 1970]<br><br>Yes, men and women who turn their lives over to God will find out that he can make a lot more out of their lives than they can. He will deepen their joys, expand their vision, quicken their minds, strengthen their muscles, lift their spirits, multiply their blessings, increase their opportunities, comfort their souls, raise up friends, and pour out peace. Whoever will lose his life to God will find he has eternal life.<br><br>And now as to our sacrifice to him. Yes, sacrifice is the crowning test of the gospel. Men are tried and tested in this mortal probation to see if they will put first into their lives the things of the kingdom of God (see Matthew 6:33). To gain eternal life, they must be willing, if called upon, to sacrifice all things for the gospel. "If thou wilt be perfect," Jesus said to the rich young man, "go and sell that thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come and follow me."<br><br>Hearing this injunction, Peter said, "Behold, we have forsaken all, and followed thee; what shall we have therefore?"<br><br>To this query, our Lord replied, "Every one that hath forsaken houses, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my name's sake, shall receive an hundredfold, and shall inherit everlasting life" (Matthew 19:16–29; see also D&amp;amp;C 132:55).<br><br>Joseph Smith said this about sacrifice:<br><br><i>For a man to lay down his all, his character and reputation, his honor and applause, his good name among men, his houses, his lands, his brothers and sisters, his wife and children, and even his life--counting all things but filth and dross for the excellency of the knowledge of Jesus Christ--requires more than mere belief or supposition that he is doing the will of God; but actual knowledge, realizing that, when these sufferings are ended he will enter into eternal rest; and be a partaker of the glory of God. . . . A religion that does not require the sacrifice of all things never has power sufficient to produce the faith necessary unto life and salvation; for, from the first existence of man, the faith necessary unto the enjoyment of life and salvation never could be obtained without the sacrifice of all earthly things. It was through this sacrifice, and this only that God has ordained that men should enjoy eternal life.</i>[<i>Lectures on Faith</i>, pp. 58–60]<br><br>Elder Bruce McConkie said, "Sacrifice pertains to mortality; in the eternal sense there is none. Sacrifice involves giving up the things of this world because of the promises of blessings to be gained in a better world. In the eternal perspective there is no sacrifice in giving up all things--even including the laying down of one's life--if eternal life is gained through such a course" (<i>Mormon Doctrine</i>[Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1966], p. 664; see also D&amp;amp;C 98:13–15).<br><br>But just as when one loses his life to God he really finds the abundant life; so also, when one sacrifices all to God, then God in return shares all that he has with him. Try as you may, you cannot put the Lord in your debt--for every time you try to do his will he simply pours out more blessings upon you. Sometimes the blessings may seem to you to be a little slow in coming; perhaps this tests your faith, but come they will and abundantly. And it has been said, "Cast your bread upon the waters and after a while it comes back toasted and buttered."<br><br>Said President Brigham Young:<br><br><i>I have heard a great many tell about what they have suffered for Christ's sake. I am happy to say I never had occasion to. I have enjoyed a great deal, but so far as suffering goes I have compared it a great many times, in my feelings and before congregations, to a man wearing an old, worn-out, tattered and dirty coat, and somebody comes along and gives him one that is new, whole and beautiful. This is the comparison I draw when I think of what I've suffered for the Gospel's sake--I have thrown away an old coat and have put on a new one.</i>[<i>Discourses of Brigham Young</i>, comp. John A. Widtsoe (Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Co., 1973), p. 348]<br><br>The saints never suffer as the sinners do, President Young explained:<br><br><i>As to trials, why bless your hearts, the man or woman who enjoys the spirit of our religion has no trials; but the man or woman who tries to live according to the Gospel of the Son of God, and at the same time clings to the spirit of the world, has trials and sorrows acute and keen, and that, too, continually.</i><br><br><i>Cast off the yoke of the enemy, and put on the yoke of Christ, and you will say that his yoke is easy and his burden is light. This I know by experience</i>. [<i>Discourses of Brigham Young</i>, p. 348]<br><br>Do you know one reason why righteous mothers love their children so much? It's because they sacrifice so much for them. We love what we sacrifice for, and we sacrifice for what we love.<br><br>But when you give little you receive little. Said the poet:<br><br><i>I bargained with life for a penny</i><br><i>And life would pay no more;</i><br><i>However I begged at evening</i><br><i>When I counted my scanty store.</i><br><br><i>For life is a just employer,</i><br><i>It pays you what you ask;</i><br><i>But once you have set the wages,</i><br><i>Why you must bear the task.</i><br><br><i>I work for a menial's hire,</i><br><i>Only to learn, dismayed;</i><br><i>That any wage I had asked of life,</i><br><i>Life would have willingly paid.</i><br>[Jessie Belle Rittenhouse, "My Wage"]<br><br>Why don't we go all the way with the Lord--not part way? Why don't we sacrifice all of our sins--not some of them?<br><br>She was a young girl. She had sacrificed her worldly plans to spend long, tedious hours in work in order to provide for and raise her younger orphan brother. But now she lay on her bed, dying of a sickness. She called for her bishop, and as she talked to him in her last moments, he held her rough, hard, work-calloused hand in his. Then she asked the question "How will God know that I am his?"<br><br>Gently he raised her wrist and answered, "Show him your hands."<br><br>Someday we may see that pair of hands that sacrificed so much for us. Are our hands clean, and do they show the signs of being in his service? Are our hearts pure and filled with his thoughts?<br><br>Each week we make a solemn covenant to be like him and take him for our leader, to always remember him in everything and keep all of his commandments. In return he promises to give us his Spirit.<br><br>A few years ago, we knew our Elder Brother and his and our Father in heaven well. We rejoiced at the upcoming opportunity for earthly life that could make it possible for us to have a fullness of joy as they had. We could hardly wait to demonstrate to our Father and our Brother, the Lord, how much we loved them and how we would be obedient to them in spite of the earthly opposition of the evil one. And now we're here--our memories are veiled--and we're showing God and ourselves what we can do. Nothing is going to startle us more when we pass through the veil to the other side than to realize how well we know our Father and how familiar his face is to us. And then, President Young said, we're going to wonder why we were so stupid in the flesh.<br><br>God loves us, he's watching us, he wants us to succeed, and we'll know someday that he has not left one thing undone for the eternal welfare of each of us. If we only knew that there are heavenly hosts pulling for us--friends in heaven, whom we can't remember now, who yearn for our victory. This is our day to show what we can do--what life and sacrifice we can daily, hourly, instantly bring to God. If we give our all, we will get his all from the greatest of all.<br><br>I close with this last true story, as it was given by Bob Richards in his book<i>Life's Higher Goals.</i>It always touches my heart and it may touch yours. Lou Little tells this story about his greatest football team. They were on their way to the conference championship--one last game. He had a boy on his squad who had not quite been able to make the team for four straight years. Just before the game--three days before--Lou was given a telegram to give to this boy that informed him his only living relative had just died. The boy looked at the telegram and said, "Coach, I'll be back for Saturday's game." The morning of the game he came up to his coach and said, "Lou, I want you to put me in this game. I know I haven't made the first team yet, but let me in for this kickoff. I'll prove to you that I'm worthy of it." Well, Lou could see that the boy was emotionally upset, and he made all kinds of excuses, but finally he thought, "Well, he can't do much harm on the kickoff, so I'll put the boy in."<br><br>The roar of the crowd followed the kickoff. The opposing quarterback took the ball on the goal line, moved up, and on the seven-yard line there was a tremendous tackle. The boy had dropped him in his tracks. On the next play Lou left him in. He made the next tackle; he was in on the next tackle; you couldn't move him out of there. He made practically every tackle that day--terrific downfield blocking. He was the reason why Columbia won the championship. Afterwards, all the guys were pounding him on the back. When they were all done, Lou Little went up to the boy and said, "Son, I don't understand it. Today you were an all-American. I've never seen you play like this in four straight years. What happened?"<br><br>And the boy looked up at his coach and said, "Coach, you knew my dad died, didn't you?"<br><br>"Yes, I handed you the telegram."<br><br>He said, "You knew he was blind, didn't you?"<br><br>"Yes, I've seen you walk him around the campus many times."<br><br>He said, "Coach, today is the first football game my dad ever saw me play." It makes a difference, friends, when those unseen eyes are watching.<br><br>Give God your best, and his best will come back to you. May God be with you this season and always, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Ezra Taft Benson was a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when this devotional address was given at Brigham Young University on 10 December 1974.</i></i><br><br><i>©Intellectual Reserve, Inc.
