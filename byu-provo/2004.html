<h1> An Outward Expression of the Inner Self - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I appreciate both what Sister Samuelson has said about your wonderful and positive examples and also the privilege it is to share this pulpit with her today. One of the special blessings of our assignment here at BYU is that we have the opportunity to do much together. I often remind her that she is the one primarily responsible for the high honor that has been given to us to be here with you.<br><br>Just before Christmas I received a letter from a retired teacher and member of the BYU class of 1953. She really believes, as I do, that teachers can make a difference in the attitudes and behaviors of their students. She is also very concerned about her own granddaughters. I resonate with her opinions. Let me share a paragraph of her letter. She said:<br><br><i>After listening to President Hinckley talk about pornography and its evil influence on people and their lives, then reading in the</i> Church News <i>dated November 29, 2003, I have decided to follow through with my impression of the dress standards of the Church. I acknowledge that we try to teach our children to dress modestly. It shocked me to see so many tummies on the campus while I was attending my 50-year reunion in October.</i><br><br>I don't know how many "tummies" she actually saw on campus, but it doesn't take all the fingers on one hand to count "too many." You might not be surprised that this was not the first time such issues have been drawn to my attention. Some adult women I know have mentioned that a few of you look like you are wearing your much younger sister's T-shirts.<br><br>Therefore today I would like to talk about a very important and significant subject. It is a matter I have thought much about for a long time and almost daily since my arrival on campus. Although I have mentioned it in some settings, I have apparently been guilty of giving it insufficient attention--at least in some people's eyes. In this devotional I hope to change that. I do so with the sad recognition that some of the few who might most benefit from what I will say may not be with us. Without wishing to be preachy or confrontational, I would hope that you will not be shy in sharing my message with your friends and associates, should they not be here today.<br><br>Although one of you students, in addition to the grandmother I have quoted, may be especially responsible for today's message, a few others of you have kept the matter at the forefront of my attention. At the outset I must commend and praise the vast majority of you for your appearance and your conduct, your deportment, and your attitudes. I have chosen my topic with some risk because it is possible that those who most need to hear what I will say will be most likely to think that I am speaking to someone else. I would hope that every one of you, even the most consciously exemplary, would ask the selfsame question posed by the Savior's original apostles when He explained that He would be betrayed by one of their number. The question that applied to them and applies to each of us is, "Lord, is it I?"<br><br>The one of you who is most directly responsible for my comments today has a mother who made the following observation to me. After expressing her respect for Brigham Young University and her gratitude that her daughter is able to attend, she said something that penetrated me like a sharp dagger. This faithful mother said she was trying to help her daughter dress more modestly and wear less-tight clothing. Her daughter, one of you, said something to the effect that her professors and even, on one occasion, the president himself had seen her and not said anything critical of her dress and appearance. I plead guilty for apparent past deficiencies and consider my message today to address not only the past but also the present and future. Again, my comments apply to the relatively few, but since everyone in our university family is important, I will ask that we all--students, faculty, staff, and administration--consider what we can do about the serious issues of modesty in dress, speech, deportment, and attitude.<br><br>We all have much about which we should be modest. None of us is perfect, and, as has been observed by a special friend and longtime member of the BYU family, the concrete sidewalks at BYU develop cracks just as they do everywhere else.<br><br>I also want to be clear that these matters should be a concern for you men as well as you women. I might have used for an initial example the discomfort caused for some and also raised with me about haircuts, or the lack thereof, estrangement from razors, and the like.<br><br>I do not sense I have been shy or reluctant to share my views and concerns. Recently I felt strongly motivated to comment on my feelings about the importance of good sportsmanship here at BYU. In spite of my willingness to offer correction when warranted, I do believe that you are all brilliant, devoted, and appropriately wise. Why else would you have chosen to come to BYU or why would you have been admitted?<br><br>I have assumed, and still do, in large part, that you understand the doctrines underlying modesty, personal appearance, and agency and that you will make correct decisions and judgments when you take time to think carefully about the issues before you. My purpose today is to help all of us seriously and personally consider the specific matters of modesty and deportment in dress and appearance as well as the broader issues related to what we represent externally to others as a reflection of our inner selves.<br><br>Part of my reluctance to speak as candidly to you as I will today is that I want you to like me and be comfortable when you see and are with me. I also want to be comfortable when I am with you. I feel a little like Jacob, the brother of Nephi, must have felt when he had to say some difficult things to his people. Jacob loved his people, but in some of them he saw behaviors that troubled him. He said that they had begun to "indulge themselves somewhat in wicked practices" (Jacob 1:15).<br><br>I do not perceive that his concerns were exactly the same as mine. I am sure that they are not, but there are some similarities, including the fact that those most needing correction are usually the slowest to recognize it. I have thought about Jacob and us and have pondered and prayed. Let me share his words and counsel because I believe they fit our circumstances very well, although the specifics happily differ for most of you in some important ways. As I follow Nephi's suggestion to "liken all scriptures" unto ourselves (1 Nephi 19:23), I see striking parallels to Jacob's words. Let's return to them.<br><br><i>Wherefore I, Jacob</i> [or President Samuelson], <i>gave unto them these words as I taught them in the temple</i> [or the Marriott Center], <i>having first obtained mine errand from the Lord.</i><br><br><i>For I, Jacob, and my brother Joseph had been consecrated priests and teachers of this people, by the hand of Nephi</i> [or Gordon B. Hinckley].<br><br><i>And we did magnify our office unto the Lord, taking upon us the responsibility, answering the sins of the people upon our own heads if we did not teach them the word of God with all diligence; wherefore, by laboring with our might their blood might not come upon our garments; otherwise their blood would come upon our garments, and we would not be found spotless at the last day.</i> [Jacob 1:17–19]<br><br>I don't know how those verses strike you, but they hit me between the eyes as one consecrated to be a teacher for you. As timid as I might be to call any of your behaviors or attitudes into question, my reservations pale in the face of my understanding that if I do not try to teach you with all diligence--making my very best efforts--I will bear the burdens of your shortcomings and mistakes. I don't want them! I have enough deficiencies of my own!<br><br>Therefore I will do my best to be as clear as I can concerning that which I draw to your attention. Let me do so by again returning to the words of Jacob. He said:<br><br><i>For behold, as yet, ye have been obedient unto the word of the Lord, which I have given you.</i><br><br><i>. . . I can tell you concerning your thoughts, how that ye are beginning to labor in sin. . . .</i><br><br><i>And also it grieveth me that I must use so much boldness of speech concerning you, before your </i>[brothers and sisters], <i>many of whose feelings are exceedingly tender and chaste and delicate before God. . . .</i><br><br><i>But, notwithstanding the greatness of the task, I must do according to the strict commands of God, and tell you</i> [of your potential wickedness], <i>in the presence of the pure in heart. . . .</i><br><br><i>Wherefore, I must tell you the truth according to the plainness of the word of God.</i> [Jacob 2:4–5, 7, 10–11]<br><br>That is pretty serious stuff, and it is certainly straightforward! I don't read these words of the prophet Jacob to scare you or to criticize you. I do share them because it is necessary to be sure that we have your attention and understanding. Once you are really thinking about these matters with all of their implications, I am absolutely convinced that you will make proper decisions and considerations and will more clearly reflect externally what you are inside.<br><br>External appearances do matter. It is not only the military or athletic teams that wear uniforms or distinguishing apparel. You and I can think of many examples, such as the school uniform our daughter Sara wore while we lived in England, certain kinds of paraphernalia worn by gang members, and even the white shirts common to our missionaries and priesthood leaders. Although the specific messages, both good and bad, are usually intended by clothes worn, makeup applied, hairstyles, jewelry, and the like, it is also true that we may inadvertently send signals by our appearance that we don't intend to send to others.<br><br>Please forgive a personal example. On most days, since serving as a missionary, I have worn neckties. (Now, every day I wear one!) On weekdays, until I was called as a General Authority, I usually wore colored or striped shirts. I was not making any conscious statement, but a few years later I learned that my work colleagues knew when I had a Church meeting after work because of the white shirt I would be wearing. They didn't particularly care; they just knew. I hadn't thought that my shirt color would affect anyone but me, but it did. In a similar vein, before March of last year, no one ever cared about the color of my ties. I have had yellow, blue, green, and red ties, and no one mentioned the pattern or the hue--other than any spilled soup on it. Now a day does not go by that someone does not remark on the color of my tie, and my red ones have been securely retired!<br><br>Perhaps some of you may also not be aware of the unintended messages you give by your apparel. Surely none of you wish to send a negative message about your feelings of modesty, propriety, or the sacredness and beauty of your bodies. All of you wish to be attractive and appropriately fashionable. All of us--the administration, faculty, staff, trustees, parents, Church leaders, and friends--want you to be beautiful or handsome in every way.<br><br>The great challenge we all face as we live in the world but are not part of the world is that standards of modesty, dress, and personal conduct have rapidly changed from a societal perspective but are constant in the eyes of the Lord and His Church. Things that once might have been considered slovenly or totally inappropriate are now celebrated and even modeled by those in the public eye, who often seem to revel in their capacity to shock and "push the envelope" of propriety.<br><br>Some seem to believe that any attention, however personally degrading, is better than being out of the limelight. Some believe they are expressing newfound freedoms, when all they are really doing is expressing ignorance or disdain for things sacred and significant while being trapped with the milling hordes of low-class conformity. Some simply take their fashion advice from the crowd and fail to heed useful counsel from parents, Church leaders, teachers, loyal friends, and even their own mirrors!<br><br>Most in this audience know well the sustaining doctrines of the great plan of happiness, and yet we may fail to make connections between sacred truths and practical applications we should employ as we live our lives. The Apostle Paul understood this potential disconnect in our thinking and actions when he asked this important question: "Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?" He then went on to explain not only what we all should know but what we should use to measure how we see ourselves and how we choose to present ourselves to others: "The temple of God is holy, which temple ye are" (1 Corinthians 3:16–17).<br><br>I hope that what I will soon read to you is very familiar and absolutely consistent with your beliefs and practices. If not, I hope you will seriously consider, in light of my previous straightforward and direct invitation, what it means to you personally, now and in the future, to be at variance with what the Lord's servants have asked of you.<br><br>In the years immediately preceding my appointment here at BYU, I had an assignment in the Priesthood Department of the Church working with the Priesthood Executive Council, which includes members of the Quorum of the Twelve, the Presidency of the Seventy, and the Presiding Bishopric. We worked very closely with the Young Women and Young Men general presidencies in preparing the new version of the booklet <i>For the Strength of Youth: Fulfilling Our Duty to God.</i> You may have seen an excellent summary in a recent edition of the <i>Church News.</i><br><br>After much effort, prayer, and preparation, these materials were submitted to the First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve for their adjustments and finally their approval. I watched our senior leaders review and revise what is said in this publication word by word. I thus have tremendous respect for this wonderful booklet and recommend it to you with full confidence that it represents the current best counsel of our leaders. Let me share two sections with you. The first is the introductory "Message from the First Presidency":<br><br><i>Our beloved young men and women, we have great confidence in you. You are choice spirits who have come forth in this day when the responsibilities and opportunities, as well as the temptations, are the greatest. You are at the beginning of your journey through this mortal life. Your Heavenly Father wants your life to be joyful and to lead you back into His presence. The decisions you make now will determine much of what will follow during your life and throughout eternity.</i><br><br><i>Because the Lord loves you, He has given you commandments and the words of prophets to guide you on your journey. Some of the most important guidelines for your life are found in this pamphlet. We testify that these principles are true.</i><br><br><i>We promise that as you keep these standards and live by the truths in the scriptures, you will be able to do your life's work with greater wisdom and skill and bear trials with greater courage. You will have the help of the Holy Ghost. You will feel good about yourself and will be a positive influence in the lives of others. You will be worthy to go to the temple to receive holy ordinances. These blessings and many more can be yours.</i><br><br><i>We pray for each of you. May you keep your minds and bodies clean from the sins of the world so you can do the great work that lies before you. We pray that you will be worthy to carry on the responsibilities of building the kingdom of God and preparing the world for the Second Coming of the Savior.</i> [<i>For the Strength of Youth: Fulfilling Our Duty to God,</i> 2001, 2–3]<br><br>The next section is the statement on "Dress and Appearance" from this same publication. It begins with the scriptural citation from the Apostle Paul I mentioned earlier: "Know ye not that ye are the temple of God?"<br><br><i>Your body is God's sacred creation. Respect it as a gift from God, and do not defile it in any way. Through your dress and appearance, you can show the Lord that you know how precious your body is. You can show that you are a disciple of Jesus Christ.</i><br><br><i>Prophets of God have always counseled His children to dress modestly. The way you dress is a reflection of what you are on the inside. Your dress and grooming send messages about you to others and influence the way you and others act. When you are well groomed and modestly dressed, you invite the companionship of the Spirit and can exercise a good influence on those around you.</i><br><br><i>Never lower your dress standards for any occasion. Doing so sends the message that you are using your body to get attention and approval and that modesty is important only when it is convenient.</i><br><br><i>Immodest clothing includes short shorts and skirts, tight clothing, shirts that do not cover the stomach, and other revealing attire. Young women should wear clothing that covers the shoulder and avoid clothing that is low-cut in the front or back or revealing in any other manner. Young men should also maintain modesty in their appearance. All should avoid extremes in clothing, appearance, and hairstyle. Always be neat and clean and avoid being sloppy or inappropriately casual in dress, grooming, and manners. Ask yourself, "Would I feel comfortable with my appearance if I were in the Lord's presence?"</i><br><br><i>Someday you will receive your endowment in the temple. Your dress and behavior should help you prepare for that sacred time.</i><br><br><i>Do not disfigure yourself with tattoos or body piercings. If girls or women desire to have their ears pierced, they are encouraged to wear only one pair of modest earrings.</i><br><br><i>Show respect for the Lord and for yourself by dressing appropriately for Church meetings and activities, whether on Sunday or during the week. If you are not sure what is appropriate, ask your parents or leaders for help.</i> [<i>For the Strength of Youth,</i> 14–16]<br><br>Some of you may feel that now you are in Relief Society or the elders quorum, these standards no longer apply. Some of you have been to the temple. Let me state clearly that these standards apply to all of us, whatever our age and station. Much like the Word of Wisdom, where some things are specifically proscribed and others are left to our own judgment and inspiration, we need to consider carefully our dress and appearance. Why have we received the counsel and direction we have received? I think the Word of Wisdom advice from the Doctrine and Covenants applies to the issue of modesty as well.<br><br><i>Given for a principle with promise, adapted to the capacity of the weak and the weakest of all saints, who are or can be called saints.</i><br><br><i>Behold, verily, thus saith the Lord unto you: In consequence of evils and designs which do and will exist in the hearts of conspiring men</i> [and women] <i>in the last days, I have warned you, and forewarn you, by giving unto you this word of wisdom.</i> [D&amp;amp;C 89:3–4]<br><br>Most of you have no problems concerning the Word of Wisdom with respect to tea, coffee, tobacco, and alcohol and recognize the dangers to those who experiment with these prohibited substances as well as anything else that is addictive or mind-altering. What we may not realize is that there are other seductive pressures and temptations that the adversary will employ on those who do not realize that what we put <i>on</i> our bodies may be as equally corrosive and dangerous as what we might ingest <i>into</i> our bodies.<br><br>Some of you are probably thinking by now that your president is old-fashioned and out of touch on many things. I cheerfully plead guilty. I also seriously declare to you that I know what I speak today is true and vital for you to hear but even more important for you to understand and practice. I have absolute faith in you and your integrity and capacities for good. I also have great confidence in the statement of the Prophet Joseph Smith when he was asked how he governed the people. He said, "I teach them correct principles and they govern themselves" (Joseph Smith, quoted by John Taylor in "The Organization of the Church," <i>Millennial Star</i> 13, no. 22 [15 November 1851]: 339; James R. Clark, comp., <i>Messages of the First Presidency,</i> 6 vols. [Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1966–75], 3:54; also see <i>JD</i> 10:57–58). That is what we are attempting to do with you.<br><br>I have reminded you of correct principles. They are true, and they are vital if we are to achieve the success in mortal life that our Heavenly Father hopes and expects for us. I believe that I have discharged a major duty to and for you, in the parlance of Jacob's teachings. I have shifted the responsibility to you with full confidence in your abilities and willingness to be sure that your lives are fully congruent with the principles taught by the Lord's servants. I am hopeful that you will be willing to make your outward appearance and conduct a testimony to everyone around you that you know you are "a child of God, And He has sent [you] here" ("I Am a Child of God," <i>Songbook,</i> 2–3).<br><br>As I have attempted to fulfill my charge in part by shifting it to you, I also remind you of your responsibilities to and for each other. You young women will have a greater influence over the appearance and deportment of young men than will others if you will kindly but directly share your concerns and commendations. Likewise, young men, you will be of the greatest assistance to our young women when you carefully and charitably share your encouragement for modeling modesty in every way.<br><br>When we show that we really know who we are, we benefit not only ourselves but others. The counsel of the Apostle Paul to his young associate Timothy in the same chapter mentioned by Sister Samuelson earlier seems as current and appropriate for our day as it was in theirs: "Take heed unto thyself, and unto the doctrine; continue in them: for in doing this thou shalt both save thyself, and them that hear [or see] thee" (1 Timothy 4:16).<br><br>May we take heed of ourselves in the light of our doctrine and the counsel of our leaders with the confidence that we--and others--will be blessed through our devoted and thoughtful expressions of who we really are and who we wish to be. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Cecil O. Samuelson was the president of Brigham Young University when this devotional address was delivered on 13 January 2004.</i><br><br><i>© Intellectual Reserve, Inc. All rights reserved.</i>

<br>
<br>
My dear brothers and sisters, it is a privilege to be able to speak to you today as we begin a new semester as well as a new year.<br><br>It was almost 10 months ago that I stood at this pulpit expressing to you my feelings of being humble and grateful in anticipation of the new assignment my husband had just received. The months since that March day have passed quickly, and today I would like to take the opportunity to thank all of you publicly for the kindness and welcoming spirit that my husband, family, and I have received from you--the faculty, staff, administration, and, especially, the students of Brigham Young University.<br><br>It has been a great delight to become part of this university family, and, as you can imagine, it has brought many changes into our lives. We have moved to Provo; purchased blue wardrobes; learned that buildings on campus are identified by initials such as HFAC, WSC, MOA, and HBLL; hugged Cosmo; eaten the delicious ice cream from the Creamery--and the list could go on. Most important, however, we have made many new friends and our lives have been enriched by these associations as well as by the spirit that radiates from you, the students, with the successes you have in the academic, spiritual, social, and other worthwhile aspects of your lives.<br><br>You have greatly impressed me in so many different ways; therefore, may I commend you for the wonderful examples you are and can be to those with whom you associate as well as those who view and see you in word and action whether near or from afar. Elder Neal A. Maxwell says it well in this statement: "We can be walking witnesses and standing sermons to which objective onlookers can say a quiet amen" ("The Net Gathers of Every Kind," <i>Ensign,</i> November 1980, 15).<br><br>I truly believe the words of President Gordon B. Hinckley, who so often reiterates that throughout the Church your generation has been chosen by our Heavenly Father to come to earth at this time. You have missions to perform that will bless your lives as well as those of your families, descendants, the Church, and the world. To all of us, you exemplify the scripture found in 1 Timothy 4:12: "Be thou an example of the believers, in word, in conversation, in charity, in spirit, in faith, in purity." The majority of people in the world today cannot or will not understand or comprehend that young people will choose to exemplify conduct that is in keeping with what is admonished by this scripture as well as what is taught by those who lead and love you.<br><br>I have the opportunity often to view you in action as I walk around this campus. I become more and more convinced of your goodness, faith, love, and exemplary lives. You are happy, cheerful, friendly, and usually smiling. I see you studying from not only your textbooks but also the scriptures. I view you serving others, whether it be showing courtesy in your employment or expressing your pure love of Christ in charity. I see you letting your light shine by sharing your talents and skills with others. You spend hours perfecting these and giving others joy by your accomplishments. I see you overcoming disappointments, challenges, and mistakes with renewed enthusiasm and faith in yourselves. I also know of the gratitude you have for the opportunity you have to be at Brigham Young University. You appreciate the service and sacrifices of so many that have enabled you to participate in what is available to all who attend here. You should never forget, however, that, as is stated in Doctrine and Covenants 18:38, "And by their desires and their works you shall know them." Always in the sight of the world around you, you will be judged accordingly.<br><br>The Lord has given us standards to live by and to guide each one of us. President Hinckley has stated:<br><br><i>While standards generally may totter, we of the Church are without excuse if we drift in the same manner. We have standards--sure, tested, and effective. To the extent that we observe them, we shall go forward. To the extent that we neglect them, we shall hinder our own progress and bring embarrassment to the work of the Lord. These standards have come from him. Some of them may appear a little out of date in our society, but this does not detract from their validity nor diminish the virtue of their application. The subtle reasoning of men, no matter how clever, no matter how plausible it may sound, cannot abridge the declared wisdom of God.</i> [Gordon B. Hinckley, <i>CR,</i> April 1970, 21; "Contend Not with Others, But Pursue a Steady Course," <i>Improvement Era,</i> June 1970, 40; also, <i>Be Thou An Example</i> (Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1981), 12]<br><br>You are so blessed to be attending this university and gaining a wonderful education in both the academic and spiritual areas of your lives. Elder Dallin H. Oaks, a member of the Quorum of the Twelve and past president of this university, said at his inauguration:<br><br><i>Our reason for</i> being [meaning BYU] <i>is to be a university. But our reason for</i> being a university <i>is to encourage and prepare young men and women to rise to their full spiritual potential as sons and daughters of God. We seek to prepare them to live and serve</i> in <i>the world, but we encourage them not to be</i> of <i>the world.</i> ["Inaugural Response," 12 November 1971, 18; emphasis in original]<br><br>As each of you strives to achieve success and growth both academically and spiritually during your years here and as you live the teachings of our Heavenly Father, you have the greatest example to follow. Our Savior, Jesus Christ, and His life and teachings are for all of us to emulate. He knows our inner hearts and delights in our joys and righteous endeavors. He suffers with us during our trials, temptations, shortcomings, and failures. He is always there with an open heart and an abundance of love. May each of you know of my testimony of Him and my love and caring for each one of you. I feel it a privilege to be in your midst and thank my Heavenly Father for this blessing in my life at this time. I say this in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Sharon G. Samuelson, wife of Cecil O. Samuelson, gave this devotional address on 13 January 2004.</i><br><br><i>© Brigham Young University. All rights reserved.</i>
<h1>Guiding Lights - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
My beloved brothers and sisters, I am pleased to be with you to speak about two principles that will give you light throughout your journey through life.<br><h2><b>The Great Journey</b></h2><br>Like many others, I have followed with interest the landing of an unmanned craft on the planet Mars.<br><br>What a remarkable feat!<br><br>Since the early 1960s, 35 missions have been launched from Earth to the red planet. Of these, less than one-third have been considered successful (see William Harwood, "Mars Lander Remains Silent," <i>Washington Post,</i> 27 December 2003, A2). Mars, on average, is roughly 50 million miles away. Can you imagine the challenge of launching a rocket from Earth--a planet that is traveling faster than 66,000 miles per hour itself--having it cross millions of miles of space, and then having it arrive at another planet that is hurtling through space at its own speed of 54,000 miles per hour?<br><br>But getting the rover to the planet is only part of the challenge. Landing it safely is another.<br><br>Scientists knew the lander would make its descent through the Martian atmosphere at a rate of 12,000 miles per hour. Even after deploying its parachutes, the rover would be going too fast to land safely. So the scientists designed a cocoon of glorified air bags that would surround the rover, cushioning it during impact.<br><br>The landing worked beautifully and the rover is now exploring the surface of the red planet, collecting a harvest of images and data that will be studied by students and scientists for years to come.<br><br>During my lifetime there have been a number of great voyages that will ever be etched upon the pages of history. When I was a young boy, Charles A. Lindbergh crossed the Atlantic Ocean in his <i>Spirit of Saint Louis.</i> When he took off, many throughout the world held their breath, wondering if he would survive. He became a hero of mine, and I remember how we celebrated when news broke that he had landed in Paris.<br><br>In another great voyage that took place in the summer of 1969, Neil Armstrong stepped away from the Apollo 11 lunar module. With the words "That's one small step for a man, one giant leap for mankind," he set foot upon the moon.<br><br>In the last century mankind has taken many great journeys. We have mapped the human genome, made amazing advances in medicine, and reached into the heavens and pulled back answers to riddles that have puzzled mankind for centuries.<br><br>We are ever on the threshold of new journeys and new discoveries. Can you imagine the excitement of the Wright brothers on the morning of that first flight? or the anticipation of Jonas Salk as he analyzed the data that demonstrated a way to prevent polio?<br><br>Today I look at the youth of our Church and see nearly limitless anticipation. You stand at the very threshold of life!<br><br>Who is to say what your lives will hold? What discoveries will you make? What remarkable events will you witness?<br><br>I have been thinking of late of another man who lived long ago, a man who also stood on the threshold of his own great adventure. This man lived in an ancient time during the confounding of languages at Babel. We know him by the unusual name of "the brother of Jared."<br><br>This righteous man obeyed the command of the Lord and built eight barges for the purpose of crossing a vast ocean. You will remember that the barges were watertight both from below and from above. The boats would not so much sail above the ocean as through it, "as a whale in the midst of the sea" (Ether 2:24).<br><br>But as the boats were sealed to water, so too were they sealed to air and light. The Lord instructed the brother of Jared how to provide air for them, but as for light, He merely asked, "What will ye that I should prepare for you?" (Ether 2:25).<br><br>The brother of Jared thought about the problem and then went to work. He prepared 16 stones--two for each of the vessels--white and clear and transparent as glass, and he carried them up to the top of the mountain and asked the Lord to touch the stones and make them shine.<br><br>The Lord touched the stones, and they produced light!<br><br>Throughout their voyage to the promised land the stones gave "light unto men, women, and children, that they might not cross the great waters in darkness" (Ether 6:3).<br><br>Like the brother of Jared, you stand at the threshold of your own exciting journey; you stand at the shores of the ocean you are about to cross. And perhaps you are wondering, as did he, "How will I ever get across?"<br><br>It's only natural that you feel a bit apprehensive about the voyage you are about to undertake. You probably know that there will be tempests along the way. Furious winds may crack and blow. Mountainous waves may crash against you. Monsters of the sea may try to destroy you. Sometimes it may seem as though you are surrounded in darkness without even a glimmer of light.<br><br>As the brother of Jared placed two stones into each barge to provide light for the journey, may I offer two words of counsel, two beacons of light that will provide direction to you during your journey?<br><h2><b>The Two Great Commandments</b></h2><br>During the time of the Savior's ministry, the lawyers and students of scripture often tried to catch Him in a snare. They asked questions, hoping that He would say something they could use against Him.<br><br>Of course for them this was an exercise in continual disappointment.<br><br>The scriptures tell us that after Jesus had silenced the Sadducees, the Pharisees decided to try their hand with a question they were sure would be impossible for Him to answer: "Master," they asked, "which is the great commandment in the law?" (Matthew 22:36).<br><br>The reason they thought this was such a difficult question was that they themselves had invested an enormous amount of time trying to answer the questions themselves. In fact, they had determined that there were more than 600 commandments--365 of them negative, 248 positive (see James E. Talmage, <i>Jesus the Christ,</i> 3rd ed. [Salt Lake City: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 1916], 564–65).<br><br>That must have been quite a list--no wonder it was so hard to keep all of the rules straight. In fact, the list was so cumbersome that the Pharisees had worked hard to identify which of the 600 commandments were "heavy," or most important, and those that were "light," meaning of lesser importance.<br><br>At any rate, it must have been a topic of considerable debate, and if the question was such a difficult one for the scholars, then certainly it would be impossible for this young man from Galilee.<br><br>Of course in that hope the Pharisees were once again disappointed, for the Messiah turned and answered their question directly:<br><br><i>Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind.</i><br><br><i>This is the first and great commandment.</i><br><br><i>And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.</i><br><br><i>On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.</i> [Matthew 22:37–40]<br><br>In a few short sentences the Savior silenced the Pharisees and provided mankind with two great guiding commandments--commandments that belong at the center of and provide the foundation for all we think, feel, and do: <i>Love the Lord and love your fellowman.</i> These two guiding lights I wish to impress upon your hearts this day. These lights will shine ever in the darkness and provide guidance during the storms of life.<br><br>Why does the Lord command us to love Him? He is all powerful and all knowing. Why, then, is the first commandment to love Him? Is He incomplete if we do not worship Him? Is He any less if we fail to acknowledge Him? Of course not.<br><br>Then why is the first and great commandment to "love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind"?<br><br>The answer to this question has little to do with how our love benefits God and everything to do with how that love benefits us.<br><h2><b>Immortality and Eternal Life</b></h2><br>What is the work and glory of God? "To bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man" (Moses 1:39).<br><br>Bringing to pass immortality is essentially a work of creation. God speaks and worlds are formed. Oceans and atmospheres, plants and animals, and insects of all kinds and of every species spring forth and thrive, fulfilling the measure of their creation. At the culmination of this work, man is placed upon the world to learn, be tested, and gain experience.<br><br>Because of the sacrifice of the Son of God, the hour will come when<br><br><i>all that are in the graves shall hear his voice,</i><br><br><i>And shall come forth; they that have done good, unto the resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of damnation.</i> [John 5:28–29]<br><br>The just as well as the unjust are given a priceless and incomprehensible gift: immortality. Because of Jesus the Christ, we will live forever.<br><br>We are immortal.<br><br>Eternal life, however, is something altogether different.<br><br>Immortality is about quantity.<br><br>Eternal life is about quality.<br><br>To use a metaphor, immortality is how long the dinner lasts. Eternal life is what is on the menu and who is with us at the table.<br><br>Eternal life "is the greatest of all the gifts of God" (D&amp;amp;C 14:7).<br><br>"Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him" (1 Corinthians 2:9).<br><br>I could speak of kingdoms and glory and knowledge beyond comprehension, but the words would do little justice to the reality. I could speak of exquisite joy and of infinite peace, but meager words fall incomplete and empty compared to the glorious truth.<br><br>Can the word <i>waterfall</i> describe Niagara? Can <i>nebula</i> describe the glory of Orion? Can <i>love</i> give a satisfactory description to the tender and profound feelings of a mother for her child?<br><br>Eternal life is the culmination of existence. As spiritual children of God, you and I are heirs to this priceless fortune, benefactors to a glorious future, recipients of grace.<br><br>If immortality is God's work, then eternal life is God's glory. Our Heavenly Father, with love that is scarcely within our power to comprehend, desires each of us to partake of this greatest of all gifts: eternal life.<br><br>However, eternal life does not come automatically. We must learn for ourselves the lessons that bring wisdom. We must fill our minds with truth. We must purge our hearts of evil and fill them with the desire to do good continually. Like our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, we must continue grace for grace until we receive a fulness (see D&amp;amp;C 93:13).<br><br>Heavenly Father in His love for us has revealed the path we must walk in order to reach the ultimate goal of eternal life. You and I understand this path as the commandments. We can look upon these commandments as oppressive rules that limit our enjoyment of life, or we can look upon them as "the way"--the path that leads to a glorious and incomprehensible future.<br><h2><b>The First Light</b></h2><br>When we love our Heavenly Father with all our heart, might, mind, and strength, we follow Him joyfully. When we love our Heavenly Father, we leave behind the grudging "have to" and embrace the enthusiastic "can't wait to" attitude. In thanksgiving we joyfully walk the path of the Lord--the path of discipleship that leads to Him.<br><br>Why must we love the Lord? Because as we do so, we become refined, pure, and holy. When we love the Lord, the benefits of the Atonement can wash away our earthly stain and, though our sins be as scarlet, we can become new creatures filled with new life, new thoughts, and a desire to do good continually.<br><br>When we love the Lord we hunger and thirst for knowledge of Him.<br><br>I commend you for seeking light and knowledge by attending courses taught by the dedicated and inspired instructors who make up our Church Educational System. What a wonderful blessing to study the gospel at the feet of men and women who, as a result of their love for the Lord and for His word, have devoted much of their lives to teaching the sacred truths of the gospel.<br><br>When we love the Lord we cherish the scriptures. We hold the truths therein precious, as gems of great worth. In our day we eagerly wait upon the words of our prophet, President Gordon B. Hinckley. General conference becomes a time of feasting and rejoicing, a time of gratitude for the great blessing we have that in our day God once again speaks to man.<br><br>It is easy to say we love the Lord, but true devotion means more than mouthing syllables. "If ye love me, keep my commandments" (John 14:15), the Savior taught His disciples, and so He urges us today.<br><br>As members of the Church keep the commandments, they will feel the influence and guidance of the Spirit in their lives. Gradually, through a process of spiritual refinement, they will become sanctified and filled with the gift of the Holy Ghost. Their prayers will become effectual, their faith more certain.<br><br>"Draw near unto me and I will draw near unto you," the Lord has spoken in these latter days; "seek me diligently and ye shall find me; ask, and ye shall receive; knock, and it shall be opened unto you" (D&amp;amp;C 88:63).<br><br>The first light, then, that I would urge you to carry with you during your journey through life is <i>love of the Lord.</i><br><h2><b>The Second Light</b></h2><br>The second light I urge you to take with you is <i>love for your fellowman.</i><br><br>Loving our neighbor is not just a good idea--it is the core of what has distinguished the followers of Christ in every age since the beginning of time. "By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples," the Savior taught, "if ye have love one to another" (John 13:35).<br><br>Look at every Zion society from ancient times to present and you find at its center love for others.<br><br>The great Book of Mormon prophet King Benjamin counseled that caring for others is linked to the power of the Atonement. "For the sake of retaining a remission of your sins from day to day, that ye may walk guiltless before God," he taught his people, "I would that ye should impart of your substance to the poor, every man according to that which he hath, such as feeding the hungry, clothing the naked, visiting the sick and administering to their relief, both spiritually and temporally, according to their wants" (Mosiah 4:26).<br><br>The scriptures caution us that even our power of prayer is dependent upon our compassion for others, for "if ye turn away the needy, and the naked, and visit not the sick and afflicted, and impart of your substance, if ye have, to those who stand in need . . . , behold, your prayer is vain, and availeth you nothing" (Alma 34:28).<br><br>Disciples of the Living Christ have always known that as we bear one another's burdens, we fulfill the law of Christ (see Galatians 6:2).<br><br>The irony of this is that, although we may make a difference in the lives of those we help, often the person who benefits most from charitable service is the person who gives. When we sacrifice our time, talents, and resources for the sake of others, we refine our character and thereby become more fit for the kingdom. The Savior said the poor will always be with us (see John 12:8), and it is a good thing, too, because we cannot become exalted without them. We need the poor as much as the poor need us.<br><br>As we open our hearts to those in need--whether they be poor or discouraged or grieving or in distress--and as we give of ourselves to lift their burdens, our problems seem a little smaller. We grow in spirit. We grow in peace. We grow in joy.<br><br>As we lift up the hands that hang down, the light within us grows a little brighter and illuminates the way before us.<br><br>The Prophet Joseph Smith taught that a member of the Church "is to feed the hungry, to clothe the naked, to provide for the widow, to dry up the tear of the orphan, to comfort the afflicted, whether in this church, or in any other, or in no church at all, wherever he finds them" (<i>Times and Seasons</i> 3, no. 10 [15 March 1842]: 732).<br><br>In our day President Gordon B. Hinckley has said, "Where there is stark hunger, regardless of the cause, I will not let political considerations dull my sense of mercy or thwart my responsibility to the sons and daughters of God, wherever they may be or whatever their circumstances" (<i>CR,</i> April 1985, 72; or "The Victory over Death," <i>Ensign,</i> May 1985, 54).<br><br>We manifest our love for others by our kindness. Like the people in Alma's day, we too are desirous to "bear one another's burdens, that they may be light; . . . mourn with those that mourn; . . . and comfort those that stand in need of comfort" (Mosiah 18:8–9).<br><br>We manifest our love for others by standing "as witnesses of God at all times and in all things, and in all places" (Mosiah 18:9). The great missionary work of the Church is a testimony to our love of our fellowman. The gospel of Jesus Christ restored to the earth in these latter days is the great hope for individuals, families, communities, and the world itself. We say to our friends, "Come unto Christ, enter the purifying waters of baptism, receive the Holy Ghost, and your lives will be transformed in the light and life of the Spirit."<br><br>Because of love of our fellowman, we enter holy temples to perform vicarious ordinances for those who have departed from this mortality without the blessings of the everlasting gospel. This act of compassion is selfless. It is an act of love for those who wait upon us, praying continually for our assistance.<br><br>Love is the great commandment. "Love your enemies," the Savior proclaimed, "do good to them which hate you" (Luke 6:27).<br><br>Imagine for a moment how our lives would be transformed if everyone in the world had as a central motivation love and compassion for all of God's children. What do you suppose their families, wards, communities, and nations would be like if everyone's central focus was less on themselves and more on what they could do to serve others?<br><h2><b>"To Build a House in Ecuador"</b></h2><br>The <i>Church News</i> published a story about a small ward in Ecuador that did just that.<br><br>For three decades the Church had thrived in the small town of Otavalo, and many had entered the waters of baptism. Not everyone in the village, however, shared those warm feelings. One man in particular hated the Church and everything about it. "Whenever the members wanted to build a new meetinghouse, this man opposed it. When graffiti appeared on Church property, it was rumored that he had taken part in it."<br><br>One day an earthquake hit the Otavalo area and toppled the man's house.<br><br><i>He appealed for help . . . to the city, then to the churches. But Otavalo is a humble community and few had the resources to do anything. . . .</i><br><br><i>And so it happened that . . . this man who hated the Church did something he thought he would never do--he knocked on the door of Rafael Campo, the high priests group leader. . . .</i><br><br><i>". . . My house fell down and I don't have the money to fix it. I know we haven't seen eye to eye in the past and that I have no right to ask anything of you, but the fact remains, I have no house for my family and I wondered if . . . your church could help?"</i><br><br><i>Brother Campo had joined the Church 30 years earlier. He was one of the first to be baptized in all of Otavalo. He had personally witnessed the man's often vindictive words and actions towards the Church.</i><br><br>[As the man spoke,] <i>numerous thoughts passed through Brother Campo's mind. . . . But, ultimately, the words that struck him with the greatest power were those of the Savior, "but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also." (Matthew 5:39.)</i><br><br><i>"We have been teaching this for 30 years," he told himself. "Perhaps it is time to practice what we have been taught."</i><br><br>Brother Campo explained the situation to the bishop, and during a quorum meeting the next Sunday the bishop said:<br><br><i>"We all know this man. . . . We all know what has happened in the past. But the man does not have a home and he has come to us seeking help."</i><br><br><i>The bishop passed around a list and asked the brethren who desired to help to indicate what they were willing to donate. There were 23 men in the meeting that day. When the list had finished circulating, 23 names appeared on it.</i><br><br><i>One offered to bring 5 pounds of nails. One said he had some framing wood. Another could bring 50 cement blocks. One offered sand, another labor.</i><br><br>The following day the quorum "assembled at 7 a.m. and built a modest but sturdy home for a man who only a few days before had been their greatest enemy." (Taken from Neil Newell, "To Build a House in Ecuador," <i>Church News,</i> 20 January 2001, 11.)<br><h2><b>The Essence of the List</b></h2><br>Brothers and sisters, if only we could develop that same spirit of compassion, our lives, families, wards, and communities would be filled with greater meaning and abundant joy.<br><br>We live in an age of industry. Our lives are filled to capacity with lists of tasks we need to accomplish. If you are like many, you place on the list things such as prayer, reading the scriptures, visiting the sick, and helping those in need.<br><br>These two lights we have spoken of--loving the Lord and loving our neighbor--are not merely things we should include on our lists. They are the very essence of the list. For upon these two commandments "hang all the law and the prophets" (Matthew 22:40).<br><br>How much more meaningful would our lives be if our thoughts, hearts, and actions were guided by these two great lights?<br><br>How much more vibrant and filled with love would our families, quorums, Relief Societies, wards, and stakes be if we kept these two great lights ever at the forefront of our agendas, our discussions, our plans, our lives?<br><h2><b>Where Love Is, There God Is Also</b></h2><br>In 1885 the great Russian writer Leo Tolstoy wrote a story about an old cobbler by the name of Martin who lived in a humble shop in a small village. He did quality work, didn't charge too much, and was reliable and honest.<br><br>Like many of us, Martin had experienced his share of sorrow. He had buried not only his wife but his only son as well. In his grief Martin "prayed again and again that he too might die." Gradually his despair gave way to anger, and Martin, in his bitterness, lost his faith and would have nothing to do with God.<br><br>One day a holy man who had spent eight years in prayer and meditation came by to see him. Martin opened his heart and told the man that he no longer wished to live since he was<br><br><i>"quite without hope in the world."</i><br><br><i>The old man replied: "You have no right to say such things, Martin. We cannot judge God's ways. . . . If God willed that your son should die and you should live, it must be best so. As to your despair--that comes because you wish to live for your own happiness."</i><br><br><i>"What else should one live for?" asked Martin.</i><br><br><i>"For God, Martin," said the old man. "He gives you life, and you must live for Him. When you have learnt to live for Him, you will grieve no more, and all will seem easy to you."</i><br><br><i>Martin was silent awhile, and then asked: "But how is one to live for God?"</i><br><br><i>The old man answered: ". . . Can you read? Then buy the Gospels and read them: there you will see how God would have you live. . . ."</i><br><br><i>These words sank deep into Martin's heart, and that same day he went and bought himself a Testament in large print, and began to read.</i><br><br><i>At first he meant only to read on holidays, but having once begun he found it made his heart so light that he read every day. Sometimes he was so absorbed in his reading that the oil in his lamp burnt out before he could tear himself away from the book. . . . He continued to read every night, and the more he read the more</i> [he felt his love for the Lord growing stronger.] <i>And his heart grew lighter and lighter. . . .</i><br><br><i>From that time Martin's whole life changed.</i><br><br>He drank and gossiped less. When he was tempted to say unkind words, he refrained. "His life became peaceful and joyful."<br><br>One night as he was reading his Bible, he drifted to sleep.<br><br><i>"Martin!" he suddenly heard a voice. . . .</i><br><br><i>He started from his sleep. "Who's there?" he asked. . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . "Martin, Martin! Look out into the street to-morrow, for I shall come."</i><br><br><i>Martin roused himself, rose from his chair and rubbed his eyes, but did not know whether he had heard these words in a dream or awake. . . .</i><br><br>[The next morning as he was working, the cobbler] <i>thought over what had happened the night before. At times it seemed to him like a dream, and at times he thought he had really heard the voice.</i><br><br>Could it be that his beloved Savior would visit him in his humble shop?<br><br>While he worked, he looked out onto the street at everyone who passed by to see if he recognized their face.<br><br>After a while an old soldier with worn and shabby boots came near the window. Martin knew the man. He had no money and stayed with a neighbor who, out of charity, had offered him a room in exchange for help around the house.<br><br>It was cold outside and it had started to snow, and the old soldier was trying to get warm by leaning against Martin's building.<br><br>Martin put some tea on the stove and invited the man into his shop.<br><br>"Don't trouble to wipe your feet," Martin said. "I'll wipe up the floor--it's all in the day's work."<br><br>The old man sat down and emptied his glass. Martin offered him another while continuing to look out the window onto the street.<br><br>"Are you expecting any one?" asked the old soldier.<br><br>"Well, now," Martin said, "I'm ashamed to tell you. It isn't that I really expect any one; but I heard something last night which I can't get out of my mind."<br><br>And he told the old man about the voice he had heard.<br><br>The old soldier listened intently, and, after drinking a third glass of tea, he thanked Martin for giving him "food and comfort both for soul and body" and told him he hoped he wouldn't be disappointed and that his visitor would appear.<br><br>Later in the day Martin noticed a woman whom he had never seen before. She was poorly dressed, wearing only summer clothes that were shabby and worn. On her feet she wore "peasant-made shoes," and she had a baby in her arms.<br><br>Through the window Martin could see the woman was shivering; he could hear "the baby crying, and the woman trying to soothe it."<br><br>Martin went out and insisted she enter his shop. "Sit down . . . near the stove," he told her. "Warm yourself and feed the baby."<br><br>She told him that she had no milk to feed the baby and that she herself hadn't eaten since early morning.<br><br>Martin made some soup and offered the woman some bread. While the woman ate, Martin held the baby. As they talked, Martin learned that she had been working as a cook until her baby was born but that her employer wouldn't keep her on with a newborn child. She had no money for food and had pawned her last shawl for a few coins the day before.<br><br>She explained that a woman in another village had offered her a position and that she was on her way toward that village when Martin invited her in.<br><br>Martin smiled and gave the woman a cloak to wrap her baby in. He then handed her some coins and told her to get her shawl out of pawn.<br><br>After she left, Martin went back to work, always looking outside the window, hoping against hope to see the face of the one he loved with all his heart, his Savior.<br><br>Time passed, and after a while Martin saw an apple vendor stop just in front of his window.<br><br>She was attempting to shift an old sack from one shoulder to the other when "a boy in a tattered cap ran up, snatched an apple out of [her] basket and tried to slip away." But the woman was too quick, and she caught the boy and "held on with both hands, knocked his cap off his head, and seized hold of his hair."<br><br>The woman scolded and the boy screamed.<br><br>Martin rushed out of the door as he heard the woman threatening to take the boy to the police. He separated the boy from the woman and begged the woman to forgive him. Although the woman did not want to let him go, something in Martin's words struck her, and she let go.<br><br>As she did so, the young boy saw his opportunity and tried to run away. But he did not get far. Martin seized him, held him fast, and insisted he ask the woman for forgiveness.<br><br>The boy, realizing he had nowhere to run, cried and pleaded for the woman to forgive him.<br><br>Seeing that the boy was truly penitent, Martin paid the woman for an apple and gave it to the boy, telling him not to steal again.<br><br>By the time Martin returned to his little shop, "he noticed the lamplighter passing on his way to light the street lamps." Evening had come.<br><br>The Savior had not appeared.<br><br>Finally Martin put away his tools and pulled down his beloved Bible from the shelf.<br><br><i>He meant to open</i> [it] <i>at the place he had marked the day before . . . , but the book opened at another place. As Martin opened it, his</i> [experience of the night before]<i> came back to his mind, and no sooner had he thought of it than he seemed to hear footsteps, as though some one were moving behind him. . . . And a voice whispered in his ear: "Martin, Martin, don't you know me?"</i><br><br><i>"Who is it?" muttered Martin.</i><br><br><i>"It is I," said the voice. And out of the dark corner stepped</i> [the old soldier], <i>who smiled and</i> [vanished] <i>like a cloud. . . .</i><br><br><i>"It is I," said the voice again. And out of the darkness stepped the woman with the baby in her arms, and the woman smiled and the baby laughed, and they too vanished.</i><br><br><i>"It is I," said the voice once more. And the old woman and the boy with the apple stepped out and both smiled, and then they too vanished.</i><br><br><i>And Martin's soul grew glad. He . . . put on his spectacles, and began reading the Gospel just where it had opened; and at the top of the page he read:</i><br><br><i>"I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me in."</i><br><br><i>And at the bottom of the page he read:</i><br><br><i>"Inasmuch as ye did it unto one of these my brethren, even these least, ye did it unto me."</i> [Matthew 25:35, 40]<br><br><i>And Martin understood that his dream had come true; and that the Saviour had really come to him that day, and he had welcomed him. </i>[Leo Tolstoy, "Where Love Is, God Is," in <i>Twenty-Three Tales,</i> trans. Louise and Aylmer Maude (London: Oxford University Press, 1906), 131–46]<br><h2><b>Standing at the Threshold</b></h2><br>My dear brothers and sisters, you stand at the threshold of an amazing and wonderful journey. As one who has gone before you, I offer these two words of counsel, two sources of light that will provide light for you throughout your life's journey: Love the Lord with all your heart, might, mind, and strength. Love your neighbor as yourself.<br><br>This is the essence of who we are as disciples of Jesus Christ.<br><br>As a special witness of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, I testify with all my heart that the gospel of Jesus Christ is restored to Earth again. I testify that a young boy retired to a grove of trees and sought the answers to the questions of his heart. God the Father and Jesus Christ appeared to Joseph Smith, and so began the great work of restoration that unveiled the gospel in all its fulness.<br><br>Jesus the Christ lives. He loved us so much that He paid the ultimate price to save us from our sins.<br><br>Jesus the Christ lives today. He is not aloof nor uninterested in our lives. He has told us, "Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me" (Revelation 3:20).<br><br>The heavens are not closed. The Master of ocean, earth, and skies speaks to prophets and apostles today.<br><br>All who approach Him with humility and real intent, seeking to know of Him, surely shall find Him.<br><br>It is my testimony to you today that as we make our lives living monuments that testify of our love for God and for our fellowman, we will be walking in the path that leads to eternal life. That we may do so is my humble prayer in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Joseph B.

<h1>e Poor and Needy - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
My first memory of staring poverty in the face came about 1936, during the great economic depression. About that same time Maynard Dixon painted a poignant picture called <i>Forgotten Man.</i> This is a man with holes in his shoes, downcast eyes, and hands hanging down. He is without work or hope, sitting on the curb. Well-dressed men and women walk by, paying no more attention to him than to the fire hydrant next to him. The faces of the passersby are deliberately not shown--representing, I think, their lack of humanity and compassion. I hope this captures your full attention and introduces my remarks in a memorable way.<br><br>I would have been about five years old when a man dressed in tattered clothing came to our door in Winslow, Arizona, asking: "Could you spare some food or money? I am on the road, cold and hungry." The concern and empathy I felt never left me. During those years poverty was widespread. As I remember, Mother always found something to spare for the poor.<br><br>We had few luxuries and guarded our meager resources closely. We always had a comfortable home, however, and good food on the table. Mother canned fruit, vegetables, and meat. She made all of our bread and many of our shirts. I never remember eating at a restaurant. We did not consider ourselves poor. Nearly everyone around us was in similar circumstances. We enjoyed a good life. In reality, measured by standards through most of the world's history, we were rich. We had clean running water, indoor plumbing, space to live in, and clothing that in most ages would be robes only the rich could afford.<br><br>Today many of us enjoy unprecedented abundance. We see it here and nearly everywhere. We can easily forget that a major percentage of the world's people live in poverty, seriously lacking necessities. What should we do about this gap between those with plenty and those living in poverty? Do we have an individual responsibility to help alleviate poverty? Does the Church, now a worldwide institution, have a responsibility to help? Is caring for the poor merely a good thing to do or an imperative duty? These are the issues I will address.<br><br>One of the phrases we often hear in prayers is "Bless the poor and the needy, the sick and the afflicted, and those who have cause to mourn." I hope we always pray for the poor and needy, but isn't there more to this than dashing off that phrase? And why should I even bring up this subject with university students?<br><br>Although material abundance may come for many of you, those days are probably in the future. Nevertheless, this is a good time to be thinking about these things. I have sensed a great spirit of compassion here. I felt it when I spoke at the hunger banquet on campus 11 months ago. I am aware that some of you struggle daily. The overall impression, however, is one of ampleness. And if we compare our comfortable circumstances with such places as Bangladesh, Haiti, and Bolivia, we know we are blessed. Conditions of poverty are widespread. I sense that in the years ahead you would like to do something about the great gulf separating individuals and communities. I believe you will!<br><br>I hope to touch your hearts, increase your understanding, and engage your interest about this subject. The gulf between the affluent and needy worries me. The scriptures on this issue cut to the core. Both our opportunities and duties arise out of these teachings. How we act in relation to them is of the utmost importance, even tied closely to our individual salvation.<br><br>Let's start with the teachings of Jesus and His Apostles. Poverty was even more evident in those days. The Apostles often ran into it among their Gentile converts. In his second epistle to the Saints at Corinth, Paul urged those with abundance to share with those in poverty around them. He reminded the Saints how gracious the Lord had been to them. They enjoyed every benefit of the gospel. To use Paul's own words, they abounded "in faith, and utterance, and knowledge" (2 Corinthians 8:7). And now, in the spirit of love, Paul urged them to take practical steps to care for the poor.<br><br>To dramatize their duty to the poor, he used the greatest moral act in history as an example they should follow. These were his words: "For ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though he was rich [referring to his high and holy premortal station], yet for your sakes he became poor [meaning that he came down from that high station to earth], that ye through his poverty might be rich" (2 Corinthians 8:9). The Atonement was the crowning act of love. Christ had rescued them from spiritual and physical death.<br><br>By using the words <i>rich </i>and <i>poor</i> to describe Christ's great gift, Paul helped them understand their loving duty to help the poor. In this way, he explained, they could prove their sincerity. Paul continued: "Now at this time your abundance may be a supply for their want, that their abundance also may be a supply for your want: that there may be equality" (2 Corinthians 8:14).<br><br>Simply put, others now need your help. And you may at another time need their help. Helping each other leads to equality. These words triggered another thought. As Paul said, both the abundant giver and the needy recipient had their needs supplied in the process of giving. Those with abundance gave food, clothing, shelter, and money to those in need. On the other hand, those in poverty shared their love, appreciation, humility, and simplicity. This process of sharing with each other promoted greater justice and equality. And the process brought them closer to the spirit of the great plan of reconciliation.<br><br>We can have the same blessings today. Sharing blesses both the giver and the receiver, and both feel good when it happens. The Lord is also pleased. Everyone wins!<br><br>The desire to help others comes, not just as a duty, but also through our love of others. And it extends to those we don't even know. Joseph Smith's grand understanding of love's reach and power is captured in this tremendous statement: "A man filled with the love of God, is not content with blessing his family alone, but ranges through the whole world, anxious to bless the whole human race" (<i>HC</i> 4:227).<br><br>We find an interesting declaration of these principles in the Doctrine and Covenants. The Lord said: "I, the Lord, stretched out the heavens, and built the earth, my very handiwork; and all things therein are mine" (D&amp;amp;C 104:14). Yes, we may enjoy temporary possession of many good things, but we are merely stewards of those things because all things belong to our Lord.<br><br>He then explains that "the earth is full, and there is enough and to spare" (D&amp;amp;C 104:17). The Lord intends to provide for His Saints, but in His own way. The Lord's way is "that the poor shall be exalted [that is, lifted up and their wants supplied], in that the rich are made low [that is, those with abundance share with those in poverty]" (D&amp;amp;C 104:16).<br><br>As the Lord concluded these very clear teachings, He declared something designed to capture our complete attention and underline the critical importance of caring for the poor: "If any man shall take of the abundance which I have made, and impart not his portion, according to the law of my gospel, unto the poor and the needy, he shall, with the wicked, lift up his eyes in hell, being in torment" (D&amp;amp;C 104:18).<br><br>That, indeed, is plain language. The Lord warned and motivated us to take care of His children. And lest we choose to brush this warning off, we find the same warning repeated often in the scriptures. For example, Jesus gave the same teaching and warning in the parable of Lazarus and the rich man. The unnamed rich man in the parable is described as clothed in purple and fine linen. He also enjoyed sumptuous food every day. Lazarus, on the other hand, lay at the rich man's gate, hungry and covered with sores, hoping somehow to pick up crumbs that fell from the rich man's table. On Judgment Day Lazarus "was carried by the angels into Abraham's bosom" (Luke 16:22). When the rich man died, he was consigned to hell, where he burned in torment. The tables had turned. The rich man was now the needy one. What had he done to deserve such a judgment? Obviously it was what he did not do for Lazarus that, at least in part, doomed him.<br><br>Perhaps he rationalized: "This beggar brought his condition on himself. He is lazy. Anyone can work if he wants to." He may have told himself: "I gave at the office. I have helped build the temple with my contributions. I was honest in business."<br><br>When the Lord repeats the same warning in direct statements and powerful parables, we are wise if we pay attention. It is obvious that we must help those needy souls that cross our paths, if we have the ability to do so. My experience is that most Church members with abundance would like to find a way to share with those in poverty but are looking for the best ways to do it. They have discovered that giving in the wrong way often causes more problems than it solves. Our giving can be wasted, even when given with the best of intentions. And handouts often weaken more than they strengthen. Also, so much that we do provides only temporary help and fails to solve problems on a basic level. We want to help in the worst way and often do! Is there anything we can do that will have a lasting effect in helping the poor and needy?<br><br>This is where we turn to the issue of the responsibility owed to the poor and needy by the Church as an institution. I remember when Ethiopia experienced the terrible drought in 1984. Thousands died daily, and there was no end in sight. The Brethren designated a special Sunday to fast and make contributions for the relief of the people of Ethiopia. The Saints in 1984, as did the Saints in Corinth in Paul's time, raised money--millions of dollars--to be used to alleviate suffering. Part of the money was used to develop an irrigation system to store and distribute water in times of good rainfall. This was more than just a Band-Aid approach to alleviating poverty. The possibilities for basic long-range benefits made that help particularly valuable. The Brethren assigned me to investigate the value of the project by traveling to Ethiopia when the irrigation project was well along. I was thrilled then with our involvement. Individuals could not easily provide such help. The Church as an institution needed to organize and promote the effort.<br><br>Let me share some keys that help me understand this subject.<br><h2><b>The First Key</b></h2><br>The first key to understanding our duty in relation to abundance and poverty is that we should not set our hearts on riches. Why? Because "where your treasure is, there will your heart be also" (Matthew 6:21). Remember the rich man who came to Jesus in the night seeking to know what he must do to enjoy eternal life? He had lived a good life, but that was not enough to ensure that he would reach his goal. Probably sensing his pride and selfishness, Jesus told him: "Sell that thou hast, and give to the poor" (Matthew 19:21). Jesus perceived that the rich man had his heart set on the wrong things. If he really wanted eternal life, he had to repent of his pride and love of riches. Likewise, we can be in danger if our major focus is on amassing more and more wealth.<br><br>Jacob summarized this first key in these words:<br><br><i>Before ye seek for riches, seek ye for the kingdom of God.</i><br><br><i>And after ye have obtained a hope in Christ ye shall obtain riches, if ye seek them; and ye will seek them for the intent to do good--to clothe the naked, and to feed the hungry, and to liberate the captive, and administer relief to the sick and the afflicted.</i> [Jacob 2:18–19]<br><br>Follow Jacob's counsel and you will be on the right path. Keep your priorities straight. Doing so will not deprive you of financial success--if that is important to you--but your heart will be anchored on the rock of Christ.<br><h2><b>The Second Key</b></h2><br>The second key is to keep your eyes open for opportunities to do what you can to alleviate situations of suffering that come your way. We have already sufficiently reminded you of this simple, but vitally important key in such teachings as the parable of Lazarus and the rich man.<br><h2><b>The Third Key</b></h2><br>The third key applies to those fortunate enough to enjoy material abundance. We should voluntarily share some of it with institutions and programs that help those in need. I have mentioned as an example the help the Church gave to alleviate suffering in Ethiopia. Since then a tremendous outpouring of contributions have come to the Church for such causes, enabling the Church to help with needs and crises all over the world. Of course, we should not forget our responsibilities to donate to the fast-offering fund, an enormously vital and successful way for the Church to care for its poor globally.<br><br>Something very profound and exciting happened on March 31, 2001. The Church established the Perpetual Education Fund (PEF) to help bring a whole generation of young adults out of poverty. The PEF is not just another humanitarian project but is uniquely postured to meet deeper and more fundamental needs of young adults mired in poverty. When he introduced the PEF, President Gordon B. Hinckley counseled us succinctly and directly on our duties to help the poor. He said: "I believe the Lord does not wish to see His people condemned to live in poverty. I believe He would have the faithful enjoy the good things of the earth." He invited those with enough and to spare to share with the fund: "It is our solemn obligation, it is our certain responsibility ... to 'succor the weak, lift up the hands which hang down, and strengthen the feeble knees' (D&amp;amp;C 81:5)." He added, giving the manner in which we can best help: "We must help them to become self-reliant and successful" ("The Perpetual Education Fund," <i>Ensign,</i> May 2001, 53).<br><br>Church members seemed to instantly sense that the prophet had acted under the inspiration of God. He had provided Church members with a simple and marvelous way to bring our people out of poverty and want, gain financial stability, and become successful citizens in their own lands. In showing the way, he dodged the give-away approach to helping the poor by establishing a loan program rather than offering grants. He explained his firm expectation that members receiving loans would repay them to help others who would come after them.<br><br>In explaining the purposes of the loans, President Hinckley boldly declared: "Education is the key to opportunity" ("The PEF," 53). We might do many good things, but to educate a generation of young adults in their own countries is the key to real opportunity.<br><br>When he announced the creation of the PEF, President Hinckley cited the former PEF, the Perpetual Emigrating Fund and Company, as a precedent. Historians have written extensively of its beneficial effect, enabling Church members from Europe to join the body of the Church trying to make a go of it in these valleys. When the organization of the Perpetual Education Fund was announced, many Church members experienced a sacred feeling that it was right and inspired. Some had the reaction: "Why didn't we think of this before?"<br><br>Helping young people get education leading to good employment is one of the finest ways conceived thus far to liberate a generation of young adults in less-advantaged areas of the world. So many good things can and will follow from such a program. The Church is interested in perfecting the whole person.<br><br>A recent convert to the Church in Peru faced severe parental disapproval when she was baptized. Later, when she received a PEF loan and started a wonderful educational program, her parents experienced a complete change of heart. Her father said: "Your new Church is not only concerned about the spiritual welfare of its members but also their temporal welfare."<br><h2><b>The Fourth Key</b></h2><br>A fourth key is obvious, but it needs to be said. It is that we don't intend for those with family responsibilities to forget them in following the other three keys. Perhaps all we need to do is remind ourselves of the advice Paul gave Timothy: "If any provide not for his own, and specially for those of his own house, he hath denied the faith, and is worse than an infidel" (1 Timothy 5:8). The Lord wants us to have a reasonable share of the good things of the earth and to become self-sufficient, never forgetting the source of all good things.<br><h2><b>Conclusion</b></h2><br>In summary, I submit that those four keys will guide us in meeting the issues we all face in helping the needy. We want all of you to become the best you are capable of becoming. We hope you will strive to incorporate these four keys in your lives.<br><br>The PEF is already bearing fruit. There are 300 young people from Peru who are benefiting from this initiative. When you look at their faces, you see that they are our brothers and sisters.<br><br>Perhaps one example will illustrate the power of the PEF to lift our young people from conditions of poverty. A young man in South America came home from his mission with a great desire to make his mark in the Church and in his community. He knew he needed an education and, since he lived close to an excellent technical school, desired to enroll there. He visited the school and learned that the cost to attend was far beyond his means. "Perhaps next year the cost will be reduced," he thought. For eight years he visited and asked for the opportunity of attending there, to no avail.<br><br>Then came the announcement of the PEF. He applied for a loan that would enable him to attend the school. He graduated first in his class as an occupational safety engineer. When he graduated, the school was about to build a new campus for 10,000 students. They hired him as their safety engineer at three to four times any income he had previously enjoyed. In turn, he reduced their accidents by 80 percent. His ability to serve in the Church increased. His wife and children now have sufficient for their needs. This is an example that could be replicated hundreds of times.<br><br>May we individually and as a Church family bless the poor and needy. As leaders of the Church, we have shared the keys as we see them. May we now all act well our parts in these matters. Imagine what 30,000 of you, spanning the world, living these principles, can mean to the Church and to the world. I envision this happening under the inspired direction of our leaders and under the inspiration of the Spirit. Perhaps this is the way Enoch and his people eradicated poverty completely from their great city. And in doing these things, we bridge the gulf between those enjoying material abundance and those mired in poverty. Perhaps recalling the words of the opening hymn is a way to sum it up:<br><br><i>Because I have been given much, I too must give;</i><br><br><i>Because of thy great bounty, Lord, each day I live</i><br><br><i>I shall divide my gifts from thee</i><br><br><i>With ev'ry brother that I see</i><br><br><i>Who has the need of help from me.</i><br><br><i>Because I have been blessed by thy great love, dear Lord,</i><br><br><i>I'll share thy love again, according to thy word.</i><br><br><i>I shall give love to those in need;</i><br><br><i>I'll show that love by word and deed:</i><br><br><i>Thus shall my thanks be thanks indeed.</i><br><br>["Because I Have Been Given Much," <i>Hymns,</i> 1985, no. 219, verses 1 and 3]<br><br>Let's return to Maynard Dixon's painting, <i>Forgotten Man.</i> By all means let's continue to pray for the poor and needy, the sick, and those who mourn. But let's all--every one of us--do more than pray. Let's do what we can, according to our circumstances, to lift those arms that hang down. Let's <i>act</i> in a way that will bless the poor and needy. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>John K. Carmack was managing director of the Perpetual Education Fund and a General Authority emeritus of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when this devotional address was given on 3 February 2004.</i><br><br><i>© Intellectual Reserve, Inc.

My dear brothers and sisters, I consider it a great privilege to be with you today. What a wonderful opportunity it is to be with my friend and colleague President Cecil Samuelson and his dear companion, Sharon. It is such a blessing to have Sister Hammond with us. When we were young, just the touch of her hand caused my heart to beat wildly. And, you know, honestly, it still does. Which leads me to this little story:<br><br>An honest seven-year-old admitted calmly to her parents that Billy Brown had kissed her after class.<br><br>"How did that happen?" gasped her mother.<br><br>"It wasn't easy," admitted the young lady, "but three girls helped me catch him."<br><br>Seriously, Bonnie has been my spiritual inspiration since that day long ago when she encouraged me to go on a mission for the Lord. Today I thank her for that and for the many other times that she has prompted me to do my very best for the Savior. I humbly proffer my love to her, before all of you. Would that each of you could find such incredible happiness as we have found together.<br><br>After a day at school in late fall many years ago when I was a 15-year-old boy, my mother and I were returning to our ranch home. Mother taught at the school, and she had waited for me to finish basketball practice. As we drove up the dirt lane that led to the house, to our horror we saw a large plume of smoke curling up from the roof--the house was on fire! We jumped from the car and ran across the yard toward the house. At that same moment my father, who had been working in the field and had seen the smoke, arrived on the scene. He ran to the front door and kicked it open. Flames that had been trapped inside leaped out. There was no way to enter. The fire had already engulfed the house.<br><br>As a family we stood silently and watched as the flames devoured the stricken building. First the roof fell straight down into the basement, causing a great burst of bright sparks to fly over the yard. Then the walls, one by one, toppled over into the same hole. In 30 minutes it was over. Only a tiny wisp of smoke rose from the ashes of what had been.<br><br>The nearest neighbors came to offer their help. They kindly took us to their home for the night. There were no extra beds, but with plenty of warm blankets and pillows, a place was made on the floor for us to spend the night.<br><br>I lay on the floor unable to sleep. In my mind's eye I saw the flames consuming the house and everything that was inside of it: clothing, beds, furniture, priceless pictures, documents--nothing was saved. It was more than I could bear. The tears slipped from my eyes, and I sobbed aloud out of desperation and despair.<br><br>Nearby lay my mother and father. They could not close their eyes. Far into the night they had whispered about the loss and what they could possibly do to recover. My sobs caused Mother to rise from the floor and make her way to me. She knelt beside me, took me into her arms, kissed me, dried my tears, and reassured me that everything would be all right.<br><br>"But, Mother, we have lost everything," I cried. "We have nothing."<br><br>"There, there, my dear son," she replied as she patted my face. "You do not understand. We still have our family. Not one of us was hurt in the fire. We have our dear friends and, most important, we have the Church and the gospel. Don't you see? We have everything."<br><br>That following Saturday night the tiny community had a party at the town hall. Everyone came from miles around. They brought presents of every kind: clothes, food, blankets, furniture, hundreds of dollars. One sweet family offered a small vacant family cabin, rent free, for the rest of the winter. It was an outpouring of love and generosity like nothing that had been seen before. Why, I had more clothes than I had ever had before in my life. And we survived that winter in spite of the tragedy.<br><br>The years passed, and I had become a man with a family of my own--a beautiful wife and six wonderful children. We had settled in Rexburg, Idaho, where for many years I taught at Ricks College (now BYU--Idaho). We had built a house on the east bench, above the city.<br><br>My parents had moved to a small town nearby--Sugar City, Idaho. They had built a lovely little home and were very comfortable. Then it happened. A dam built on the Teton River burst, and millions of gallons of water poured out of the reservoir, flooding the peaceful communities below. A wall of water 10 feet high rushed through the valley, sweeping away everything before it. Several sawmills were located in the valley, and the water picked up thousands of logs that became battering rams, crashing into buildings and literally causing them to explode with their terrible force. The cattle, horses, sheep, houses, and everything in the path of the raging water were gone. The water pushed a cloud of thick dust in front of it, and many of the animals trying to escape suffocated before the water engulfed them. Nearly every home in Sugar City was destroyed and washed away. Thankfully a warning had been sounded in sufficient time for almost all the people in the valley to get safely to higher ground.<br><br>Sister Hammond and I were out of town attending meetings in Boise, Idaho. When word of the flood came, we drove the five hours back to Rexburg. It was midnight when we arrived. All of the highways were closed. We came in over the dry farms on dirt roads. No lights were to be seen in the valley. Everything was in darkness. Only the moon shone brightly, and its reflection could be seen for miles on the now still waters left standing on the valley floor.<br><br>As we drove into the driveway of our home, five different families rushed outside to greet us. They had come because their houses were completely gone, vanished in the muddy water. My mother had put a few personal items into a small plastic basket and carried them with her as she and my father fled from their home. For the second time in her life everything of material worth was gone. There was no shelter and no food. All of them were weeping. They were so sad and so afraid.<br><br>We spread blankets as beds all over the house. After kneeling together in solemn, tender, humble prayer, everyone found a spot to lie down for the remainder of the night. There was no sleep that night. From the darkness could be heard the pitiful lowing of the surviving cattle. In the early morning hours I heard the muffled sounds of someone weeping. It was my heartbroken mother. I quickly arose from my bed and made my way through the hall into the room where she lay.<br><br>I gathered her little frame into my arms. I kissed her sweet face and whispered my love for her.<br><br>"Oh, Mel," she cried, "what are we to do? Everything that we had is gone. We have nothing!"<br><br>"It is all right, Dear. Don't be afraid." And then I remembered what she had lovingly taught me so many years before. "Mother," I whispered, "don't you remember? Why, we have everything. Our family, our friends, the Church, and the gospel of Jesus Christ. We have everything!"<br><br>And she remembered. We wept together, and tears of sorrow became tears of gratitude.<br><br>"Oh, yes," was her reply, "we still do have everything! Everything that is important."<br><br>And so my message for you today, dear students, is that the things that matter most in our lives are our family, our friends, and the Church and gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ. For the few precious minutes remaining I would like to impress upon you the importance of each of these. Will you consider them with me and place them in the context of your own lives?<br><h2><b>Families</b></h2><br>None of us can overstate the infinite importance of the family. Families did not begin with mortality. Each of you is familiar with the doctrine of celestial parentage. To contemplate the family is to contemplate eternity, for each of us belongs to an eternal family. Like it or not, we are all brothers and sisters, children of "heavenly parents" ("The Family: A Proclamation to the World," <i>Ensign,</i> November 1995, 102).<br><br>Now I challenge you to think of your own family. Perhaps you come from homes that are broken with divorce or homes where there is conflict and strife. Maybe there is a lack of love where wickedness and deceit have left you without hope or joy. If so, then I ask you: What can you do at this point in your life to insure that the future will be one of happiness and joy forever?<br><br>Remember that this week is Valentine's Day, and so if I talk a little about romance and love, you won't mind! For you men, all of this applies only after a faithful mission is completed.<br><br>I hope the desire of each one of you is to find an appropriate companion, go to the holy temple of the Lord to be sealed together for time and eternity, and then become worthy parents of many children. Children have a propensity to bring you great joy and some sorrow, but they will help to fashion you into celestial beings. Then you will become exalted and have a fulness of glory, "which glory shall be a fulness and a continuation of the seeds forever and ever" (D&amp;amp;C 132:19).<br><br>Conversely, if you fail to comply with the commandment of eternal marriage--the forming of an eternal family--then, putting it rather mildly, you are damned and become as those angels who "remain separately and singly, without exaltation, in their saved condition, to all eternity; and from henceforth are not gods, but are angels of God forever and ever" (D&amp;amp;C 132:17).<br><br>With this concept in mind you should be able to understand more clearly the pronouncement of Moroni to Joseph Smith when he quoted, with some significant differences, from the book of Malachi:<br><br><i>Behold, I will reveal unto you the Priesthood, by the hand of Elijah the prophet, before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord.</i><br><br><i>... And he shall plant in the hearts of the children the promises made to the fathers, and the hearts of the children shall turn to their fathers. If it were not so, the whole earth would be utterly wasted at his coming.</i> [JS--H 1:38–39]<br><br>To me <i>wasted</i> means to have been given everything, only to lose it all through neglect, selfishness, or wickedness. You can have exactly the kind of family you would like. For it to be eternal, you must build it on the laws of God. Then you can know exquisite happiness and finally a fulness of joy. I am glad that Elijah did come and that the promises are being kept by the faithful. Eternal families are being formed by sealing power, and thus the cycle of an eternal round continues forever and ever.<br><br>I don't know if this has ever been so impressed upon me as it was several weeks ago when in the temple that graces this lovely valley I sealed a great father and a beautiful mother together for all eternity. Their two handsome sons were brought into the room, one of them preparing for his mission. (He has since been called to serve a Spanish-speaking mission in California). They knelt with their parents, and then, using that same sacred power, I united them together as a family forever. If ever there was a heavenly moment in this mortal sphere, it was then and there.<br><br>Remember, neither the man nor the woman can be in the highest degree of the celestial kingdom alone! In fairness, there will be some who desire all of the blessings of eternal marriage but through no fault of their own will not have the opportunity. To them I would say: Do not despair, be faithful, stay true, have hope, be believing, keep the commandments, and, as sure as the Lord liveth, He will give you all--all the blessings that are associated with a fulness of the priesthood and eternal life. This is the promise!<br><h2><b>Friends</b></h2><br>Someone once said that if in the course of our lives we have but one single friend, we are rich indeed. This surely must be true. I have learned through a great deal of experience that to have friends we must be a friend. Our circle of friends has such bearing on who we are and what we do. Friends can either lift us and build us or bring us down to degradation and destruction. Your closest friends may be your roommates. How you treat them now will dictate how close you will be to them for the rest of your lives. And to some degree it will be a demonstration of how you will treat your own future family.<br><br>Once a dear friend and I sat together in my office. We were still young and looking forward to life. As we visited, the conversation turned to our great desires to keep the commandments of the Lord. We discussed our families and the hope that we could raise them up to be of worth to themselves, to others, and to their God. We determined that if we were really friends we would never do anything or say anything that would drag the other down. We made a commitment to each other that in our association we would always build upward. We would lend strength and, if needed, even direction to make us better men. He is still my dear friend. To this day we maintain our allegiance to each other and our bond of eternal friendship. I wish that every one of you could have such a wonderful friend.<br><br>My dearest friend is the Savior. Next to Him is my eternal companion. Our friendship is measured by such qualities as loyalty, kindness, trust, love, and sacrifice. The Savior taught us a great deal about this when He said to His Apostles, "Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends" (John 15:13). He was willing to submit Himself even to death because of His love for His friends.<br><br>I think that I better understand the meaning of His friendship when I read the scripture where He said to His Apostles, "Ye are they whom my Father hath given me; ye are my friends" (D&amp;amp;C 84:63). Oh, to be known as His friend! Oh, to be trusted by Him! Oh, to feel His love! But we must never forget what He then added: "Ye are my friends, if ye do whatsoever I command you" (John 15:14). The friendship of the Savior is conditional: It is formed by our obedience to the Father, which is a manifestation of our love for Him.<br><h2><b>The Gospel and the Church</b></h2><br>I will try to tie this all together by a continuation of the story with which I began. I grew up and left Montana and went to Ricks College to play basketball. While there, several people became my dearest friends. One was a young man named Keith, who sat in front of me during my first class. He and another young man, Kent, and I spent a great deal of time together. We were high-spirited and, some might say, even a little rowdy. To say the least, we had great fun in and out of class.<br><br>Keith introduced me to his younger sister. Suffice it to say, I fell in love with her. I will be forever grateful to him for that one act that has blessed my life now and forever. In those days full-time missions were not promoted quite as much as they are now. I had decided that I wanted to enlist in the air force and become a pilot. But, succumbing to the influence of my two friends and the imploring of Bonnie, who insisted that she would never marry me without my serving, I accepted a call to the Spanish-American Mission in Texas and New Mexico to labor with the Mexican people. Keith went to the northwest, and Kent went to Argentina.<br><br>Upon our return home, each of us married in the temple and began our families. We went to college and obtained as much education as we possibly could. Eventually, while still young, we migrated back to Rexburg, Idaho. Kent became a prosecuting attorney, and Keith and I taught religion at Ricks College. Almost at the same time the three of us were called to be bishops in the Church. A few years later we were called to be counselors in stake presidencies, and I was subsequently called to preside over a stake. All three of us were called to be mission presidents. Then Keith was called to serve as president of the Portland Temple, and Kent and I were called to be General Authorities.<br><br>Our whole lives were centered in the gospel and in the Church. We had totally committed ourselves to the Savior. Perhaps some of you know them. I have spoken of Elder J. Kent Jolley, formerly a member of the Second Quorum of the Seventy, and President Keith L. Sellers.<br><br>I have told you this in an effort to convince you that it requires the gospel and the Church to bring everything that is important in our lives into one eternal sphere. There is nothing else in this life of eternal worth--just family, friends, and the gospel and the Church of Jesus Christ. As you move forward in your lives, I suggest that your focus ought to be on nothing else. Even in our brief discussion, if you have been attentive, you have seen that really we cannot separate nor divide these three elements--they are all combined into one great concept: our eternal relationship with our Heavenly Father and His Only Begotten Son, the Savior Jesus Christ. I am so grateful to Him, and I express my deepest love to Him.<br><br>I pray that you will have families that are bound to you forever, that you will have eternal friends that will help you to become better, and that through the gospel and the Church you will eventually be made perfect in Jesus Christ. Then you will be able to say and to understand that "we have everything." In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>F.

Learning a new language as an adult can be a very difficult and frustrating process. Languages have a huge, seemingly endless supply of new words, idiomatic expressions, and unpredictable grammatical constructions, and they come from unfamiliar systems of politeness and culture. Students, even very advanced ones, often feel overwhelmed by the sheer volume of material left to learn.<br><br>To be perfectly honest, teaching a foreign language to adult learners is just about as frustrating as learning one is. We are a profession with an almost spectacular level of failure. Large numbers of bright-eyed, excited students enter our classes every semester, eager to "learn Arabic" or some other language, but despite our best efforts something doesn't click with a good percentage of those students, and they end up quitting at some point well shy of reaching their goal.<br><br>I would like to refer specifically to two of the major sources of frustration in learning a new language as an adult. The first is that direct teaching and learning of the <i>facts</i> about the language has limited usefulness in actually learning the language. This realization dawns on students slowly, and at first it can even anger them. When they have put in hours memorizing vocabulary and grammar rules, they really expect there to be an immediate payoff, but it doesn't happen that way. Knowing a language is not just knowing facts <i>about</i> the language (that's a kind of knowing we refer to as "knowing that")--it goes well beyond that to being able to understand and use the language like a native speaker does in real time and in authentic cultural situations (this kind of knowing could be referred to as "knowing how").<br><br>It is much harder to teach for this latter kind of learning. The fact of the matter is, we don't really know how to do it so that it is 100 percent successful, given our spectacular failure rate. It does seem clear, however, that the methods that work the best are a combination of a little direct teaching of the facts and a lot of creating situations that allow students to practice using the language inside and outside of class. These latter methods are relatively indirect, and they don't have an immediate payoff. Students often feel frustrated and feel they are not making progress. The students who eventually do make the break to a kind of fluency, however, are the ones who throw themselves into these activities and simply try to communicate with abandon, working around and through their frustration until a breakthrough finally comes. There is a kind of mystery involved here: moving from a theoretical knowledge to a practical one, figuring out how to develop those habits of tongue, mind, and heart that allow them to function as native speakers do. It is not a direct process.<br><br>Three of my children have served foreign language missions, and in each case the first few letters home from the field were full of language frustration. They didn't understand anything, even after studying the language intensively in the MTC. One of them had studied the language throughout his school years, had done very well on the high school AP test in that language, and was a "star" at the MTC. It came as something of a surprise to both him and us that during the first month in Chile he still understood very little of what people said to him. It turns out that for him to "know Spanish," he needed something more than what he had learned in a very long and intense period of Spanish study. He needed to get beyond knowing Spanish just in his head to knowing it "in his bones." Those first months of a foreign language mission--being dragged by your senior companion to one situation after another where you are forced to try to understand and communicate somehow--usually provide those indirect learning experiences that allow the initial breakthrough to fluency.<br><br>I like to compare it to the process of learning to ride a bike. Our teacher may or may not give us a minimal explanation about the principles of balance, but no amount of explanation is going to do the least bit of good unless we actually get on the bike and simply try it. We will certainly fall off many times before something clicks and we somehow "get it," but if we don't get up and get back on, we will certainly never get it. With language it is the same. If we throw ourselves into the language both inside and outside of class, although no one activity seems to make much of a difference, insight does come, and we make discrete jumps of understanding. If we don't keep getting back on the linguistic bike, however, we certainly will never achieve mastery.<br><br>The second frustration of adult language learning I would like to refer to is the dawning realization that comes to honest learners--even after they are very good at the language--that there is an almost infinite amount left to learn. Even very fluent speakers are constantly made aware of how imperfect their accent is, how many words they still don't know, how awkward their constructions are, and how unnatural their production is. The gulf between even a very proficient speaker and a native speaker seems huge indeed.<br><br>I give myself as an example of this phenomenon. People tell me that I speak Arabic well, and I happen to be an expert on the complicated system of Arabic case markings. Arabs have often told me that I know Arabic better than they do when they notice how good I am at the case markings. But, of course, they are completely wrong, and this becomes embarrassingly apparent as soon as I open my mouth. I do things that I know are wrong. I find myself using incorrect forms in the heat of a conversation, breaking rules that I've known for years. I know the rule as well as I know anything, but somehow I still don't know it well enough. Why do native speakers <i>never</i> make mistakes like the ones I make? What is the difference between their knowledge and mine? Why does theirs seem to be so "deep wired," so much a part of their very beings that nothing can come out of their mouths that isn't in accord with it, whereas my knowledge seems to be more superficial, more imposed, less a part of me? Even when I manage to produce something that is grammatically perfect, why does it take so much intellectual and emotional energy from me to do so, so much active managing and monitoring of my performance, whereas native speakers produce perfect language without really thinking about it at all?<br><br>Now this second source of language frustration is related to one of the major frustrations of being a language teacher at BYU. And here I want you to listen carefully, since it is your problem. One of the clearest results of language teaching research is that when a student becomes satisfied with what he knows, when he feels he "knows the language," he almost immediately ceases to make progress. We call this the "returned-missionary syndrome."<br><br>Missionaries become fluent and proficient in their language in a very limited sphere. Unfortunately, many of them decide somewhere deep within their souls that they know enough that they don't need to know any more. They come home and enter our classes and don't make progress; they already know enough. They are seemingly oblivious to all the things they don't know, both in the overt know-that sense and in the know-how sense--becoming more like a native speaker. It is also frustrating that other professors and administrators often seem to agree with the students that they know enough and that there is nothing else important to learn, making it even more difficult for us to figure out ways to help you make progress in your language. Returned missionaries who manage to keep in mind how little they know and how much they have still to learn end up being the ones who make the most ultimate progress and find the most joy in the journey. Being reminded of the huge gulf between one's own language abilities, no matter how advanced, and those of a native speaker appears to be a prerequisite for further progress.<br><br>I believe there are important lessons we can learn from the process of trying to learn a language and the process of trying to learn the gospel.<br><br>When we gain a testimony we feel certain in ourselves, and we have a desire to declare to the world that we "know the gospel is true." But the question I would like us to consider today is: "Once we know the gospel is true, once we have received that witness of the Spirit, is there anything else to know?" Of course nothing is more important to know than this basic witness. But I am asking, "Once we get that basic witness, is that enough?" Missionaries know that new converts can get this witness quite early in the process of learning about the Church, sometimes during the very first meeting. It appears to be quite possible to know the gospel is true with only a minimal understanding of the gospel, perhaps just a few basic facts. Thus coming to "know the gospel is true" and coming to "know the gospel" are quite different processes.<br><br>Listen to how Brigham Young described the state of our knowledge, remembering that he is describing the people of the Church, who already know the gospel is true:<br><br><i>The people</i> [cannot receive the laws] <i>in their perfect fulness; but they can receive a little here and a little there, a little to-day and a little<br><br>to-morrow, a little more next week, and a little more in advance of that next year, if they make a wise improvement upon every little they receive; if they do not, they are left in the shade. </i>[<i>JD</i> 2:314]<br><br>In another place Brigham Young said:<br><br><i>The fullness of perfection . . . was couched in the character of our Savior; although but a scanty portion of it was made manifest to the people, in consequence of their not being able to receive it. All they were prepared to receive He gave them. All we are prepared to receive the Lord gives us; all that the nations of the earth are prepared to receive He imparts unto them. </i>[<i>JD</i> 12:256]<br><br>I believe that the most important piece of knowledge that we can receive is the testimony that the gospel is true and that Jesus is the Christ. But in light of these quotes from Brigham Young as well as from many scriptures, I believe it is also clear that it would be wrong to stop once we have gained a testimony. The Lord has said He wants us to continue to grow in knowledge and understanding until we come to a perfect understanding, and He has made it clear that coming to that perfect understanding will be a slow process requiring patience, faith, and hard work.<br><br>I call this principle the "Line upon Line Principle," and I believe it has important implications for our understanding of the gospel.<br><br>Listen first to Nephi:<br><br><i>For behold, thus saith the Lord God: I will give unto the children of men line upon line, precept upon precept, here a little and there a little; and blessed are those who hearken unto my precepts, and lend an ear unto my counsel, for they shall learn wisdom; for unto him that receiveth I will give more; and from them that shall say, We have enough, from them shall be taken away even that which they have.</i> [2 Nephi 28:30]<br><br>I would like to summarize the doctrine of "line upon line" in this way: Even after we receive a testimony of the gospel, our understanding of it is incomplete--according to Brigham Young, woefully so. Even after years of Primary and Sunday School classes, scripture reading, and missionary service, our understanding is still not perfect. However, like the returned missionaries in our language classes, many of us have the returned-missionary syndrome. They are fluent and they do know a lot and it is hard for them to imagine that there is something important about the language that they don't know--even though the gulf separating them from what a native speaker of the language knows is deep and almost unbridgeable. Similarly, we feel that we know the gospel quite well, and it can be hard for us to imagine something about the gospel that we don't know. We don't expect there to be another hidden law of tithing waiting for us just around the corner or some as-yet-secret law of sacrifice. We've had at least 30 Sunday School lessons on faith, and we didn't hear anything new in the last 20. What is there left to learn?<br><br>Well, according to the line-upon-line doctrine, we are not yet <i>native</i> speakers of the gospel. Even though we may have developed some gospel fluency, there is a huge gulf between where we are now and where we could and should be. How can this be? I believe there are at least a couple of ways that we can conceive of.<br><br>First, it may not be the case that there are any whole new areas of doctrine out there waiting to be discovered. Rather, it is more likely that we have an understanding of the whole gospel, but it is in schematic form, like an outline that hasn't been entirely filled in yet. We know the basics but may not see all the deeper connections both between specific doctrines and how the gospel is an interconnected whole.<br><br>Second, there may be ways of understanding the gospel that are beyond what might be called knowing-that understanding--ways involving action, commitment, and the heart. These cannot really be explained or grasped intellectually but give a kind of clarity that can only be experienced to be understood--a true "knowing how." We may be able to explain love, sacrifice, selflessness, justice, and mercy but still may have only the most primitive understanding of them, since we have not yet found a way to bring these principles into actual practice in our lives. We know them in a sense--just like I know those Arabic grammar rules--but we don't consistently do them, and our doing of them is "monitored" and "forced"; we are not yet proficient "speakers" of the gospel.<br><br>We won't, in fact, know the gospel fully until it is deep wired, "written in our hearts" (2 Corinthians 3:2–3; see also Jeremiah 31:33), incorporated so deeply into our being that living it is as natural as breathing--so that nothing can come out of us that is not in accord with it. This does not happen quickly, and it happens as an indirect rather than a direct result of study <i>and</i> practice <i>and</i> applying the Atonement in our lives to change our hearts. It is, in fact, that lifetime process of getting a little here and a little there--of falling off the bike and getting back on again until we finally "get it"--that Brigham Young was referring to.<br><br>I would now like to expand on this summary by deriving some principles from the line-upon-line doctrine and investigating how they affect our lives.<br><h2><b>Principle 1: We Don't Know It All Now</b></h2><br>This follows directly from the line-upon-line doctrine. If we are to continue to learn here a little and there a little throughout much of our lives, then we don't know it all now. This principle is more important than it seems. It seems obvious--and therefore not worth stating--but as much as anything else the idea that we do know it all now, or at least the idea that we know <i>enough,</i> keeps us from making progress on the line we're on and progressing to the next line. This is, in fact, a real danger, since when we do achieve a new insight, a new cohesion, we are almost immediately tempted to think: "Wow! I finally have it all figured out. I know it all."<br><br>This reminds us of those language students who believe they have the language down and who then don't make progress beyond that point. The feeling that we have it all figured out is a kind of pride and is a clear roadblock to our progress. It may be true that we have it figured out better than we used to and that the old outline looks pretty skimpy compared to our current understanding, but we need to recognize in the same thought that even our current understanding will look skimpy in a few years as we move on to further lines. It is a lifesaver to keep reminding ourselves: We don't know it all now.<br><br>Listen to Jacob:<br><br><i>O that cunning plan of the evil one! O the vainness, and the frailties, and the foolishness of men! When they are learned they think they are wise, and they hearken not unto the counsel of God, for they set it aside,</i> supposing they know of themselves, <i>wherefore, their wisdom is foolishness and it profiteth them not. And they shall perish.</i><br><br><i>But to be learned is good if they hearken unto the counsels of God.</i> [2 Nephi 9:28–29; emphasis added]<br><br>Being willing to accept that we currently "see through a glass, darkly" (1 Corinthians 13:12), that we don't know it all, can save us from a multitude of griefs. It can literally settle our troubled souls over many noncentral gospel issues that we may find troublesome and that the General Authorities have counseled us to "back-burner."<br><br>Are we worried about the age of the earth or the literalness of Noah's flood? It helps to remember that our current understanding of both the facts and of the relevant scriptures is partial, and that as clear as our current view of the world seems, new facts and new scriptural understandings could come along to shake the very foundations of that view. We just don't know enough to come to a certain conclusion now.<br><br>There are, of course, some partial, hazy answers to issues like these that can help somewhat, but what will help more than anything else is simply a recognition that "I don't know this right now." We can remember what we do know, what witness we have received, and what our current understanding of the gospel is and be grateful for and cling to that. We have no guarantee, however, that at any particular point in the process we are going to be able to fit in every stray piece of information.<br><br>Remembering this first principle, then, can help us keep our bearings as we work on the line we're on. That it is a real temptation to think we have things figured out, and that it is dangerous to do so, is evidenced by King Benjamin's sermon. He said:<br><br><i>Believe in God; believe that he is, and that he created all things, both in heaven and in earth; believe that he has all wisdom, and all power, both in heaven and in earth;</i> believe that man doth not comprehend all the things which the Lord can comprehend. [Mosiah 4:9; emphasis added]<br><br>Can you see that King Benjamin is not just telling us that we don't know everything; he is asking us to <i>believe</i> it, to make it a matter of faith. It is so easy to forget that we <i>must</i> make it an article of faith, something we need to keep reminding ourselves of. Believe that you don't comprehend everything the Lord comprehends. Make that belief a cornerstone of your life, bringing its insights to bear on the problems you encounter. I don't have it all figured out right now. There are some things that still don't fit in, but I have a witness that the Lord understands and knows the answers to those things and that they do fit in, so I can be satisfied with where I am in my progress right now. Although it sounds paradoxical, I would like to suggest that if we can get a witness of this point, a testimony that we <i>don't know</i> (along with our testimonies of the things that we do know), our progress in this line-upon-line test will be much smoother.<br><h2><b>Principle 2: You Get What You Are Ready For</b></h2><br>Most of us appear to have an insatiable curiosity about things. We want to know everything and have trouble figuring out why we have to wait, why we aren't allowed to know the answers now. But both the scriptures and Brigham Young's teachings make it clear that it isn't just the Lord's petulance that keeps Him from telling us right now. He isn't playing games with us, enjoying our pain while we writhe around for a time. He gives us what we are ready to hear--and no more--because He loves us. Getting more than we are ready to accept or understand either does no good at all or actually does harm.<br><br>There will be a constant interplay in our line-upon-line progress between the various kinds of knowledge I have been talking about. Sometimes progress in one area seems to be suspended until we catch up in other areas. For every principle it seems that we need to get a spiritual witness that it is a true principle, we need to get some kind of understanding of it and of how it fits into the rest of the gospel, and we need to deep wire it, incorporate it into our behavior and our inner lives. If we concentrate on only one of these areas--say, just on the intellectual understanding of the principle--we may be confused as to why we don't make more rapid progress in our gospel knowledge. That confusion would clear itself up fairly quickly if we simply asked ourselves how we are doing on the other two kinds of knowledge of this principle (getting a witness and "knowing how" to do it). It may be impossible to make more progress in the one area without catching up in the other two. It may feel disappointing to realize that although we've been working on some of the most basic principles for many years, we still don't really <i>know</i> them yet. But that realization can be a lifesaver if it motivates us to do what it takes to get ready to actually move on to the next line. The next line may not even make sense to us until this one is deep wired.<br><h2><b>Principle 3: What You Know Now May Look Different When You Get to the Next Line</b></h2><br>This, too, is an important and overlooked principle. When we get added knowledge of any of the kinds we are discussing today, it throws new light on what we already knew, recontextualizes it, and helps us understand it differently and see better where and how it fits. The relative importance of things can move around. This does not mean that there was anything untrue in what we knew before, but now we know more precisely, more perfectly. These changes can be disconcerting, so it is wise to expect them as we continue to get a little here and a little there.<br><br>When I first introduce an unusual structure like the <i>cognate accusative</i> to students in an Arabic language class, it seems more of an oddity than anything else. But as students grow in their knowledge of the language and start seeing this structure as it is integrated into real text, they gradually come to understand how it relates to other aspects of the language and how it fills a particular, but important, niche in a coherent system.<br><br>I believe that whenever we experience progress in any area--whether by getting a witness of a principle, coming to a better understanding of it, or better incorporating it into our lives--the other areas are clarified as well. One of the best examples of this involves Alma the Younger. He must have heard his father explain the Atonement many times throughout his life, and he must have had a fairly good intellectual understanding of it as a principle. However, he attached no importance to it whatsoever. It simply didn't mean anything to him more than an intellectual curiosity. However, the angel didn't just knock Alma to the ground, he also demolished the world that Alma had so carefully built up for himself. For the first time in his life Alma saw himself for what he really was, and he was appalled--horrified. When he then thought about those teachings of his father about Christ, they all of a sudden made perfect sense to him. The Atonement as an abstract concept had barely interested him, but when he desperately needed it, it became the most important event in the world for him. I believe that we will experience similar radical realignments as we continue to work on the lines of the gospel.<br><h2><b>Principle 4: The Only Way to Get to the Next Line Is to Take the One We're on Seriously</b></h2><br>To take it seriously means to take a serious look at ourselves and our hearts. King Benjamin calls this "an awful view" (Mosiah 3:25), and it can be awful, because when we take an honest look at our hearts, as did Alma, we often find things we aren't proud of and would just as soon ignore. Just as a good learner can manage to produce a grammatical sentence by sheer force of will and by heavy monitoring and managing of his tongue, we can, through force of will and effort, bring our gospel performance into line so that from the outside we are "in compliance" with all the rules. However, we know in our hearts that this is not enough. The Lord requires overt obedience, but that is only the beginning. The Lord also requires the heart. Throughout the scriptures He makes it perfectly clear that a gift hypocritically given is not counted as a gift. Sitting politely and looking spiritual in church is nice, but it doesn't make up for the cynical thoughts screaming through our heads about the bishop. The Lord doesn't just expect us to do our callings as if we had faith. He wants us to have the faith and act out of that faith. He doesn't just want us to behave toward people as if we loved them. We somehow or other need to actually learn to love them. Getting these principles into our hearts is not easy, and working on them is not necessarily a direct process; but taking the process seriously at a minimum requires us to take an honest look at ourselves, recognize where we are now, and figure out what line we're on. Any such honest look, I can assure you, will immediately convince you why you so desperately need the Savior's help in this process.<br><br>Taking seriously the line we are on implies choosing to accept some things we don't understand yet. Instead of chafing under current rules and policies or current understandings, let's accept them as where we are right now; make something of them, as Brigham Young says; capitalize on them; learn from them; incorporate them; deep wire them; and find a way to get them written in our hearts so we can move on to the next line.<br><br>Taking seriously the line we are on also means getting a lot of practice. Kids who don't keep getting back on the bike never end up learning to ride, and students who don't keep plugging away at learning a language <i>and </i>practicing it never end up mastering it. Students who do end up learning to ride and speak get frustrated because no one thing they do seems to get them closer to their goal at the time, but, as they keep trying, the bike and the language eventually give themselves to them. Something is happening below the surface that ends up making a difference.<br><br>I believe that working on the line we are on in the gospel can be similar. Once we have recognized where we are now and where our hearts need to be, it will be clear where we need to direct our energy in both gospel study and gospel practice. There is a sense in which we simply need to throw ourselves into gospel practice, making sure we are in many situations that call for gospel responses. No one thing we do will create the quantum leap of understanding that we are searching for, but if we don't keep plugging away at it with a lot of consistent study <i>and</i> practice, no leap will ever come. With study and practice, imperceptible changes happen beneath the surface that end up making a difference.<br><h2><b>Principle 5: We Must Do All We Can and Then Ultimately Rely on the Grace of Christ to Get to the Next Line</b></h2><br>Taking seriously the line we are on means recognizing the huge gulf between where we are and where we need to be and realizing that we probably are not going to be able to fill that gulf through sheer force of will. Just as a language learner can diligently study a language for many years and still be so far from being like a native speaker that it is almost pathetic, likewise our own diligent efforts to change our hearts by ourselves will prove useless until we come to rely on the grace of the Savior and His Atonement. It is the Savior who sees and recognizes our efforts to change and who makes it possible for that change to really happen. We do need to do all we can, but we also need to be patient and recognize that the ultimate breakthrough depends on His grace.<br><br>I don't have time to tell the story here of how I learned Arabic on my mission in Lebanon, but I will say that although I studied it for many months, I had been told that it was too difficult for a missionary to learn and I believed that I would never learn it. Then one day we were invited into a home to speak with a family that spoke very little English.<br><br>After the visit my companion said: "I didn't know you could speak Arabic."<br><br>I replied with surprise: "I didn't know either."<br><br>I had experienced that coveted breakthrough to fluency, but I experienced it as an act of grace, a literal gift of God to me for His purposes--something that could not have come just from my study, even though the study may have been necessary for it to come. I have come to believe that in most, if not all, instances of that miracle and mystery of having some piece of knowledge move from the head to the heart--whether in language learning or in the gospel--grace is involved. As we do all we can do, grossly inadequate as it is, the Lord in His time, and when we are ready, can and will make up the difference and actually change us, writing on our hearts the knowledge that we have so carefully stored in our heads.<br><h2><b>Principle 6: It's Quite Possible to Get Stuck on a Line, Stop the Flow of Lines, or Even Forget Lines</b></h2><br>One possible reaction to the line-upon-line doctrine would be to feel that since we're just going to get a little here and a little there anyway, since it is basically random, I won't worry too much about it but just kind of float through life. This is clearly a mistake.<br><br>The scriptures warn us that it is quite possible, even probable, to end up with no lines at all. Listen to Alma:<br><br><i>It is given unto many to know the mysteries of God; nevertheless they are laid under a strict command that they shall not impart only according to the portion of his word which he doth grant unto the children of men, according to the heed and diligence which they give unto him.</i><br><br><i>And therefore, he that will harden his heart, the same receiveth the lesser portion of the word; and he that will not harden his heart, to him is given the greater portion of the word, until it is given unto him to know the mysteries of God until he know them in full.</i><br><br><i>And they that will harden their hearts, to them is given the lesser portion of the word until they know nothing concerning his mysteries; and then they are taken captive by the devil, and led by his will down to destruction. Now this is what is meant by the chains of hell.</i> [Alma 12:9–11]<br><br>This is almost a reverse line-upon-line process. If we get one line completely wrong and become convinced that we have it all figured out, we will on the basis of that incorrect understanding go on to line upon line, on the basis of the first false one, to continue to construct false, even evil, understandings of the way the world is, until our understanding is twisted and dark.<br><br>The Book of Mormon gives a wonderful detailed example of Laman and Lemuel figuring out, "knowing," that Nephi's motives are evil and that the whole point of the game he is playing is to fool them so he can get power over them. This leads them from one bad decision to another until they literally lose contact with God or anything spiritual and become more and more angry, finally becoming murderers. The problem was the first thing that they thought they had figured out, that they thought they knew. It seemed logical, and they were pretty sure of it, but they were wrong. Nephi's motives weren't evil, and he wasn't in it just for the power. But look how sure they were:<br><br><i>We</i> know <i>that he lies unto us; and he tells us these things, and he worketh many things by his cunning arts, that he may deceive our eyes, thinking, perhaps, that he may lead us away into some strange wilderness; and after he has led us away, he has thought to make himself a king and a ruler over us, that he may do with us according to his will and pleasure.</i> [1 Nephi 16:38; emphasis added]<br><br>And later:<br><br><i>We</i> knew <i>that ye could not construct a ship, for we </i>knew <i>that ye were lacking in judgment. . . .</i><br><br><i>And we</i> know <i>that the people who were in the land of Jerusalem were a righteous people.</i> [1 Nephi 17:19, 22; emphasis added]<br><br>Look how many times they used the word <i>know,</i> how sure they were of what they had figured out. Are we ever as wrong about what we know and what we are sure we have figured out as Laman and Lemuel were?<br><br>One bad line may not seem so serious, but it can have eternal consequences if it stops the line-upon-line process. Humility, remembering, and forcing ourselves to remember that <i>we don't know</i> of ourselves may be the only thing that can keep us from falling into the Laman and Lemuel trap of losing lines right and left until we know nothing of the things of God. It is a kind of wonderful paradox that to ever really know, we must accept that we do not know.<br><h2><b>Conclusion</b></h2><br>In conclusion, I'd like to refer to that wonderful chapter in which Nephi mocks those who say they don't need any more Bible: "A Bible! A Bible! We have got a Bible" (2 Nephi 29:3).<br><br>We Mormons find it pretty annoying when others respond to the Book of Mormon with "We already have a Bible. Why would we need another scripture?"<br><br>We ask ourselves: "Why wouldn't they want more of God's word? Why wouldn't they be happy that God has chosen to speak again?"<br><br>Nephi summed up his condemnation with the words "Yea, wo be unto him that saith: We have received, and we need no more!" (2 Nephi 28:27).<br><br>I'm not sure he is just referring to nonmembers and nonbelievers when he said this, however. I wonder if he also isn't referring to me as I sit in Sunday School class with one more lesson on faith wondering what more I could possibly learn about faith. No matter how much progress we have made, no matter what line we're on, <i>we need more.</i> We need a firmer witness, a clearer and deeper understanding, and a more practical, heart-changing incorporation of almost any gospel principle we could contemplate. If we are satisfied with where we are, if we are pretty sure we have the whole thing figured out, we are in effect saying: "We have received, and we need no more." The point of this life is to grow and progress, to become something so unbelievably far from where we are now that it almost seems ridiculous to contemplate. Learning the language of the gospel to the point of real native fluency--just like learning a foreign language as an adult--is difficult and can seem impossible when we contemplate the gulf between where we are and where we want to be. But God has given us a way to do it, and if what Brigham Young says is right, we get to it a little at a time by consistently working at it throughout our lives until the gospel gradually--and through His grace--becomes a part of us, truly "written in our hearts," one line at a time.<br><br>I am profoundly grateful for the lines I have received. I am grateful for the Book of Mormon, the foundation of my own testimony, and for my understanding of the mercy of the Savior. I am particularly grateful today for the line-upon-line doctrine and for my testimony that I don't know it all right now but that the Lord in His mercy will continue to deepen my knowledge of the gospel as I continue to pay attention to His teachings and try to get them written on my heart. I pray that we may all do so in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Dilworth B. Parkinson was a BYU professor in the Department of Asian and Near Eastern Languages.

<h1> Who You Are! - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Thank you to President Keetch, and thank you to that wonderful choir. You are wonderful, and I appreciate it.<br><br>First of all I'd like to clear up that rumor making the rounds in certain singles wards: I did not date Brigham Young. (At least give me the benefit of Heber J. Grant!)<br><br>Some of you may be wondering what I could say that you haven't heard before. Well, I've been wondering the same thing! I can promise you that I won't talk about the saving powers of scrapbooking or tuna casseroles--I don't do either of those very well.<br><br>You see, the reason I've worried so much about this talk is because I know who you are. I see how valiantly you strive to live the gospel. I feel a great love for you. And so I have wanted to say something that would matter in your lives, that would give you hope to not give up, that would lift and inspire you.<br><br>But I wasn't getting any answers. So I finally resigned myself to stand here and sing "'Give,' Said the Little Stream" or other Primary songs. I can guarantee you haven't heard that before!<br><br>To spare you that fate worse than death, I returned to the temple, fasting and praying. And this time I received specific direction. Oh, for a spiritual laser printer.<br><br>President Gordon B. Hinckley recently described you as being "faithful and true" <sup>1</sup> in your desires for righteousness. Heavenly Father sees your goodness; that is why He has inspired me with a message specifically for you.<br><h2><b>Bonnie-isms</b></h2><br>As my four sons were growing up, I had a few sayings that I used repeatedly to help keep them on track--my oldest son calls them "Bonnie-isms." Here are a few examples:<br><br><i>The Holy Ghost goes to bed at midnight.</i><br><br><i>Truth is truth wherever it is found.</i><br><br><i>Fair is where you go to see the pigs.</i><br><br>Among my many Bonnie-isms there were two I used frequently. If I had to remind my sons about an unfinished chore and they responded, "I <i>know!" </i> my standard reply was, <i>" To know is to do!" </i><br><br>And almost every time they ran out our back door for a date, a football game, or a dance, I would call another Bonnie-ism after them: <i>" Remember who you are!" </i><br><br>There is power in these two phrases. Let me explain. When we know something--truly <i>understand</i> it--then we <i>do</i> it.<br><br>For example, once you know it's easier to get a date when you use deodorant, you'll use it, right?<br><br>One of the most important things to know is something Elder Neal A. Maxwell taught: "You have been you for a long time." <sup>2</sup> He's trying to help us remember <i>who we are.</i> Because <i>knowing</i> who you are changes what you <i>do.</i><br><br>Case in point: If you know--and remember--who you are and remember your divine birthright, you will date noble people, wear modest clothing, use clean language, surf worthy Web sites, listen to good music, watch enriching movies, keep the Word of Wisdom, and stay morally clean. You will study your scriptures, forgive each other, say your prayers, repent of your sins, serve others, magnify your callings, and love one another.<br><br>But remembering what you know can be especially tricky during this time of your life. You're pursuing so many worthwhile goals: an education, a job, an eternal companion. (Get out there and find each other, will you please!) Sometimes, in pursuit of worthy goals, we lose sight of what matters most.<br><br>I know you think life has yet to begin, but gaining the knowledge of your eternal identity happens <i>right now--</i>at your very stage of life. Not <i>after</i> you're married or <i>after</i> you've graduated or <i>after</i> you've learned to use deodorant. It comes <i>right now, before</i> all that stuff! "Seek not the things of this world," said Jesus, "but seek ye first to build up the kingdom of God, and to establish his righteousness, and all these things shall be added unto you" (JST, Matthew 6:38).<br><br>Part of seeking the kingdom first is seeking <i>your specific place</i> in the kingdom. That changes everything!<br><h2><b>The Making of a Prophet</b></h2><br>Let me tell you a story. A few years ago a little baby was taken from his poor family to be raised by a wealthy family as their son. Initially he knew nothing of his true identity. He lived like royalty, taking advantage of the poor--including his own family--to increase his adoptive family's wealth. But one fateful day he learned the truth of his origin. Even his religion was different. He was heartsick about having inflicted such pain on those he should have protected and loved. And so he knew he would have to make things right. That man's name was Moses.<br><br>After this mighty change of heart, Moses became a great prophet. He knew the Lord. He witnessed and participated in incredible miracles--escaping from Egypt, parting the Red Sea, and receiving the Ten Commandments. He had innumerable spiritual experiences. Yet he never stopped asking Heavenly Father for <i>further</i> light and knowledge. Thus the more he learned from God, the more he became like God. Isn't that our desire?<br><br>Let's look at chapter 1 of the Pearl of Great Price. Let's figure out firsthand what we must do to learn what Moses knew. As we think about <i>his</i> journey, liken it unto yours (see 1 Nephi 19:23), for what was promised to Moses is promised to you.<br><h2><b>A Mountain of the Lord</b></h2><br>The chapter opens with Moses at the top of a high mountain (see Moses 1:1). Frequently in the scriptures, a mountain represents a holy place away from the world, a place of revelation--like the temple (see Micah 4:1). To learn the things of heaven, Moses removes himself from the world. This is significant!<br><br>I recently asked a group of sisters your same age what single thing kept them from knowing who they truly are. Can you guess their first answer? They said the loud, distracting, powerful pull of the world. Can you relate? Separating ourselves from the world both in distance <i>and</i> in worthiness is an act of great struggle--like Moses scaling that mountain. But what incredible blessings await those who do so.<br><h2><b>A Son of God in Glory</b></h2><br>Verse 2 tells us that here, away from the world, Moses "saw God face to face, and he talked with him, and the glory of God was upon Moses." Can you imagine such an experience! I hope so, because Heavenly Father also wants to talk to <i>you</i> face to face and shine His glory upon you. As of right now, you probably haven't experienced God's <i>full</i> glory. But each time you feel the love of the Lord in your life, you are experiencing a <i>portion</i> of His glory. Never take those experiences for granted--because the glory of God is powerful stuff. It enables Moses to endure God's presence, to judge between good and evil, to receive saving strength.<br><br>Would you like to know what Moses and Heavenly Father talked about in that glory?<br><br>First, Heavenly Father introduces Himself. He speaks tender, comforting words to Moses: "Behold, <i>thou art my son" </i> (Moses 1:4; emphasis added). What a powerful statement. Moses is a child of the living God! Throughout this chapter Heavenly Father continually calls Moses "my son." This revelation should be no less powerful for you--because you, too, are a child of the living God!<br><h2><b>A Work to Do: Look, and He Will Show</b></h2><br>" Wherefore," says Heavenly Father--or, in other words, <i>because</i> you are my son--" look, and I will show thee the workmanship of mine hands" (Moses 1:4). And so it is with you! Because you, too, are His child, look, and He will show you what you need to know.<br><br>And then Heavenly Father reveals, "I have a <i>work for thee,</i> Moses, my son" (Moses 1:6; emphasis added). Wow! He who can do all things had a mission--<i>a purpose--</i>for Moses. Moses was being entrusted to assist God. Do you think at that moment Moses might have felt a little inadequate? (See Exodus 4:10–16.) I certainly would have.<br><br>When President Hinckley extended my current calling as Relief Society general president, I was more than overwhelmed--I was flusterpated! But remembering my divine heritage gave me confidence to accept this assignment. I imagine it was similar for Moses. Maybe that's why President Harold B. Lee once observed, "What a difference it would make if we really sensed our divine relationship to God, our Heavenly Father." <sup>3</sup><br><br>You are a child of God, and He has sent you here. Thus it is essential that you learn why you are here. The Prophet Joseph Smith taught, "Unless [the Saints of God] have an actual knowledge that the course they are pursuing is according to the will of God they will grow weary in their minds, and faint." <sup>4</sup><br><br>What might <i>your</i> work be? You have unique talents and abilities to develop. You need to marry and have a family, you have callings to fulfill, you have brothers and sisters to love and serve. You see, those gifts that make you most unique are those that require your energy. Some assignments can be accomplished by anyone, but others require someone special. Think of Jesus or Joseph Smith or Moses. Think of yourself, for "who knoweth whether thou art come to the kingdom for such a time as this?" (Esther 4:14). Who knoweth? Well, your Father in Heaven knows--that's who.<br><h2><b>Personal Scripture</b></h2><br>How can He tell you the work He has for you? Of course there are many ways, but chief among them is your patriarchal blessing. President Hinckley explains that when you receive your blessing, "A man of God lays his hands upon [your] head and <i>speaking as a prophet</i> bestows a blessing, setting forth the great possibility that you have in this life." <sup>5</sup> Your patriarchal blessing protects you from becoming weary in your mind. It reminds you who you are. It is personal scripture of the work you have to do and what you need to know about yourself.<br><br>Look what Heavenly Father tells Moses about himself: "Moses, my son, . . . <i>thou art in the similitude of mine Only Begotten;</i> and mine Only Begotten is and shall be the Savior" (Moses 1:6; emphasis added). Moses' mission was not to unlock the gate to eternal life, but, in <i>similitude</i> of the Savior, he saved the children of Israel from bondage and led them to the promised land.<br><br>Moses is not alone at being in the similitude of Jesus with a unique work to do. You are right there with him with your unique mission, which includes being a savior on Mount Zion (see Obadiah 1:21).<br><br>Have you received your patriarchal blessing? Do you read it often? Do you pray about it? I hope so, because it's pretty hard to do what you don't know! Right now is the time to discover your mission. And if you'll oppose the world's pull, Heavenly Father will show you.<br><h2><b>Spiritual Eyes Versus Natural Eyes</b></h2><br>Heavenly Father shows Moses this world and worlds without end "and all the children of men which are, and which were created." And of this Moses "greatly marveled and wondered" (Moses 1:8).<br><br>But then, after such awesome enlightenment, "the presence of God [withdraws] from Moses, that his glory [is] not upon Moses." Now listen to this next phrase: "And <i>Moses [is] left unto himself.</i> And as he was left unto himself, he [falls] unto the earth" (Moses 1:9; emphasis added). There is a great truth there: When we are separated from God's glory, we are left to ourselves. And when we are left to ourselves, it is much easier to fall.<br><br>It took "many hours" for Moses to regain his strength. And he sums up his experience thus far with a new perspective, saying, "I know that man is nothing, which thing I never had supposed" (Moses 1:10). Can you relate? Moses sees his place amongst God's creations and is astonished. And yet, of all those creations, God appeared to Moses to show him his mission. I find that astonishing. Nevertheless, I know this is how He operates with each of His children, including <i>you.</i><br><br>Reflecting on it all, Moses does not question what he has seen. In fact, he acknowledges <i>how </i>he saw it: "But now mine own eyes have beheld God; but not my natural, but my spiritual eyes, for my natural eyes could not have beheld; for I should have withered and died in his presence; but his glory was upon me; and I beheld his face" (Moses 1:11).<br><br>As was true for Moses, we cannot come to know our calling with our natural eyes--natural eyes do not require faith! Paul teaches us that the beautiful truths of the kingdom are<br><br><i>revealed . . . unto us by his Spirit. . . .</i><br><br><i>For what man knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of man which is in him? even so</i> the things of God knoweth no man, but the Spirit of God. [1 Corinthians 2:10–11; emphasis added]<br><h2><b>The Test of Faith</b></h2><br>Even after such a life-changing experience, Moses' struggles are not over. In fact, because there is "opposition in all things" (2 Nephi 2:11), his great highs will be matched with deep lows. After all, it's easy to remain true to our faith without the challenges to try that faith; true faith is only made manifest in the face of heart-piercing trials. Moses--like all of us--has to learn and prove just how stalwart he is with his new knowledge.<br><br>As Moses rejoices in what he had witnessed, "Behold, Satan [comes] tempting him, saying: Moses, son of man, worship me" (Moses 1:12).<br><br>Did you notice the very first thing Satan says to Moses? It is the direct opposite of what God had said! Listen to Lucifer again: "Moses, <i>son of man,</i> worship me." Do you see it? Satan goes for the jugular by calling into question Moses' divine birthright and, thus, his very identity. "You're no son of <i>God," </i> Satan says, "you're a mere son of <i>man." </i> For Satan understands that the slide into captivity begins with doubts about who we really are.<br><br>But Moses is a pretty smart guy. He doesn't say, "Okay, you're probably right. Let's go eat, drink, and be merry." Instead, he fires right back: "Who art thou? For behold, <i>I am a son of God" </i> (emphasis added). And then Moses strengthens that declaration by adding, "I am . . . in the similitude of his Only Begotten" (Moses 1:13). Do you see the power that comes from knowing who you are?<br><h2><b>Lucifer's Need for Idolization</b></h2><br>And did you detect one of Satan's fixations? It is two simple words: "Worship me" (Moses 1:12, 19). That obsession hasn't changed.<br><br>Because of their past, Lucifer is insanely jealous of his brother Jehovah. Lucifer craves being idolized. But he mistakes idolization for adoration, reverence, and veneration. Thus, like a spoiled child throwing a tantrum, he screams, "Worship <i>me--</i>not Him."<br><br>But most of us aren't that stupid to just worship Satan outright--are we? We need a little enticement. So Old Scratch is happy to provide it. When tempting Jesus--who was Jehovah in the flesh--Lucifer used the same bait he still uses today: appetites, riches, and power.<sup>6</sup> In short, the things of this world. And Jesus could have all that cash and those fabulous prizes--if He would only worship Satan (see Luke 4:1–13).<br><br>I know that you are a choice group of Heavenly Father's children. But the Lord has very specific counsel for His chosen: "There are many called, but few are chosen. And why are they not chosen? <i>Because their hearts are set so much upon the things of this world, and aspire to the honors of men" </i> (D&amp;amp;C 121:34–35; emphasis added). Lucifer knows this! Why else would he put so much energy into showing us the things of this world?<br><br>You see, "No man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon" (Matthew 6:24).<br><br>Unfortunately, there are legions listening to Lucifer's calls to worship him. Just two months ago President Hinckley said something that stopped my heart. He said, "I do not know that things were worse in the times of Sodom and Gomorrah [than today]. . . . Similar conditions . . . prevail all across the world. I think our Father must weep as He looks down upon His wayward sons and daughters." <sup>7</sup> This is a powerful pronouncement. But I agree.<br><br>Again, you are a choice group of Heavenly Father's children; your attendance at this fireside further demonstrates your desire for righteousness. But, like Moses, this also makes you a larger target for the adversary. Every righteous soul that Satan seduces from the truth becomes a game hunter's trophy, prominently mounted and displayed on the walls of hell.<br><h2><b>How Lucifer Entices Us</b></h2><br>How does Satan entice us to worship him? By indulging our appetites, offering us riches, and promising us power. Of course he needs someone to show us his wares, and he has no end of eager salesmen.<br><br>One of the most powerful persuasives is the visual image. A brother I know calls television "the devil's home teacher." And aside from the Lord, nobody understands the power of images, decibels, and repetition better than Satan. Satan knows the sway of "everybody's doing it." He knows if he dangles his merchandise in front of you long enough, your heart just might get hooked on the things of this world.<br><br>In last October's general conference, Elder M. Russell Ballard said:<br><br><i>The choices we make in media can be symbolic of the choices we make in life. Choosing the trendy, the titillating, the tawdry in the TV programs or movies we watch can cause us to end up, if we're not careful, choosing the same things in the lives we live." </i><sup>8</sup><br><br>And then he encouraged us to follow the counsel in the pamphlet <i>For the Strength of Youth:</i><br><br><i>Do not attend, view, or participate in entertainment that is vulgar, immoral, violent, or pornographic in any way. Do not participate in entertainment that in any way presents immorality or violent behavior as acceptable. . . .</i><br><br><i>Have the courage to walk out of a movie or video party, turn off a computer or television, change a radio station, or put down a magazine if what is being presented does not meet Heavenly Father's standards. Do these things even if others do not.</i><sup>9</sup><br><h2><b>Lucifer's Temples</b></h2><br>What words do you use to describe the temple? I use words like <i>holiness, peace, worthiness, calmness, </i>and <i>light.</i> The Lord Himself says His house is "a house of prayer, a house of fasting, a house of faith, a house of learning, a house of glory, a house of order, a house of God" (D&amp;amp;C 88:119). The increase in temples around the world is another testament to me of the truthfulness of the gospel.<br><br>But as God's temples spread across the world, so, too, do Satan's. The success of his missionary work also requires a place for his converts. After all, how can he be worshiped without a sanctuary? Opposites of the words we just used for God's temples describe Satan's: <i>filthy, wicked, loud,</i> and <i>dark.</i> Consider the ever-lengthening strip of Las Vegas's casinos. In Lucifer's temples--now advertised as "family friendly" --appetites are satisfied in spades; more is not enough; anarchy trumps order. And all the while our spirits are blinded by the lights, deafened by the din, and bludgeoned by the beats.<br><br>One day that power will be shut off; the lights and music will cease. And "they who are filthy shall be filthy still . . . and . . . shall go away into everlasting fire" (2 Nephi 9:16).<br><h2><b>The State of the World</b></h2><br>I don't emphasize these things to scare you. But "we wrestle not against flesh and blood," said Paul, "but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places" (Ephesians 6:12).<br><br>Listen to what President Boyd K. Packer taught just over a month ago:<br><br><i>The world is spiraling downward at an ever-quickening pace. I am sorry to tell you that</i> it will not get better.<br><br><i>It is my purpose to . . . put you on alert.</i> These are days of great spiritual danger for our youth.<br><br><i>I know of nothing in the history of the Church or in the history of the world to compare with our present circumstances.</i><sup>10</sup><br><br>Of course Lucifer's temples are not just casinos. You know where and what they are--they are places where men and women are persuaded "to do evil, and believe not in Christ, and deny him, and serve not God" (Moroni 7:17). They are places where Satan's demand of "Worship me!" is heeded, where loud music and rough language drown out the still small voice, where darkness--not glory--is desired.<br><h2><b>Glory Versus Darkness</b></h2><br>How ironic for Satan, then, that this very contrast between glory and darkness helps Moses recognize Satan. Had Moses not experienced God's glory, the darkness would have been less obvious. But Moses remembers, so he asks Lucifer:<br><br><i>And where is</i> thy <i>glory, that I should worship</i> thee?<br><br><i>For behold, I could not look upon God, except his glory should come upon me. . . . But I can look upon thee in the natural man. . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . Thy glory . . . is darkness unto me[.] And</i> I can judge between thee and God. [Moses 1:13–15; emphasis added]<br><br>What empowering words!<br><br>All of you have experienced some level of God's glory. If not, you would not be here. And all of you have experienced some level of Satan's darkness. In this you are no different from Moses either. So, like Moses, <i>you can judge!</i> You know the pain of your spirit being wounded by sin or the devastation of the Holy Ghost leaving when offended or the despair of losing self-control. But you also know the sweetness of forgiveness, the transcendence of testimony, and the humble gratitude for answered prayers. You have felt the love of the Lord in your life; you have felt His glory. This is why <i>you</i> can judge between glory and darkness, between God and Lucifer!<br><h2><b>Banishing Satan</b></h2><br>Knowing that God is completely honest (see Deuteronomy 32:4), Moses also knows that Satan is deceitful. Thus Moses doesn't invite the father of lies to stay for lunch so as not to offend him. No, Moses cuts right to the chase: "Get thee hence, Satan; deceive me not" (Moses 1:16).<br><br>This is a powerful command--but not too powerful for a son or daughter of God to make! You, too, are a child of God. And you, too, can say, "Get thee hence, Satan." In fact, there will be times you will <i>have</i> to say it.<br><br>Moses is strengthened by knowing his divine birthright and thus declared an unwavering commitment to Heavenly Father. He reminds Satan that<br><br><i>God said unto me: Thou art after the similitude of mine Only Begotten.</i><br><br><i>And he also gave me commandments when he called unto me out of the burning bush, saying: Call upon God in the name of mine Only Begotten, and worship</i> me. [Moses 1:16–17; emphasis added]<br><br>In other words, Moses is going to honor his covenants. He reiterates his commitment, saying:<br><br><i>I will</i> not <i>cease to call upon God, I have other things to inquire of him: for his glory has been upon me, wherefore I can judge between him and thee. Depart hence, Satan.</i> [Moses 1:18; emphasis added]<br><br>You see this pattern again and again. Moses has seen God's glory (or felt the love of the Lord in his life), he remembers it--his judgment is not impaired by Satan's deceptions--and thus he can cast Satan out with confidence. Make this your pattern, too.<br><br>Further, if a man of Moses' stature and testimony is still humble enough to realize that he cannot cease to call upon God, what does that mean for you? Brothers and sisters, at all times and in all places--but especially in the face of great trials and tribulations--<i>you cannot give up praying to Heavenly Father! </i>You must just keep trying, even if the heavens seem sealed and silent.<br><br>President Hinckley said, "We must get on our knees and plead with the Lord for help and strength and direction." <sup>11</sup><br><br>So after Moses commands Satan to leave, "Satan crie[s] with a loud voice, and rant[s] upon the earth, and command[s,] saying: <i>I</i> am the Only Begotten, worship me" (Moses 1:19; emphasis added). That is a lie, plain and simple. Lucifer is forever trying to be someone he's not.<br><h2><b>Faith and Fear</b></h2><br>Lucifer's exit must have exceeded anything Moses had ever witnessed, because "Moses began to fear exceedingly; and as he began to fear, he saw the bitterness of hell" (Moses 1:20).<br><br>Verse 20 is crucial to remember because it shows us that Satan does not give up easily, or go quietly. He might preach instant gratification and self-indulgence, but he knows the power of patience and self-denial. Why else is he called the "cunning one" (2 Nephi 9:39)? Thus, Satan's fury can strike fear into the hearts of men, even men like Moses--and like you. That is a scary thought, because as soon as Moses became afraid, he could see into the very depths of hell. But did you know that fear can overcome faith? All of us have times of fear--remember Peter walking on the water?<br><br>The Prophet Joseph Smith taught a most extraordinary truth:<br><br><i>For doubt and faith do not exist in the same person at the same time; so that persons whose minds are under doubts and fears cannot have unshaken confidence; and where unshaken confidence is not there faith is weak; and where faith is weak the persons will not be able to contend against all the opposition, tribulations, and afflictions which they will have to encounter in order to be heirs of God, and joint heirs with Christ Jesus; and they will grow weary in their minds, and the adversary will have power over them and destroy them.</i><sup>12</sup><br><br>Jesus told Peter: "Behold, Satan hath desired to have you, that he may sift you as wheat: But I have prayed for thee, <i>that thy faith fail not" </i>(Luke 22:31–32; emphasis added). Jesus knew that faith--not fear--will conquer Satan.<br><br>It is fear that overtakes Moses. But his fear does not last long enough to give Satan any advantage. Do you know why? Look at verse 20 again:<br><br><i>Nevertheless,</i> calling upon God, he received strength, <i>and he commanded, saying: Depart from me, Satan, for this one God only will I worship, which is the God of glory. . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . And he departed hence, even from the presence of Moses.</i> [Moses 1:20, 22; emphasis added]<br><h2><b>Binding Satan</b></h2><br>What did Moses, the great prophet, do to escape his fear? He had no secret weapon that you don't have. He prayed. He needed that divine assistance because Satan is persistent. It takes Moses <i>four </i>times to drive Satan out. Four times! (Even my sons usually minded after three times--well, most of the time.) Imagine if Moses had given up after three times.<br><br>In your deepest times of temptation and fear, like Moses, you must <i>plead with Heavenly Father as frequently and as long as necessary</i> to retain your faith. If you do not, Lucifer will lurk nearby until your defenses drop--and then return with enticings to worship him and fears to stop your heart. It is not easy--but nothing of worth is.<br><br>Nearly 30 years ago Elder Eldred G. Smith gave some wonderful counsel about standing up to Lucifer:<br><br><i>The only power I know of that will bind Satan, or render him powerless, is righteous living.</i><br><br><i>. . . Even Jesus Christ had to bind Satan when he was tempted in the wilderness. . . .</i><br><br><i>When you have resisted a temptation until it no longer becomes a temptation, then to that extent, Satan has lost his power over you, and as long as you do not yield to him, to that degree he is bound.</i><sup>13</sup><br><br>With Satan finally gone, "Moses lift[s] up his eyes unto heaven, being filled with the Holy Ghost, which beareth record of the Father and the Son" (Moses 1:24).<br><br>You have been given the gift of the Holy Ghost, who testifies of the truth. You are entitled to His presence and direction according to your faithfulness. Let Him help you!<br><h2><b>The Rewards of Faithfulness</b></h2><br>" And calling upon the name of God, he [Moses] beh[olds] his glory again, for it [is] upon him" (Moses 1:25). Did you notice that Heavenly Father's glory has returned?<br><br>Continuing in verse 25, Heavenly Father begins pouring out blessings upon Moses to reward his loyalty. God's first words are ones of comfort and encouragement: "Blessed art thou, Moses, for I, the Almighty, have <i>chosen </i>thee" (emphasis added). Being chosen by God is no small thing. Do you remember why many are called but few are chosen? Satan had offered Moses the worldly menu, but Moses denied himself "of <i>all</i> ungodliness" (Moroni 10:32; emphasis added). Thus Moses is chosen because his heart is set upon the things of his Father.<br><br>And now, after that crucible of temptation, God knows Moses can be trusted completely, and--just as important--<i>Moses</i> knows he is completely trustworthy. So Heavenly Father is able to further reward Moses with increased knowledge about his mission. Listen:<br><br><i>And thou shalt be made stronger than many waters; for they shall obey thy command as if thou wert God.</i><br><br><i>And lo, I am with thee, even unto the end of thy days; for thou shalt deliver my people from bondage, even Israel my chosen.</i> [Moses 1:25–26]<br><br>What great promises! Can you hear the foreshadowing of "all that my Father hath shall be given unto [you]" (D&amp;amp;C 84:38)?<br><h2><b><i>Whose</i> We Are</b></h2><br>Heavenly Father proceeds to reveal His innumerable creations and answer Moses' questions about those creations. And then Heavenly Father says something that even though I cannot comprehend it, I know to be true: "For behold, there are many worlds. . . . And innumerable are they unto man; but <i>all things are numbered unto me, for they are mine </i>and <i>I know them" </i> (Moses 1:35; emphasis added).<br><br>Can you believe it? Even with all those innumerable creations, God knows Moses. And I testify that He also knows <i>you.</i> How do I know? Because He knows <i>me.</i> Because He has inspired my words for you tonight. We are numbered to Him because <i>we are His.</i><br><br>My counselor and dear friend, Anne C. Pingree, made a wonderful observation that not only are we "blessed to know who we are," we are blessed to know "<i>whose</i> we are." <sup>14</sup><br><h2><b>The Great Reward</b></h2><br>Moses had been taught who he was, he had been given his work, and he had been shown whose he was. And then, because he had proven himself unshakable, he was ready to learn Heavenly Father's work and glory. From this seemingly simple revelation in Moses 1, the gospel and everything we do in it is unified and infused with eternal significance. Here is that stunning revelation in verse 39: "For behold, this is my work and my glory--to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man."<br><br>This sublime statement is the crowning reward for Moses' faithfulness and steadfastness. Its insight extends to us, changing our actions. It is a perfect example of how knowing leads to doing.<br><br>But remember that this pearl of great price came at a great price. It was received only <i>after </i>Moses had removed himself from the things of this world, had experienced divine love and glory, had learned who he was and what his work would be, had made covenants with his Father in Heaven, and had resisted Satan unceasingly with testimony and prayer.<br><br>Some of you may be struggling with knowing who you are. There's a little secret about "to know is to do" : the flip side is also true--" to <i>do</i> is to <i>know!" </i> In other words, if you're unsure, just do anyway. Jesus has promised, "If any man will <i>do</i> [my Father's] will, he shall <i>know</i> of the doctrine, whether it be of God" (John 7:17; emphasis added). Do, and you'll know.<br><h2><b>Remember Who You Are!</b></h2><br>Like Moses, you are a son or daughter of God in the similitude of His Only Begotten Son. Like Moses, you can do every single one of these things! And, therefore, like Moses, you can receive every single one of these incredible blessings.<br><br>Listen to the words Peter taught, referring to promises the Savior had made to others: "For the promise is unto <i>you,</i> and to <i>your children,</i> and to all that are afar off" (Acts 2:39; emphasis added).<br><br>And so this is why I tell my children and my grandchildren and each one of you, "Remember who you are." Or, as the Lord said, "Remember the worth of souls is great" (D&amp;amp;C 18:10).<br><br>This is why I say, "To know is to do." Or, as the Savior said--and I like what was added--" If ye know these things, happy are ye <i>if ye do them" </i> (John 13:17; emphasis added).<br><br>I hope you feel energized and, as my boys say, "pumped up" to overcome the challenges that are uniquely yours for this unique time. You can conquer!<br><br>When you feel down, remember, you don't have to do it alone. Many, like Moses, have gone before you and have successfully overcome hard things. You can too. Many--like President Hinckley, the Apostles, your bishop, your parents, and even I--pray for you daily. You can, and you must, pray too. You are children of God, and He has sent you here! His work and His glory is to bring to pass <i>your</i> immortality and eternal life.<br><br>Recently President Hinckley gave us wonderful encouragement:<br><br>[You] <i>must not give up.</i> [You] <i>must not become discouraged.</i> [You] <i>must never surrender to the forces of evil.</i> [You] <i>can and must maintain the standards for which this Church has stood since it was organized. There is a better way than the way of the world.</i> If it means standing alone, [you] must do it. . . .<br><br>. . . [You] <i>must get on</i> [your] <i>knees and plead with the Lord for help and strength and direction.</i> [You] <i>must then stand on</i> [your] <i>feet and move forward.</i><br><br><i>I am absolutely confident that heaven will smile upon</i> [you]. <i>The Lord will hear and answer</i> [your] <i>prayers if</i> [you] <i>will commit</i> [yourself], <i>giving</i> [your] <i>very best to this work.</i><sup>15</sup><br><br>Moses showed us that this is true.<br><br>Tonight as you run out the door to life's adventures, let me give you two Bonnie-isms for the road. They are filled with all the love in my heart: <i>Remember who you are. To know is to do!</i><br><br>I pray that you, like your brother Moses, will let Heavenly Father lead you, guide you, and walk beside you, because I testify that He will.

<h1>ee to Choose&quot; - Neal A. Maxwell - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Thank you so much, President Samuelson. You're blessed to have this wonderful man as your president. But I miss him at Church headquarters--greatly and personally! It's always easy to praise Sharon because she represents, as does my wife--as do so many others--the faithful women of this dispensation, without whom this work simply could not be done. They are the kind of souls who are high yield and low maintenance.<br><br>I appreciate the special rendering of Merrill Bradshaw's composition, having had the privilege of spending a little time with him just a couple of hours before he died. I appreciate, likewise, Steve Cleveland's prayer. This is a man who cares about what happens on the basketball court, but first he's a disciple. For that I love him the more.<br><br>Unsurprisingly, I have become more keenly conscious of the passage of time. Several evenings ago a 13-year-old granddaughter was on her way, all made up, to be in a school play, and I found myself saying, "Kansas, this isn't Dorothy anymore!" I am unresentful of the passage of time and am still well within the sound range of the kettle drums representing the cacophony of mortality. Yet I sometimes seem to hear, ever so faintly, the distant sounds of beckoning trumpets as these waft in upon me.<br><br>I plead for the Spirit to help me. But you must help, too, because of the format of this presentation, which will feature a conversational style and which assumes you will be active, though inward, responders. I hope the Spirit will arc between us so that there is a rapid and shared understanding (see D&amp;amp;C 50:10). In any case, I hope you feel my love and openness and forgive in advance my falling short.<br><br>The vital revelations about the agency of man--the freedom to choose--inevitably and simultaneously portray the perfect generosity and perfect justice of God. In the key words that soon follow, we see how deeply serious God is about human joy. The Prophet Joseph Smith declared, "If men do not comprehend the character of God, they do not comprehend themselves" (<i>Teachings,</i> 343). In no respect, brothers and sisters, is this more true than with regard to comprehending God's mercy and justice and His commitment to our freedom to choose.<br><br>The doctrine of our freedom to choose is set forth sparsely and is not fully presented in the precious Holy Bible. But we have key phrases that have been given to us in the Restoration scriptures:<br><br>1. "I [have given] unto man his <i>agency" </i>(Moses 7:32; emphasis added; see also D&amp;amp;C 101:78; Moses 4:3; JST, Genesis 3:4).<br><br>2. "Thou mayest <i>choose for thyself" </i> (Moses 3:17; emphasis added).<br><br>The gift sounds reassuring and really good, doesn't it? I am free to choose--just as things ought to be! Certainly you and I can handle it--almost effortlessly!<br><br>3. "That ye may live and move and do <i>according to your own will" </i> (Mosiah 2:21; emphasis added).<br><br>The granting of agency is so complete and personal, isn't it? So breathtaking! Thus there is initial exhilaration. But a disquieting and accompanying realization also emerges:<br><br>Satan "sought to destroy the agency of man," bringing on the war so vigorously fought in the premortal world (Moses 4:3; see also Revelation 12:7).<br><br>But never mind, you and I are still free, though admittedly we're on a path requiring daily decisions as we<br><br>4. "act <i>according to [our] wills</i> and pleasures, <i>whether to do evil or to do good" </i> (Alma 12:31; emphasis added).<br><br>Do my viscera feel a catch coming? Otherwise, why does the divine candor seem so stern? Including in these next words:<br><br>5. "Whosoever doeth iniquity, <i>doeth it unto himself;</i> for behold, ye are free" (Helaman 14:30; emphasis added).<br><br>Evaporated by now is the earlier "no-hands" naïveté about how "I am free to choose." Still, I am free to choose, even if I can <i>neither be immune from the consequences</i> of my wrong choices nor avoid accountability (see Romans 14:12; D&amp;amp;C 101:78).<br><br>At this point you and I may feel a little nudging. Yes, our freedom to choose is truly a shining and shimmering gift, but it is also one that can cause some shivering at times. Is this why we are sometimes almost afraid to decide certain things? Are we afraid we might make a mistake? But "no decision" <i>is </i>a decision! Hence this soul sigh: Choosing is no picnic after all.<br><br>But we are not alone!<br><br>The chilly wind one sometimes feels is more than offset by the warming reality that each of us has within us: the guiding <i>light of Christ.</i> We can actually distinguish between good and evil (see 2 Nephi 2:5; Moroni 7:16, 19). We can repent! Further, <i>the gifts of the Holy Ghost</i> can guide us and reassure us. And those gifts include peace and joy and love--of which there is such a terrible shortage in the world! Such is the precious and pervading sunshine of the Spirit (see Galatians 5:22; James 1:17; Moroni 10:8, 17).<br><br>Mercifully we are therefore not left alone! Nevertheless, we are at risk!<br><br>Back now to the more crisp and revealed words about choosing!<br><br>6. "[You will receive] according to <i>[your] desire" </i>(Alma 29:4; emphasis added).<br><br>7. "[And you will receive] according to <i>[your] wills" </i> (Alma 29:4; emphasis added).<br><br>I'm not sure we grasp how the final judgment will reflect our choices! But my desires and choices really will be honored! How manifestly just of God! How trembling for me! There is the anxiety protruding once again. Are my desires sufficiently educated to choose wisely (see Alma 13:3, 10)? Could the further education of my desires be the most important form of continuing education?<br><br>So it is that the chilly dawn of realization is further felt: Real choosing bristles with alternatives, enticements, defining moments, accountability, counterfeits, and consequences!<br><br>8. Why then do some actually choose to remain <i>" willingly . . .</i> ignorant," such as of impending Messianic events (2 Peter 3:5; emphasis added)? Yes, some seem to say, "My mind is made up, so don't confuse me with cosmic facts. Instead, let me compartmentalize my life and my choices."<br><br>One cannot stay, however, on that naïve plane of understanding very long when he or she reads these next sobering words. They are so ripe with implications. They inform us that some rebels are simply<br><br>9. <i>" not willing</i> to enjoy that which they might have received" (D&amp;amp;C 88:32; emphasis added).<br><br>That cold wind is really blowing at the edges of my mind now. Foregoing enjoyment? But why? Knowingly turning down something vastly better? Why?<br><br>So this is a real war--with real casualties--in which there can be no real pacifists. No wonder, brothers and sisters, there's been such a long shelf life of the wry quip we've all heard about "free agency and how to enforce it." In effect, some seem almost to ask, "Is this gift returnable?"<br><br>10. "For, behold, <i>the devil . . . rebelled against me . . . ;</i> and <i>also a third part of the hosts of heaven</i> turned he away from me <i>because of their agency" </i> (D&amp;amp;C 29:36; emphasis added).<br><br>Lucifer was very angry then, and he is very angry still--choosing to strive to make "all men [to] be miserable like unto himself" (2 Nephi 2:27).<br><br>Wait a minute!<br><br>One-third deliberately chose <i>not</i> to undergo the mortal experience by choosing not to go on choosing? It seems so. It all began such a very long time ago, since<br><br>11. "it must needs be that the devil should tempt the children of men, or they could not be <i>agents unto themselves" </i> (D&amp;amp;C 29:39; emphasis added).<br><br>Thus his very temptations become vexing verifications that we're free to choose.<br><br>12. "Wherefore, the Lord God gave unto <i>man</i> that he <i>should act for himself.</i> Wherefore, man could not act for himself save it should be that he was <i>enticed by the one or the other" </i> (2 Nephi 2:16; emphasis added).<br><br>Hmmm! So it's worse still. The choices are not to be made among passive alternatives but among vibrant, alluring choices! Why can't we just glide through life and cherry-pick what we want? Why must there be "an opposition in all things" (2 Nephi 2:11)? It seems so relentless at times!<br><br>13. "That <i>every man may act in doctrine . . . according to the moral agency which I have given unto him,</i> that <i>every man</i> may be <i>accountable</i> for his own sins in the day of judgment" (D&amp;amp;C 101:78; emphasis added).<br><br>Well, by now any earlier and superficial exhilaration has fully departed. And we see instead unsmiling accountability standing astride every path, every choice.<br><br>Time now to let go of this format with my informal and conversational insertions and to review!<br><br>Again, what are the ground rules?<br><br>Well, the revealed record shows that Lucifer clearly chose to seek his personal preeminence, chose to be angry when he was rejected, chose to lead others astray, and chose misery, not joy. His followers in turn chose to rebel, chose to respond to his false allures, and turned their collective backs on the second estate!<br><br>But there's this ground rule: The Prophet Joseph assured us, "The devil <i>could not </i>compel mankind to do evil; all was voluntary. . . . God <i>would not</i> exert any compulsory means, and the devil could not" (<i>Teachings,</i> 187; emphasis added). Such is our situation.<br><br>Professor C. Terry Warner has written that individuals<br><br><i>cannot avoid being both free and responsible for their choices. Individuals capable of acting for themselves cannot remain on neutral ground, abstaining from both receiving and rejecting light from God.</i> [In Daniel H. Ludlow, ed., <i>Encyclopedia of Mormonism, </i>5 vols. (New York: Macmillan, 1992), s.v. "agency," 1:26; see also 2 Nephi 2:27–29; 10:23]<br><br>If we even just glance at spiritual history, no wonder there is this touching lamentation from long-suffering Jesus, or Jehovah. When speaking of ancient Israel, He said, "How oft would I have gathered you as a hen gathereth her chickens, and ye would not" (3 Nephi 10:5). "How oft" ? The "how-oft question" is one of the most haunting in all of eternity (see also Luke 13:34).<br><br>It is matched by what the Lord of the vineyard can justifiably say at the end of the salvational day. Reading these words often makes me weep. As He surveyed all that He had tried to do--leaving us free--and all the yield that might have been, and having given us our freedom to choose, He, the Lord of the vineyard, tenderly asked: "What could I have done more?" (Jacob 5:47).<br><br>Oh, the special character of God! Oh, His perfect love and patience! Captured eloquently, I think, by President J. Reuben Clark, Jr., who said:<br><br><i>I believe that in his justice and mercy</i> [God] <i>will give us the maximum reward for our acts, give us all that he can give, and in the reverse, I believe that he will impose upon us the minimum penalty which it is possible for him to impose.</i> [<i>CR, </i>October 1953, 84]<br><br>So here we are: comprehending the character of God and comprehending that there could be no joy without agency.<br><br>I wonder what it means--and perhaps you do, too--when I read the related verse about how Lucifer does not understand about "the mind of God" (Moses 4:6). The details have not been revealed to us. But could it possibly involve Lucifer's catastrophic failure to comprehend the inviolate interplay of agency and joy?<br><br>Once more, therefore, the act of choosing is more than nodding assent or passive shoulder shrugging. It reflects real choices made over time that form definite patterns. Even our prayers are much affected by our choices. If we have made good choices, we are much less likely to ask "amiss" (2 Nephi 4:35) in our prayers but instead can ask according to that "which is right" (3 Nephi 18:20). And then the promise is there for us to begin to claim more and more. The choices and prayers can be such that we <i>can</i> ask, and what we ask for can be "done even as [we] asketh" (D&amp;amp;C 46:30).<br><br>Again, there can be no agency avoidance. <i>No</i> decision <i>is</i> a decision. Delay is a delusion, and that delay always discards the holy present. It simply throws it away.<br><br>Again, choosing to be obedient is a choice. Jesus chose to let His will be "swallowed up in the will of the Father" (Mosiah 15:7). It was a deliberate choice--a choice, of course, that blessed all mortals mightily and everlastingly. Being obedient is a way <i>of </i>life, but it is also the way <i>to </i>eternal life.<br><br>With you I have reflected over that spiritually intriguing phrase "compound in one" and about our freedom to choose. It tells us that without being able to choose among alternatives, life would be no life at all. Things would "remain as dead" with no "sense nor insensibility" (2 Nephi 2:11). And we are told God's creation would have served "no purpose" (2 Nephi 2:12). Very strong language! Thus for a few moments today we have been discussing a very strong doctrine indeed!<br><br>Do I mean of God's creation there would be no beautiful Grand Canyon to behold? Who would have the sensibility to appreciate it? No mother's glow over her baby's first smile? Who would have the capacity for such joy? Do I mean there would never be individuals of holiness to admire? Who could have been free to choose holiness or to admire it? Oh, the annihilating "compound in one" !<br><br>I marvel, as many of you know, at the extent of the cosmos--this encompassing vastness and personalness. It is incredible to even contemplate. But it is not as grand as God's gift to us of the freedom to choose. There are literally now, science says, more stars in the universe than there are grains of sand in every beach, every desert, and every ocean floor on this planet (see Allison M. Heinrichs, "The Stellar Census: 70 Sextillion," <i>Los Angeles Times,</i> 26 July 2003, A19; see also Carl Sagan, <i>Cosmos</i> [New York: Random House, 1980], 196). Scriptural words are not just elegant, extravagant language. Besides, souls matter more than stars. And He wants us to have joy. We cannot do that unless we are free to choose. But neither can we have that joy unless we are willing to be spiritually submissive day in, day out, and unless we exercise that grand and glorious freedom to choose in which people truly matter more than stars.<br><br>I testify to you that though the grandness of this doctrine is beyond our comprehension, it is not beyond our attention and exploration. We are, in fact, in the position of having been given revelations that were then far beyond the Prophet Joseph Smith, bright as he was. Yet he was their enunciator and their declarer. We worship a God whose character is so stunning and who wants us to come home. But He will not force us. <i>He will not force us.</i><br><br>God bless you, my young friends, in your daily choices, in the inflections of your decisions, and in the thoughts that traverse your minds. May there be for all of us, including myself, an alignment with Him that brings us home. Home where, as He says, He will give us "all that he hath" (Luke 12:44). There isn't any more--of which I testify in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Neal A.

<h1>fully and Partake of the Gospel Feast - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
You know that I teach nutrition, but I also need to tell you that I like to eat! Today I want to share a few ideas about spiritual nourishment based on some principles of physical nutrition and experiences we have with eating. I have prayed for the Spirit to help us understand how to apply these ideas in our lives.<br><br>The first principle of nutrition is simple and obvious: we need to eat food regularly to supply nutrients to our bodies. We need to do this daily, several times each day. Although our bodies store some nutrients for months or even years, we run out of others after a few weeks or even days. When we become deficient in essential nutrients, body processes gradually deteriorate and our health declines.<br><br>A gospel application of this principle is fairly obvious. We need to participate in gospel activities regularly--daily, even multiple times each day. You know the list: prayer, scripture study, tithing, humility, kindness in our interactions, and so forth. Our spiritual health declines if we are deficient in daily spiritual nourishment. Have we heard it all before? Are they the same messages over and over in the scriptures? Absolutely! But still we do need another lesson on fast offerings, on genealogy, on forgiveness, or [you fill in the blank].<br><br>The next nutrition principle is about hunger. Eating is so important that the body signals when it's time to eat. How do you feel when you go a long time without eating? Maybe it's only as long as from breakfast to lunch or lunch to dinner. I know I get really hungry on fast Sunday, and I look forward to eating again. People who have gone on survival adventures say that they fantasized about food and eagerly anticipated their first regular meal at the end of the adventure.<br><br>How might such feelings of hunger apply to the gospel? How hungry are we to live the gospel? Whenever I hear the phrase "hunger and thirst after righteousness," I recall an experience with BYU students in Mexico some years ago. Students were assigned to wards and branches in several towns. One day I accompanied two students on their visits to a village to teach Relief Society sisters in their homes. The bus dropped us off by the side of the highway, and we headed up the hot, dusty path to the village. We walked uphill for at least an hour, spent several hours in the village, then walked back to the highway to catch the bus.<br><br>We each carried a canteen of water with us, but for some reason I didn't have enough. I don't remember the name of the village or what we taught that day, but I still remember how desperately thirsty I was by the time we got to town. How often do I--do we--hunger and thirst after righteousness? How grateful are we when we have been spiritually fed?<br><br>Worse than just being hungry or thirsty, some of our Father's children are starving. Some are like refugee children who are innocent victims of wars, famine, poverty, or ignorance. They don't have enough food to eat, and what little they get isn't the right kind of food. They are deficient in many nutrients. You can see the outward signs: skinny legs and arms with sagging skin where fat and muscle have disappeared. When malnutrition is this obvious, many different internal processes have already been affected. If emergency relief arrives in time, these children may survive, but their growth and health will be permanently affected.<br><br>Less extreme undernutrition can also have long-lasting consequences. Let me describe two children who were born in a poor, rural Mexican village about 35 years ago. The little girl was born during the first two years of a nutrition project, when researchers simply monitored the growth and health of all the pregnant women and their offspring. The researchers' objective was to understand more clearly the consequences of early poor--or good--nutrition on children's health and growth. The little boy was born during the second two years of the project, when the usual food intake of the pregnant women and their offspring was supplemented with additional nutritious foods.<br><br>Some of the differences between good and poor nutrition are obvious. In a picture of these two children, the girl is almost four years old and the boy is two and a half. Despite their age difference, the children are about the same height. But if the little girl's growth were normal--if she had received adequate nutrition early in life--we would expect her to be about two inches taller than the little boy. He appears to be energetic and confident, and she appears to be timid. He has thick, dark hair, and she has thin, wispy hair. He is at a normal height and weight for his age, whereas she is much too short and thin. Nutritionists call these effects of undernutrition stunting (meaning children don't grow to their normal, expected height) and wasting (when children are too thin). Depending on how severely undernourished children are, they may never be able to make up for the missed nutrition nor reach their growth potential in this life.<br><br>In a picture of the two-and-a-half-year-old boy with his seven-year-old brother the stunting is even more obvious. The older brother is only about three inches taller, but we would expect him to be about 10 inches taller if he had received better nutrition. The older brother has the same timid, insecure demeanor as the poorly nourished little girl. Before the nutrition project the villagers thought their poorly nourished, short children were normal, because all of the village children were undernourished. But when villagers began having healthier children, they could see the impact of better nutrition. Moreover, the active, energetic, well-nourished children stimulated their parents to interact with them more, which further enhanced the children's mental development.<br><br>You who have traveled in other countries or served missions where there is much poverty can picture the village marketplaces. The women come to sell on market days, bringing their young children with them. Did you notice that the little children sat passively by their mothers all day? It wasn't because they were better behaved than the children you and I know. It was because they were undernourished! They didn't even have the energy to get into trouble!<br><br>With undernutrition there are always more problems than just the obvious physical symptoms. Even if these children recover, they probably can't learn as much or as quickly as well-nourished children. They have low resistance to infections. They are more susceptible to developing chronic diseases as adults. They will have a lower capacity for hard work. Some of these limitations can be overcome in this mortal life, but too often they are permanent. In other words, good nutrition matters.<br><br>Can people be spiritually undernourished? Of course! If we aren't actively living the gospel we will waste away, losing whatever spiritual muscle mass or strength we have (picture the loose skin on refugee children's arms). Our spiritual growth will be stunted. Like the undernourished children who grow into adults with less capacity for hard work, the spiritually weak and underdeveloped will be unprepared and unqualified to serve in our Lord's kingdom on earth. Like the villagers who thought their poorly nourished children were normal, could we fail to recognize our own spiritual undernutrition because we are so much like the world around us? On the other hand, the more often we have spiritual experiences, the more often we will be blessed--like the healthy children whose mental development was further enhanced by increased interaction with their parents.<br><br>Now I want to turn to a more pleasant nutrition idea: feasting! Picture a time when you have had a wonderful, abundant meal--perhaps at Thanksgiving--or when you celebrated an important event or honored a special person. Fine food was served on the good china, with silverware polished for the occasion. Maybe the table was set with a sparkling white, ironed tablecloth. If you were the host, you worked hard to make it a wonderful meal, and you gladly paid what it cost. If you were the guest, you were excited to eat a meal that you didn't have to prepare, and you gladly brought your ready appetite.<br><br>As you ate, you began to feel full, and by the meal's end you were positively stuffed! You thought, "How can I possibly ever be hungry again?" Yet what happened? Just a few short hours later you were thinking about eating, and before long you were actually hungry. Finally, you ate again.<br><br>I think the idea of feasting provides rich imagery relevant to the gospel. The gospel is a feast prepared for us to enjoy by a loving Father in Heaven and His Son!<br><br>For years I have pictured the gospel as a feast. Often I have visualized a wonderful scene from the old musical version of Scrooge. When Ebenezer Scrooge looks into the room where the Spirit of Christmas Present is waiting to welcome him, he sees a feast that is marvelous to behold. A wonderful abundance of beautiful, delicious-looking food is piled high! To me this feast represents the gospel of Jesus Christ, and this gospel is so much more than unappetizing, cold, soggy leftovers in a Styrofoam take-home container!<br><br>We can think of the gospel feast in two ways--a feast available to enjoy right now and also as the incomprehensibly magnificent feast that awaits us when this life is over. What is the feast for us right now? It is peace and joy, security in our knowledge of the plan of happiness, companionship of the Comforter, faith in our Savior Jesus Christ, and confidence that His ultimate judgment will be just and merciful to all His children. Brothers and sisters, this is truly a feast!<br><br>As guests at the feast, we need to show up and partake. A fullness of blessings in this life is not given to the nonparticipants. Do you remember the parable of the great supper, when the host invited many respectable people, but one by one they made excuses? So the servant was sent out to invite the poor, the maimed, the halt, and the blind; and then he was sent out again to find even more guests in the highways and hedges, that the house might be filled (see Luke 14:16–35). So it is that we must do something--show up and partake fully--to receive the gospel blessings. The message that the Women's Chorus sang to us illustrates this really well: "Take my life, and let it be consecrated, Lord, to Thee" (Frances Ridley Havergal, 1874). Thank you, Women's Chorus.<br><br>As for the eternal nature of the gospel feast, those who are faithful in the gospel will receive unimaginable blessings: "thrones, kingdoms, principalities, and powers, dominions, all heights and depths" (D&amp;amp;C 132:19), "everlasting life" (Helaman 12:26), "a crown in the mansions of [our] Father" (D&amp;amp;C 59:2; see also 106:8), "endless happiness" (Alma 41:4), and "[our] joy shall be full forever" (2 Nephi 9:18). Wow! I know that from a mortal perspective I can't begin to comprehend how wonderful it will be, but I know that it will be worth whatever it takes to participate in that great feast.<br><br>What about eating so much that we think we can't possibly ever be hungry again? No matter how satisfying a specific spiritual feast may be, this nourishment doesn't sustain us indefinitely. Oliver Cowdery, David Whitmer, and Martin Harris--the three witnesses of the Book of Mormon--had many spiritual feasts, and yet they fell away from participation. They never denied their testimonies, yet for most of their lives they denied themselves the peace and happiness they might otherwise have enjoyed. The incomparable spiritual manifestations they received still weren't sufficient to sustain them indefinitely. As magnificent as the spiritual feasts may be (and we can enjoy the upcoming general conference with that in mind), we can't ignore the daily spiritual nourishment that comes through faith and obedience.<br><br>Now for the last nutrition principle I want to talk about today. A lot of people think that food that is good for us has to be distasteful. From a nutrition point of view, this is a wrong idea! Specific preferences may differ, but we can choose from an enormous variety of nutritious, delicious foods. If we don't like these foods, there are plenty of others to eat. In fact, I think it is part of the divine plan for this earthly experience that we enjoy eating!<br><br>In the Doctrine and Covenants we learn that the fullness of the earth is ours; that things that come of the earth are made for our benefit and use to please the eye and gladden the heart; and that food, with its tastes and smells, is meant to strengthen the body and enliven the soul (see D&amp;amp;C 59:16–20). God is pleased to give us these things. This doesn't sound like austerity and asceticism!<br><br>How might someone's attitude toward eating--reluctant or favorable--apply to the gospel? I know people who are unwilling or afraid to wholly commit themselves to the gospel because of some perceived obstacle, maybe a past hurt. At times we ourselves may resist.<br><br>In his fable The Great Divorce, C. S. Lewis described a busload of souls from hell who travel to the outskirts of heaven. Without exception, they have the opportunity to dwell there permanently and experience the eternal joy available to all our Father's children. But the invitation is conditional. In order to stay, they must give up something they hold dear: one desires popularity and fame; another continues to nurse a grudge; one is committed to a false principle; another wants the power felt through selfishly manipulating others. Unfortunately, most of the travelers from hell are so immersed in their self-centered preoccupations that they don't recognize the beauty, abundance, glory, and, yes, the joy of heaven! They refuse to see that what they would have to give up is nothing in comparison to what they would gain. Most of them choose to cling to their misery and return to hell. (See C. S. Lewis, The Great Divorce [New York: Simon and Schuster, 1996].)<br><br>The point here is that we are free to choose the comfort, peace, and joy of the gospel--or we can choose otherwise. I will illustrate with two experiences from my life. I share them humbly, with the hope that someone hearing my words may recognize ways in their own life to overcome obstacles and participate more joyfully in the gospel feast.<br><br>The first was a very small experience, but with long-lasting consequences. When I was in graduate school many years ago, I attended a branch potluck supper. One of the leaders said something to me that offended me. I have long forgotten what was said, but I remember I felt so hurt that I went back to my apartment and wept. I thought, "I'll show them! I don't want to be with people like that. I won't go to church anymore!" But reason--or the inspiration of the Comforter--prevailed. I realized that I could continue to feel offended and harm only myself or I could acknowledge that although my feelings had been hurt, I knew the hurt was not intentional and I had best just let it go. It was one small experience, but it had eternal consequences. My life would have been very different, in unhappy ways, if I had held onto my hurt feelings. Instead I humbled myself and chose to continue participating in the gospel feast.<br><br>The second experience was incomparably greater in magnitude. My husband was a widower, and I gained an instant family of four sons when I married him. We had our fifth son and were barely expecting our sixth when my husband was called home to our Heavenly Father--only 19 months after we were married. I was devastated! I questioned God's wisdom. It wasn't fair.<br><br>Without going into all the details, I will admit that I continued grieving for three years--and I had only known my husband in this mortal life for two short years. I finally realized I had to make a decision. I could continue my prolonged pity party and have a soul like a wrinkled prune when I was reunited with my husband, or I could put my grief behind me and let joy into my life again. Although I did not understand God's purposes--I still do not understand them all--I had to make a conscious decision to choose a positive outlook. I know I chose rightly.<br><br>I share this not as a model of coping with grief or disappointment--because it isn't a very good one. Nor do I suggest that my suffering was worse than anyone else's. We each have our own tailored challenges to endure. I offer my experience only as an illustration that sometimes we must consciously choose how we will react--and that choosing to come to the gospel feast can increase our happiness.<br><br>Since that time I have met many individuals who are positive and joyful in spite of terrible disappointments or devastating tragedies. I admire them and rejoice that they have chosen to find peace and hope and joy in the gospel.<br><br>A friend recently told me of a stake conference where the stake president invited those who were happy to raise their hands. To those who raised their hands, he said something like, "Congratulations! You are candidates for the celestial kingdom. The rest of you need to repent." It was his understanding that only happy people would be in the celestial kingdom. I would like to invite you to do the same thing today, but I don't have the authority for that kind of pronouncement.<br><br>President Hinckley has said:<br><br>It is very important to be happy in this work. We have a lot of gloomy people in the Church because they do not understand, I guess, that this is the gospel of happiness. It is something to be happy about, to get excited about. [TGBH, 256]<br><br>Let me restate the principles of spiritual nutrition I have tried to describe today. Think about them sometimes when you eat.<br><br>• We must receive daily spiritual nourishment.<br><br>• We must be hungry enough to want to partake.<br><br>• We must prevent spiritual wasting and stunting and instead maximize our spiritual growth.<br><br>• We must come to the feast with a positive attitude, willing to give up those stupid, little things that might otherwise prevent us from tasting how delicious it is.<br><br>The gospel offers us a feast fit for royalty, and we are immature and growing princes and princesses.<br><br>But to receive the fullness offered to us--and think of that in the physical sense of being full when you eat--we must partake wholeheartedly, joyfully. Jesus invited us to "take, eat: this is my body" (Matthew 26:26; Mark 14:22). He is the Bread of Life. He is the Living Water.<br><br>May we come and enjoy the feast is my prayer. In the sacred name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><em>Lora Beth Larson Brown was a BYU associate professor in the Department of Nutrition, Dietetics, and Food Science when this devotional address was delivered on 30 March 2004.</em><br><br>© Brigham Young University.

A friend of mine who was critical of religion once asked me, "What does it really mean if a person behaves righteously because of external rewards and punishments? Every animal will choose reward over punishment."<br><br>Elder Maxwell gave a marvelous talk about agency from this podium three weeks ago. I want to reiterate one of the points he made: A central feature of agency is that God doesn't coerce us. Think about it. Could we trust a God who behaved the way He did because He was coerced into it? Satan's proposal to coerce souls into godly character reveals his lack of understanding. How could any soul be trusted if he or she were behaving well because of coercion? Satan's plan makes no sense except in terms of his seeking glory for himself. He craved the feeling of power that can come from making others obey. And he craved to be worshipped. He still does.<br><br>Rather than coercing us, God gives us the gift of a life experience here that allows opportunity to learn to think and feel as Christ does, to educate our desires, as Elder Maxwell suggested (see "Free to Choose?" 16 March 2004 ). And life provides innumerable opportunities for the learning.<br><h2><b>Everyone Faces Core Issues</b></h2><br>Earth life demands that we face a core set of issues, usually time and again as we proceed across the years. We get lots of practice exercising agency relative to these issues, and it is through repeated encounters that we hone our character. People have faced these issues from day one, no matter when or where they lived. Here are a few examples:<br><br>Basic survival: we need food, water, shelter, and safety--not only for the survival of individuals but also for the survival of the species, with all the thoughts, emotions, and behaviors that are involved with procreation.<br><br>We're constantly dealing with uncertainty, although most of us probably don't like to think about that. But, in reality, we don't know what's going to happen next year or next month or even in the next five minutes.<br><br>We're always dealing with how we feel about ourselves and how we feel about other people. What do we think about them? How do we treat them?<br><br>We also have to deal continually with how others treat us.<br><br>We face issues of self-possession. To what extent do we control our thoughts, our emotions, and our behaviors?<br><br>We're always facing challenges to our integrity.<br><br>And we're continually making decisions about how to use our time.<br><br>These are just a few of the issues we encounter in our time here. Could there possibly be a richer environment in which to exercise agency?<br><h2><b>We Exercise Our Agency in Context</b></h2><br>I believe that one of the most important principles we derive from scripture is that we exercise our agency in context. What we believe is real and true has an enormous influence on our decision making as we face life's issues.<br><br>Myriad factors contribute to our personal contexts.<br><br>Clearly the <i>influence of the Holy Ghost</i> contributes to our context. That influence is one of our most precious gifts--a resource without parallel.<br><br>We also know that <i>Satan and his followers </i>seek relentlessly to entice us to think and feel and believe and act in ways that are incongruent with a godly character.<br><br>A factor that must be crucial but which we know little about is the <i>experience of our eternal spirits</i> and the choices we made prior to coming to the earth. Our subjective experience here is informed by our spirits, although we don't understand how our spirits interact with our earthly minds.<br><br>Our <i>genetic makeup and other biological factors </i>also can have a profound influence on how we perceive the world and ourselves. In terms of providing a learning experience, what superlative brilliance it is to put an eternal spirit into a biological body!<br><br>A dramatic example that reveals biological influence is brain injury. The kindest, wisest, most righteous people can be so affected by such an injury that their personalities change. In some cases they may act most inappropriately. Their biological context has changed.<br><br>Clinical depression provides another example of the power of biological influence. When I mention clinical depression, I'm not referring to the normal ups and downs of life or even the deep sorrow of losing a loved one. I'm talking about a persistent cognitive and emotional state that has a life of its own. It doesn't work to try to talk depressed people out of it or to tell them to just get their act together or count their blessings and cheer up. A typical view of reality for clinically depressed people is that life is hopeless and they are worthless. And that's the context in which they're exercising agency at that point.<br><br>Our <i>stage of development</i> is another context worth considering. Let us think about the context in which young children exercise their agency. We don't baptize children before age eight for good reason. They must be able to distinguish between right and wrong, and they must care about the distinction. They must be able to understand the choices available in a given situation, anticipate consequences, and weigh the alternatives. And they must be able to conform their behavior to their decisions. If we literally can't control some aspects of our behavior, how can we carry out a choice in that particular realm?<br><br>For example, a 15-month-old child may be tearing up your favorite book, even saying aloud, "No rip book," as she rips the book. But a child this age does not yet have the brain development to withhold that behavior. So the degree of development is part of the context in which this child exercises agency. It is about age two when children begin to be able to willfully control such behavior; thus a different context for agency emerges at that time.<br><br>Our <i>earthly environment</i> is crucial, including the influence of our immediate and extended families, our friends, the larger community, and the culture.<br><br>A notable example is Saul of Tarsus. He was acting according to what he believed to be the truth when he persecuted the Christians and participated in the martyrdom of Stephen. On the road to Damascus he received more knowledge--in a dramatic and undeniable way--and he liked what he learned. Thereafter he proceeded to exercise his agency in light of the new information. He became one of the most dedicated and effective servants of the kingdom that ever was.<br><br>Laman, Lemuel, and Nephi grew up with a prophet for a father. They witnessed miraculous events time and again--including seeing angels. The two didn't like it, and the other did. Each exercised his agency in light of his perception of reality. Laman and Lemuel and their families ended up being separated from Nephi and the other believers, and they taught their descendants false beliefs about the gospel and about the Nephites. This affected the attitudes and choices of their descendants for generations.<br><br>Alma the Younger pled with the people of Ammonihah to repent. He said:<br><br><i>Nevertheless I say unto you, that it shall be more tolerable for them in the day of judgment than for you, if ye remain in your sins, yea, and even more tolerable for them in this life than for you, except ye repent.</i><br><br><i>For there are many promises which are extended to the Lamanites; for it is because of the traditions of their fathers that caused them to remain in their state of ignorance; therefore the Lord will be merciful unto them and prolong their existence in the land.</i> [Alma 9:15–16]<br><br>Alma the Younger must have understood this doctrine exquisitely well, because he had sinned seriously, in light of having been taught the gospel. He himself had provided a context that influenced many of his people to disbelieve the truth. He worked to remediate that for the rest of his life, providing quite a different context for those who knew him then.<br><br>Another interesting example of people exercising agency in context is the sons of Helaman. In Alma 56:47–48 we read:<br><br><i>Now they never had fought, yet they did not fear death; and they did think more upon the liberty of their fathers than they did upon their lives; yea, they had been taught by their mothers, that if they did not doubt, God would deliver them.</i><br><br><i>And they rehearsed unto me the words of their mothers, saying: We do not doubt our mothers knew it.</i><br><br>What a wonderful context those mothers provided their children in which to exercise agency.<br><h2><b>What Do We Contribute to the Contexts of Those Around Us?</b></h2><br>In thinking about the issues people face throughout this life, I believe we need to ask ourselves, "What do people face when they face us?" We need to consider carefully our contribution to the context in which others exercise their agency, even our contribution to the way they perceive reality. We can influence the way others see themselves and the world in subtle and not-so-subtle ways, particularly in the case of long-term relationships such as the family.<br><br>Do those around us have to work against us to develop a celestial character? There must needs be opposition, of course, but do we really want to be the ones providing it? God behaves toward His children in ways designed to maximize the likelihood of developing a godly character, and clearly He wants us to do the same.<br><br>The most efficient and effective way to be good for others is to have the principles of the gospel well in mind and well in heart, as it were, and to follow the promptings of the Spirit.<br><br>If our influence helps engender faith, hope, and charity in those around us, we are providing a good context. If our influence helps engender a godly love for themselves and others, we are providing a good context. If our influence engenders in them a bridling of the passions, so that their emotional energy is at their command, we are providing a good context. If our influence helps those who are aware of their sins and inadequacies to still have hope and confidence in the Lord, we are providing a good context.<br><br>Lots of principles help us create a good context in which others exercise their agency. I've chosen just four of them to talk about in the remaining few minutes:<br><br>*Not treating others as objects<br><br>*Provoking others to love and good works<br><br>*Turning the other cheek<br><br>*Loving others, even our enemies, as we love ourselves<br><br>In practice, these principles work together.<br><br>The principle of <i>not treating others as objects </i>is brought out very early in the scriptural record. Cain is the prototype user. He actually killed his brother to get gain. Think about it a little and you can come up with lots of ways it's tempting to use others for our own gratification. The objectifier and the objectified are both damaged by this, and it spans a huge spectrum of unrighteousness.<br><br>As we talk about not treating others as objects, let's also consider the principle of <i>provocation:</i><br><br>In Ephesians 6:4 we read: "And, ye fathers, provoke not your children to wrath: but bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord."<br><br>Likewise, in Colossians 3:21 we are instructed: "Fathers, provoke not your children to anger, lest they be discouraged."<br><br>Hebrews 10:24, on the other hand, reads, "And let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to good works."<br><br>It can be tempting to see family members as objects sometimes and to provoke them to wrath. It's heartbreaking to walk around a neighborhood and hear fathers and mothers yelling at their children. Most young children see their parents as gods, essentially, although they don't label it that way. Isn't this sobering? When parents are harsh to children--yelling, calling names, imposing inappropriate punishment, giving little encouragement--it makes it harder for those children to find the universe a friendly place and themselves and others lovable and trustworthy. Of course this doesn't mean those children will never form other views. But it makes it more difficult for them. Also, when parents don't routinely show kindness and self-possession, it makes it more difficult for their children to exercise their agency in that direction.<br><br>Yelling at children, calling them names, or engaging in other derisive behaviors is, indeed, treating them as objects. It will not provoke them unto love and good works but rather unto wrath and discouragement. Yelling at someone is virtually never appropriate. In fact, if we are really acting like Christ, we won't lose our temper. You're probably thinking to yourself, "Hey, Christ got angry." And you may recall D&amp;amp;C 121:43, which mentions the necessity of "reproving betimes with sharpness, when moved upon by the Holy Ghost." But I have to think that godly anger is not the same as typical human anger. At a recent stake conference, Elder Roger Merrill made the point that Christ never lost His temper. He also made the point that "reproving betimes with sharpness" is best understood in terms of reproving with accuracy and precision. I believe that anger, as we humans generally seem to think of it, is not consonant with the presence of the Spirit. The experience of godly anger is quite a different thing.<br><br>The way parents treat their children can have a profound effect on how those children come to regard God. Children of harsh parents may have trouble even realizing that there is kindness in the world, let alone that there is a kind and loving God who is patient, forgiving, and encouraging.<br><br>Research by John Gottman at the University of Washington indicates that when parents respond empathetically to their children, helping their children identify their own feelings and kindly setting limits as the children find solutions, those children become more able to soothe themselves (see John Gottman et al., <i>The Heart of Parenting: How to Raise an Emotionally Intelligent Child</i> [New York: Simon and Schuster, 1997]). This helps the children learn to bridle their passions, and it appears to help them become more resilient and better able to respond to stress and even to focus their attention better. Think of the effect this would have on the way those children exercise their agency. They would have choices available to them that they otherwise might not.<br><br>Another way to provide a healthy context for others is to <i>turn the other cheek.</i> In addition to not hitting back, this means that we may take another hit ourselves. Sometimes this is absolutely the right thing to do.<br><br>I used to give an assignment to students in my introductory psychology classes that involved turning the other cheek. (I know this may sound a little on the draconian side, and I did provide alternative assignments if students didn't want to do this one. But most of them chose this.) Here's how it went.<br><br>Students were to pick someone with whom they had an important and ongoing relationship--such as a spouse, a parent, a sibling, or a dear friend. It was to be someone who really cared about them and who was emotionally stable. They were to ask that person to pick one thing he or she would like the student to change within the relationship and to explain that thing in depth. That's a pretty scary thing to do for most of us, especially with someone we're close to. There were some ground rules, of course. The person had to agree to do this calmly, in a kind way, to stick to one issue, and to stop the discussion at any point the student asked them to. The students were not to defend themselves during this discussion but only to ask questions or restate what the other person was saying until they understood the other person's point of view about this issue completely. Then, at another time, the students could give their point of view if they wanted to.<br><br>It's pretty tough to take a nondefensive stance when we're being criticized, but we can learn so much from this! I had lots of students say when they wrote about the experience, "What would have happened to my marriage if I'd never found out how my spouse felt about this?" Or, "I wish I had really understood my mother's point of view before." There were no disasters, I'm happy to report.<br><br>I'm not necessarily recommending that you go out and do this. But the point I want to make is about the effect this humble attitude, this willingness to receive feedback and listen to the other's point of view, has on that person. One of the most rewarding experiences in life is to have someone pay complete attention to us and to really care about what we're saying--to have the other person listen to us in depth rather than just going for the sound bite.<br><br>It's an especially sweet gift when the other person not only listens to us but wants to change for the better. When we see that this person cares about our well-being as much as they care about his or her own, we gain confidence and are less afraid of setting out to improve ourselves and making the inevitable mistakes. We may gain the courage or the insight to make choices we might not otherwise have made.<br><br>I believe Satan would have us resist examining ourselves closely, and he would have us avoid being examined closely and known deeply by others. Being carefully and patiently listened to is a context that fosters self-acceptance while it encourages self-examination.<br><br>One of the most helpful of all contexts for people to be in is to see themselves through the eyes of people who <i>love them unconditionally.</i> If we know we're loved, we are less afraid to engage in the process of growth because we know we can make mistakes and still be loved. Also, we're much more likely to be able to love others if we have the blessing of being truly loved ourselves.<br><br>This applies even to people we don't like and to people who don't like us. If you really want to figure out how to provide a better context for others' use of agency, carefully read the Sermon on the Mount. And if you want to get humble fast, by the way, carefully read the Sermon on the Mount. What a wonderful exposition of the principles of faith, hope, and charity--and, I might add, self-awareness and self-possession.<br><br>Here's what Christ said about loving others:<br><br><i>Ye have heard that it hath been said, Thou shalt love thy neighbour, and hate thine enemy.</i><br><br><i>But I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you;</i><br><br><i>That ye may be the children of your Father which is in heaven: for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust.</i><br><br><i>For if ye love them which love you, what reward have ye? do not even the publicans the same?</i> [Matthew 5:43–46]<br><br>It's easy to love people who love us back.<br><br>I do realize that there is an appropriate feeling of revulsion when we're dealing with evil. But this does not preclude the love. Usually we're not going to be dealing with people who are really evil or who are really our enemies. But we all deal with difficult people who may be working against us at times. This can happen even within families.<br><br>I can think of a few good exercises in loving our adversaries. Let me mention one. The next time you're driving on the freeway and somebody cuts you off, think immediately to yourself: "Do I love this person?" If you don't, try taking a deep breath, consciously relaxing, and deciding to love the offending driver. That person is a child of our heavenly parents, too.<br><br>An acquaintance of mine told me of an experience he had a number of years ago on the highway. A car pulled in front of him in a way that irritated him, and so he caught up with the car and gave the occupants a vulgar hand sign. Then, as he looked more closely into the car, he saw President Spencer W. Kimball looking back at him.<br><br>Does it really matter who was in the car? What kind of climate do we set when we hit back like that? The fact that we've been provoked doesn't mean we should provoke in return. There are other ways of dealing with the situation.<br><br>The Book of Mormon illustrates many ways of dealing with adversaries: teaching them the gospel, working with them, negotiating with them, serving them, waging warfare in response to being attacked, simply leaving, and even, on very rare occasions, submitting to their mistreatment. None of these precludes loving our adversaries. In fact, I submit that a prerequisite for dealing in any way with adversaries is to love them. A wonderful side effect of living this principle is that it invites the Spirit to teach us how to handle the situation. Hatred and contempt are not consonant with the presence of the Spirit.<br><h2><b>Conclusion</b></h2><br>In the course of our studies on peaceable and violent behavior in children, Bonnie Ballif-Spanvill and I have concluded that there are endless and creative ways of being good to other people. The options for being bad are actually rather limited in comparison, although they may seem varied and attractive at first blush.<br><br>The scriptures abound with information about how to treat others so as to foster their development of godly character through the use of agency. Those I've mentioned only scratch the surface. This information is bolstered by sound research that helps us understand some specific ways in which to apply the principles. In fact, I believe God is pouring out knowledge in many ways to help us help each other in these difficult times.<br><br>I hope that all of us will pay closer attention to how we treat others so that we help maximize their opportunities to become like Christ. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Claudia J.

<h1>ting Our Education - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Before commencing my first semester at Brigham Young University, I had the opportunity of visiting Bourton-on-the-Water, a small village in the English Cotswolds. Replete with honey-colored houses, bridge-crossed brooks, and sheep-trodden meadows, the town represented all things quintessentially English. While wandering through the narrow streets along the Windrush River, I entered the Church of St. Lawrence. I thought that no one else occupied the silent church, but I soon noticed an elderly woman in a dark wool suit and sensible shoes sitting in the third pew from the altar.<br><br>At first I thought she was praying, but upon closer inspection I realized that she was doing needlepoint, so I felt more comfortable approaching her. We sat together for some time talking about everything from the local tourist sights to the latest tabloid embarrassment of the royal family. As we talked I became intrigued by her handiwork. She explained that she was making a prayer cushion like the dozens hanging from brass hooks on the pews around us. She carefully described the entire process--from the type of materials used to the time and patience required for completing such an undertaking. As a budding young economist, I asked her how much such an endeavor cost.<br><br>"I buy the materials for 30 pounds," she replied.<br><br>Next I asked how much she charged for the prayer cushions.<br><br>"The church buys them for 20 pounds each," she said.<br><br>Now it doesn't take an economics major to do a profitability analysis of this cottage industry. As I puzzled over her 10-pound loss and obviously irrational economic behavior, she responded with a somewhat bewildered smile, saying, "Oh, but you mustn't think in that way!"<br><br>Awkwardly I considered her admonition before responding that all that really mattered was that she derived a great deal of pleasure from her efforts. By saying so I graciously restored her economic sensibility. Again she looked at me with the same smile. I could almost hear her say in response, "Oh, but you mustn't think in that way either!"<br><br>Not knowing how to think, I said good-bye and excused myself. It wasn't until some time later, long after I left the Church of St. Lawrence and the Cotswold hills, that I understood her primary motivation. Her labors were not a profit-maximizing investment decision; neither were they necessarily an exploration of her passion. Rather, she consecrated her needlepoint prayer cushions as a simple gift to her God and her fellow parishioners. Therein lay the importance of her act and her fulfillment in the action.<br><br>I am reminded of that sage woman as I reflect today upon our experiences at Brigham Young University. With hard-earned degrees in hand, we might be inclined to congratulate ourselves on an important investment in human capital. We have all devoted significant time, effort, money, and talent to acquiring these important degrees. Although our undergraduate and graduate programs have prepared us to encounter the world with necessary and refined training and skills, we should remind ourselves of the elderly woman's wise saying: "You mustn't think of it in that way!" Our years here were more than just an economically profitable investment.<br><br>Our university experience has given each of us ample opportunity to explore our passions through many general education and special interest classes. My passion for studying the literature of the American West and northern European baroque art history has taken me to unexpectedly beautiful places. I hope that each of us has experienced that same unparalleled excitement about learning varied subjects during our time here. Finding and developing our passions have been critical elements of our education, but, as I say that, I can see the old woman smiling and hear her saying, "You mustn't think of it in that way either!" Our years here were more than just an exploration of our passions.<br><br>When I reflect upon our experience here at Brigham Young University, I realize that, like the prayer cushions in Bourton-on-the-Water, our education is also a gift that we must consecrate for the benefit of those around us. More important than developing our careers or passions, our unique secular and spiritual education at Brigham Young University has developed within us the capacity to "go forth to serve" so that we might more fully bless the lives of others.<br><br>I'm confident that for the Cotswold woman, seeing her prayer cushions used every week in church gave her great satisfaction in knowing that she'd done some good in her corner of the world. However, I'm also sure that she never imagined that six years later and 5,000 miles away, her attitude of consecration would continue to inspire an economics student whom she probably doesn't even remember. Whether building freeways, preserving history, raising families, teaching students, or healing patients, we will each see the direct impact of our education on the lives of others. But, like the Cotswold woman, consecrating our education and cultivating a giving attitude will enable us to bless many more individuals than just those who use our freeways, read our histories, meet our families, learn in our classrooms, or receive our care. These will be the people who years later and thousands of miles away will not necessarily remember what we did but rather how we did it.<br><br>As graduates we can follow the examples of consecration given us by loving families, loyal friends, inspired professors, wise leaders, and humble tithe payers from around the world--some of whom are in attendance today. This class was sustained and supported by individuals who gave freely and unselfishly of their time, talents, energy, and resources to make our experience here possible. They never thought in that way, preoccupying themselves with their own economies and passions. They truly understood that we must think in terms of serving our fellow brothers and sisters and our Father in Heaven. Through their attitude of consecration they have blessed the lives of many more than just those individuals whom they have come to see today. On behalf of the entire graduating class and a wise woman in sensible shoes, I extend our sincere appreciation.<br><br>Thank you.<br><br><em>Richard J. Hawkins spoke as the representative of his graduating class at BYU commencement on 22 April 2004.</em><br><br>© Brigham Young University. All rights reserved.

Many of the defining experiences of my life were obtained here at BYU, on what I believe to be hallowed ground. I solidified my testimony of the gospel of Jesus Christ, I confirmed my desire to fulfill a mission, I was introduced to my beautiful wife, I was educated with the basics of my occupation, and I learned the importance of service to others.<br><br>If you will indulge me, I would like to share one lesson learned here that took place entirely by accident. Frankly, I am embarrassed to relate it to you--and wouldn't--except that the lesson I learned might prove insightful to one or two of you new graduates.<br><br>As a friend and I were walking past the Smoot Administration Building on our way toward the Marriott Center for a Tuesday morning devotional, Elder Jeffrey R. Holland, then president of the university, hurriedly came out.<br><br>No one was within 50 yards of my friend and me--and now President Holland. He merged onto the sidewalk fewer than 10 feet in front of us but began to increase the distance between us. He was clearly more anxious to get to the devotional on time than we were. In my youthful irreverence--and thinking I would be clever--I muttered to my friend, intentionally loud enough for Elder Holland to hear, "You'd think he'd at least slow down to say hello to a couple of his students." (As you can see, the IQ required to attend BYU was not nearly as high 25 years ago as it is today.)<br><br>It was then that this master teacher taught me a lesson I have kept with me my entire life. Without the slightest pause in his step he simply stated, loud enough for me to hear and profound enough for me to learn from and to remember: "I have much to do. But if you will step up with me, we'll walk together."<br><br>I have thought often of this exchange and from it learned a number of lessons.<br><br>The most obvious is discretion. What kind of a goofball says something like this to the president of the university--the man who with a stroke of a pen can revoke scholarships or do any number of other education-ending actions?<br>Additionally I learned that when a leader speaks, even seemingly insignificant exchanges in passing can have a lasting influence. I have spent 25 years considering and learning from this brief exchange.<br>Elder Holland taught me forgiveness. When the natural man might have responded with an equally inconsiderate retort, he chose instead to say something to uplift.<br>He taught me that he was engaged in doing good works when he said, "I have much to do."<br>He invited me to participate with him.<br>While reaching out to me, he wasn't distracted from the bigger picture concerning what he was about and what he was called to do.<br>Elder Holland invited me to lengthen my stride and to improve my own actions when he said, "Step up with me."<br>He didn't tell me what to do but instead led with example: "Come join me, and we'll travel together."<br>This embarrassing five-second exchange represents only an infinitesimally small fraction of what I have gained by attending BYU. I owe a debt to this university--greater than I have the capacity to repay. I would suggest that each of you as well has a greater debt than you realize.<br>Make a commitment today to serve Brigham Young University and begin repaying that debt!<br><br>Serve BYU by mentoring those who follow you.<br>Serve BYU by donating your time and financial support every year.<br>Serve BYU by never doing anything that would reflect poorly on its name.<br>Serve BYU by being the employee/manager/owner/citizen who only acts with the highest integrity.<br>Serve BYU by strengthening the testimony of the gospel that was nurtured here.<br>I congratulate you on your accomplishments to date.<br>As president of your Alumni Association, I hereby confer on each of you lifetime membership in the Brigham Young University Alumni Association and welcome you to this honored fraternity of more than 350,000.<br><br>I invite each of you to "step up with me." Let us "walk together" in service to this great university and the students it produces. I pray that you may go on to reap even greater rewards than you receive today--namely, that you graduate life with honors! In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><em>Carr Krueger was president of the BYU Alumni Association when this commencement address was given on 22 April 2004.</em><br><br>© Brigham Young University.

<h1>cial and Great University - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Graduates, families, brothers, sisters, and friends, it is my happy opportunity and responsibility on this special day to add again my warm welcome and greeting to all of you and my congratulations to those we honor. We are especially grateful for the presence of Elder Richard G. Scott of the Twelve and chairman of the executive committee of the board of trustees, who presides. His support, counsel, and occasional correction are most appreciated and greatly helpful.<br><br>As always, we are grateful for the presence and constant encouragement and support we receive from Elder Henry B. Eyring of the Quorum of the Twelve, commissioner of church education. We also are pleased to have Sister Bonnie Parkin, Relief Society general president, and Sister Susan Tanner, Young Women general president, with us as members of the board of trustees. We also recognize and thank the many other friends and honored guests who are with us today.<br><br>In addition to those listed in the program as graduates, I would like to mention a person who is attending his last graduation for an extended period. Academic vice president Alan Lee Wilkins has accepted a call from the First Presidency to preside over a mission in Argentina, beginning July 1 of this year. The entire university community will miss him and his wife, Margaret, but I feel a special and personal loss as he has become a close confidant, friend, and associate since my arrival. Although we are honored by his call and support it with enthusiasm, we also admit to missing him already. Alan, would you please stand and allow us to recognize you for your most significant contributions to BYU over these many years?<br><br>I would also like to ask Professor John S. Tanner to stand. No stranger to BYU or academic leadership at the university, he has agreed to become our new academic vice president on June 1. Please join me in welcoming Vice President Tanner.<br><br>Brothers Wilkins and Tanner come from different disciplines and colleges here at BYU, but both are wonderful examples of what BYU graduates are and can become. Both are rigorous scholars, men of integrity, and exemplary Latter-day Saints. I am very grateful for the opportunity to serve with them.<br><br>As some of you might know, I am just completing my first year here at BYU. It has been and is wonderful! The surprises continue, but the special spirit is consistent and sustaining. I am constantly amazed at the general excellence and pervasive goodness of our students, faculty, staff, and administration. I think that there must not be another community anywhere in the world like this one. Sharon and I express our gratitude for the high privilege of being part of all of this.<br><br>I continue to be positively impressed as I learn more about this great university. I thought you might like to know a few interesting facts about this year's senior class, based on our most recent BYU senior survey.<br><br>Almost half of you graduates are now married, and 16 percent have children. Our historical data predict that in the next three years 83 percent of you will be married, so we suggest particularly that the parents of the single women start to plan ahead as you juggle your finances!<br><br>You have learned much about many things while here at BYU. As evidence of this, most of you have wonderfully adjusted your thinking about important things and have lifted your sights. Just one example: When you arrived at BYU, only a third of you planned on continuing with graduate education. Now 71 percent of you have that expectation. We commend all of you for your increasing thirst for lifelong education--whatever your specific plans and immediate goals--and we assure the moms and dads here that we do understand the difference between education for eternity and creating eternal students!<br><br>As well as most of you have done, it would not have been possible without our most capable and devoted faculty. I am tremendously impressed that well over half of you students have reported that you have spent one or more semesters--and some, several--working regularly with a faculty member outside of class. We thank you and our faculty for learning together and for teaching each other.<br><br>BYU is not a perfect place, and Gerrit Gong regularly reminds me that our concrete sidewalks on campus develop cracks like they do everywhere else. Although we do have much to be meek and modest about, I am also thrilled that 95 percent of you feel your BYU experiences have helped you prepare well for future family life. Brigham Young University does attempt to assist and prepare you for all aspects of your future life, in addition to your purely academic endeavors.<br><br>In this context I am pleased that most of you have reported that your BYU experiences have "strongly enhanced" your spiritual development. Of the examples you have chosen, let me mention those that you identified with high frequency. They include your religion courses, student wards, Church Educational System and university firesides, campus devotionals, and the many informal interactions with roommates, classmates, and other students. As important as your major studies are, BYU is about so much more!<br><br>The last statistic I will mention with pleasure is that most of you are far, far below the national average for student debt, especially on credit cards. Much commendation is due to you and those who have helped you learn correct principles in this area. For those still trying to learn to manage finances prudently, it is never too late, and it will never be easier than now!<br><br>Let me conclude by reminding you of a different kind of debt you have all incurred--different in that it cannot be tallied in a checkbook or a bank balance, but real just the same. I speak of the tremendous debt owed by each of you to your spouses, parents, families, and other direct financial benefactors. I speak also of the faithful members of the Church worldwide, many living in relative poverty and without a realistic hope of themselves or their families ever enjoying a BYU education. They pay their tithes and offerings with complete confidence in the leaders of the Church who are so carefully and generously making the incomparable BYU experience possible for us. I hope that we will always remember their sacrifice and generosity in our prayers.<br><br>Beyond that, I hope we will commit ourselves today and continue this commitment throughout our lives to contribute in every way that we can to building the kingdom of God on earth and also in supporting our alma mater. Gratitude is easily verbalized but often difficult to actualize. You remember the account of Jesus meeting the 10 men with leprosy (see Luke 17:11–19). All of them called on the Lord and pled for mercy or to be cured. The Savior told them what to do, and they did it--resulting in the cleansing of their leprosy. Sadly, there was only one of the 10 who thought to return and thank the Lord. Think of Jesus' question to the one thoughtful and grateful man. Said Jesus, "Were there not ten cleansed? but where are the nine?" (Luke 17:17).<br><br>BYU and its graduates excel in almost every category and consideration. I am convinced that we will never forget our significant debt and we will ever recognize the privilege it is to be part of this grand enterprise called Brigham Young University. I am sure that you will wish always to stand with the grateful one and not the negligent nine.<br><br>We promise you that we will not forget you and we will do all we can to remind you of your blessings. We ask that you also keep us in your thoughts and prayers and help us become even better with your continued participation and your splendid examples as you go throughout the world during your especially blessed lives.<br><br>Again I congratulate you and those supporting and sustaining you. I invoke the blessings of heaven upon you, your families, and your brilliant futures. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><em>Cecil O. Samuelson was the president of Brigham Young University when this BYU commencement address was given on 22 April 2004.</em><br><br>© Intellectual Reserve, Inc. All rights reserved.

<h1> Art Merry, Praise the Lord” - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
<h2><b>Whiplash</b></h2><br>One winter's morning during a snowstorm, I took my mother to have some blood tests done. It was "white-knuckle" driving on snowy, icy roads. We were headed home and going around a corner very slowly. The car hit black ice, and as if in slow motion, we headed for the curb. THUNK! I quickly asked Mom, "Are you OK?"<br><br>"Yes."<br><br>We continued cautiously, slowly.<br><br>Then I said in an oh-so-sarcastic kind of way, "So I suppose you're going to sue me for whiplash." Instantly she jumped in, moaning and holding her neck. "Oh ... ohhhhhh ... oh, my neck hurts. ... Oh, I can't move my head. ... Oh dear, I have to call ..." and she tried to say the name of one of the lawyers who advertises on TV. ("One call ... that's all!") It was so spontaneous and so hilarious that we both laughed until we were screaming.<br><br>We eventually came up for air, but Mom kept the fun going for days, calling me, moaning and whining about her whiplash the minute I'd answer.<br><br>I'm so grateful for what I have learned from my parents about being cheerful, lighthearted, and--yes--sometimes silly.<br><br>It's a blessing to have been asked to ponder the topic of being merry and praising the Lord. This is another of my "soul-search" topics. I pray that what I have prepared will be uplifting, comforting, thought provoking, and happifying--all in just twenty-five minutes!<br><br>The Prophet Joseph Smith taught that "happiness is the object and design of our existence" (<i>Teachings</i>, 255).<br><br>That's why our Heavenly Father's plan is so often called the great plan of happiness. Happiness is part of our nature, as it is part of God's nature. As Alma taught his son Corianton:<br><br><i>And now, my son, all men that are in a state of nature, or I would say, in a carnal state ... are without God in the world, and they have gone contrary to the nature of God; therefore, they are in a state contrary to the nature of happiness. </i>[Alma 41:11]<br><br>We are born with a naturally sunny, optimistic, cheerful disposition. Feeling joy and happiness doesn't mean we're always laughing our heads off, although, laughter <i>is</i> very therapeutic! President James E. Faust has said: "Don't forget to laugh at the silly things that happen. Humor ... is a powerful force for good when used with discretion. Its physical expression, laughter, is highly therapeutic" ("Learning for Eternity," <i>Brigham Young University 1997–98 Speeches</i> [Provo: Brigham Young University, 1998], 78). He's right! When we laugh hard, our heart rate speeds up, the circulatory and immune systems are stimulated, and more endorphins are produced. (And then they go perform at Sea World).<br><br>In Proverbs we read, "A merry heart doeth good [like] medicine" (17:22). I was told that Picabo Street, the great Olympic skier, wants to become a nurse and work in the ICU so she can answer the phone with "Picabo, ICU." Isn't it like a dose of good medicine when we laugh together? It feels unifying!<br><br>Abraham Lincoln once said: "With the fearful strain that is on me night and day, if I did not laugh I should die" (quoted in James E. Faust, "The Need for Balance in Our Lives," <i>Ensign,</i> March 2000, 4). I heard that if you want or need to laugh and you don't--if you suppress laughter--it goes to your hips and spreads out.<br><br>Sister Hinckley had (and I'm sure still has) a delightful sense of humor. She said: "The only way to get through life is to laugh your way through it. You either have to laugh or cry. I prefer to laugh. Crying gives me a headache" (Virginia H. Pearce, ed., <i>Glimpses into the Life and Heart of Marjorie Pay Hinckley</i> [Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1999], 107). How we miss her.<br><br>A good sense of humor can help us in many ways in life. President Gordon B. Hinckley once said:<br><br><i>We've got to have a little humor in our lives. You had better take seriously that which should be taken seriously but, at the same time, we can bring in a touch of humor now and again. If the time ever comes when we can't smile at ourselves, it will be a sad time.</i> [<i>TGBH</i>, 432]<br><br>Several years ago my friend Helen told me that in her little town of Vernon, Utah, where there were way too many crickets, they included some cricket recipes in their ward newsletter! I have a special appreciation for those who can laugh even in the midst of challenges.<br><br>Someone who tells jokes all the time--to whom everything is funny--does <i>not</i> have a sense of humor. And if we hurt someone's feelings, it's not funny. The essence of good humor is love! Thomas Carlyle wrote: "True humour springs not more from the head than from the heart; it is not contempt, its essence is love" (quoted in James E. Faust, "The Need for Balance in Our Lives," <i>Ensign,</i> March 2000, 4)<br><br>For a few years at the Missionary Training Center, I supervised those learning American Sign Language. One day the supervisor brought her group to my office door to announce they'd been asked to sing for the MTC Christmas program. I could tell something funny was about to happen by the look on her face.<br><br>"Do you want to know what they've chosen to sing?"<br><br>"Of course I do!"<br><br>"Our two numbers are "Do You Hear What I Hear?" and "I Heard Him Come.'" The missionaries, several of whom were deaf, laughed and clapped. So did I!<br><h2><b>Lightheartedness vs. Lightmindedness</b></h2><br>I want to return to President Faust's comment about humor being "a powerful force for good when used with discretion" ("Learning for Eternity," 78). I've done a lot of thinking about the difference between lightheartedness and lightmindedness. I think lightmindedness is thoughtless--literally, without thought. It is empty, meaningless, and wasteful. Often there is hypocrisy and scorn associated with lightminded laughter. It is irreverent and unholy. It separates us from the Spirit. It's the things we talk and laugh about that don't encourage, cheer, or edify.<br><br>Lightheartedness is goodness--joyful goodness. It includes all that blesses and happifies us and others. It's being of good cheer while focusing on the things that matter. It's a virtue.<br><br>Truman Madsen tells a story about Heber C. Kimball:<br><br><i>He is praying with his family and in the midst of the prayer says, "Father, bless Brother So-and-So." Then he bursts into a loud laugh. I can imagine the heads of his children popping up and their eyes opening. There is a slight pause, and then he says, "Lord, it makes me laugh to pray about some people," and he goes on with his prayer. (see </i>Life of Heber C. Kimball<i>, p. 427.) I leave you to say whether that is lightmindedness or profound intimacy with the Lord. He knows. We have a funny bone. He gave it to us. </i>[<i>The Radiant Life</i> (Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1994), 6]<br><br>President Harold B. Lee has written,<br><br><i>I have never believed that in order to be righteous one must be sad-faced and solemn. People approved of the Lord have always been those who have laughed and danced and sung as well as worshipped, but at all times within proper bounds and not to excess. </i>[<i>Decisions for Successful Living</i> (Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1973)<i>,</i> 154]<br><br>I took note when Elder Ballard, in a visit to the MTC in September 1985, told the missionaries that "lightmindedness offends," and he said, "You can tell!" Then he added, "If we said you couldn't have a sense of humor, all the Brethren would be in jeopardy" (from author's personal notes).<br><br>President Boyd K. Packer wrote: "A good sense of humor is a characteristic of a well-balanced person. It has always been apparent that the prophets were men with very alert and pleasing senses of humor (<i>Teach Ye Diligently</i> [Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1973], 210). I remember a time in the Tabernacle years ago on a Sunday morning during general conference when it was <i>hot</i>. Everyone was fanning themselves with whatever they could find. President Hinckley got up and said something like "It's hot in here. We know you're hot. But you're not as hot as you're going to be if you don't repent!" The laughter was instant and joyful.<br><br>We really are happy people. We can't help it! We know too much! We are like the Nephites--we "[live] after the manner of happiness" (2 Nephi 5:27). And we work at having happy hearts without being lightminded.<br><br>We certainly recognize the importance of reverence for all that is sacred. President Boyd K. Packer said, "There are some things just too sacred to discuss. ... It is not that they are secret, but they are sacred, ... to be harbored and to be protected and regarded with the deepest of reverence" ("'The Spirit Beareth Record,'" <i>Ensign,</i> June 1971, 87). We are reverent about our Heavenly Father and His holy Son Jesus Christ, including being reverent with Their names. Jesus' name is the only name under heaven that can save us! (See Acts 4:12; 2 Nephi 25:20.)<br><br>President David O. McKay said, "The greatest manifestation of spirituality is reverence. ... Reverence is profound respect mingled with love" ("Meditation, Communion, Reverence in Our Houses of Worship," <i>The Instructor,</i> October 1966, 371).<br><h2><b>Happiness and Adversity</b></h2><br>Happiness does not mean an absence of adversity. Why would our baptismal covenant include bearing one another's burdens if no one had any burdens? Why would we covenant to mourn with those who mourn and comfort those who stand in need of comfort if no one ever mourned and no one ever needed comforting? (see Mosiah 18:8–9).<br><br>Elder Jack H. Goaslind has said:<br><br><i>I am convinced if we are to have happiness in our hearts, we must learn how to preserve it, in our hearts, in the midst of trouble and trial. We can control our attitude toward adversity. Some people are defeated and embittered by it, while others triumph over it and cultivate godlike attributes in the midst of it.</i> ["Happiness," <i>Ensign,</i> May 1986, 54]<br><br>Probably each of us can think of someone who has been refined and who has become more godlike through trials. Elder Goaslind uses the word <i>cultivate.</i> It indicates work, doesn't it? We work to develop godlike attributes. President Hinckley has invited us to "cultivate an attitude of happiness. Cultivate a spirit of optimism" ("If Thou Art Faithful," <i>Ensign,</i> November 1984, 92).<br><br>Life may not always be exactly what we had in mind, but we're not alone. Have you noticed that sometimes you draw closer to your Heavenly Father when you are deeply in need? That's been my experience. And He comes. He is always willing to come. Listen again to what happened to the people of Alma when they were being persecuted by the former priests of Noah:<br><br><i>Lift up your heads and be of good comfort....</i><br><br><i>And I will ... ease the burdens ... upon your shoulders, that even you cannot feel them upon your backs, even while you are in bondage; and this will I do that ye may stand as witnesses for me hereafter, and that ye may know of a surety that I, the Lord God, do visit my people in their afflictions.</i> [Mosiah 24:13–14]<br><br>Many of <i>you</i> can also be witnesses for Him hereafter, testifying that He also visited you in your afflictions.<br><br>Elder James E. Talmage said, "[Happiness] springs from the deeper fountains of the soul, and is not infrequently accompanied by tears. Have you never been so happy that you have had to weep? I have" ("A Greeting to the Missionaries," <i>Improvement Era,</i> December 1913, 173). We have too, haven't we?<br><br>Psalm 30 teaches, "Weeping may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning" (30:5). Doctrine and Covenants adds, "If thou art sorrowful, call on the Lord thy God with supplication, that your souls may be joyful" (136:29).<br><h2><b>Happiness Is a Result of Righteousness</b></h2><br>In 2 Nephi 2:13, Lehi is teaching his son Jacob about opposition:<br><br><i>And if ye shall say there is no law, ye shall also say there is no sin. If ye shall say there is no sin, ye shall also say there is no righteousness. And if there be no righteousness there be no happiness. And if there be no righteousness nor happiness there be no punishment nor misery. And if these things are not there is no God.</i><br><br>There <i>is</i> a God, there <i>is</i> righteousness, and there <i>is</i> happiness.<br><br>President Gordon B. Hinckley said, "Happiness comes of righteousness." He went on to teach that wickedness, sin, selfishness, and greed never bring happiness. And then he said, "Happiness lies in living the principles of the gospel of Jesus Christ" ("Fast-Paced Schedule for the Prophet," <i>Church News,</i> 20 April 1996, 3).<br><br>It's true that "wickedness never was happiness" (Alma 41:10). And so righteousness never was misery. Adversity, deep water, and fiery trials for sure, but not misery. We can choose to cultivate either happiness or misery. Elder Goaslind has said:<br><br><i>Our joy in God's kingdom will be a natural extension of the happiness we cultivate in this life. </i>["Happiness," <i>Ensign,</i> May 1986, 53]<br><br>A few weeks ago, a woman shared with me a very interesting experience she had during her stake conference. She said her stake president invited all those who were happy to raise their hands. To them he said "Congratulations! You are candidates for the celestial kingdom. The rest of you need to repent!" Then he added, "I'm convinced that in the celestial kingdom there will only be happy people!"<br><br>Moroni illustrates this principle in Mormon 9:14:<br><br><i>And then cometh the judgment of the Holy One upon them; and then cometh the time that he that is filthy shall be filthy still; and he that is righteous shall be righteous still; and he that is happy shall be happy still; and he that is unhappy shall be unhappy still.</i><br><br>We will be "raised to happiness according to [our] desires of happiness" (Alma 41:5) and according to the degree to which we have cultivated happiness right here, right now.<br><h2><b>An Attitude of Happiness and a Spirit of Optimism</b></h2><br>Joy is a gift of the Spirit (see Galatians 5:22). President Marion G. Romney said, "The key to happiness [or joy] is to get the Spirit and keep it" (<i>CR,</i> October 1961, 61). Heber C. Kimball said: "I am perfectly satisfied that my Father and my God is a cheerful, pleasant, lively, and good-natured Being. Why? Because I am cheerful, pleasant, lively, and good-natured when I have His Spirit" (<i>JD</i> 4:222). Has that been your experience? As you have felt the Spirit, have you also felt joy? Joy brings the Spirit, and the Spirit brings joy.<br><br>Brigham Young asked:<br><br><i>Where is happiness, real happiness? Nowhere but in God. By possessing the spirit of our holy religion, we are happy in the morning, we are happy at noon, [and] we are happy in the evening. ... Every Latter-day Saint, who has experienced the love of God in his heart, ... realizes that he is filled with joy ... happiness, and consolation.</i> [<i>DBY,</i> 236]<br><br>Think of someone you enjoy being around, and think about <i>why</i>. Through the many years I've asked others this question, I can't think of a single time when someone has said, "Oh, I like to be around Fifi--she is such a downer! What a pessimist! She's so negative! I can't be around her more than 2 minutes without feeling just awful!" Cheerful, optimistic people are pleasant to be around. This certainly includes President Hinckley, who has helped so many of us smile and laugh in a happy way. I feel that his optimism and good cheer come in large measure because of his goodness, his righteousness, and his absolute obedience.<br><br>Brigham Young said, "It does make the Devil mad ... that he cannot afflict this people so as to make them have a sad countenance" (<i>DBY,</i> 236). Another time, he noted: "There is not a man or woman on this earth, whose peace is made with God, and who are associated with holy beings, and seeking after holy principles, but their countenances are lit up with a lamp of divine cheerfulness" (quoted in Truman G. Madsen, "'The Joy of the Lord Is Your Strength' (Nehemiah 8:10)," <i>Brigham Young University 2000–2001 Speeches</i> [Provo: Brigham Young University, 2001], 145). This is taught in Proverbs--"A merry heart maketh a cheerful countenance" (Proverbs 15:13)--and by President Hinckley, who said, "Let the light of the gospel shine in your faces wherever you go and in whatever you do" ("Live the Gospel," <i>Ensign,</i> November 1984, 86).<br><h2><b>Passing Along Joy and Happiness to Children</b></h2><br>More than 100 years ago, President George Q. Cannon said:<br><br><i>My experience has proved that there is greater happiness, purer joy and more delight to be obtained in serving God and being active in His work than can be obtained in any other direction. ...</i><br><br><i>... We illustrate the great truth that a people can be a profoundly religious people and at the same time be a very happy people. I do not believe there is any happier people on the earth than the Latter-day Saints. ... There must be the fountain of [happiness] within us; and wherever we go and have that spirit within us, we shall be happy. ... We should cultivate this, and teach it to our children.</i> [<i>Collected Discourses Delivered by President Wilford Woodruff, His Two Counselors, the Twelve Apostles, and Others,</i> comp. and ed. Brian H. Stuy (n.p.: B.H.S. Publishing, 1989), 5:394–95]<br><br>President Gordon B. Hinckley has encouraged: "Enjoy your membership in the Church. ... Enjoy your activity... Be happy in that which you do. Cultivate a spirit of gladness in your homes" ("Live the Gospel," <i>Ensign,</i> November 1984, 86). I'm so thankful for the spirit my parents cultivated in our home. I thank both of them for the difference it has made in my life to have them share and nurture a sense of humor, a spirit of optimism, and a cheerful disposition. Another time I can share more about my father, but for now I have a few more things to say about my mother, who is close to 90 years old.<br><br>One of Mom's most wonderful qualities is her ability to laugh at herself. Eleven years ago she suffered a major stroke. This affected her in many ways, including her speech, reading, and writing. Just four months after the stroke, she gave a talk right here in the Marriott Center at women's conference. One of the things she said in her halting way was not to wait to have a stroke--that you could probably enjoy it more if you had it when you were younger. She felt she had waited too long.<br><br>One time in her hospital room, my brother Frank and I were watching as she went to the mirror to brush her teeth. She picked up the tube of toothpaste and stood looking at it. Then, very carefully, she put a little dab on her finger. We kept watching, not wanting to interrupt and trying not to laugh. She looked in the mirror and down at her finger, and then she began to rub the toothpaste on her nose. That did it. We started laughing, and she laughed harder than we did. Frank commented that she wouldn't be getting any cavities on her nose!<br><br>This past September, my mother went with me to St. George for a women's conference. This was during the annual senior games, and as we shuffled into the motel--Mom leaning on her walker and me dragging our luggage--we noticed all the ship-shape senior athletes. I said to her, "Hey, Mom. They think we're here for the senior games! They're wondering what our sport is!" That cracked us up!<br><br>I've spent some challenging times in places far away from my family and from basic conveniences. One thing that "has made all the difference" is to receive letters and packages from home. Once when I was in Hong Kong, Mom sent me a nose-and-glasses combination. How did she know I'd love that? She's my mother, that's how. I'd wear it around, including on the busses, and watch for the fun and smiles all around me. When I was in Indonesia, she'd send boxes filled with lovely things she'd found in her basement or at Deseret Industries or received from neighbors wanting to get rid of stuff--from rat traps to aprons, from old drapes to kazoos. While I was in Africa she sent me a Tupperware catalogue, saying that she thought it'd be nice for the sisters out in the bush to have a Tupperware party. We <i>can</i> pass along joy and good cheer--and a good sense of humor--to our children and others.<br><br>President James E. Faust commented:<br><br><i>For many years as I have blessed newborn children, including my own, I have blessed them with a sense of humor. I do this with the hope that it will help guard them against being too rigid, that they will have balance in their lives, and that situations and problems and difficulties will not be overdrawn. </i>["The Need for Balance in Our Lives," <i>Ensign,</i> March 2000, 4]<br><br>A mother who was diagnosed with cancer told of being isolated in a bare room for many long days behind closed lead-lined doors, feeling like a prisoner convicted of a crime she didn't commit. Then she tells of her oldest daughter coming to visit:<br><br><i>She sat down behind the lead screen that separated us and proceeded to take off her boots and socks. She slipped her socks on her hands and pretended they were puppets and spoke through them. I laughed for the first time in months. That simple act brightened my outlook instantly.</i> [Emily Farmer, "'What Do I Say to Someone Who Is Dying?'" <i>Ensign,</i> April 1990, 73]<br><br>"Count your many blessings, name them one by one"--you never know when one might be missing! Gratitude leads to joy and happiness, just as joy and happiness lead to gratitude and contentment. President Lorenzo Snow said, "It is ... the duty of every Latter-day Saint to cultivate a spirit of gratitude" (quoted in Rulon D. Pope, "Free-Riding and Gratitude," <i>Brigham Young University 1999–2000 Speeches</i> [Provo: Brigham Young University: 2000], 102).<br><h2><b>Heavenly Father Wants Us to Be Happy</b></h2><br>Our Heavenly Father and the Savior want us to experience joy, happiness, and good cheer. President Gordon B. Hinckley has said, " I am satisfied that our Father in Heaven likes to see His children happy--not miserable, but happy" (<i>TGBH,</i> 256). A <i>Church News</i> article states: "Some unfortunate souls think that joy is a luxury, one of life's frills they cannot afford or do not deserve. But ... it is God who decided that joy is the very purpose for our existence" ("Choosing Joy," <i>Church News,</i> 6 February 1993, 16). His plan really <i>is</i> the great plan of happiness!<br><br>Elder Matthew Cowley commented:<br><br><i>I like to get fun out of this business--good, wholesome, righteous fun--get a kick out of it. When I obey the principles of this gospel, I am the happiest man on earth. When I don't, then I am depressed, then I have a right to worry about myself; but, when I am trying to do the best I know, then I tell you, I am having the time of my life. </i>[<i>Matthew Cowley Speaks</i> (Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1954), 133]<br><br>Elder Neal A. Maxwell said: "Ultimate hope and daily grumpiness are not reconcilable. It is ungraceful, unjustified, and unbecoming of us as committed Church members to be constantly grumpy or of woeful countenance" (<i>Neal A. Maxwell Quote Book</i> [Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1997], 164).<br><br>President Hinckley has several quotes on this topic in the collection of his teachings: "It is very important to be happy in this work. We have a lot of gloomy people in the Church because they do not understand, I guess, that this is the gospel of happiness. It is something to be happy about, to get excited about" (<i>TGBH, </i>256); "I hope you enjoy this work. I really do. Notwithstanding all the problems, this is a work of happiness. This is the good news! This is a work of joy! I hope you can laugh and smile and be happy and rejoice before the Lord" (<i>TGBH,</i> 255); "Your happiness lies in following the gospel of Jesus Christ. ... Happiness lies in faithfulness and in righteousness" (<i>TGBH,</i> 256). That's it! That's the key! Our happiness lies in following the gospel of Jesus Christ--in having faith in Him, believing Him, coming unto Him, and becoming more like Him.<br><br>May our deep and tender feelings about the Savior bring us comfort, peace, hope, joy, gratitude, contentment, optimism, a countenance of divine cheerfulness, and genuine happiness. He is the one who invites us to "be of good cheer, and do not fear, for I the Lord am with you, and will stand by you" (D&amp;amp;C 68:6).<br><br>He will. He does. I know it.<br><br><i>Mary Ellen Edmunds gave this Women's Conference address at Brigham Young University on 29 April 2004.</i><br><br><i>© Intellectual Reserve, Inc. All rights reserved.</i>

<h1> Delighteth in the Things of the Lord” - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
My soul delighteth in the things of the Lord," wrote Nephi, "and my heart pondereth continually upon the things which I have seen and heard" (2 Nephi 4:16). Yet in the verses that follow, he expressed sorrow and even grief because of his weaknesses. Sometimes known as Nephi's Psalm, these twenty powerful verses in 2 Nephi chapter 4 give us unique insights into the process he went through to lift himself out of discouragement and to renew his faith and determination in the Lord. I would like to spend the next few minutes examining these verses. My hope is that, by looking carefully at Nephi's approach, we might find a pattern that would assist us as we struggle through challenges in our own lives.<br><br>As already noted, Nephi expressed his delight for the things of the Lord and his desire to continually ponder the blessings and guidance he received. His words indicate he truly learned to serve the Lord with all his heart and mind. The constancy of his mind and heart reminds us of the Psalmist, who said: "I will bless the Lord at all times: his praise shall continually be in my mouth" (Psalms 34:1).<br><br>Nonetheless, despite Nephi's righteous desires and his attempt to continually feed his mind with the things of God, there were challenges in his life. In verses 17–19 Nephi described the affliction he felt because of the weaknesses of his flesh and the sorrow and grief caused by his iniquity. He wrote:<br><br><i>I am encompassed about, because of the temptations and the sins which do so easily beset me.</i><br><br><i>And when I desire to rejoice, my heart groaneth because of my sins.</i> [2 Nephi 4:18–19]<br><br>Nephi was puzzled by his sorrows. He had seen marvelous visions in which he was taught about the Apostasy and Restoration, the coming of the Savior to his descendants, the tree of life (see 1 Nephi 11–14), the scattering and gathering of Israel, and more. He had been taught the mysteries of God (see 1 Nephi 10:17–19). Angels had ministered to him and, he had beheld things he could not write because they were "too great for man" (2 Nephi 4:24–25). And yet, despite these tremendous experiences, he was troubled by temptation and affliction.<br><br>Surely all of us, in one way or another, can relate to Nephi's feeling of being "encompassed about" by sin. Our world is becoming darker and darker, and we can, at times, feel beset, either through the wickedness of the world and its accompanying lack of hope or through our own weaknesses or afflictions. Satan desires to surround us. He attacks us from all sides. If we are not careful, he will hem us in (see <i>The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language,</i> 4th ed., s.v. "beset"), bind us down, chain us, and lead us carefully away to hell (see 2 Nephi 9:45, 28:21–22).<br><br>In the last phrase of verse 19, we notice a significant turn in Nephi's expression of sorrow: "Nevertheless, I know in whom I have trusted." He then recalled the marvelous support and blessings he had received from the Lord: "My God hath been my support; he hath led me through mine afflictions[,] ... preserved me[,] ... filled me with his love, ... confounded mine enemies, ... heard my cry ... , and ... given me knowledge. ... Mine eyes have beheld great things" (2 Nephi 4:20–23, 25).<br><br>In this passage we recognize that Nephi kept his covenant with the Savior, remembering all that the Lord had done to guide and bless him. It is also an example of the fulfillment of one of the major purposes of the Book of Mormon: "to show ... the House of Israel what great things the Lord hath done for their fathers" (title page).<br><br>Nephi, more than most of us, understood what it means to be "tempest-tossed" on "life's billows," "discouraged, thinking all is lost." He followed, as should we, the advice of the hymn:<br><br><i>Count your many blessings; name them one by one,</i><br><br><i>And it will surprise you what the Lord has done.</i> ["Count Your Blessings," <i>Hymns,</i> no. 241]<br><br>We can look at these words as either a quaint nineteenth-century formula or as an invitation to keep our covenant to always remember the Savior and his role in our lives, even amid our persisting trials and troubles.<br><br>So now, after having recalled the many ways the Lord had blessed him, Nephi found himself at a point where he had to choose. He was at the intersection between faith and discouragement, and his agency had to be used. In order to make his decision about whether to continue on the path of sorrow and grief or to turn fully to the Lord, he asked these important questions:<br><br><i>Why should my heart weep and my soul linger in the valley of sorrow, and my flesh waste away, and my strength slacken, because of mine afflictions?</i><br><br><i>And why should I yield to sin, because of my flesh? Yea, why should I give way to temptations, that the evil one have place in my heart to destroy my peace and afflict my soul? Why am I angry because of mine enemy?</i> [2 Nephi 4:26–27]<br><br>This may be the most important part of the chapter, because it helps us to see how Nephi used his agency to overcome the grief he felt in his heart. He expressed his sorrows, remembered the strength of the Lord in his life, and questioned why he would want to stay in that zone of sin and discouragement and trouble. We can certainly do the same in our hour of need. Why would we want to linger in valleys of sorrow, waste away, or slacken our strength? Knowing what we know about sin, what in the world would cause us to give way, give in, or give up? When we know our actions, thoughts, or circumstances will allow the evil one to destroy our peace or cause us anger, should we not do all we can to get up and get going, to move our position and set a new course?<br><br>There is no question about the course Nephi charted. He chose, through his faith, to lift himself toward the things of righteousness. "Awake, my soul!" he exclaimed. "No longer droop in sin. Rejoice, O my heart, and give place no more for the enemy of my soul" (2 Nephi 4:28).<br><br>The lesson is clear: When encompassed about and discouraged, when we feel all is lost, we need to close up the spaces in our hearts and minds that give entrance to the enemy and follow Alma's counsel to "give place" for the seed of faith to be planted in our hearts (Alma 32:28). As we clear space and make room for the word of God, for the Spirit of the Lord, for all that is true and good, our righteous desires will increase, allowing the Lord's promise to be manifest: "Even as you desire of me so it shall be unto you" (D&amp;amp;C 6:8).<br><br>How can we increase such desires in us? To emphasize a request, sometimes we place a verb at the beginning of a sentence, using an imperative statement. Those of you who are mothers may have employed this approach in speaking to your children: "Take the garbage out now, son!" "Get your homework done!" Notice the imperative statements Nephi used in verses 28–30 when he addressed himself as a way to increase his determination and focus his spiritual energies:<br><br>Awake, my soul!<br><br>Rejoice, O my heart, and give place no more for the enemy of my soul.<br><br>Do not anger.<br><br>Do not slacken my strength.<br><br>Rejoice, O my heart. [See 2 Nephi 4:28–30.]<br><br>At times when our faith is slipping, we are tired, or we need to summon strength, we might speak to ourselves in the same way: "Have faith. Be calm. Don't be angry. Fear not. Trust the Lord. Don't give up!"<br><br>It is particularly interesting that Nephi repeated the phrase <i>rejoice, O my heart.</i> Just a few verses before, he had written that he desired to rejoice but could not. "Nevertheless," he confirmed, "I know in whom I have trusted" (2 Nephi 4:19).<br><br>If we desire to rejoice but cannot, then like Nephi, we ought to place our trust in the Lord, remember that his help will come, and let our hearts believe in his mercy and grace. We are told in the Doctrine and Covenants to lift up our hearts and rejoice (see D&amp;amp;C 25:13, 27:15, 31:3, 42:69). Our heart is the repository of our deepest feelings and beliefs and the seat of our intellect (see <i>The</i> <i>American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language,</i> 4th. ed., s.v. "heart"). Lifting up our hearts means elevating our thoughts and feelings and refocusing our desires. It means putting into practice the command to "let virtue garnish [our] thoughts unceasingly" (D&amp;amp;C 121:45). How important is each of the dimensions of the commandment to love God with all our heart, might, mind and strength! (See D&amp;amp;C 59:5.) Loving and trusting God in our hearts and minds may require all of our might and strength, but doing so will allow us, in time, to rejoice.<br><br>Nephi did not merely convince himself to lift up his heart and get out of the doldrums. This was not simply the power of positive thinking at work. His words to himself--"Awake my soul! No longer droop in sin" (2 Nephi 4:28)--were determined, focused expressions that indicated his orientation and his intent to serve the Lord. He steered his soul toward salvation and invited the Lord to place him "beyond the power of all his enemies," which is how Joseph Smith described salvation (<i>HC</i> 5:392).<br><br>Not only did Nephi address himself and gather internal strength, he also cried unto the Lord--prayed--asking God for strength.<br><br>Let's examine his prayer. It began with a commitment: "O Lord, I will praise thee forever; yea, my soul will rejoice in thee, my God, and the rock of my salvation" (2 Nephi 4:30).<br><br>Next, he offers a plea for deliverance and help to avoid sin: "O Lord, wilt thou redeem my soul? Wilt thou deliver me out of the hands of mine enemies? Wilt thou make me that I may shake at the appearance of sin?" (2 Nephi 4:31). Nephi's petition reminds us of the Lord's Prayer: "Suffer us not to be led into temptation, but deliver us from evil" (Matthew 6:13, JST).<br><br>Then Nephi introduced three vivid metaphors. First, a gate:<br><br><i>May the gates of hell be shut continually before me, because that my heart is broken and my spirit is contrite! O Lord, wilt thou not shut the gates of thy righteousness before me.</i> [2 Nephi 4:32]<br><br>Second, a path, or way:<br><br><i>That I may walk in the path of the low valley, that I may be strict in the plain road!</i><br><br><i>...O Lord, wilt thou make a way for mine escape before mine enemies! Wilt thou make my path straight before me! Wilt thou not place a stumbling block in my way--but that thou wouldst clear my way before me, and hedge not up my way, but the ways of mine enemy.</i> [2 Nephi 4:32–33]<br><br>And finally, a robe:<br><br><i>Wilt thou encircle me around in the robe of thy righteousness?</i> [2 Nephi 4:33]<br><br>What powerful language is found in this prayer! Encircled around with robes of protective righteousness, we too can make our way forward on the straight path, praying the Lord will clear it and open his gates before us.<br><br>The conclusion of this chapter and of Nephi's prayer returns us to the theme of trust, with a commitment to continue to pray forever:<br><br><i>O Lord, I have trusted in thee, and I will trust in thee forever. I will not put my trust in the arm of flesh; for I know that cursed is he that putteth his trust ... in man or maketh flesh his arm.</i><br><br><i>Yea, I know that God will give liberally to him that asketh. Yea, my God will give me, if I ask not amiss; therefore I will lift up my voice unto thee; ... Behold, my voice shall forever ascend up unto thee, my rock and mine everlasting God. Amen.</i> [2 Nephi 4:34–35]<br><br>Clearly, Nephi had now come to a point of increased strength and determination. Following his teaching to "liken all scriptures unto [ourselves] ... for our profit and learning" (1 Nephi 19:23), I believe his experience provides a model, a pattern we can apply when we are discouraged or feel affliction or grief. If the enemy has us encompassed and we want to rejoice but cannot, we can<br><br>1. express delight in the things of the Lord and continually ponder our blessings,<br><br>2. recount how he has helped us in the past,<br><br>3. ask ourselves if we really want to linger in sorrow or despair,<br><br>4. direct and command our will and thoughts toward the Lord,<br><br>5. ask the Lord to clear the way before us, protect us, and deliver us from our enemies,<br><br>6. commit to him that we will trust him and raise our voices to him forever.<br><br>This chapter provides us great insight into the process of building our character and strengthening our faith. In it we can see the fulfillment of the Lord's promise that as we come unto the Savior, his ever-sufficient grace will transform our weaknesses into strengths (see Ether 12:27).<br><br>We can apply Nephi's pattern of reflection, leading us to determination, which then leads to affirmation and confirmation, promising God we will forever trust and praise him. Nephi, at great sacrifice, bent his will to align it with the will of the Lord. Should we not do the same? His constancy of mind and heart, his continual desire to focus and orient his life on the things of God, these are Christlike attributes that must become part of our character, keeping us straight in the plain road that leads--even ascends--home to God.<br><br>Regarding that great journey, Elder Neal A. Maxwell has observed:<br><br><i>The costs of discipleship are not paid just once ... at the front end and then all is done. The dues for discipleship continue ... on an ascending scale. ... There are ever so many reminders of the straight and narrow way that leads on and on after the entering of the first gate.</i><br><br><i>Of course, there is another gate--the final gate to Home. ... We are at best barely in the suburbs, and we still have miles to go.</i> [<i>Wherefore Ye Must Press Forward,</i> (Salt Lake City, Deseret Book, 1977), 32–33]<br><br>During the remainder of that journey we "will live in [a] wheat-and-tares situation" (Neal A. Maxwell, "Becometh As a Child," <i>Ensign,</i> May 1996, 68), causing many to despair. How must we live so as to identify and appreciate the things of the Lord, avoiding the things of the world that would rob us of our identity as a peculiar people? Paul's counsel to Titus seems particularly appropriate:<br><br><i>Denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present world;</i><br><br><i>Looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ;</i><br><br><i>Who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works.</i> [Titus 2:12–14]<br><br>Nephi's own counsel about traveling this path of life is also powerful: "Press forward with a steadfastness in Christ, having a perfect brightness of hope, and a love of God and of all men" (2 Nephi 31:20).<br><br>As one former church leader suggested, foster<br><br><i>within the fountains of your feelings" the spirit of truth; let "the work of improvement and reform ... extend through the entire circle of your being, let it reach every relationship in life, and every avocation and duty embraced within your existence.</i><br><br><i>Let it affect your thinking, and the feelings which you cultivate, and let there be nothing pertaining to your being but what shall be influenced by it.</i> [Amasa Lyman, in <i>JD</i> 3:177; 176]<br><br>When we do so, we can experience what Brigham Young called "a continual feast to the soul," given to those who "in the reflections and meditations of the mind" contemplate "the things of God and the rich treasures of infinite wisdom, which are opened to the children of men who obey the Gospel. ... They grow in grace, and in the knowledge of the truth as it is in Jesus Christ, until they see as they are seen, and know as they are known" (<i>JD</i> 1:234, 241).<br><br>How is it that we ever lose the Spirit? President John Taylor indicated:<br><br><i>We forget to pray and call upon God, and dedicate ourselves to him, or because we fall into transgression, commit iniquity, and lose the Spirit of God, and forget our calling's glorious hope; but if we could all the time see and realize and understand our true position before God, our minds would be continually on the stretch after the things of God, and we should be seeking to know all the day long, what we could do to promote the happiness and salvation of the world ... that when we stand before him, he may say to us, "well done thou good and faithful servant."</i> [In <i>Teachings of Presidents of the Church: John Taylor</i> (Salt Lake City: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 2001), 103–4]<br><br>This "[stretching] after the things of God," elevating our thoughts and dedicating ourselves to him, will help us out of our own valleys of sorrow. Next time you are discouraged, feeling all is lost, follow the pattern Nephi gave us. Recall your blessings. Focus your desires. Commit yourself to the Lord and ask him to clear the way before you. Pray to be encircled in the robe of his righteousness, and commit to continually lift up your voice to him.<br><br>Enduring on the straight path will bring us to a point where, one day, we, with a great multitude from all nations, will receive our own robes and palms in our hands (see Revelation 7:9). The question will be asked: "What are these which are arrayed in white robes? and whence came they?" And the answer will follow: "These are they which came out of great tribulation, and have washed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb" (Revelation 7:13, 14).<br><br>Then, dear sisters, along with Isaiah, we will loudly proclaim:<br><br><i>Behold, God is my salvation; I will trust, and not be afraid: for the Lord Jehovah is my strength and my song; he also is become my salvation.</i><br><br><i>Therefore with joy shall ye draw water out of the wells of salvation.</i> [Isaiah 12:2–3]<br><br><i>Stephen Jones was dean of the College of Fine Arts and Communications when he gave this Women's Conference address at Brigham Young University on 29 April 2004.</i><br><br><i>© Brigham Young University.

<h1> for Light Burdens but for Strong Backs - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I have prayed earnestly concerning the topic I have been asked to address--that we pray not for light burdens but for strong backs. I have come to understand that to honestly pray for a strong back is a very courageous thing to do. The spiritual exercise required is not an easy course, but the promised blessings make it worthy of our total commitment--whatever the cost.<br><br>I learned of the importance of a strong back when I was about ten years old.<br><br>In the summertime after we had put in a full day's work, my father would take me down to the Belly River near the edge of our small Canadian town, Glenwood, not far from the Alberta Temple in Cardston. There he taught me to swim. Not only to swim but also to eventually jump off the pier into the cold water and swim upstream against the current. It wasn't easy. It took a lot of courage and determination--yes, and a lot of encouragement from my dad. As I recall, the water was always cold and it seemed very swift to me. What made it possible was my father swimming along beside me. I can hear his voice in my mind even today: "You can make it. Keep going." By the end of the summer, my back was stronger from the consistent effort and constant encouragement. The water in the river had receded, and the swiftness of the current had subsided considerably--but only after I had learned the lesson. There must be opposition if we are to develop strength. The river had served the purpose my father had in mind.<br><br>Today we must be prepared to swim upstream against the current. We face tremendous opposition. President Hinckley recently spoke of the challenges we face:<br><br><i>In the Church we are working very hard to stem the tide of . . . evil. But it is an uphill battle, and we sometimes wonder whether we are making any headway. But we are succeeding in a substantial way. . . .</i><br><br><i>We must not give up. We must not become discouraged.</i> ["Standing Strong and Immovable," Worldwide Leadership Training Meeting, 10 January 2004 (Salt Lake City: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 2004), 20]<br><br>Sisters, we must be strong enough to take a stand, to defend our values, and courageous enough to speak up and speak out, to register our vote and stand firm for truth and righteousness under all circumstances. We are swimming upstream against a river of opposition. Our families need our constant encouragement, reassurance, love, and faith. We will never be given more than we can handle with the Lord's help.<br><br>When we pray for a strong back, we learn that it is through our covenants with the Lord that we are strengthened far beyond our natural ability. The testimony of President George Q. Cannon explains this relationship:<br><br><i>When we went forth into the waters of baptism and covenanted with our Father in heaven to serve Him and keep His commandments, He bound Himself also by covenant to us that He would never desert us, never leave us to ourselves, never forget us, that in the midst of trials and hardships, when everything was arrayed against us, He would be near unto us and would sustain us.</i> [<i>Gospel Truth: Discourses and Writings of President George Q. Cannon,</i> sel., arr., and ed. Jerreld L. Newquist (n.p.:<i> </i>Zion's Bookstore, 1957), 1:170]<br><br>Honoring our covenants is the only way to swim against the escalating opposition of our day. When we are baptized and confirmed members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, we are given the gift of the Holy Ghost. Each week we have the blessing and opportunity to strengthen our backs and fill our spiritual reservoir. We renew our covenants by partaking of the sacred emblems of the sacrament. We hear in our mind and heart the words of the covenant to "<i>always </i>remember him and keep his commandments" so we can "<i>always</i> have his Spirit to be with [us]" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/20.77?lang=eng#76">D&amp;amp;C 20:77</a>). This should be our most earnest desire. Nothing will prepare us to stand against the opposing forces like the blessing and power of the gift of the Holy Ghost.<br><br>The Holy Ghost is the messenger who provides personal revelation, communication, and connection with our Father in Heaven and our Savior, Jesus Christ. Suppose we were to make a pledge to do all within our power to keep the communication lines open. Suppose there were no compromise, no justification, and no excuse to tolerate any enticement of the world--in our entertainment or other activities--that would lessen the Spirit. Let us strive every day to avoid anything that could weaken our spirit and extinguish the light. Let us simply give it up, turn our backs, and walk away.<br><br>Elder David B. Haight helps us understand the strength that can be found in our temple covenants, not only for our backs but for every fiber of our soul. He says:<br><br><i>A temple is a place in which those whom </i>[God]<i> has chosen </i>[that's all of us]<i> are endowed with power from on high--a power which enables us to use our gifts and capabilities with greater intelligence and increased effectiveness in order to bring to pass our Heavenly Father's purposes in our own lives and the lives of those we love. . . .</i><br><br><i>Come to the temples worthily and regularly. . . . Freely partake of the promised personal revelation that may bless your life with power, knowledge, light, beauty, and truth from on high, which will guide you and your posterity to eternal life.</i> ["<a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/1992/04/come-to-the-house-of-the-lord?lang=eng">Come to the House of the Lord</a>," <i>Ensign,</i> May 1992, 15–16]<br><br>A very significant chapter in the Book of Mormon tells of Father Lehi explaining to his son Jacob the need for opposition. "For it must needs be, that there is an opposition in all things. If not, . . . righteousness could not be brought to pass" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/2.11?lang=eng#10">2 Nephi 2:11</a>). The very purpose of this life is for us to be tried and tested in preparation to receive all the blessings the Lord has promised those who love Him and keep the commandments (see <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/136.31?lang=eng#p30">D&amp;amp;C 136:31</a>).<br><br>We can expect trials and tribulation--they are an essential part of the great plan. Some we will experience because of our own mistakes--our sins--others merely as a part of living in mortality, and others because the Lord loves us and provides experiences that tend to our spiritual growth. "Whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/heb/12.6?lang=eng#p5">Hebrews 12:6</a>). It doesn't seem so hard once we understand the purpose for the trials. There are times when we must trust in the Lord with all our hearts even when we don't understand (see <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/prov/3.5?lang=eng#p4">Proverbs 3:5</a>).<br><br>As Elder Bruce Hafen teaches,<br><br><i>If you have problems in your life, don't assume there is something wrong with you. Struggling with those problems is at the very core of life's purpose. As we draw close to God, He will show us our weaknesses and through them make us wiser, stronger.</i> ["<a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2004/04/the-atonement-all-for-all?lang=eng">The Atonement: All for All</a>," <i>Ensign,</i> May 2004, 97]<br><br>Some years ago, Sister Jana Taylor, one of our faithful sister missionaries who committed to be totally obedient and strive to have the Spirit with her always, had some very difficult, discouraging, and challenging times--not unlike a typical mission. If one is committed to really make a difference, it seems the adversary is right there to increase the swiftness of the current, to increase the opposition that would, if possible, carry us downstream away from our goal. The last day before Sister Taylor was to return home from her mission, she stood before her peers to testify. She had a glow about her, a confidence different than when she arrived. "I'm thankful," she said, "for the challenges and the trials. I'm thankful for every single hard day." She paused, then added, "And every day was hard. If it hadn't been, I wouldn't be who I am now. I am not the same person I was when I came out." And because of those hard times she will never be the same person again. She had, as the scripture says, grown up in the Lord (see <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/109.15?lang=eng#p14">D&amp;amp;C 109:15</a>). And her growth will continue.<br><br>The writings of Orson F. Whitney help us understand the need for adversity:<br><br><i>No pain that we suffer, no trial that we experience is wasted. It ministers to our education, to the development of such qualities as patience, faith, fortitude and humility. All that we suffer and all that we endure, especially when we endure it patiently, builds up our characters, purifies our hearts, expands our souls, and makes us more tender and charitable, more worthy to be called the children of God. . . . And it is through sorrow and suffering, toil and tribulation, that we gain the education that we came here to acquire and which will make us more like our Father and Mother in heaven.</i> [Quoted in Spencer W. Kimball, <i><a href="https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/spencer-w-kimball_tragedy-destiny/">Tragedy or Destiny</a>,</i> Brigham Young University Speeches of the Year (6 December 1955), 6]<br><br>While serving in the Alberta Temple the past 3 years, I witnessed many people with strong backs. Some were stooped with age and others who had traveled long distances to enter into the walls of the temple. I'm not talking about the physical distance of miles or kilometers, but about the inward desire, about their priorities and commitment.<br><br>One day a young woman, Annae Jensen, came to the temple to receive her endowment. I could feel the radiance of her spirit. This young woman was born without any arms--nothing beyond her shoulders. However, it was almost as though she had lost awareness of her physical limitation and had been spiritually compensated.<br><br>Just this past month, my husband and I received a call from Annae and Garath Jones telling us of their blessing and excitement. I asked her for permission to share part of their story. They are expecting their first baby in just a few months--the beginning of their posterity. Into my mind I saw this faithful young mother without arms and thought of her desire to cradle and love this special little spirit.<br><br>I asked Annae, knowing she would respond positively, "How have you learned to handle the hard things in life?"<br><br>In her usual happy, upbeat tone, she said, "I just say, 'Heavenly Father, what am I supposed to learn from this?' And if I don't learn it, I've missed an opportunity." While Annae is without arms, her back is strong. She has developed spirituality under what would appear to be adversity. There is no question--that baby will be enshrouded with its mother's love.<br><br>We have many examples in the Book of Mormon that show us how the Lord intervenes when we turn to Him and how trials and tribulation turn to our good. When Alma and his people were being persecuted by Amulon--the leader of the priests of the wicked King Noah--they began to pray "mightily to God" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/24.10?lang=eng#p9">Mosiah 24:10</a>). The voice of the Lord came to the people of Alma, just as it will come to us. The Lord said, "I know of the covenant which ye have made unto me; and I will covenant with my people and deliver them out of bondage" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/24.13?lang=eng#p12">Mosiah 24:13</a>).<br><br>From this record we learn several very significant lessons. The steps toward the complete delivery from bondage did not happen all at once. Alma's people were told that the Lord would first ease the burdens on their backs, even to the extent that they wouldn't even be able to feel them. The Lord did not take them away completely. There was a reason. It would not have allowed for the growth that took place as they learned to trust in Him. The Lord explained this when He said, "This will I do that ye may stand as witnesses for me hereafter, and that ye may know of a surety that I, the Lord God, do visit my people in their afflictions" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/24.14?lang=eng#p13">Mosiah 24:14</a>). Learning to carry the burden with ease allowed them to testify from personal experience that the Lord does watch over us in our adversities.<br><br>We can follow these steps as we apply the pattern in our own lives.<br><br><i>And now it came to pass that the burdens which were laid upon Alma and his brethren were made light; yea, the Lord did strengthen them that they could bear up their burdens with ease, and they did submit cheerfully and with patience to all the will of the Lord</i>. [<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/24.15?lang=eng#p14">Mosiah 24:15</a>]<br><br>And the lesson continues. Because of their great faith and patience through their trials, the Lord spoke to them again. He would not only ease their burdens, but as He had promised in the beginning, He would deliver them. "Be of good comfort," He said, "for on the morrow I will deliver you out of bondage" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/24.16?lang=eng#p15">Mosiah 24:16</a>).<br><br>We know about our Savior, but it is often in our adversities that we truly find Him and know Him and love Him. In our times of trial, if we turn to Him, the Spirit bears witness that our Savior not only can, but will, ease our burdens. I can testify from my own experience in life, that some of our heaviest burdens, disappointments, and heartaches can in time be replaced with "the peace of God, which passeth all understanding" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/philip/4.7?lang=eng#6">Phillipians 4:7</a>) while "we wait upon the Lord" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/isa/40.31?lang=eng#p30">Isaiah 40:31</a>).<br><br>In the words of Elder Neal A. Maxwell, we read,<br><br><i>We can say: "I know that [God] loveth his children; nevertheless, I do not know the meaning of all things" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/11.17?lang=eng#p16">1 Nephi 11:17</a>.)</i><br><br><i>There have been and will be times in each of our lives when such faith must be the bottom line: We don't know what is happening to us or around us, but we know that God loves us, and knowing that, for the moment, is enough.</i> [<i>Not My Will, But Thine</i> (Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1988), 119]<br><br>Sisters, we have a work to do. Our trials and tests are an important part of our preparation. The Lord is counting on us.<br><br>Now let us consider the possibility of burdens on our backs of our own making. Some would think that by filling up their daily planners with activities, events, and lists of good things to do, it defines them as being successful. But the burden slowly gets heavier and heavier, and without noticing it, they are in danger of being hunched over with osteoporosis. "Oh my aching back" or "My back is breaking" might be the shout for relief at such times.<br><br>President Kimball's statement about life invites some thoughtful contemplation. He says, "Since immortality and eternal life constitute the sole purpose of life, all other interests and activities are but incidental thereto" (<i>The Miracle of Forgiveness</i> [Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1969], 2). Now does that suggest there should be no time for fun, sports, scrapbooking--yes, shopping--and fancy parties? Of course not! We need to make time to do other worthwhile things, as long as they do not distract from what matters most, the very purpose of life.<br><br>Deciding what we really want is a very significant and powerful tool. It gives us a sense of being in control of our life, rather than being controlled. You see, the feeling of being controlled, or being out of control, is contrary to our divine nature. We cannot feel the Spirit or the peace and joy of each day when we are burdened beyond our ability to handle it all. I believe that if it were possible, the adversary would keep us busily engaged in a multitude of good things in an effort to distract us from the few vital things that make all the difference.<br><br>Now this task of cutting back on some of our activities is really the hard part. It may seem as painful as cutting off an arm or a leg. It requires determination. Pruning is hard. It can come only after pondering and praying to know what we're willing to cut out to provide more time for what we really desire. I love Michael McLean's song "Hold On, the Light Will Come." As we look at our busy lives, we might sing, "Let go of some things so the light can come."<br><br>In the Book of Mormon, the writings of Zenos teach us the need for pruning, cutting back, and thinning the branches. The Lord of the vineyard looks at his dying trees and says to the dedicated servant what we might say when we have concerns for the welfare of our family: "What could I have done more in my vineyard? Have I slackened my hand, that I have not nourished it? Nay, I have nourished it, and I have digged about it" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/jacob/5.47?lang=eng#p46">Jacob 5:47</a>). We might echo his lamentation, saying, "I've worked all day long, even into the night. What else might I have done?" (see <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/jacob/5.47,49?lang=eng#p46">Jacob 5:47, 49</a>). Sound familiar? It sounds like complete dedication doesn't it? The servant then explains the problem. It wasn't a lack of dedication or hard work. The branches of the tree--like our overcrowded lives--had "overcome the roots," or grown faster than the roots, "taking strength unto themselves" and leaving the roots undernourished (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/jacob/5.48?lang=eng#p47">Jacob 5:48</a>). We are not left to wonder what nourishes our own roots. It is time spent together. It is in following the words of the prophet--including the guidance given in "<a href="https://www.lds.org/topics/family-proclamation?lang=eng&amp;amp;old=true">The Family: A Proclamation to the World</a>."<br><br>The first responsibility to ease the burden on our backs rests with us. We must take time to <i>ponder,</i> to <i>pray,</i> and to <i>prune.</i> Perhaps it would be a good idea to ponder the question Nephi was asked when he was swept away by the Spirit in chapter 11 of 1 Nephi. We learn that Nephi must have spent some time thinking and pondering when the Spirit said to him, "What desirest thou?" Nephi was prepared with an answer. If we were asked in answer to our prayers, "What desirest thou?" would we be ready with an answer? Do we know what it is we really want? Not only what we want, but more importantly, what we want to have happen and why?<br><br>I can hear one of my darling nieces say something like, "What I most desire is to make it through the whole day without being impatient or raising my voice. Or just to catch my breath for a few moments before the troops come home. Or just to feel loved, appreciated, and in control." Certainly those desires are reasonable and real, but when time is provided to get an eternal perspective and see beyond the urgencies of the day, our perspective changes. We are willing, even anxious, to do some pruning, some cutting back if that would provide more time for the things we most desire.<br><br>I have been impressed with the moving account of Emma Smith's most earnest desires at a very challenging time in her life. We read of when her husband decided to return to Carthage:<br><br><i>Emma asked [him] to give her a blessing. The Prophet told her to write the best blessing she could desire. He promised her that upon his return, he would sign it for her.</i> [In <i>Relief Society Courses of Study, 1985</i> (Salt Lake City: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 1984), 199]<br><br>That tells us something about the confidence the Prophet had in the desires of Emma's heart. He never returned from Carthage. But we have a record of her desires at that fateful time in her life. She wrote nine things she most desired. The first sentence used the words "I . . . crave," and the following nine "I desire." I would like to share with you her first and last statements:<br><br><i>First of all that I would crave as the richest of heaven's blessings would be wisdom from my Heavenly Father bestowed daily, so that whatever I might do or say, I could not look back at the close of the day with regret, nor neglect the performance of any act that would bring a blessing.</i><br><br>She completed her list of ten with this statement: "Finally, I desire that whatever may be my lot through life I may be enabled to acknowledge the hand of God in all things" (in <i>Relief Society Courses of Study 1985,</i> 199). Under the most severe testing during that crucial time in the history of the Church, Emma Smith's desires tells us something of the strength of her back.<br><br>There are courageous women among us today and those who will follow after us when we do our part. In the poetic words of a Mormon pioneer, Vilate C. Raile, we see this legacy of faith passed from one generation to the next.<br><br><i>They cut desire into short lengths</i><br><br><i>And fed it to the hungry fire of courage,</i><br><br><i>Long after--when the flames died--</i><br><br><i>Molten gold gleamed in the ashes.</i><br><br><i>They gathered it into bruised palms</i><br><br><i>And handed it to their children</i><br><br><i>And their children's children.</i><br><br>[Cited in Asahel D. Woodruff, <i>Parent and Youth</i> (Salt Lake City: Deseret Sunday School Union Board, 1971), 124]<br><br>Sisters, we are on the Lord's errand. We can have His Spirit to be with us always, with angels round about us to bear us up. Today I pay tribute to my great-grandmother Susan Kent Greene and her unwavering testimony.<br><br>In 1835 Susan married Evan M. Greene and soon after went to Kirtland to live. They were among the first of the Mormon fugitives at Mount Pisgah, Iowa, in the early spring of 1846. We read,<br><br><i>As soon as Evan pitched the tent he left his wife and their little ones while he went with his team and wagon to aid in bringing forward some of the saints who were without means of their own. Unfortunately for Susan she had no near neighbors. Almost as soon as her husband had gone the eleven-month old baby became ill. The baby rapidly grew worse, and after a few days died in its mother's arms. This occurred on a dark and stormy night accompanied by loud thunderbolts and vivid lightening flashes. All she could do was to pray that the Lord would not forsake her, but would send someone to help her, which prayer was answered. A young man came to the door and spoke words of pity and comfort. In the morning he made a coffin and dug a grave for the baby and buried it. Susan had to prepare the little body for its last rest, herself.</i> [Lula Greene Richards, "Life Sketch of Susan Kent Greene," typescript, in author's possession]<br><br>This was only the beginning of the tests that were to follow.<br><br>Evan and Susan arrived in Utah, having endured much, she wrote the following on the first page of her journal dated February 3, 1875:<br><br><i>I make this covenant to do the very best I can, asking God for wisdom to direct me in that I may walk with Him in all righteousness and truth. I much desire to be pure in heart that I may see God. Help me, Lord, to overcome all evil with good. Signed: Susan K. Green.</i><br><br><i>This covenant with the writings on this page is written with my blood and I have not broken my covenant and trust shall not. Signed: Susan K. Greene.</i> [Quoted in Ardeth Greene Kapp, "'I Shall Know They Are True': Susan Kent Greene," in <i>Heroines of the Restoration,</i> ed. Barbara B. Smith and Blythe Darlyn Thatcher (Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1999), 87–88]<br><br>I look forward to one day meeting my great-grandmother and pray that I can tell her that I have followed her path and kept the faith and all of the covenants.<br><br>With an understanding of the purpose of life, of our promised blessings as women of the covenant, and of the need for opposition, let us be grateful that God allows us to struggle, to cry, and to feel pain. Else how could we comfort others in their tribulation? (See <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/2-cor/1.6?lang=eng#p5">2 Corinthians 1:6</a>.)<br><br>Let us be grateful to know about hurt and healing. Else how could we know the Healer, the Great Physician, who invites us to come unto Him and be healed? (See <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/42.48?lang=eng#p47">D&amp;amp;C 42:48</a>.)<br><br>Let us be grateful to know about fear and faith. Else how would we recognize the light of faith after the dark night of fear? (See <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/6.36?lang=eng#p35">D&amp;amp;C 6:36</a>.)<br><br>Let us be grateful to know about discouragement and encouragement. Else how could we reach out and take another's hand in empathy, understanding, and love? (See <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/john/13.34?lang=eng#p33">John 13:34</a>.)<br><br>Let us be grateful to know about offenses and forgiveness. Else how could we ever begin to appreciate the Atonement? (See <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/7.11?lang=eng#p10">Alma 7:11</a>.)<br><br>Let us be grateful for His infinite love and hear in our minds and hearts His words of comfort: "What I say unto one I say unto all, be of good cheer, little children; for I am in your midst, and I have not forsaken you" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/61.36?lang=eng#p35">D&amp;amp;C 61:36</a>).<br><br>I testify that in those difficult times, when our crosses seem unbearable, He who carried the cross for all of us--our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ--will sustain us, be with us, and will be the strength in our backs when we turn to Him in earnest and fervent, sincere and humble prayer.<br><br><i>Ardeth G.

<h1>he Divine Roles of Men and Women - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I appreciate very much the opportunity to participate in this session with my wife, Sharon, who always does so well in expressing her, and our, thoughts. Her counsel is most appreciated because some of her best perceptions, while usually complementary, are often different than my own. Thus, while we enjoy doing much together, we have learned that some differences can be enriching and very helpful, rather than competitive or conflicting. Largely because of my career and callings, we have also learned to do some things on our own without feeling any minimization of our love or relationship. This is clearly a matter of attitude and choice. Let me give you just one example. Years ago when I had regular responsibility for groups of medical students, I would ask Sharon to speak to their spouses. She did a wonderful job, as she has today, and her counsel always seemed to be very helpful. In fact, on occasion I still have these former student families mention how helpful her advice and example have been.<br><br>She would say something to the effect that being married will either make you a better or worse student, and it depends on your attitude. She would also say that the potential opportunities and traumas of school and training could be either joyful or depressing. One frequent example was that if you are focused on how terrible and lonely it is to be alone (and young doctor's spouses are alone a lot!), then you will often be sad. On the other hand, if you choose to focus on how wonderful it is to have some time together and not really expect that you will have too much or that it will occur too often, then those moments, however few, can be most joyful. I can report that her reactions to me over almost forty years have almost always been positive but also always truthful!<br><br>Even bad news or difficult counsel is better received in an atmosphere of optimism and positivity. Necessary changes and adjustments will lead to more joyful living in a generally happy environment when it is nonthreatening and supportive.<br><br>Our family has had wonderful and touching experiences at Martin's Cove and traveling over Rocky Ridge. These gave us much more insight into our responsibilities and opportunities to find joy even in the face of almost overwhelming adversity. It also gave us renewed and enhanced appreciation for courageous ancestors who traveled with handcarts, wagons, and on foot, as well as other pioneer Church members who understood the principles of real joy in the face of the daunting disappointments and challenges of mortality.<br><br>This trip also demonstrated for me again the principle that those of us who are married can find joy and satisfaction in doing things together even when we might contribute in different ways or see some of the particulars with divergent perspectives. As we went over Rocky Ridge in our aged family vacation vehicle, I took great pleasure in the capacity of our 4-wheel drive to navigate up and over the very rough terrain. Sharon took equal pleasure in carefully and frequently directing and correcting my driving.<br><br>We have done other things together--differently. When we built our home thirty years ago, I delighted in drawing plans, pouring concrete, framing, and doing other carpentry work. Sharon used her talents in selecting and staining much of the finish woodwork and cabinetry. I enjoyed calculating the electrical circuits and stringing the wires, and she assumed the heavy task of choosing the light fixtures and other finishes and furnishings. She was wise enough not to counsel me much about the sizes or routes of the plumbing pipes, and I happily left to her entirely the choice of basins and sinks.<br><br>We even have gardened together over the years. Sharon has a green thumb, and I have green stains on the knees of my jeans. She knows for sure what shrubs to plant and where, and I know how to dig the holes the right depth! I installed the sprinkler system, but she is the one who understands the timer and when the water should come on and go off. We have even found joy in gourmet cooking! Sharon prepares it with great enthusiasm, and I, with equal glee, eat it. This could go on and on, but I think you get the point. We enjoy being together and also enjoy our differences, which we believe are real but also are compatible and complementary. Thus we, with you, can understand the doctrinal and scriptural basis, as well as the experiential, for finding joy in the God-ordained differences between men and women, husband and wife.<br><br>It does seem important to understand that within the framework of the gospel, which includes the priesthood and sacred roles unique to women and men, considerable room exists for individual choice and preference as well as capacity to adapt to necessary personal and family circumstances. For example, I know devoted and exemplary Latter-day Saint women who are able to hang sheetrock, lay beautiful wood flooring, and program their VCRs! Likewise, I know a wonderful priesthood leader, father, and patriarch who enjoys knitting. I have never felt that a man who can sew on a button, iron a shirt, or run a vacuum cleaner is demeaned in any way.<br><br>Understanding these joyful differences is also possible and necessary for those without companions or those yet to be married. Again, the combinations of preference and necessity are given great latitude in God's plan for His children when we understand who we really are.<br><br>These significant but wonderful differences also apply in our Church assignments and experiences. Think of bishops and Relief Society presidents as they attend to the welfare needs of their wards. Neither has the experience nor the insights possessed by his or her counterpart, and both are necessary to bless the members to the fullest. Likewise, we see the wisdom in Heavenly Father's plan, which provides the optimal situation for rearing children under the loving stewardship of both a faithful mother and father who complement and support each other in their unique responsibilities. Gratefully, provisions are often made to compensate when the ideal does not occur or is interrupted. Sadly, in the world today, there are those voices who suggest that the ideal is not possible and also that it is not desirable. More than ever before, we need to understand that the unique roles of women and men are both necessary and joyful.<br><br>In our current world, where religion and devotion to God are often thought, if considered at all, to be synonymous with sacrifice and stultifying sobriety, restrictions and restraints, one of the most stunning doctrinal assertions of the Restoration is that "men [and women] are, that they might have joy" (2 Nephi 2:25). What is this joy and how are we to obtain it?<br><br>I believe most of us would not be surprised by a dictionary definition of joy. One of the best describes joy as a feeling of happiness (or contentment) that comes from success, good fortune, or a sense of well-being (<i>The Merriam-Webster Dictionary</i>, 1974, s.v. "joy"). Sadly, none of the dictionaries with which I am familiar seeks to identify the real source of real joy. There are additional words that others may consider to be synonyms but that might not quite match the mark from our perspective. Examples include words like pleasure, fun, gratification, and the like.<br><br>The scriptures use a phrase--<i>a fulness of joy</i>--that provides clarifying and useful insights. Some general and doctrinal principles seem evident that we might apply to our consideration of finding joy in our unique roles as women and men. Let me mention a few.<br><br>The Psalmist said, "In thy presence [meaning the Lord's] is fulness of joy" (Psalm 16:11). A definition of the fulness of joy, then, is being in the presence of the Father and the Son and the promise of the scriptures to us is that we were created to be able to return to them and experience this fulness of joy. Fundamental to the entire plan of salvation is that we might achieve joy--real joy--and experience it in its fulness.<br><br>Jesus Himself adds assurance and clarity. As He taught the Three Nephites, who desired to remain on earth until the Second Coming, He commended them for their desires to "bring the souls of men unto me." He also explained, "For this cause ye shall have fulness of joy; and ye shall sit down in the kingdom of my Father; yea, your joy shall be full, even as the Father hath given me fulness of joy; and ye shall be even as I am, and I am even as the Father; and the Father and I are one" (3 Nephi 28:9–10). The fulness of joy includes not only proximity or propinquity with Deity, it means a oneness with the Father and Son. What a distance in time, place, attitude, and behavior we have yet to go to truly have and experience a fulness of joy!<br><br>Through the Prophet Joseph, we receive some additional understanding and clarification that shed light on the essentiality of the Resurrection and its relationship to our potential joy. We are dual beings. Our spirits have existed for a very long time, long before we came to earth in mortality. Our bodies, essential to our progression and return to the Father and the Son, are made of the "elements." When our bodies and spirits are separated, we cannot receive a fulness of joy, but when our spirits and bodies are "inseparably connected," or we are resurrected, we can "receive a fulness of joy" if we have otherwise qualified (D&amp;amp;C 93:33–34). Thus, the Atonement is key and even more magnificent when we consider it is really about making a fulness of joy possible for us.<br><br>Special Enoch, blessed of the Lord with uncommon and most sacred insights because of his remarkable goodness and almost limitless faith, was privileged to be a witness of a panorama of the plan of salvation from the beginning to the end. Enoch "received a fulness of joy" (Moses 7:67) as he and his people "walked with God" (Moses 7:69) and were taken into His presence.<br><br>Clearly, then, joy means more to us than momentary comfort, no matter how comfortable we are or may be! When we understand the basic and broader dimensions of joy, pleasure must be seen in context. Proximate gratifications are often antithetical to real, lasting joy that leads us to a fulness.<br><br>One of the wonders of joy is that it can be limitless in the sense that one person's fulness does not subtract from another's. In fact, as we were reminded in the examples of Enoch and the Three Nephites, they received a fulness of joy in large part because of their exemplary efforts to bring a fulness of joy to others. Just as Jesus models His love for us by what He has done and continues to do for us, so must we be what we should and do what we must for others to truly achieve the joy that is fully possible for all of us. Think of these encouraging words of the Redeemer as He expresses His love in the context of His instruction: "If ye keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love; even as I have kept my Father's commandments, and abide in his love. These things have I spoken unto you, that my joy might remain in you, and that your joy might be full" (John 15:10–11). Jesus has joy, and He wants us to have His joy remain with us--to feel it, savor it, experience it, and share it--all to the effect that our "joy might be full."<br><br>What are some other applications of the doctrine of joy that we might consider in our special, unique, and God-given roles as women and men? We know that our individual identities are neither accidental nor unknown to God. Further, our mortal circumstances are a constellation of challenges that may share commonalities with others and also unexpected dimensions unique to ourselves. While we are hopefully willing to acknowledge absolute fairness in the overall plan, most feel at least sometimes, often with apparently good reason, that in the fine print of our lives stark unevenness occurs in advantages and blessings, disappointments and difficulties.<br><br>In addition to issues such as health, prosperity, geography, and opportunity, special challenges may occur in matters pertaining to the most significant parts of the plan designed to lead us to a fulness of joy. In spite of best efforts and intentions, some do not have eternal companions or children. Some have horrible difficulties in family relationships that make a future fulness of joy seem so remote as to be inconceivable. Physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual challenges vex the afflicted and those who love them. You can add many more seeming limitations, but to all--everyone--is the promise that the Savior's Atonement can fully apply to them and that a fulness of joy is eventually possible for everyone, save those relatively few who have consciously chosen to reject the Redeemer's gift. Nephi understood this principle as he explained the clear urgency of his own efforts: "For we labor diligently to write, to persuade our children, and also our brethren, to believe in Christ, and to be reconciled to God; for we know that it is by grace that we are saved, after all we can do" (2 Nephi 25:23).<br><br>Our Father in Heaven and Jesus Christ make our personal salvation and exaltation with a fulness of joy possible by their grace through the Savior's Atonement, "after all we can do," whatever our limitations. Gratefully, the compensations of the eternities equalize the limitations of mortality when we do what we should and can. While some apparent deficiencies or handicaps are more obvious than others, we all have them to such a significant degree that a large measure of meekness and humility, in addition to unbounded gratitude and faith, should be pervasive in us.<br><br>For those of us who are married or who will have the privilege of marriage in this life, the Preacher in Ecclesiastes gives some good counsel in which, incidentally, is couched a significant promise or insight: "Live joyfully with the wife [or husband] whom thou lovest all the days of the life . . . which he [meaning God] hath given thee" (Ecclesiastes 9:9). I admit I do not know exactly how it is that the Lord gives husbands to wives and wives to husbands, except in the temple sealing ordinance. I have, like you, watched the matchmaking process all of my life. I do not believe God makes our choices for us, nor do I believe that He will instantaneously remodel any of us or our mates into that person we fantasized that we would be or marry before we got down to the practical issues at hand. He does help us with attractions, hormones, and opportunities; hopefully, the positive examples of parents, other loved ones, and leaders and, most significantly, the promptings of the Holy Ghost can assist us regarding when to proceed and when to back away. I do know that marriage is sacred, vital to God's plan and essential to an eventual true fulness of joy in the eternities. Happily, whatever our current circumstances, we are assured that "all things must come to pass in their time" (D&amp;amp;C 64:32).<br><br>When we keep in mind what it really means to live joyfully, we will understand that marriage means much more than we or others may have supposed. It is not just a useful or pleasant or convenient arrangement between two people who enjoy being together and who have genuine affection and concern for each other, as significant as this may be. It is, as described in "The Family: A Proclamation to the World," that marriage is "ordained of God" and vital to the eventual achievement of a fulness of joy (<i>Ensign,</i> November 1985, 102). Anything, however seemingly attractive, pleasant, or useful, that detracts, delays, or derails the pursuit of a fulness of joy must be avoided or discarded if the antonyms of true joy are not to be achieved.<br><br>Should we be surprised that so many are apparently confused about these issues or that there is so much effort being made by some to distract people from the path to a fulness of joy? I think not. These dynamics have been in operation for a long, long time and have had an impact on God's children ever since Lucifer was expelled for his rebellion and began his campaign to make as many others as possible "miserable like unto himself" (2 Nephi 2:27).<br><br>Listen to these words of Lehi to Jacob:<br><br><i>For it must needs be, that there is an opposition in all things. If not so, . . . righteousness could not be brought to pass, neither wickedness, neither holiness nor misery, neither good nor bad. . . .</i><br><br><i>And if ye shall say there is no law, ye shall also say there is no sin. If ye shall say there is no sin, ye shall also say there is no righteousness. And if there be no righteousness there be no happiness. And if there be no righteousness nor happiness there be no punishment nor misery. And if these things are not there is no God. And if there is no God we are not, neither the earth; for there could have been no creation of things, neither to act nor to be acted upon; wherefore, all things must have vanished away. . . .</i><br><br><i>Wherefore, the Lord God gave unto man that he should act for himself. Wherefore, man could not act for himself save it should be that he was enticed by the one or the other.</i> [2 Nephi 2:11, 13, 16]<br><br>Clearly, the obtaining of a fulness of joy is not easy work nor an activity for the fainthearted woman or man! Opposition is an essential part of the plan, but so too is the magnificent gift of moral agency. Elder Neal A. Maxwell taught beautifully in a recent BYU devotional that agency is among the greatest blessings a loving Heavenly Father has bestowed upon His children, but it is also unavoidably accompanied by great responsibility. Wonderfully, we can choose to be joyful now and achieve a fulness of joy in the eternities.<br><br>Often we hear those making poor choices in their lives say, "I'm only hurting myself." That is such a great lie that even the adversary should blush, were he able to do so. What we do individually, and this is particularly true in families, has an impact upon those around us to a great degree, whether it be positive or negative. If my path is not leading to a fulness of joy, these nearest and dearest of necessity have their own joy and future possibilities severely impacted negatively.<br><br>Little wonder then that this simple but carefully targeted sentence from 3 John resonates so clearly with those who are beginning to understand what the business of joy is really all about: "I have no greater joy than to hear that my children walk in truth" (3 John 1:4). Likewise, we should experience little surprise when we discover that prophets like Lehi, King Benjamin, and Alma have recognized that their first duties were to their families or that others like the Prophet Joseph and his closest associates have been reproved by the Lord when they were distracted away from family responsibilities by even very important considerations. (See D&amp;amp;C 93:40–48.)<br><br>While we may all be very familiar with these scriptural references, there is a verse following the counsel and rebuke to Joseph Smith that we may usually ignore: "What I say unto one I say unto all; pray always lest that wicked one have power in you, and remove you out of your place" (D&amp;amp;C 93:49). Our place in the Church or in the world can be in jeopardy, but also, and especially, our place in the only precincts where a "fulness of joy" can be experienced.<br><br>Emma Smith learned some important things when Doctrine and Covenants section 25 was given, but I suspect that Joseph, her husband, did also! I used to believe the words "this is my voice unto all," which conclude this section, were to all women or sisters (D&amp;amp;C 25:16). As has often been the case, my view was too constricted. I believe now that it also applies to me and to all men as well as to all women. This section is fully inclusive in its basic message, even in the face of some important details included for Emma alone. I believe that it has some truths or secrets, which if understood and applied, will help us all live more joyfully. Let me mention a few of these. I invite your careful study of these verses, and you will find others.<br><br>First, Emma and the rest of us are daughters and sons of God. We need to be very careful about whose relatives we offend!<br><br>Second, if we are faithful and "walk in the paths of virtue" (D&amp;amp;C 25:2), our lives will be preserved and we will receive a fulness of joy. This does not tell us how long we will dwell in mortality. It does promise our outcome if we live as we should.<br><br>Third, our sins can be forgiven. Each of you sisters, like Emma, can be an "elect lady" (D&amp;amp;C 25:3).<br><br>Fourth, the Lord is free with His counsel to bless us if we will listen. Here are two concrete examples that may apply more broadly than just to Emma Smith:<br><br><i>Murmur not because of the things which thou has not seen, for they are withheld from thee and from the world, which is wisdom in me in a time to come.</i><br><br><i>And the office of thy calling shall be for a comfort unto . . . thy husband </i>[or wife],<i> in his </i>[or her]<i> afflictions, with consoling words, in the spirit of meekness.</i> [D&amp;amp;C 25:4–5]<br><br>Fifth, if we are called to teach or serve, we can be set apart and use the scriptures effectively as directed by the Spirit. The best teachers in the home are almost always the mothers--both because of their special endowment as mothers and because they get of necessity the most constant practice! It is also true in my experience that often the best instructors in the ward or branch are the women, whether in the Gospel Doctrine class or in the Primary. For this reason, the Lord has emphasized that for all of us, but especially for women, "thy time shall be given . . . to learning much" (D&amp;amp;C 25:8). This learning does not exclude the scriptures!<br><br>Interestingly, as the Lord gives assurance and guidance to the sisters and wives, he also gives direction to husbands--not just prophets or bishops--but to all men and husbands: "And thou needest not fear, for thy husband shall support thee" (D&amp;amp;C 25:9).<br><br>Some of the particulars mentioned in this verse apply to the Prophet Joseph, but the direction that husbands need to support their wives is very clear, whatever the unique personal circumstances: "And verily I say unto thee that thou shalt lay aside the things of this world, and seek for the things of a better" (D&amp;amp;C 25:10).<br><br>"Things of a better." Does that sound like a fulness of joy?<br><br>I hope that each of us can understand a little better and a little clearer both the possibilities and the promises that lead to a fulness of joy. Joyful living in the here and now is an important antecedent to the complete joy that we know can be ours in the eternities, which is made possible by the presence with us of our families in the company of the Father and the Son. Let me conclude by reading the summary counsel and promises to each of us from section 25:<br><br><i>Wherefore, lift up thy heart and rejoice, and cleave unto the covenants which thou hast made.</i><br><br><i>Continue in the spirit of meekness, and beware of pride. Let thy soul delight in thy husband, and the glory which shall come upon him.</i><br><br><i>Keep my commandments continually, and a crown of righteousness thou shalt receive. And except thou do this, where I am you cannot come.</i> [D&amp;amp;C 25:13–15]<br><br>It is my conviction and testimony that of what I have spoken is true. I invoke the blessings of heaven upon us all that we might find joy in our sacred roles as women and men and achieve the fulness of joy that the Father has promised His faithful children. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Cecil O.

<i>Do you know who you are, little child of mine,</i><br><i>So precious and dear to me?</i><br><i>Do you know you're a part of a great design</i><br><i>That is vast as eternity?</i><br><br><i>Can you think for a moment how much depends</i><br><i>On your holding the "Iron Rod"?</i><br><i>Your life is forever--worlds without end--</i><br><i>Do you know you're a child of God?</i><br><br><i>Do you know where you've been, little child of mine?</i><br><i>It is hard to recall, I know;</i><br><i>Do you ever remember that Home Divine--</i><br><i>With the</i>[Parents who loved]<i>you so?</i><br>["To a Child," by Ora Pate Stewart, (Provo, UT: Fernwood, 1964)]<br><br>These lyrics from the song "To a Child," by Ora Pate Stewart, always bring the Lord's Spirit to me.<br><br>My husband and I had been married for nine years when we heard these words from the doctor: "You are not going to keep this one."<br><br>As parents we looked at the wee baby who so recently had left his heavenly home. We did the only thing we could do. He was named and given a father's blessing. We prayed, had faith, and said aloud, "Thy will be done." Hours passed, and then days, in our very small community hospital. Doctors and nurses continued to work with our son. At last, we heard the words from the doctor, "I believe you will keep this one." During this experience, we as parents grew in understanding and strength and drew closer to the Lord.<br><br>In a much larger hospital thirteen years later, this exact experience was repeated with our tenth child. He was named and given a father's blessing. We prayed, had faith, and once again said aloud, "Thy will be done." Hours crept slowly by. Once again we were greatly blessed. He would live. The lessons learned years before had been repeated. Soon President Packer, then an Assistant to the Twelve, was able to catch a flight for a delayed assignment in Europe.<br><br>This second time our children were older. We reinforced our teaching of the Father's plan, the Atonement, and the Godhead. In teaching our children we also learned the basic principles of the gospel ourselves. Teaching and growth never end with children or parents.<br><br>Sometimes I get a telephone call from one of our children. They need help or they express concern about an overwhelming new church calling. Other times they just call to report in. The boys "call home" to their father to get advice on practical and spiritual matters. "Calling home" is an important part of our family. "Calling home" through prayer to our Heavenly Father is a necessity. We need His help and comfort and blessing.<br><br>Sister Freda Johanna Jensen Lee, wife of President Harold B. Lee, would say, "My first good morning is to the Lord, and my last goodnight is to the Lord." I know she was right.<br><br>We can't go too far astray if we, on bended knee, place a call to our Heavenly Father's home twice a day. We will receive the expected help, assurance, and peace of mind.<br><br>Some years ago two of our little boys were wrestling on the rug before the fireplace. They had reached the pitch where laughter turns to tears and play becomes a struggle. My husband worked his foot gently between them and lifted the older, four-year-old boy to a sitting position on the rug, saying, "Hey there, you monkey! You had better settle down."<br><br>The little child folded his arms and looked at his father with surprising seriousness. His little-boy feelings were hurt, and he protested, "I not a monkey, Daddy--I a person." And indeed he was a person, a child of God loaned to us for a short time, and then he would be on his own. (See Boyd K. Packer,<i>The Shield of Faith</i>[Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1998], 27.)<br><br>"The Family: A Proclamation to the World" is akin to scripture. Today I will read only two paragraphs:<br><br><i>All human beings--male and female--are created in the image of God. Each is a beloved spirit son or daughter of heavenly parents, and, as such, each has a divine nature and destiny. Gender is an essential characteristic of individual premortal, mortal, and eternal identity and purpose.</i><br><br><i>In the premortal realm, spirit sons and daughters knew and worshiped God as their Eternal Father and accepted His plan by which His children could obtain a physical body and gain earthly experience to progress toward perfection and ultimately realize his or her divine destiny as an heir of eternal life. The divine plan of happiness enables family relationships to be perpetuated beyond the grave. Sacred ordinances and covenants available in holy temples make it possible for individuals to return to the presence of God and for families to be united eternally.</i>["The Family: A Proclamation to the World,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 1995, 102]<br><br>In an address at a general Relief Society conference, President J. Reuben Clark Jr. said:<br><br><i>Eve came to build, to organize, through the power of the Father, the bodies of mortal men, . . . so that God's design and the Great Plan might meet fruition.</i><br><br><i>This was her calling; this was her blessing, bestowed by the Priesthood. This is the place of our wives and of our mothers in the Eternal Plan. . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . Mother guides, incites, entreats, instructs, directs . . . the soul for which she built the earthly home, in its march onward to exaltation. God gives the soul its destiny, but mother leads it along the way.</i>["Our Wives and Our Mothers in the Eternal Plan,"<i>The Relief Society Magazine,</i>vol. 33 no. 12 (December 1946), 800-01, 803]<br><br>The vision of what is expected in earth life can be obtained through scripture study, words of the prophets, pondering "The Family: A Proclamation to the World." With the inspiration of the Holy Ghost, we can understand these things. We can understand the past, focus on the present, and see into the future. Work and service are requirements throughout our lifetime.<br><br>The gospel of Jesus Christ gives answers to questions that all mankind ponders. These concepts are taught nowhere else in the world. President Packer has said:<br><br><i>There are so many unanswered questions. Why the inequities in life?</i><br><br><i>Some are so rich.</i><br><br><i>Some so wretchedly poor.</i><br><br><i>Some so beautifully formed, and others with pitiful handicaps.</i><br><br><i>Some are gifted and others retarded.</i><br><br><i>Why the injustice, the untimely death? Why the neglect, the sorrow, the pain? . . .</i><br><br><i>The doctrine is simply this: life did not begin with mortal birth. We lived in spirit form before we entered mortality. We are spiritually the children of God. . . .</i><br><br><i>The scriptures teach this doctrine, the doctrine of premortal life. For His own reasons, the Lord provides answers to some questions</i>[scattered throughout]<i>the scriptures. We are to find them;</i>[but]<i>we are to</i>earn<i>them. In that way sacred things are hidden from the insincere. . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . When one knows the doctrine, parenthood becomes a sacred obligation, the begetting of life a sacred privilege.</i>[Boyd K. Packer, "The Mystery of Life,"<i>Ensign</i>, November 1983, 16-18; emphasis in original]<br><br>I have a personal witness that what he said is true. Having a testimony of the gospel of Jesus Christ gives us confidence and courage in life. We can yield our agency to the Lord and let him manage our lives. I know it requires faith to do this, but our divine nature gives us that strength, and we find joy in our commitment and our duty.<br><br>Sometimes, because of another person's agency, we cannot follow through on all our mortal commitments. The Lord loves us, understands us, and will bless us for our desires and efforts.<br><br>Our present-day servants of the Lord have made it very plain that marriage and children will not eternally be denied righteous women. The Lord is a just God.<br><br>I became acquainted with the book<i>Gospel Doctrine</i>by Joseph F. Smith in my early married years. The chapters on priesthood and home and family have been most helpful to me. One section is called "The Truest Greatness." This prophet states:<br><br><i>To do well those things which God ordained to be the common lot of all man-kind, is the truest greatness. To be a successful father or a successful mother is greater than to be a successful general or a successful statesman. . . .</i><br><br><i>We should never be discouraged in those daily tasks which God has ordained to the common lot of man. . . .</i><br><br><i>Let us not be trying to substitute an artificial life for the true one.</i>[<i>GD,</i>385]<br><br>When our ten children were at home, I sometimes would wonder if our teachings were being transferred to them. One day I noticed a drawing by one of the children. It was of the young boy Joseph Smith and the First Vision. Joseph had been drawn looking up at two Heavenly Beings. I saw individual fingers and toes on the Heavenly Visitors. At that moment it was confirmed in my heart that our gospel teachings were being received by our children.<br><br>Another time I had a great learning experience. It was a very busy day when all of our ten children were living at home. Somehow my day had gotten away from me. The dinner hour was near, and I recalled some sound advice my mother had given me: "You plan ahead, and you get your simple nutritious meals going early in the day. You know the children will be hungry before the dinner hour. Use some common sense. Sometimes you may have to feed them early." This advice had been overlooked that day.<br><br>I hastily moved into action. The assigned children on meal preparation came to my aid, and soon dinner was underway. I heard the hum of a busy household and then an unusual sound in another room. I found two of the younger children having a difference of opinion. I suggested that each could sit on a chair and think things over. The younger one looked at me in defiance and said, "You not in charge of me!" I was a bit taken aback, but I just quietly drew him aside and calmly explained that Heavenly Father had temporarily assigned me to love and to care for him. It took only a few more sentences, and he climbed up on the chair to think.<br><br>Soon the dinner bell rang, and we all sat up to the table. I learned the value of prompt meals. I<i></i>had been part of the problem that day. Yes, the crisis was over but the learning was not. As I recall, our next family home evening lesson was on obedience.<br><br>As parents we worked together in our home. The children soon learned that we were united. The answers from father and mother were always the same. We taught the children that there would come a time when they would leave home. It was time for more schooling, a mission, and marriage. Even with the world going downhill, we had confidence they could face troubled times. We wanted them to have the fulness of life. We would always be available, but we were willing to let them go with our love, faith, and blessings. Even though we as parents knew the adversary had great power in the world, we also knew that worthy sons and daughters of God have power over Satan. Our children had the divine nature, and they could succeed on their own.<br><br>My Grandmother Jordan was a great example of one who knew her divine nature. In 1909 as a recent convert to the Church, she had to make difficult decisions and took firm action, unlike her typically quiet, timid self. She told me she received prayerful direction, and she was empowered with vision and strength beyond her own. Because she did what had to be done, I had the blessing of being born in the covenant and having a rich heritage. I have many ancestors who have faced life with courage. Their actions have given me great advantages and responsibilities.<br><br>For the past forty-three years my husband has been away most weekends on Church service. This has been a productive family-history time. Becoming acquainted with previous generations has given me great joy and happiness. Our family has enjoyed researching, writing, and illustrating life stories and having the temple experiences together. Knowing our ancestors and serving them has brought a richness into our lives. Our ancestors are vitally interested in our successes here on earth. I know on many occasions I have received help from the other side.<br><br>I am in harmony with the thoughts of Elder Melvin J. Ballard:<br><br><i>I believe . . . that the hearts not only of the children are turned to their fathers, but the hearts of the fathers in the Spirit World are turned to their children on earth. . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . There are evidences that the dead are interested. If you will go forward with the research work the way will be opened on the right and on the left. You will be astonished to find avenues open. . . .</i><br><br><i>When you have done all you can do and have reached the limit, what will happen? . . .</i>Then will come God's opportunity. ["The Joy of Sacred Service," in<i>Saviors on Mount Zion,</i>comp. Archibald F. Bennett (Salt Lake City: Deseret Sunday School Union Board, 1950), 200–202; emphasis in original]<br><br>Cleo, an auntie of mine, was in a nursing home. After traveling some distance, we made a final visit. Cleo and her husband, Cliff, were content and at peace. At one point during our visit, Cleo spoke forcefully: "I can't just lay around here. I must get on with life." She did not mean this earthly life. The Lord granted her desire. I am certain she was welcomed by loving earthly parents and a multitude of family members for whom she had been instrumental in finding their names and seeing to their temple work.<br><br>Because of the divine nature of women, we seem to be very sensitive to the whisperings of the Holy Ghost. In the home mothers need to act as the receiving station for the communications from a loving Father in Heaven. It is vital that you remain worthy and alert. You must avoid getting too stressed or busy for the quiet promptings of the Spirit.<br><br>While raising our seven sons and three daughters, I had a few down days. The budget was very tight, physical demands were high, and I felt the expectations of others were even higher. Even though I recognized my divine nature, knew about the plan of happiness, and knew my husband was a worthy priesthood holder, I still had a few discouraging days as we raised our large family.<br><br>I learned that if I felt physically well I was more optimistic and better able to cope with life. I studied and practiced the Lord's law of health. I was responsible to give my children a healthy start in life. Sleep was an essential, so we retired early. We combined this with regular attendance at church meetings. Renewing our covenants with the Lord and the association with people with similar goals helped us to stay on course. Temple attendance helped me to clarify my vision and gave me a deep feeling of gratitude for all my blessings and my opportunities for growth.<br><br>There was consistent help from our extended family--a box of outgrown clothing, a basket of fruit, an hour of babysitting at just the right time. The Relief Society gave thrifty and practical homemaking ideas. I always felt their love and support.<br><br>Music had the power to comfort, edify, and bring joy into my everyday living.<br><br>Posting uplifting statements around the home as gentle reminders of what life is all about has helped me. I'll give you a few of my favorite statements: President David O. McKay liked to say, "Whate'er thou art, act well thy part" (<i>Cherished Experiences from the Writings of President David O. McKay,</i>comp. Clare Middlemiss [Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1955], 174). I once heard Sister McKay say, "It is the artful duty for the woman to adjust." I enjoy the scripture "Be thou humble; and the Lord thy God shall lead thee by the hand, and give thee answer to thy prayers" (D&amp;amp;C 112:10). The Prophet Joseph Smith said, "There must be decision of character aside from sympathy" (<i>HC,</i>4:570).<br><br>A 1950s<i>Children's Friend</i>magazine had a poem that I posted inside a kitchen cupboard door. The paper was yellow with age before our children were raised. On difficult days this poem quickly brought back my focus:<br><br><i>Plastic little</i>[children]<br><i>Made from heaven's clay.</i><br><i>Oh, Father, give us vision,</i><br><i>To mould them right today.</i><br><br><i>Potential gods in miniature;</i><br><i>We must have help from Thee;</i><br><i>For how they're fashioned here today,</i><br><i>Will endure through eternity.</i><br>[Lucy G. Bloomfield, "Primary Teacher's Prayer,"<i>Children's Friend,</i>February 1954, 74]<br><br>There are rewards for completion of commitments and promises to the Lord. President J. Reuben Clark Jr. told the Relief Society sisters:<br><br><i>The Priesthood will wish to proclaim their debt to these their helpmeets without whom the Priesthood could not have worked out their destiny. . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . Your offspring, saved and exalted in the presence of God, will never forget you, will ever bless you, and will sing hymns of eternal gratitude for the bodies you gave them and taught them to make the Temples of the Spirit of God</i>. ["Our Wives and Our Mothers in the Eternal Plan,"<i>The Relief Society Magazine,</i>vol. 33 no. 12 (December 1946), 804]<br><br>My husband and I have seen some rewards of our teaching as we have watched our children, grandchildren, and, now, great-grandchildren. Children are always desired and welcomed in our family. Sometimes faith is tested, but we have found if we keep our covenants, the Lord will bless us. Our grandchildren's world is more challenging than our world was, but their parents are doing a much better job than we did.<br><br>We are grateful other families teach their children the basic principles of the gospel, obedience to all commandments, and of their divine nature. They have raised special children, allowing our children and grandchildren to be married in the temple to a worthy partner. We have the assurance that the younger generation is equally yoked, having the same desires and eternal goals. They "shall stand in holy places, and shall not be moved" (D&amp;amp;C 45:32).<br><br>In the year 2002 we celebrated our 55th wedding anniversary with our family of nearly 100. We pondered a theme for the evening, "A Legacy of Covenant Choices."

Therefore with joy shall ye draw water out of the wells of salvation" (Isaiah 12:2–3).

<h1>th in the Morning - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Our daughter, Emily, was in the hospital in another state caring for her two-month-old baby, who had an upper-respiratory infection, and her two-year-old, Ella, who had come to visit her little sister.<br><br>It had been a difficult five days for Emily. Her husband was in the middle of final exams in a rigorous graduate program. Two children under two years of age is a large enough challenge under the best of circumstances. Finances were limited, and no extended family lived nearby for support. Emily had been wearing the same clothes, sleeping in the hospital by her baby, passing the two-year-old back and forth to her husband as he was able to break away from school. She was fatigued and frightened and lonely.<br><br>Ella could not stay happy long in the confines of her baby sister's hospital room, so our daughter took her to the children's playroom. Ella was delighted with the toys and puzzles. Unfortunately, the attendant came soon after Ella arrived to close the playroom. Ella threw herself on the floor in a full-fledged two-year-old tantrum. Can you imagine her mother's embarrassment as she looked around at the other children, who were very sick in contrast to Ella's robust countenance, leaving obediently, dragging IV poles behind them? Emily picked up her distraught child and hurried out of the hospital. They sat down somewhere on a bench far from the eyes and ears of strangers. Emily let Ella finish out the tantrum but was unable to contain her own emotions, which she had kept pent-up for five days in the hospital. She gave way to her own good cry. Imagine Emily's surprise to have Ella look up at the tears now streaming out of her mother's eyes and say with remarkable two-year-old compassion, "I'm sorry, Mommy. Don't cry. Ella happy now."<br><br>In our later phone conversation, we talked about how difficult it is to handle a tantrum, especially when it happens outside of our homes, where we have established some sense of routine for these breakdowns. Emily was grateful she didn't try to redirect Ella in the middle of a difficult day. Emily was blessed with a moment of joy, even though she had miles to go in resolving the immediate concerns of her family.<br><br>Today I would like to develop the topic of finding joy and teaching it to our children. So often the joy is only realized in hindsight, in subtle, surprise interactions or through simple conversations each of us has had with our children, with ourselves, and with our Heavenly Father. In a myriad ways daily, each of us can be "surprised by joy."<br><br>Our lives are a combination of disappointment, loneliness, and sorrow interspersed with memorable joyful moments. We can feel overwhelmed and discouraged and happy all in the same day or even the same hour. Joy and sorrow are twinborn, as is reflected in a scripture from Psalms: "Weeping may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning." I would like to discuss some of the ways that happens for each of us.<br><br>In late December I received a letter asking me to speak at Women's Conference. This wasn't the first time I had been asked to speak. The minute an invitation like this comes into your life, things are different. The topic is with you at the grocery store, as you go to sleep, as you push grandchildren on swings in the park, even as you work on church assignments. In January and February I browsed the Church Web site, entering the word joy into the search engine. Talks with titles like "Finding Joy in Life" and "Joy in the Journey" came up. I took them to bed with me at night, usually finding them all crumpled in the covers in the morning. I looked in the Topical Guide, read each scripture suggested, and even wrote them all out on paper with my own observations and impressions. I felt good. I was learning and loving the time spent researching and pondering the topic of joy, and the deadline was far away--or so it felt.<br><br>But after returning from a training trip to Africa, on March 1 I found a letter from the First Presidency notifying me that I was assigned to speak in general conference a few weeks later. The Women's Conference talk left my mind--so did joy. After conference I saw that we were now into April, and there were just days left until the deadline for turning in a finished talk to the Women's Conference committee. My talk in general conference was about finishing, and I wondered if I could finish this talk, which is almost three times longer than the conference talk, which took several weeks to complete. I now had four days to the deadline.<br><br>Now what would you all do? I am sure each of you would start writing. But not me. I looked at my home office, which is also my husband's home office, and saw stacks of papers, books, mail, candy wrappers, cups, and bedroom slippers. I thought, I can't write in this mess. In our mission we regularly told the missionaries in zone conference that the Spirit can't work in a dirty living space. So I proceeded to purge, clean, and organize. In this cleaning frenzy I found a number of notes and letters that I wanted to respond to from kind friends and neighbors, wedding invitations that needed attention, an overlooked bill in the stacks of paper, and much more. As I organized I started becoming distraught. I found tears running down my face as I thought of all the important things I needed to do, and now I was adding more necessary, good things to do to that long, impossible list.<br><br>After I had my meltdown, I remember talking to Heavenly Father just as though He were on the couch next to my piles of unorganized matter. I felt He was close and aware of my dilemma. He knew my heart and all my good intentions, and I knew the thank-you notes and even missed wedding gifts could wait for another time. He wanted me to start writing right where I was and finish well, basically the message I had tried to deliver in conference. Why was I the last to learn?<br><br>I felt renewed even though it was late at night. I knew joy could come in the morning. Off to bed I went and the next day--in the middle of the stacks--I wrote the fragments of conversations I'd had with people who smile through tears of frustration, sorrow, or difficulty.<br><br>A dear friend and I talked about her struggles with her grown children. She said that one morning she walked alone along the lakefront near her home in downtown Chicago. She was thinking about her children, her busy schedule, and a new church calling. She was also thinking about a gospel lesson taught in Relief Society the previous day. The lesson was on joy. She began to wonder when she had last felt real joy in her life. She couldn't remember a recent time when she had not felt burdened and at wit's end. As she walked she began to pray that she might remember when joy had lifted her spirit. As soon as this prayer formed in her mind, the sun burst from behind the overcast clouds in the sky to light up the lakefront and the beautiful Chicago skyline. As the sun lit the day, she experienced a deep and sudden affirmation that she was loved. That awareness gave her the power to cope with the problems at hand. Joy came quietly on a gray fall morning in Chicago to Mary.<br><br>Jesus Christ came into this world not only to suffer for our sins but to take upon Himself our struggles and pain. "And he shall go forth, suffering pains and afflictions and temptations of every kind; . . . he will take upon him the pains and the sicknesses of his people" (Alma 7:11). Why did He do this? "That his bowels may be filled with mercy, according to the flesh, that he may know according to the flesh how to succor his people according to their infirmities" (Alma 7:12).<br><br>He knows how we struggle, how we feel, and He knows how to send his love and comfort. He will do this as often as we are in a position to receive those messages. Joy comes from knowing He loves us and from seeking His help. Then we can experience those exquisite moments of joy when we are "encircled . . . in the arms of his love" (2 Nephi 1:15).<br><br>As mothers we raise our children to one day become worthy and righteous parents. Our little daughters cuddle and care for dolls. We catch them mothering, sometimes with our very own words. Now that can be embarrassing! They can't wait to become mothers. I have four lovely daughters and one daughter-in-law. All of them pursued professional careers at the university level, but their one great desire was to become mothers.<br><br>Imagine the devastation felt throughout our family when one of our daughters was told after years and years of medical procedures that she would not be able to bear children. I remember well that Easter morning when the last procedure failed and the diagnosis was given that she and her husband would be childless. My husband and I felt our own hearts breaking. We had been to the temple earlier and felt such love and confidence that this sweet daughter and her dear husband would have a family. So the contrary news that day was difficult. Easter seemed tainted. Our belief had not changed or been shaken. But our joy in the magnificent patterns of seasons and the glory of rebirth and spring buds and blossoms had temporarily drained away.<br><br>Soon after that dismal Easter Sunday, armed with the sweet reassurance from the temple, our daughter and son-in-law began the adoption process. Later we found out that a courageous unmarried young girl was struggling with a difficult decision about what to do with her pregnancy at the same time we were in the temple praying for a child. This young girl felt an answer to her prayers. She knew she would be giving her baby the gift of both a mother and a father who were sealed in a temple of the Lord. She knew she could be a mother, but she unselfishly decided that was not enough for this little one she was carrying. Our daughter and son-in-law now have two adopted children. Joy comes in waiting patiently on the Lord and trusting in His own patterns for fulfilling promises. We don't know how the answers will come to our prayers. But the Lord does, and His comfort is "joy in the morning."<br><br>Some months ago another one of our daughters wanted to make and keep a commitment to read her scriptures daily. She had heard a motivational and inspired speaker from an earlier Women's Conference say that just having them open in a conspicuous place would be an impetus for keeping this kind of a goal and a wonderful example for her children. She began reading in the Book of Mormon and after some days was in 2 Nephi chapter 11, pondering Jacob's testimony of his Redeemer. She left her scriptures open right on the end table by the couch, basking in the joy of reading the scriptures and in her heart thanking the speaker who had given such good advice.<br><br>She went to the laundry room and had begun sorting and loading the wash when her four-year-old boy, Logan, came running to find his mom--carrying the entire chapter 11 of 2 Nephi in his hands. He knew what his sixteen-month-old sister, Ashlyn, had done would be of grave importance to his mother, and that's why he reacted so quickly, just not quickly enough. Now what do you do to teach a sixteen-month-old not to tear up scriptures? Nothing, except put them in a spot where this won't be a possibility in the future. Did my daughter have good intentions? Yes. Was she trying to put into practice basic gospel habits? Yes. Was she trying to let her children see her reading the scriptures daily? Yes.<br><br>"Why is it so hard to do the right things?" she asked me in a conversation later that week. She told me that this was the chapter most marked in her scriptures. (She meant before the baby colored on it.) We talked about other attempts at keeping the commandments and all the things that can happen to impede our efforts. Think about going to the temple regularly. If a tire is going to go flat, it happens then. We both decided that the best we can do is to adjust and just keep trying to live each and every commandment. I don't think that it is the plan to have righteous intentions and desires be fulfilled easily or without obstacle. But we know that when the restored gospel of Jesus Christ and the blessings of living it are our focus, joy comes. Our conversation ended in a happy place--thinking about diligent Logan, who at least knew how important the scriptures were to his mom. Now that counts for a lot! The moment of the incident was painful to Tina, but after time we could talk, we could laugh; we found ourselves surprised by joy.<br><br>Joy is a gift from God. Thinking back to Emily, crying right beside Ella and acknowledging her own emotions allowed for a sweet moment. Why? Because Emily did not try to control or force perfection in a two-year-old or in her own vulnerable self. The result was a joyful moment, a gift from God, a gift from the Holy Ghost. As we become joyful mothers, and it will take a lifetime to do this, our children can experience and become part of those moments. Becoming a joyful mother of children is what we are about, and making sure our days have as many joyful moments as possible is a righteous goal. The ripping apart of chapter 11 by little Ashlyn was a painful experience for her mother, but a conversation with someone who loved her and understood her and had experienced similar situations helped. Conversations with loved ones, friends, and, most important, Heavenly Father help us find joy. This talk was blessed by my conversation with Him several weeks ago when He helped me create order out of chaos.<br><br>Think about learning a new skill. For me this was learning how to use a computer while in my fifties. I learned in the mission field when it became a necessity. Our numbers of missionaries dropped so dramatically when visas to enter Portugal became a challenge that the only answer to having enough missionaries in the field to preach the gospel was to put me right into the mission office. My skill level on the computer increased dramatically with each new task I had to assume.<br><br>Maybe we shouldn't whine about life becoming too hard. Maybe we are being given new opportunities to move to higher skill levels. I can now send documents with attachments, highlighted, edited, and so forth. I couldn't even turn a computer on a few years before. In our parenting, with every child we add to the mix in our family, the skill level of our mothering goes up a notch. And just as the difficulty of using a computer increases with new technical capabilities, so every obstacle you successfully overcome builds your ability to parent. The parenting challenges escalate as you safely navigate through the childhood years to arrive at the ultimate test of living with teenagers. If you keep learning and don't give up, you will get better and better. And then before you realize it, your teenagers turn into wives and husbands, mothers and fathers.<br><br>At the same time, your own parents who have looked forward to those golden years are finding them "laced with lead." As I was almost finished with this talk, a call came from a daughter telling us that my mother had fallen and broken her hip. Mom was in an ambulance and on her way to the hospital, and my father, whose short-term memory has disappeared, was with some kind strangers. For the winter Mom and Dad were in Southern California, far from family members. My husband and I were with a daughter for the blessing of her newest baby in northern California. We quickly rented a car and started driving. All the way during the six-hour drive, we talked by cell phone to my father, his Samaritan helpers, and my mother in the hospital waiting for X-rays.<br><br>Upon arriving, we found Dad with a kind couple from the ward, who just happened to be the Relief Society president and former bishop. How relieved we were as they said Dad was doing well and had related in considerable detail his sweet two-year courtship with Mom. My husband stayed with my father, and I drove immediately to the hospital. I found Mother alone and in so much pain. But all she could talk about was her dear companion of 65 years. I spent my days and nights with my mother, coordinating two surgeries, transfusions, and reactions to medicine. My husband spent his days and nights with my father, reassuring him over and over that his Lillie would be all right. The transfer after a six-day hospital stay to the rehab center was difficult, and the drive home to Salt Lake with my father but without my mother was even more difficult. But as we prayed for direction and help, it came in surprising ways.<br><br>Our daughter Lisa said, "Mom, we will pack up the four children and come," and they did. Her strong and capable husband helped my mother return to Salt Lake City on the airplane so she could rehabilitate closer to family. Help came as we prayed with Dad and saw the anxiety disappear even before the "amen" was uttered. Help came as my husband and father gave a blessing of healing and comfort to Mom.<br><br>I have thought over and over again, Why is life so complicated? Why is there so much "unearned" suffering? Consequences are one thing, but old age is another; who earns that? In our heart of hearts we think we should be immune to some of our deepest heartache because we are trying so hard and contributing so much. Sometimes I think suffering is the answer to that arrogance. Do we search for food and water and firewood every day in a parched desert or seek safety in a crime-infested, concrete inner city? We do not. In some ways these trials reinforce how blessed our lives really are. Hospitals with tubes and tests and insurance tangles and all the things that kill the spirit outright while trying to heal the body are nevertheless a gift to us.<br><br>Joy comes through misery and heartache, through having a husband to love and protect your father through the night while you sit in a chair accumulating two days of body odor. It comes in the memories of childhood and your admiration for a remarkable, resilient mother whose caretaking you only now begin to comprehend. Joy comes in sharing these things with your children, who have learned much about making and keeping commitments from their grandparents.<br><br>The joy is not in arriving, but in getting better each time a new challenge is thrown your way, each time you learn in a new situation. Joy comes not from having a pain-free life but from conquering the obstacles, even when they are painful. If our children can see us enduring well and finding laughter, humor, and joy in the process, I think some of this will rub off on them. It will take many conversations, sometimes late at night, early in the morning, and all the times in between, but it is worth it. And as was prayed for in the temple dedication at Kirtland, we can pray that Heavenly Father will send us forth from our homes armed with His power, with His name upon us, with His glory round about us, and strengthened by His angels (see D&amp;amp;C 109:22). We pray through the night and joy comes in the morning in the form of a new perspective, a new energy and resolve, a conversation with someone who validates or mentors or just remembers.<br><br>Joy comes in the form of the natural world bursting with sunlight and patterning resurrection and rebirth just as we imagine birth will not be part of our life's experience. Joy comes through crying with the toddler whose tantrum pushed us to the limit in the first place. Joy comes in cyclical patterns and seasons. I find more humor in my daughter's dealing with a tantrum than in my own tears of frustration wanting to help my father understand that I have not kidnapped him. Joy comes through our own gratitude for the Holy Ghost teaching and testifying of the plan of salvation. Of this I testify in the joyful name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><em>Gayle Clegg was second counselor in the Primary general presidency when this Women's Conference address was given at Brigham Young University on 30 April 2004.</em><br><br>© Intellectual Reserve, Inc.

<br>
When we speak of modesty, I am reminded of what Tevya, a character in the musical <i>Fiddler on the Roof,</i> said when he spoke of his beloved village of Anatevka. He said, "In Anatevka everyone knows who he is and what God expects him to do." For me, that is the bottom line of any discussion on modesty.<br><br>Modesty is often talked of in terms of dress and appearance, but modesty encompasses much more than the outward appearance. It is a condition of the heart. It is an outward manifestation of an inner knowledge and commitment. It is an expression that we understand our identity as daughters of God. It is an expression that we know what He expects us to do. It is a declaration of our covenant keeping. A question in the <i>For the Strength of Youth </i>booklet really is the question each of us must consider: "Am I living the way the Lord wants me to live?" ([Salt Lake City: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 2001], 40).<br><br>Like the people of Anatevka, do we know who we are? Do our daughters and young women know who they are? In speaking to members of the Church, Peter said: "But ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvelous light" (1 Peter 2:9). He clearly defined our identity. And his use of the word <i>peculiar</i> did not mean "odd." It meant "special."<br><br>In the Book of Mormon, the Lord's chosen people are described in this way: "Ye are the children of the prophets; and ye are of the house of Israel; and ye are of the covenant which the Father made with your fathers" (3 Nephi 20:25). Elder Russell M. Nelson of the Twelve said, "Once we know who we are, the royal lineage of which we are a part, our actions and directions in life will be more appropriate to our inheritance" ("Thanks for the Covenant," in <i>Brigham Young University 1988–89 Devotional and Fireside Speeches</i> [Provo, Utah: Brigham Young University, 1989], 59). Even the Young Women Theme reminds us that we are "daughters of our Heavenly Father who loves us" (<i>Personal Progress</i> [Salt Lake City: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 1989], 6).<br><br>When we truly know that we are daughters of God and have an understanding of our divine nature, it will be reflected in our countenance, our appearance, and our actions.<br><br>Several years ago, a dear friend married in the Salt Lake Temple. She was a convert to the Church from India, and her entire family came for her wedding. They were not members of the Church, so they waited patiently outside for the wedding to end and the bride to exit the temple. They were dressed in native Indian attire and looked beautiful. When they walked onto the temple grounds, all eyes were upon them. The thing I noticed most was how elegantly they moved and carried themselves and how modest each was. They were not apologetic for their appearance even though it made them stand out in the crowd. They simply knew who they were and were not ashamed. I observed how beautiful they were. The women seemed almost queenly in their attitude and demeanor. In their actions, movements, and conversation, they were dignified and lovely. I thought how much I would like every young woman and woman in the Church to have that same attitude--an attitude of understanding something deeper on the inside that was reflected on the outside.<br><br>Our prophet has said,<br><br><i>Of all the creations of the Almighty, there is none more beautiful, none more inspiring than a lovely daughter of God who walks in virtue with an understanding of why she should do so, who honors and respects her body as a thing sacred and divine, who cultivates her mind and constantly enlarges the horizon of her understanding, who nurtures her spirit with everlasting truth.</i> [Gordon B. Hinckley, "Our Responsibility to Our Young Women," <i>Ensign,</i> September 1988, 11]<br><br>If our young women know this, they know much more than how to dress--they will know how to live. And they will have the courage they need to avoid the moral decline of the world.<br><br>The prophet Brigham Young desired that his daughters reflect their true identity. Visualize this setting with me for a moment. It is 1869, and the prophet Brigham Young became concerned about his daughters and their somewhat worldly interests and actions. He was worried about the general trend toward materialism, commercialism, and sophistication among the younger Church members, and his daughters seemed to reflect that trend. He assembled his children in the Lion House parlor for family prayer. He looked into the faces of his lovely daughters and said,<br><br><i>All Israel are looking to my family and watching the example set by my ... children. For this reason I desire to organize my own family first into a society for the promotion of habits of order, thrift, industry, and charity; and, above all things, I desire them to retrench from their extravagance in dress....</i><br><br><i>... I want you to ... retrench ... in your speech, wherein you have been guilty of silly ... speeches and light-mindedness of thought. Retrench in everything that is bad and worthless, and improve in everything that is good and beautiful</i>. [Susa Young Gates, <i>History of the Young Ladies' Mutual Improvement Association of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints </i>(Salt Lake City: Deseret News, 1911), 8–10]<br><br>We don't often hear the word <i>retrench </i>in our society. The dictionary defines <i>retrench</i> as meaning "to cut down, to reduce or diminish, to curtail, to economize" (<i>Webster's New World Dictionary of the American Language,</i> 1st college ed., s.v. "retrench"). This definition helps us to understand the last sentence of Brigham Young's declaration. He desired his daughters to curtail and diminish in everything that is bad and worthless and to improve in that which is good and beautiful. He wanted his daughters to be "worthy of imitation" (Delbert L. Stapley, "<i>Liahona </i>Classic: A Salute to Youth," <i>Liahona,</i> November 2001, 25).<br><br>In the Doctrine and Covenants, we are admonished to "arise and shine forth, that thy light may be a standard for the nations" (D&amp;amp;C 115:5). Perhaps it is again time to retrench.<br><br>In our present day President Hinckley has issued a similar call to the women of the Church. He has said,<br><br><i>It is so tremendously important that the women of the Church stand strong and immovable for that which is correct and proper under the plan of the Lord. ... If they will be united and speak with one voice, their strength will be incalculable.</i><br><br><i>We call upon the women of the Church to stand together for righteousness. They must begin in their own homes. They can teach it in their classes. They can voice it in their communities.</i><br><br><i>They must be the teachers and the guardians of their daughters.</i><br><br>Then he said, "I see this as the one bright shining hope in a world that is marching toward self-destruction" ("Standing Strong and Immovable," Worldwide Leadership Training Meeting, 10 January 2004 [Salt Lake City: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 2004], 20).<br><br>President Hinckley has said to both youth and adults,<br><br><i>If we are to hold up this Church as an ensign to the nations and a light to the world, we must take on more of the luster of the life of Christ individually and in our own personal circumstances. In standing for the right, we must not be fearful of the consequences. We must never be afraid. Said Paul to Timothy:</i><br><br><i>"For God hath not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind.</i><br><br><i>"Be not thou therefore ashamed of the testimony of our Lord" (2 Timothy 1:7–8). </i>["An Ensign to the Nations, a Light to the World," <i>Ensign,</i> November 2003, 84]<br><br>Modesty, therefore, is more than the way we dress. It reflects our testimony and the condition of our hearts. It is an outward manifestation of an inward knowledge and commitment. It begins in the little things. It begins with knowing who we are and what God expects us to do. Are we willing to do what is expected of us? Are we willing to do what it takes to dress modestly?<br><br>Dressing modestly is a challenge. President James E. Faust said in a General Young Women Conference, "You young ladies may have a hard time buying a modest prom dress. May I suggest that you make your own? You may need some help, but plenty of help is available" ("Womanhood: The Highest Place of Honor," <i>Ensign, </i>May 2000, 95).<br><br>Just this March at the General Young Women Meeting, President Hinckley pleaded again with the young women and their mothers to be modest. In his talk titled "Stay on the High Road," he said,<br><br><i>You are the strength of the present, the hope of the future. ...</i><br><br><i>You are second to none. You are daughters of God. ... But, my dear friends, we cannot accept that which has become common in the world. Yours, as members of this Church, is a higher standard and more demanding....</i><br><br><i>Modesty in dress and manner will assist in protecting against temptation. It may be difficult to find modest clothing, but it can be found with enough effort. I sometimes wish every girl had access to a sewing machine and training in how to use it. She could then make her own attractive clothing. I suppose this is an unrealistic wish. But I do not hesitate to say that you can be attractive without being immodest. You can be refreshing and buoyant and beautiful in your dress and in your behavior. Your appeal to others will come of your personality, which is the sum of your individual characteristics. Be happy. Wear a smile. Have fun. But draw some rigid parameters, a line in the sand, as it were, beyond which you will not go.</i> [<i>Ensign,</i> May 2004, 112]<br><br>The audience laughed when President Hinckley mentioned a sewing machine for every young woman. They thought he was kidding. But I do not think he was. I think he was serious and prophetic. The question that remains for us to answer is "Therefore what?"--what will each of us do to respond to the call of a prophet of our day to arise and shine forth?<br><br>President Spencer W. Kimball suggested we establish a "style of our own" ("On My Honor," <i>Ensign,</i> April 1979, 3). And as wickedness progresses in the world, we may have to do just that. We cannot lead if we are like the world. Instead of spending our energy and our money to look like the world, perhaps we should set a pattern that they may choose to follow. We must have the courage and the gospel understanding to be modest. Modesty will not only set us apart from the world, but it will also protect us.<br><br>Are we willing to obey the standard of modesty "at all times and in all things, and in all places" (Mosiah 18:9)?<br><br>Modesty is about more than hemlines, necklines, and revealing clothing. It is the appropriate dress for the appropriate setting. It is caring to dress appropriately to show respect for people, places, and settings.<br><br>We hear more and more concern from the Brethren about excessive casualness in our dress. "In your attempt to follow the styles and be casual, do not offend good taste. When we go to worship the Lord, we ought to be dressed in our finest, cleanest, and best" (A. Theodore Tuttle, "Your Mission Preparation," <i>Ensign,</i> November 1974, 71).<br><br>When we understand modesty, we know how to be appropriate in any given situation. We know how to dress to run a marathon as well as how to dress to attend a priesthood ordinance. We understand that having young men wear a white shirt and tie to pass the sacrament is more, much more, than a rule. We invite the companionship of the Spirit by the small things we do that show not only our attitude but our understanding.<br><br>Just a month ago the choir for the General Young Woman Meeting had a dress rehearsal in the Conference Center on a Saturday morning. Families were invited to attend. As I arrived, I noticed a family of five children reverently waiting in the seats for the practice to begin. Each of the young boys had on a freshly ironed white shirt and tie, and the little girls wore their Sunday dresses. The mother and father were neatly dressed as well. As I shook the oldest boy's hand, I said, "I compliment you on the way you are dressed on this early Saturday morning. I can tell that you understand and have been taught some things that it takes a lot of people all their lives to realize." He flashed his mother a sheepish look, and she gave him that knowing look that says, "I told you so."<br><br>The pamphlet <i>For the Strength of Youth </i>admonishes, "Never lower your dress standards for any occasion. Doing so sends the message that you are using your body to get attention and approval and that modesty is important only when it is convenient" (15).<i></i><br><br>Are we as mothers willing to do our part to raise modest daughters?<br><br>Mothers play a tremendous role in the modesty of their daughters. President Hinckley has great confidence in us. He said that "we must never lose sight of the strength of the women. It is mothers who set the tone of the home. It is mothers who most directly affect the lives of their children" "Standing Strong and Immovable," Worldwide Leadership Training Meeting, 10 January 2004 [Salt Lake City: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 2004], 21). I might add that it is mothers who can and must influence their daughters to be modest in their dress, attitudes, speech, conduct, and thought.<br><br>Mothers teach modesty in the home and model it through their example. Are we as mothers at fault for our daughters' immodest dress and actions? Are we more concerned about popularity than purity? Some say, "My daughter is a good girl. I don't want to make an issue of her tight clothing or skimpy Tshirts." They say, "I won't die on that hill." It's not about hills; it's about hearts. It's not about confrontation, it's about covenants. These are battles in which we should be engaged because modesty has moral implications. This is a different world. By encouraging our daughters to be cute and trendy, we may unknowingly be putting them at great risk.<br><br>Several weeks ago, I visited with Liriel Domiciano, a young woman from Brazil who has an extraordinary voice. Her talent has made her famous in Brazil. She insists on performing in modest attire, always wearing her Young Womanhood Medallion as a symbol of her values. When I asked her what kept her strong, she replied, "My mother is my protector." As mothers, we simply must be our daughter's protector. We must start early. We must set the example as we dress to easily meet temple standards. We can teach these standards to our daughters and help them as they anticipate and prepare for their own temple attendance. We must never compromise those standards in order that our daughters might be popular or accepted by those with not only worldly standards but worldly intentions. We must not only be their example but their protector.<br><br>Recently the Church donated $3 million to immunize African children against measles and prevent 1.2 million deaths. In Ethiopia mothers walked miles from their villages carrying their children so they could be immunized and protected against this epidemic (see Sarah Jane Weaver, "Church Gives $3 Million to Fight Measles in Africa," <i>Church News,</i> 27 September 2003, 7–9). As mothers, we will go any distance to protect our children physically. It is a "mother bear" instinct. We must be equally anxious to protect their spiritual welfare.<br><br>Here is a specific list of things we can do to protect our daughters and young women:<br><br><i>Seek answers in the scriptures.</i> The scriptures contain the answer to every question or problem.<br><br><i>Know the doctrine and teach it.</i> "True doctrine, understood, changes attitudes and behavior" (Boyd K. Packer, "Little Children," <i>Ensign,</i> November 1986, 17). The doctrine is the why--the rules are the how. Our youth must understand both.<br><br><i>Study the </i>For the Strength of Youth <i>pamphlet.</i> It describes how to qualify for the companionship of the Holy Ghost. We simply must have this guidance in today's world.<br><br><i>Teach them their eternal identity.</i> My mother always called out when I left the house, "Remember who you are and what we stand for."<br><br><i>Help them gain skills.</i> Teaching skills such as sewing, hemming, and sewing on a button builds bonds between a mother and daughter.<br><br><i>Seek experiences with the Spirit.</i> In your home pray, read scriptures, and listen to sacred music.<br><br><i>Serve others.</i><br><br><i>Don't let them base their identity on designer labels.</i> "Pretty is as pretty does."<br><br><i>Teach covenant keeping and obedience above acceptance.</i><br><br>Live what you know--be an example.<br><br>Live the standards generously. Don't teeter on the edge of the line.<br><br>Modesty is a daily standard, which, if lived, has eternal promise.<br><br>Modesty extends to our actions, our speech, our attitudes, our thoughts, even our desires. Our modesty is a reflection of our desire to follow a prophet of God. I repeat, being modest is more than how we dress. Modesty is an outward manifestation of our inward commitment and understanding.<br><br>We have a dear friend who worked as a gardener at the Oakland Temple. He shared with us the following insight:<br><br><i>Our temples are kept beautiful on the outside. I spent many, many hours grooming the temple grounds--weeding, watering, planting flowers, doing all I could to make the exterior reflect the sacred spirit inside the Lord's holy house. Surely the Lord expects us to groom and care for our physical tabernacles also--not as the world does, but in order that the Spirit of the Lord may find a fit sanctuary to dwell with our own spirits.</i> [John S. Tanner, "To Clothe a Temple," <i>Ensign, </i>August 1992, 47]<br><br>The outward appearance of the temple and the grounds reflect the inner spirit and beauty of the temple. So it is with us.<br><br>Paul said,<br><br><i>Know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your own?</i><br><br><i>For ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God's.</i> [1 Corinthians 6:19–20]<br><br>He also asked: "Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?" (1 Corinthians 3:16).<br><br>Our purpose in coming to earth was to gain a body with which to have experience and joy and to exercise our agency. Our body is a precious gift from a loving Heavenly Father. We are made in His image. Our body is the instrument of our agency and the receptacle of our spirit. There is only one to a customer. It is precious. When Adam and Eve had partaken of the fruit in the Garden of Eden and became mortal and subject to temptation, they covered themselves with fig leaves. Later, a loving Heavenly Father, in an act of mercy, placed a covering over their bodies in the form of coats of skins (see Genesis 3:21). He did this not only to protect them from the elements but to protect them from man's fallen nature (see John S. Tanner, "To Clothe a Temple," 44). Consequently, personal modesty is evidence that we understand that our bodies are sacred.<br><br>Our modesty--in fact, all of our standards and our willingness to live them--are a reflection of our covenants as members of the Church. We have made baptismal covenants. We must prepare our daughters and other young women to make and keep sacred temple covenants.<b></b><br><br>When I was a new Young Women General Board member, Elder Robert D. Hales helped me to really understand what my baptismal covenant meant. He said, "When you were baptized, you stepped out of the world and into the kingdom." He said that when we truly understand this, it changes everything. It did for me. Elder Hales's teaching awakened in me a desire to reflect in every way that I am a woman of covenant. Each time I partake of the sacrament, I remember that I promise to "always remember him" (D&amp;amp;C 20:77). I see myself literally stepping across a line out of an ever-darkening world and into the brightness of the kingdom. Again and again I ask myself, "Am I living the way the Lord wants me to live?"<br><br>Our covenants provide protection, direction, and focus. They enable us to navigate a very turbulent world guided by His Spirit. When we are keeping our covenants, it is extremely difficult to still keep one foot in the world and the other in the kingdom. Sister Mary C. Hales said, "A temple standard of modesty is an outward expression of an inward commitment--not just looking modest but actually being modest in every aspect of life" ("An Outward Expression of an Inward Commitment," in <i>The Power of His Redemption: Talks from the 2003 BYU Women's Conference</i> [Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 2004], 178).<br><br>Some young women in Kansas received a lesson on modesty and its relationship to covenants and keeping them. They thought about what they could do. They remembered that the parents of the Ammonite 2,000 stripling warriors had repented of their warlike ways and covenanted with the Lord. They had buried their swords and weapons of war in connection with their covenant. These young women decided that they would go to their closets and take out any immodest clothing. They didn't want to be the cause of anyone else being immodest, so they took their clothes out to the yard and buried them! Their outward actions reflected their inward desires. They desired to be covenant keepers.<br><br>When we are modest, we reflect in our outward actions and appearance that we understand what God expects us to do. We reflect that we are women of covenant--that we understand the covenants we have made at baptism to "stand as witnesses of God at all times and in all things, and in all places" (Mosiah 18:9). As we keep our baptismal covenant and "always remember him" (D&amp;amp;C 20:77) our actions and appearance invite the companionship of the Holy Ghost. And we are told in the Book of Mormon that the Holy Ghost will "show unto you all things what ye should do" (2 Nephi 32:5). In the world in which we live, can we risk being without this sure compass and companion? The pressures of the world must not push us into places where the Spirit cannot dwell.<br><br>"When you are well groomed and modestly dressed, you invite the companionship of the Spirit and can exercise a good influence on those around you" (<i>For the Strength of Youth,</i> 18). It is really all about the Spirit. If you go through the entire <i>For the Strength of Youth </i>booklet and circle each mention of the Holy Ghost, you will see that it occurs twenty-four times in forty-two pages. This entire book describes, standard by standard, how to qualify for the companionship of the Holy Ghost.<br><br>In our day prophets have again issued the call to young women and women to retrench, to arise, to be worthy of imitation. Our standards are clearly outlined for us and they carry with them infinitely great rewards. We are promised by prophets of God that if we live the standards, we<br><br><i>will be able to do </i>[our]<i> life's work with greater wisdom and skill and bear trials with greater courage.</i> [We] <i>will have the help of the Holy Ghost.</i> [We] <i>will feel good about ourselves and will be a positive influence in the lives of others. </i>[We] <i>will be worthy to go to the temple to receive holy ordinances.</i> [<i>For the Strength of Youth,</i> 2–3]<br><br>What more could a mother want for her daughter or for herself?<br><br>The people who assembled at the Waters of Mormon were converted to the gospel. They were about to be baptized and enter into a covenant that included "standing as a witness of God at all times and in all things, and in all places" (Mosiah 18:9). When Alma asked them if they were willing to do this, "they clapped their hands for joy, and exclaimed: This is the desire of our hearts" (Mosiah 18:11). Why was it their hearts' desire? Because, just as it was in Anatevka, they had been taught and understood who they really were and what God expected them to do. They wanted to change. They understood and wanted the promises. And they were willing to do whatever it took to have the blessing of the companionship of the Holy Ghost.<br><br>As daughters of God and women of covenant, we have stepped out of the world and into the kingdom. Now is the time to "arise and shine forth, that thy light may be a standard for the nations" (D&amp;amp;C 115:5). In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Elaine S.

<h1> Delighteth in Plainness unto My People, That They May Learn” - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Nephi said, "My soul delighteth in plainness unto my people, that they may learn" (2 Nephi 25:4). He later explains that "after this manner doth the Lord God work among the children of men" (2 Nephi 31:3). The Lord truly does work according to plainness. <i>Plain</i> means pure, clear, uncomplicated, honest, simple, and without ornamentation (<i>Webster's Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary,</i> s.v. "plain"). Sometimes in the worldly scope of things <i>plain</i> has picked up a derogatory sense, meaning ordinary, not pretty, or old-fashioned, but it does not carry this sense in the eternal scope of our Heavenly Father. It is His way. In Genesis 25:27 Jacob of old is called a "plain man"; according to the accompanying footnote in the Church's 1979 edition of the Bible, <i>plain</i> here means whole, complete, perfect, and simple. The gospel of Jesus Christ is plain in the same way as was Jacob. Its principles and commandments are taught in powerful, plain, simple, honest ways by the Lord and His prophets. As we look closely at the scriptures, we see that directives are given in three main areas: living with plainness, teaching with plainness, and speaking with plainness. By following these principles, we can become more whole, complete, and perfect.<br><h2><b>Living with Plainness</b></h2><br>We are told in the scriptures that we can live with more plainness, simplifying our lives. We can live with fewer material wants, freeing up our resources for something better, for something more lasting. The Lord Himself advises us in the Sermon on the Mount:<br><br><i>Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal:</i><br><br><i>But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, ...</i><br><br><i>For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.</i> [Matthew 6:19–21]<br><br>It is beneficial for all of us to examine periodically where we spend our time and money and realize that this denotes the state of our hearts. As we adapt to simplicity, we feel more joy and gratitude. We appreciate more fully what we already have. Can we run around a little less with empty busyness, cancel a few of the talent lessons our children don't really like, and find a little more productive time to do the important things? Can we better prioritize what is most essential in serving the needs and goals of our family? Sometimes our search for less gives us more in our quest for perfection and eternal goals.<br><br>Alma counsels his son Helaman, "Now ye may suppose that this is foolishness in me; but behold I say unto you, that by small and simple things are great things brought to pass" (Alma 37:6). Some may still suppose it foolish today, but it is the truth. As we make these words our guide to living, our lives will open up and we will recognize miracles. We will see the lifting that comes from a smile or a kind word, the benefits of simple service. We will understand the true meaning of visiting and home teaching as loving shepherding, without all of the unneeded extras.<br><br>I once was told a story of a woman who couldn't do her visiting teaching because she hadn't finished embroidering the cloths that were to go with her homemade bread that went along with her lesson. She missed the whole month. She also missed the simple principle of visiting teaching. The simple acts of listening, discussing gospel principles in solving life's problems, and building trusting friendships are what visiting teaching is really about. Having someone to go to when we need help, having a friend to laugh with, and sometimes having someone to cry with are all parts of the miracles of small and simple things.<br><br>In our families our greatest goals can be accomplished by simple means. By searching the memories of our own childhood and by being a little creative, we can make old-fashioned joys new again. Let's have fun without modern technology and without money. We can turn off the television and the movies. Let's read to our children, all cuddled up on the couch together. We can share the stories we read when we were children and laugh and remember. We could go to the library, come back with armfuls of books, and later tell each other what we've learned. We can take a walk around the block or in the yard and put nature's treasures in a brown paper bag. Let's talk and listen, play a board game, pop popcorn. We should appreciate the blessings that plainness can give your family.<br><br>Recently my husband and I made an unannounced visit to the home of a young couple with four small sons. They were all around the kitchen table, decorating cookies to give secretly to neighbors. The mother replenished the cookies and frosting and supplied a wide variety of leftover candy and sprinkles from past birthday parties and baking projects. The father sat with his sons--frosting, decorating, and being creative--sharing the fun and excitement over each treat. The love between them was strong. They enjoyed each other's company. They were best friends. This wasn't anything fancy, expensive, or complicated. It was simple. It was plain. It wasn't terribly unusual, and I'm sure that they have done many of these kinds projects together before. But it worked. Such simple things build family unity, trust, and love.<br><br>Our prophet, President Gordon B. Hinckley, along with other prophets before, has asked us to have family home evening weekly. Clear back in 1915, when the program began, President Joseph F. Smith stated, "If the Saints obey this counsel, we promise that great blessings will result. Love at home and obedience to parents will increase. Faith will be developed in the hearts of the youth of Israel, and they will gain power to combat the evil influence and temptations which beset them" (In James R. Clark, comp., <i>Messages of the First Presidency of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints,</i> 6 vols. [Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1965–75], 4:338–39). "By small and simple things are great things brought to pass" (Alma 37:6).<br><br>Family home evening is the Church's "weapon of mass construction." It builds families. It is the time when families learn the gospel together--sing, play, and pray together. It might seem like a simple thing--one day each week, maybe just an hour--but the benefits from family home evening are great. Our families will become stronger and more unified. I testify of this. My family has grown from the blessings of family home evening. My children, now all moved away, still talk about the lessons we had, the songs we sang, the projects we accomplished, and the memories we made.<br><br>The influence from family home evening can continue throughout generations. Our children enjoy and learn from family home evening. They then grow up, make friends, and have families, and the teachings go on. This inspired program not only ties our immediate family together, but the love and memories can bind generations to come.<br><br>Family home evening is where parents can bear their most sweet, heartfelt, and personal testimonies to their children. It is where they listen to their children's own first attempts at expressing their feelings for the Savior and their gratitude for blessings. It is a time of trust and acceptance within the family, before they try to express themselves to the world. Children and parents pray for each other and over each others' goals and concerns. Fathers and mothers hold personal interviews with their children, sharing and learning of their lives, goals, and needs. Families plan and schedule together, turning confusion into cooperation and support.<br><br>Future missionaries are trained in family home evening. On a mission, it may be hard to go to a home where young elders and sisters don't know the people or what to expect, especially when the language and customs are new. It's a different environment, and missionaries are sometime out of their comfort zone. But if they have been consistently taught in their homes through family home evening, they have resources on which to rely. They know how to pray. They know how to organize and give a lesson. They know how to lead music, how to fix a few treats, and even how to keep a younger, or older, boy or girl interested until the time is up. They have learned how to take turns answering questions and to listen to others with respect. And they understand the basic principles of the gospel as taught by their families. They have a head start in their confidence for a successful mission. From small things come that which is great (see Alma 37:6). That is the power of living with plainness.<br><br>The Lord gives us solutions to our problems and ways to accomplish our goals. He has shown us the way through His words and inspiration to our prophets. These ideas may be simple and plain and ones that the world may think foolish, but if we lack the obedience to try them out, we are the ones who lose out. Much like Naaman of old, we may not truly understand the power of simplicity.<br><br>As explained in 2 Kings, Naaman was captain of the armies of Syria, "a great man ... , and honourable, ... but he was a leper" (5:1). His wife had a Hebrew maid who suggested that he go to see the prophet to be healed from his affliction. He went first to the king of Israel and then to the home of Elisha, the prophet. He came with his riches--horses, chariots, gold, and silver--for he was a very wealthy man. Elisha didn't go out to meet Naaman, but rather sent a messenger to him, saying, "Go and wash in Jordan seven times, and thy flesh shall come again to thee, and thou shalt be clean" (5:10). But Naaman was offended and left angry. How dare Elisha only send a messenger. Wasn't Naaman better than that? And why wash in the Jordan River when there were nicer, cleaner rivers than that in his homeland? Naaman laments, "Behold, I thought, He will surely come out to me, and stand, and call on the name of the Lord his God, and strike his hand over the place, and recover the leper" (5:11). But Elisha did not. He chose simplicity. Naaman's servants went out to him to console and plea: "If the prophet had bid thee do some great thing, wouldest thou not have done it? how much rather then, when he saith to thee, Wash, and be clean?" (5:13). Naaman was humbled. "Then went he down, and dipped himself seven times in Jordan, according to the saying of the man of God: and his flesh came again like unto the flesh of a little child, and he was clean" (5:14).<br><br>Are we sometimes like Naaman? Would we do anything if only President Hinckley would ask us personally or if we were called to some great position in the Church? Do we have a preconceived notion of how it should be? Do we expect the Lord or His prophet to come and do great things in our honor? Is that what it takes for us to obey or understand? Or do we follow the simple authority and instructions given by his messengers? President Hinckley has asked us to have family home evening, family prayer, and family scripture study. He probably has not come to any of our door to ask, but he has given his instructions to his messengers--the Apostles, stake presidents, bishops, and other leaders. The instructions are simple, but they still work. They are lessons of living with plainness.<br><h2><b>Teaching with Plainness</b></h2><br>Jesus taught gospel truths with simplicity. He used clear, understandable language for those He taught. His stories and parables came from examples in their own lives: He spoke of shepherds, fishermen, lamps, oil, rocks, water, salt, and bread. His purpose was to clarify, not to confuse. Our Savior was the master teacher. His direct, plain approach was effective. People needed to easily know of His gospel and His teachings, for His time was short.<br><br>Is it so different now? Time is of the essence, and there is an urgency in our fast-paced world to understand and apply true gospel principles in this life. As a teacher of any group, teaching with plainness is necessary "that they may learn" (2 Nephi 25:4).<br><br>Sometimes in our callings as teachers, we get caught up in the "attraction" of the lesson. I've actually taught lessons when I've had to make three trips to the car just to get all of my decorations and visual aids for the room. There was a time when my handouts were the main focus, and I spent hours and hours on them. They were wonderful! If you haven't done this as a teacher, you've probably seen it in a class. Women seem to do this more than men. We don't see many priesthood lessons full of pictures, statues, flowers, draped cloths, and elaborate table settings. I think women do it because we are so conscientious in our desire to do well, or maybe it's because we're worried that we won't be as good as the woman who taught before; either way, it really isn't necessary.<br><br>I remember a time when Sister Sheri Dew, then a counselor in the general Relief Society presidency, came to our region to train stake Relief Society presidencies. We were so excited to meet her. The stake in charge had beautiful flowers and table arrangements in the room. Sister Dew greeted us and commented on her beautiful surroundings. She noted how lovely the flowers were and thanked the sisters who attended to all of the decorations. Then she picked up the flower arrangement, put it off to the side, and said, "Now, let's get to work."<br><br>She continued to teach about the importance of having the Spirit and realizing our callings. I learned some valuable lessons that day. It wasn't so much what she said as what I saw in myself, and I changed my concept of how I taught. I challenged myself to never again teach without simplicity.<br><br>We need to remember for whom we are teaching. We are teaching for our Lord--not ourselves--and we are teaching for the salvation of others. Nephi explains,<br><br><i>We talk of Christ, we rejoice in Christ, we preach of Christ, we prophesy of Christ, and we write according to our prophecies, that our children may know to what source they may look for a remission of their sins.</i> [2 Nephi 25:26]<br><br>Our purpose as teachers is simply to help bring others unto Christ.<br><br>We need to remember what we are to teach. We are commanded to teach the doctrine. In Doctrine and Covenants 88:77, we are given the words of the Lord: "And I give unto you a commandment that you shall teach one another the doctrine of the kingdom." Part of teaching the doctrine is using proper Church teaching materials--the lesson manuals, scriptures, and words of the prophets. Keep it plain and simple. There is no need to complicate our lessons with outside resources or speculation. I love this quote by President Heber J. Grant, "Teach and live the first principles of the gospel, and let the mysteries of heaven wait until you get to heaven" (qtd. in <i>Teachings of the Presidents of the Church: Heber J. Grant,</i> [Salt Lake City: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latterday Saints, 2002], 5).<br><br>We need to remember that only the Spirit can truly teach. We are only humble instruments by which the Spirit works. The Spirit is what touches the hearts and minds of those who listen and causes a change, not us. Nephi states, "When a man speaketh by the power of the Holy Ghost the power of the Holy Ghost carrieth it unto the hearts of the children of men" (2 Nephi 33:1). Our job is to not get in His way, to not distract, so He can do His work. Our job is to try with all our faith, humility, and prayer to have the Spirit for ourselves and for those we teach and to have an understanding of our subject matter. If we don't have the Spirit, our teaching will not be successful. We are plainly told so in Doctrine and Covenants 42:14: "And the Spirit shall be given unto you by the prayer of faith; and if ye receive not the Spirit ye shall not teach."<br><br>The gospel is plain, and it makes sense in its simplicity. We should not try to complicate it, or "[look] beyond the mark." Jacob says of the Jews:<br><br><i>They despised the words of plainness ... and sought for things that they could not understand. Wherefore, because of their blindness, which blindness came by looking beyond the mark, they must needs fall; for God hath taken away his plainness from them, and delivered unto them many things which they cannot understand, because they desired it.</i> [Jacob 4:14]<br><br>How I hope we appreciate the plainness of the gospel and teach it simply so that its understanding will never be taken away from us. May we always remember that our goal as teachers is plain and simple--to teach the doctrine for the Lord with the Spirit to the people so that they and their families may come unto Christ and return to live with our Heavenly Father.<br><h2><b>Speaking with Plainness</b></h2><br>Nephi sets the standard for plain speaking when he declares, "I glory in plainness, I glory in truth" (2 Nephi 33:6). The scriptures have always told us to be honest, truthful, direct, and clear, without pretense, deception, or hypocrisy (see 2 Nephi 31:13). In today's world, where confusion and contradictions abound, it becomes even more important to speak truth in plain and simple terms, especially in our responsibilities to guide and direct our families. The results can bring us our greatest joys. As the Apostle John says, "I have no greater joy than to hear that my children walk in truth" (3 John 1:4).<br><br>As parents it is critical that we teach our children to expect and accept simple, honest truth. It starts with open communication in the home, the first training ground. Most of children's social skills, life's expectations, and reactions are started in the home. We taught our children early that they could broach any subject, say or ask anything, as long as it was done in a respectful manner. As a family we have discussed just about every subject imaginable, family members giving their opinions and reasons openly, asking for ideas and solutions from each other. We don't always agree, but we listen and honor each other's right to one's own opinion. We don't always expect agreement--or even calm conversation--but we always expect honesty. It builds great confidence in individuals and unity for families if we'll just talk--simply, plainly--and keep talking. I know that when a child can come to ask any question to a parent and know that the answer will be honest and complete, he will come again. The comfort and trust level will grow for both.<br><br>We have special mantles as mothers and fathers of our children. We cannot give that mantle to anyone else. We should not expect someone else--a teacher, a youth leader, a bishop--to teach our children what we should be teaching. We cannot give up the responsibility. We should not be afraid to be parents.<br><br>Part of our responsibility is to teach our families about life, the reality of it all. "The Family: A Proclamation to the World" states:<br><br><i>Parents have a sacred duty to rear their children in love and righteousness, to provide for their physical and spiritual needs, to teach them to love and serve one another, to observe the commandments of God and to be law-abiding citizens wherever they live. Husbands and wives--mothers and fathers--will be held accountable before God for the discharge of these obligations.</i> [<i>Ensign,</i> November 1995, 102]<br><br>We must teach our families about consequences. That is what our Heavenly Father, the perfect parent, does with us. We must teach them about real life in plain and simple speaking so they can succeed in real life. We like to encourage and tell of all the blessings of life, but we must not neglect the sorrows and hardships as well. We must tell it like it is. How do we know how and what to say? We need to pray for guidance. We need to ask the Spirit to be with us as we speak and counsel our children. Jacob explains:<br><br><i>The Spirit speaketh the truth and lieth not. Wherefore, it speaketh of things as they really are, and of things as they really will be; wherefore, these things are manifested unto us plainly, for the salvation of our souls</i>. [Jacob 4:13]<br><br>Part of our responsibility as parents is to guide, direct, and warn if necessary. We need sometimes to ask the questions we don't want to ask, use the words we don't want to use, find out some things we may not want to know. Some topics must be covered as directly as their consequences are lethal--subjects such as modesty, drugs, pornography, and immorality. We must not be too shy to ask. We will probably be more shocked and embarrassed than our children, but we must have the courage to discuss. We cannot hide our heads and say that something can never happen to us or to ours. It can and it does. If we are to be leading, guiding parents, we cannot be the last to know.<br><br>Usually television, movies, and other media do not present reality. Their values don't reflect real-life consequences. They show that sexual activity before marriage is expected. In real life it's called expecting. They show only one side of life and forget to show the sorrows that many of these choices can bring. Is it any wonder that life's decisions have become so difficult for our children? There is much confusion in the world, and almost every choice is laid out before them. We can be catalysts to help our children learn discernment. Through the power of open, honest, plain speaking, we can give them the trust and confidence to know where to go for truth. We can teach them the power of the simple truths of the gospel. By meaning what we say and saying what we mean, we teach what truth is.<br><br>Many people say, "I could never speak that directly. I'm afraid I'd offend." Nephi instructs us concerning offenses when he speaks to his brothers: "Wherefore, the guilty taketh the truth to be hard, for it cutteth them to the very center" (1 Nephi 16:2). The offense is usually not meant by the speaker but taken only because it "cutteth ... to the very center." Why are we so afraid of speaking truth? Is being politically correct so important that we miss opportunities to warn, testify, change, or lift? We do always need to examine our motives when speaking plainly. We must never speak in anger or for revenge. Our purpose cannot be to hurt or gain power; if it is, it is not from the Spirit. If children are raised with plain speaking and expect truth, they have a much easier time accepting it without offense.<br><br>Honest speaking is as important in compliments as it is in questions and answers. There is great power in a true compliment. It can encourage and lift to great heights; but we all know the difference between a deserved compliment and one given only out of politeness. Find things that are truly good in people and tell them--plain and simple. We shouldn't wait until people die before expressing how much we love them or how much they've done for us. Eulogies are wasted on the dead. Let's lift the living! Think of the building we could do with more plainness--and our compliments will be believed because we are honest.<br><br>Plain speaking is one of the most valuable tools of sharing truth. Think of how missionaries challenge people to change their lives by obeying the Word of Wisdom, reading the Book of Mormon, praying, repenting, being baptized. It works because the challenge is simple, honest, and pure, and it is given for the loving benefit of others. It comes from the Spirit, as an expression of true charity. A testimony is the same. "It is a simple, direct declaration of belief. ... Testimonies are often most powerful when they are short, concise, and direct" (<i>Teaching, No Greater Call: A Resource Guide for Gospel Teaching</i> [Salt Lake City: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 1999], 43).<br><br>I have a testimony of simplicity, of the power of plainness in living, teaching, and speaking. I believe in honesty and truth. I know it is true that Heavenly Father lives and loves us and that we are His beloved sons and daughters. I know Jesus Christ is His Son and our Savior, who loved us and the plan of salvation so much that He atoned for our sins, opened the doors of resurrection, and gave us the possibility of exaltation. I know Joseph Smith restored this church, the Church of Jesus Christ, upon the earth in the latter days. I know President Hinckley is a prophet today, one who leads with truth. I am grateful for plainness, that I may learn. And I am grateful for this gospel--plain and simple. I say these things in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Claudia J.

<h1>World Ye Shall Have Tribulation: But Be of Good Cheer; I Have Overcome the World” - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
To the paralytic man lying helpless on a bed, Jesus proclaimed, "Be of good cheer" (Matthew 9:2). To the frightened Apostles battling the tempestuous sea, Jesus appeared on the water, declaring, "Be of good cheer" (Matthew 14:27). To Nephi the son of Nephi, who was subject to an arbitrary law threatening his life and the lives of other righteous Nephites if the signs prophesied by Samuel the Lamanite didn't occur, the Lord said, "Lift up your head and be of good cheer" (3 Nephi 1:13). As Joseph Smith met with ten elders about to be sent out, two by two, to missions fraught with trouble and danger, the Lord announced, "Be of good cheer" (D&amp;amp;C 61:36). In each instance the people had every reason to be anxious, fearful, and hopeless, yet the Lord directed them toward a reason to rejoice.<br><br>How does the Lord's admonition of cheer sound when it is applied to you and me in our world today? When economic uncertainties, terrorist threats, and corruption provide top stories for the evening news, where does the good news of the gospel intervene? When we experience personal loss in so many ways and on so many days, what is left to be cheerful about?<br><h2><b>The Key to Cheerfulness</b></h2><br>We find the key to understanding this seeming contradiction in the context of the Last Supper. Speaking to the Apostles in His final moments before Gethsemane, Jesus said, "In the world ye shall have tribulation, but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world" (John 16:33). "How was it possible for the Twelve to be of good cheer?" Elder Neal A. Maxwell asked.<br><br><i>The unimaginable agony of Gethsemane was about to descend upon Jesus; Judas' betrayal was imminent. Then would come Jesus' arrest and arraignment; the scattering of the Twelve like sheep; the awful scourging of the Savior; the unjust trial; the mob's shrill cry for Barabbas instead of Jesus; and then the awful crucifixion on Calvary. What was there to be cheerful about? Just what Jesus said: He had overcome the world! The atonement was about to be a reality. The resurrection of all mankind was assured. Death was to be done away with--Satan had failed to stop the atonement.</i> [<i>But a Few Days</i> (Salt Lake City: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 1983), 4]<br><br>I wish to focus my remarks today on the role of Christ's enabling power in our ability to feel cheer amid mortal gloom and doom. Misfortune and hardship lose their tragedy when viewed through the lens of the Atonement. The process could be explained this way: The more we know the Savior, the longer becomes our view. The more we see His truths, the more we feel His joy. But it is one thing to know that's the right answer in a Sunday School class and quite another to experience firsthand a cheerful outlook when current circumstances are far from what we hoped. If we would develop faith to apply the Atonement in this manner and not merely talk about it, awareness of imaginary finite boundaries, inadvertently placed on the Savior's infinite sacrifice, can be meaningful. Consider two false assumptions that, if pursued, will block our appreciation and access to the Lord's divine assistance.<br><h2><b>False Assumption 1--We Can Avoid Tribulation</b></h2><br>First is the false assumption that, if we are good enough, we can avoid having bad things happen to us and those we love. If we can just keep all of the commandments and pay an honest tithing and have daily prayer and scripture study, we can appease God, earn His good pleasure, and thereby assure ourselves of His protection from heartache, accident, or tragedy. When such thinking drives us, we "want victory without battle," Elder Maxwell observed, "and expect campaign ribbons merely for watching" (<i>Men and Women of Christ</i> [Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1991], 2). So trials will surely come, including when we are trying to do everything right. Elder Richard G. Scott warned, "Just when all seems to be going right, challenges often come in multiple doses applied simultaneously." He explains that a "reason for adversity is to accomplish the Lord's own purposes in our life that we may receive the refinement that comes from testing" ("Trust in the Lord," <i>Ensign,</i> November 1995, 16).<br><br>If we hold the belief that God will shield us from tribulation because of our obedience and then adversity strikes, we may be tempted to accuse God of not hearing our prayers or, worse, that He doesn't honor His promises. Obedience to God is not insurance against pain and sadness. Some unpleasant things just come with this telestial turf. Challenges have always been included in God's great plan to test our faith, to stimulate in us growth, humility, and compassion. Heartache and struggle were divinely designed to stretch us to where we have nowhere else to turn but to God.<br><br>The ground was cursed for Adam's sake, and Eve was promised that her sorrow (or hardships) would be multiplied (see Genesis 3:16–17). The Apostle Paul acknowledged, "There was given to me a thorn in the flesh,... to buffet me, lest I should be exalted above measure" (2 Corinthians 12:7). The Lord required Sariah to send her sons back into harm's way before she found her own conviction of God's will for her family (see 1 Nephi 5:1–8). Christ's mission was never intended to prevent hearts from breaking but to heal broken hearts; He came to wipe away our tears, not to ensure that we would never weep (see Revelation 7:17). He clearly promised, "In the world ye shall have tribulation" (John 16:33).<br><h2><b>False Assumption 2--We Can Trust in Our Own Efforts</b></h2><br>A second false assumption when we face tribulation can be just as destructive to our faith in Christ. We may conclude that hardships come because we haven't done enough good in the world.<br><br>We may believe that lifelong cheerfulness is achieved through our own management and efforts. After all, we are bright, capable, and resourceful women. When considering tribulation and the Lord's Atonement through this angle, we can look at the scripture that says, "It is by grace that we are saved, after all we can do" (2 Nephi 25:23), and deduce that we must first prove our worth through our obedience and our righteousness before the Lord's sacrifice will cover us or His grace enable us. Trusting in our own efforts rather than humbly acknowledging God is reflected in the term <i>self-righteousness.</i><br><br>When we look through the lens of our righteousness and take comfort in our good efforts, the idea of depending wholly on Christ (see 2 Nephi 31:19; Moroni 6:4) seems a bit risky. Listen to a series of domino-like sentiments that such a perspective can produce: What if I depend on God, but He doesn't answer me when I need His immediate help? With all the serious problems in the universe, why would He have time or interest in my personal crisis? Then again, if I organize my life carefully and think smart, I could resist temptation and not have to lean upon on the Lord for help at all. What is more, I will then not be one of those who contributed to His suffering in Gethsemane. If I just use my skills and brain, I can actually help the Lord rather than drawing on His strength. After all, so many people around here are in worse circumstances than I.<br><br>Unwittingly, when we reason this way, we sound eerily similar to Korihor's humanistic preaching in the Book of Mormon that "every man fared in this life according to the management of the creature; therefore every man prospered according to his genius, and that every man conquered according to his strength" (Alma 30:17), thereby arguing that his listeners had no need for Christ and His Atonement. "And thus [Korihor] did preach unto them, leading away the hearts of many,... yea, leading away many women, and also men, to commit whoredoms" (Alma 30:18).<br><br>Being fearful and unsettled by the unexpected, our faith in Christ fades into "gratifying our pride" by "our vain ambitions" (D&amp;amp;C 121:37). Such thinking easily leads to justifying wrongdoing because we are in control; we know better than others, so sin is not a problem for us. Our efforts focus on personal success to show that we don't need anyone else. If we can just get control over our world--our addictions in all their varieties, our eating disorders and obsession with thinness, our insistence that our house always be immaculate, our fascination with outward evidence of education and success--then we can finally be cheerful. The scriptural listing of women before men in the reaction to Korihor's teachings is curious wording. I don't know all that such wording could imply, but we can at least conclude that women were not exempt and maybe even particularly attracted to Korihor's "management of the creature" philosophy.<br><br>Christ declared, "In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; <i>I</i> have overcome the world" (John 16:33; emphasis added). He didn't say <i>you</i> must overcome the world or that He overcame the world just for the weak ones who weren't smart enough or strong enough to do it on their own. The Savior said, "<i>I</i> have overcome the world."<br><h2><b>Christ Has Overcome the World</b></h2><br>Prophets in every era have testified that Christ's grace is sufficient. <i>Sufficient</i> means "enough" or "as much as is needed." Prophets also remind us of our own nothingness and indebtedness to Christ; that we are less than the dust of the earth; that without Him we are unprofitable servants (see Mosiah 2:21–25); and that<br><br><i>no flesh ... can dwell in the presence of God, save it be through the merits, and mercy, and grace of the Holy Messiah....</i><br><br><i>... He shall make intercession for all the children of men; and they that believe in him shall be saved.</i> [2 Nephi 2:8–9]<br><br>The Apostle Paul learned that lesson. Arguably the best prepared missionary this world has known, Paul was brilliant in languages, highly educated in the Jewish religion, and well versed in the Greco-Roman culture and philosophy of his day. Drawing on his rich education and superior intellect, he attempted to teach the intellectuals of Athens about Christ as their "unknown God" (see Acts 17:23), quoting their poets and using their philosophy. While Paul's knowledge and presentation may have been impressive to his philosophical audience, his erudite approach in Athens produced a disappointing harvest.<br><br>From Athens, Paul traveled to Corinth, where he found tremendous success. Later, in an epistle to the Corinthian Saints, Paul explained his missionary approach among them--possibly a rethinking of his experience in Athens:<br><br><i>And I, brethren, when I came to you, came not with excellency of speech or of wisdom, declaring unto you the testimony of God.</i><br><br><i>For I determined not to know any thing among you, save Jesus Christ, and him crucified.</i><br><br><i>And I was with you in weakness, and in fear, and in much trembling.</i><br><br><i>And my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power. </i>[1 Corinthians 2:1–4]<br><br>Trusting that the Lord will support us in our trials and give us what to say and do in the moment that we need it can be frightening when we have become accustomed to relying on our own familiar skills. Why was Paul willing to set aside his educational prowess when it would clearly be impressive to investigators of his religion? He explained, "That your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God" (1 Corinthians 2:5).<br><br>The LDS Bible Dictionary describes grace as a<br><br><i>divine means of help or strength, given through the bounteous mercy and love of Jesus Christ....</i><br><br><i>... Through faith in the atonement of Jesus Christ and repentance of their sins, [individuals] receive strength and assistance to do good works that they otherwise would not be able to maintain if left to their own means.</i> ["Grace"]<br><br>The Atonement not only blesses us after we obey but is actually the power that sustains us while we do the deed. Likewise, Joseph Smith learned that "according to the grace of the Lord" (D&amp;amp;C 20:4), he was given "commandments which inspired him; And ... power from on high" (D&amp;amp;C 20:7–8). Because of Christ's magnanimous grace, He gives us commandments, not to curtail and restrict, but to inspire and strengthen us to understand and accomplish all that He invites.<br><br>When we look through the clarifying lens showing that Christ has already overcome the world, the scripture "It is by grace that we are saved, after all we can do" (2 Nephi 25:23) looks very different. What is "all we can do?" A group of converted Lamanites, the Anti-Nephi-Lehies, recognized the answer. Their leader wisely taught, "It has been all that we could do,... to repent of all our sins ... and to get God to take them away from our hearts" (Alma 24:11). These humble Saints desired to please God far more than receive their kinsmen's acceptance. They manifested their sincere repentance by burying their weapons of war and making a covenant with God.<br><br>We can do likewise. We can admit that we have sinned and need the Lord's redemption. We can confess His power and goodness and our constant need for His sustaining and strengthening influence. We can bury our weapons of war--tools we are prone to use to survive without Him that only serve to fortify our pride and self-righteousness. And we can make and keep our covenants with Him.<br><br>I watched a young student make that connection this semester. After studying the remarkable epistles of the Apostle Paul, she commented to the class:<br><br><i>Paul taught that the grace of Christ will make up for everything that we lack, if we will have faith in Him. During this semester, I was called to teach Gospel Doctrine in my ward. This was the scariest calling for me because I am just not one to stand in front of a class, especially for 45 minutes. But as I prepared for my first lesson, I remembered what Paul said about the grace of Christ. So I prepared everything that I could and then intensely prayed that the grace of Christ would make up for all I lacked. What happened was amazing. It was amazing because it wasn't me. The spirit was so strong and the lesson was powerful because the grace of Christ made up the difference between my preparation and what needed to be taught by the Spirit. His grace is a powerful gift. It is nothing that we earn.</i><br><h2><b>Be of Good Cheer</b></h2><br>Cheerfulness in the scriptural context connotes a divinely assured optimism, "a deep trust in God's unfolding purposes" (Neal A. Maxwell, "But a Few Days," 4), a grounded conviction that God will always keep His promises. When Christ proclaims, "Be of good cheer," He is not requesting a naïve, Pollyanna-like response to life's cruel twists and turns. Nor is He promising a pain-free life of constant bliss. Trial is no respecter of persons. Tragedy and hardship do not discriminate. Our world sees opposition among rich and poor, men and women, the righteous as well as the wicked. And while increasing dishonesty and vanity in our society are self-evident, the Savior specifically prayed that God would not take us "out of the world" (John 17:15). "In this world your joy is not full," He taught us, "but in me your joy is full" (D&amp;amp;C 101:36). How else do we learn that true satisfaction is found only by turning away from the world and coming to Christ?<br><br>Only after fearing the loss of her sons and realizing that her prophet-husband's testimony of Christ was not enough to sustain her own, Sariah found the Lord herself and declared,<br><br><i>Now I know of a surety that the Lord hath commanded my husband to flee into the wilderness; yea, and I also know of a surety that the Lord hath protected my sons, and delivered them out of the hands of Laban, and given them power whereby they could accomplish the thing which the Lord hath commanded them.</i> [1 Nephi 5:8]<br><br>She discovered that Christ's grace was sufficient. And when the sons returned to their father's tent, Nephi reported, "Our father ... was filled with joy, and also my mother, Sariah, was exceedingly glad" (1 Nephi 5:1). Naturally such gladness and cheer came because her sons returned safely. But such joy is also evident in her witness that the Lord's power enabled her sons to do good works that they otherwise would not have been able to do if left to their own means.<br><br>After suffering physical and emotional persecution throughout years of missionary labors, Paul landed in a Roman prison and then declared,<br><br><i>I have learned, in whatsoever state I am, therewith to be content.</i><br><br><i>I know both how to be abased, and I know how to abound: every where and in all things I am instructed both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to suffer need.</i><br><br><i>I can do all things through Christ</i> [who]<i> strengtheneth me.</i> [Philippians 4:11–13]<br><br>What does this mean for each of us here today? I can start by acknowledging that I have had tribulation from which no one else could deliver me but the Lord. Circumstances I would never happily choose have sent me to my knees and turned me to God. And, further, I anticipate additional trials down the road, because God loves me.<br><br>While the Lord clearly promises, "In the world ye shall have tribulation" (John 16:33), life's challenges are rarely the same for you as they are for me. I can also acknowledge that you have challenges that I will likely never experience, challenges and crosses that will be just as stretching for your soul as mine are for me. I can resist the temptation to assume the role of the Master Physician by announcing to you in your despair, "Be of good cheer" or "I understand just how you feel," being aware that it is from His voice that you and I both need to receive this message if we will be healed. He is the only one who truly understands our sorrow. Only He has felt our personal pain.<br><br>But I can also come to know the Lord and choose to bear witness of His supernal gift every time I have opportunity to speak or teach. I can realize that I will do more to help another person find the Lord by admitting my utter dependence on Christ in my actions and informal conversations than by parading a seemingly perfect outward appearance, which all too frequently communicates that I no longer need Him. We should be competing against sin, not trying to determine who needs the Savior less. When we acknowledge that we each face difficulties; that the Savior overcame the world; that He has lifted and strengthened and given vision to each of us in very personal ways, we will realize that we are never alone. We will feel a peace within even though the crisis without still rages. We will be filled with hope and even cheer.<br><br><b>Conclusion</b><br><br>The words of one of our sacrament hymns reflect great reason to lift our heads and rejoice:<br><br><i>No creature is so lowly,</i><br><br><i>No sinner so depraved,</i><br><br><i>But feels thy presence holy,</i><br><br><i>And thru thy love is saved.</i><br><br><i>Tho craven friends betray thee,</i><br><br><i>They feel thy love's embrace</i><br><br><i>The very foes who slay thee</i><br><br><i>Have access to thy grace.</i><br><br><i>Thy sacrifice transcended</i><br><br><i>The mortal law's demand;</i><br><br><i>Thy mercy is extended</i><br><br><i>To every time and land.</i><br><br><i>No more can Satan harm us,</i><br><br><i>Tho long the fight may be,</i><br><br><i>Nor fear of death alarm us;</i><br><br><i>We live, O Lord, thru thee.</i><br><br>["O Savior, Thou Who Wearest a Crown," <i>Hymns,</i> 1985, no. 297, vs. 2 and 3]<br><br>Brothers and sisters, Jesus Christ has indeed overcome the world! As darkness has no power when light appears, so the world cannot overcome or comprehend the Light of the World (see John 1:5). He is the Victor, come to earth "with healing in his wings" (3 Nephi 25:2) for both ourselves and those who disappoint us. He will not forsake us. He leads us along even when we don't know all the answers. Like Sariah and the Apostle Paul who found His matchless love in their distress, we too can know the Savior's grace in our profound need.<br><br>As the mother hen covers her chicks with her wings, so the Redeemer will surround us with His comprehensive power if we will come to Him (see Matthew 23:37). There is room under those wings for all of us, for He declares:<br><br><i>Wherefore, be of good cheer, and do not fear, for I the Lord am with you, and will stand by you; and ye shall bear record of me, even Jesus Christ, that I am the Son of the living God, that I was, that I am, and that I am to come.</i> [D&amp;amp;C 68:6]<br><br>True, we live in a time of war, a day of conflicts and terrors not only among nations but within our own hearts. But He who is the Balm of Gilead (see Jeremiah 8:22) is the Captain of all creation; only in Him is peace and serenity found. Amid all our mortal gloom and doom, Jesus Christ has overcome the world. Come, let us rejoice.<br><br><i>© Brigham Young University. All rights reserved.</i>

<h1> Life I Shall Have Joy” - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I was with three of my dearest friends, who asked about the title of this talk. As I struggled to remember, they tried to help: "Finding Joy Today"; "Joy in This Life"; "Joy Today, Gone Tomorrow"; "Where is Joy? Joy Who?"<br><br>My friend Madlyn finally said, "'There's No Joy in Mudville.'"<br><br>"That's it!" I said. "That's the title! 'There's No Joy in Mudville.'"<br><br>I have learned that, regardless of circumstance, for some people there is no joy; for others there is <i>only</i> joy. Some of us experience catastrophe in our lives; others <i>create</i> catastrophe in our lives. For some, there are a few bad days; for others there are <i>only</i> bad days.<br><br>This week I was reminded of one of those Mudville days. Honestly, I don't remember if all of these things happened on the same day--they all blur together in a fog on the joyless treadmill. But they really happened in proximity close enough to count as a bad day. I had finished long hours at work with a steady stream of student problems, faculty conflicts, and overdue reports. At home kids needed help with school problems, friend problems, and romance problems. We were living in our basement, ten months into a six-week remodeling project. We were out of cat food, so the cat was mad. But we were also out of what my son calls "human food," so the cat had to get in line. I mistakenly dropped a tax-refund check in the trash, which had gone to the street for the next day's collection, so the neighbors got to watch me rummage through my own garbage like a vagrant bag lady. Then, at the worst moment, the right front tire on my car was flat to the rim.<br><br>Sometime during all this, I made some soup for a family in our neighborhood. It was now after 10 at night, but I decided this was the only time I could deliver my pot of compassionate service. I convinced my husband that he should help me take it to a family where the father was very ill. I knew someone would still be up. So I held the soup in my lap while my husband drove the car, with the tire now repaired by AAA. (You think I am going to say that I spilled the soup, don't you? Well, I didn't! For this talk, there has to be some joy in the story.) I tiptoed to the porch and nudged my shoulder against the front door and knocked gently. I cautioned my husband to be quiet, thinking that a quiet interruption in the middle of the night somehow was more like charity.<br><br>From inside I thought I heard the doorbell ring and chided my husband, "I told you, don't ring the doorbell!" Then I heard it again. "Stop it," I said. He just looked at me with a blank face. I thought I could hear the doorbell ringing again and again. Finally, the granddaughter came to the door. "Hi," I whispered. "Sorry we are so late; we won't come in. We just wanted to let you know that we are thinking about you. I hope we didn't disturb you."<br><br>"Thank you," she said patiently, as she nudged me away in what I thought was going to be hug. As she pushed, she said, "You are leaning on the doorbell!" It was the end of a perfect day according to my personal mission statement, "No good deed goes unpunished--there's no joy in Mudville."<br><br>I also know of the days when washes of grief or despair nearly drown you; when it is all you can do to wake up and breathe one more time. I have had days like that. Following a turbulent marriage and the loss of my son, we had months and years of days filled with pain and stress and hassles.<br><br>Are you willing to pull your own handcart, but some days it feels like everyone else has climbed into it? The whole burden is yours, with everyone depending on you to pull and no one to share? You wonder, "Where is the joy in this life?"<br><br>On those days, whether bleak with despair or just full of last straws like leaning on the neighbor's doorbell, "there is no joy in Mudville." Do you feel like Casey at the bat, when the whole town waits with baited breath? It's the last inning; the score is 4 to 2; two men are on base; and two strikes are already against you. Everything depends on you, and, like Casey, you are poised to swing one more time to hit the ball with a crack. But instead the ball passes, and you swing with futility at the wind. Ernest Thayer's poem ends:<br><br><i>Oh, somewhere in this favored land the sun is shining bright;</i><br><br><i>The band is playing somewhere, and somewhere hearts are light,</i><br><br><i>And, somewhere men are laughing, and somewhere children shout;</i><br><br><i>But there is no joy in Mudville--mighty Casey has struck out.</i> ["Casey at the Bat"]<br><br>Do you feel like you have "struck out"? Are there days when you feel like joy is a doctrine that pertains only to the hereafter? How do we sustain a joyful life? How does one live every day joyfully and keep any semblance of sanity? I have discovered a few principles of finding joy.<br><h2><b>Joy Is an Act of Courage</b></h2><br>First, to live joyfully you must be brave. True joy is not for the fainthearted. You must decide to be happy. Joy is an act of courage. Joy will not abide until you make a conscious decision to treasure it. Ten years ago one evening in March, I was in the ward kitchen putting pink mints on glass plates for my niece's wedding reception. The organdy lace wedding apron was barely holding my soul together. I was quietly just hanging on spiritually and emotionally. It was a time in my life of little joy. My mother and her sister were talking together nearby. I heard my aunt ask my mother, "How is Elaine?" Mom responded, "I believe she has made a decision to be happy. She has a garden and flowers in her yard. She sews and writes, and she works hard. She keeps a clean house and plays beautiful music. Her children are doing well. I think she has decided to be brave and to be happy."<br><br>I wept a few tears as I eavesdropped on my mother's conversation. I was lonely, tired, and grief stricken. I didn't know if I had made a conscious decision to be happy. But hearing my mother's hopeful description of me, I wanted it to be true. So I did decide to be happy. I decided that night to find joy in every day. It has been difficult. But I was brave. I am not so brave every day, but I do try to remember that joy is a decision that requires courage.<br><br>In the book of Moses, we learn that after being driven out of the Garden of Eden, Adam and Eve made the decision upon entering this lone and dreary world to have joy. They had lived in a kind of paradise, having no needs, no hassles, no evil. But they learned that in order to have joy, they must know pain. More than that, they learned that to know joy in the face of pain requires courage. They wanted that experience for themselves and for us, their posterity. We read that Adam "blessed God and was filled, and began to prophesy concerning all the families of the earth," blessing the name of God as he said, "in this life I shall have joy" (Moses 5:10). "And Eve, his wife, heard all these things and was glad" (Moses 5:11). When Adam and Eve realized the cost of obedience, of enduring sorrow to meet God again, they decided that they would have joy. They made a decision. They were brave. When we learned of the divine plan of salvation before we came to earth, "when the morning stars sang together," we joined "the sons of God," and we too "shouted for joy" (Job 38:7).<br><h2><b>To Have Joy You Must Be Grateful</b></h2><br>After you find the courage to make a decision for joy, the next step is to be grateful. Gratitude is the gateway to joy. How presumptuous we are to question the trials of our lives. We are blessed to be born with the greatest daily comforts of any time or place in history. We are blessed to be here on this day to share in the feast of the word of God. This very morning my eyes caught the photograph of my healthy grandson. I walked past my nostalgic lilacs now in full bloom and watered my pots of new geraniums and daisies. Here in this room are people that I love. Surely I have reason enough for gratitude to open my heart to joy!<br><br>On 1 January 2002, I began a daily gratitude journal. (OK, I admit I got the idea from Oprah!) Every day I wrote five things for which I was grateful. I did not miss a day until Easter morning in April. On that morning I was called to be the ward Relief Society president. I believe that the act of being grateful, of thinking every day of five specific things for which I was thankful, helped me to be open to invite the Spirit, to freely love, and to accept the calling with joy.<br><br>I found that my gratitude journal filled nearly every day with little things, mostly with daily joys of my family. I began to ponder the memories of small moments of joys past. The more I meditated on things for which I was grateful, the more my heart became flooded with moments of joy--funny things my children had said, my Mom making goulash, my husband's pride at finding tickets to the sold-out opera, spreading with a kiss my ward's sisters quilt on a dear friend who was dying. From a daily focus on gratitude sprung a daily dose of joy.<br><h2><b>Joy Requires Forgiveness</b></h2><br>Even in the face of such daily joys, some of us suffer chronic sorrow or anger toward others who have hurt us. Joy requires forgiveness. Has your life been changed by pain of an event, loss, or action of your own or another? Is there a moment or a decision that you regret, that you want to take back and start again? Go to the Lord, forgive yourself, and let it go. Has someone hurt you? Take it to the Lord, find help to heal, forgive, and let it go.<br><br>Forgiving is not forgetting. The memory of the pain will always linger. It is because you remember that you must forgive, in order to allow joy into your life. Forgiving is not excusing or tolerating wrong or sin or living with hurtful behavior. Hold the person appropriately accountable, take appropriate action--then forgive. Do it for yourself. Give it to the Lord, find faith in the Atonement, and let it go. To forgive is not easy. It extracts all the strength you have. It requires practice over and over. But there is healing comfort in forgiving, and it frees the soul to welcome joy.<br><h2><b>Joy Comes from Service</b></h2><br>It is not enough simply to forgive others. Joy requires that we take the next step to serve others. I feel like I am on 24-hour call to serve others at the moment. I am a wife, mother, grandmother, ward Relief Society president, nurse, and dean. My friend Martha recently sent me a note that asked, "If it's true that we are here to help others, then what exactly are the <i>others</i> here for?" The "others" in my life expect me to be wise, helpful, organized, professional, and to have all the answers. May I share a secret? I don't have a clue! You know how it is. I make it up as I go!<br><br>My sister introduced me to <i>The Daffodil Principle,</i> by Jaroldeen Asplund Edwards. It is an enchanting story of a woman who planted 50,000 daffodil bulbs on a hillside over 35 years. She says she did it "one at a time. One woman, Two hands, two feet, and very little brain" until she filled five acres of a San Bernardino mountainside. Every spring it is a gift of joy: given one bulb at a time (<i>The Daffodil Principle</i> [Salt Lake City: Shadow Mountain, 2004], 23).<br><br>I know that you know, only too well, that when you take the time to serve another in time of need, when you unexpectedly wave and smile to the jerk who cut you off in traffic, when you surprise your daughter by cleaning her room, when you make those carbohydrate-killer potatoes for the funeral, you nearly always feel a little burst of joy, a sense that God is in His heaven and all is nearly right with the world.<br><h2><b>Joy Requires Your Presence</b></h2><br>In order to know joy, you have to <i>be</i> there. Joy requires presence. My friends know that if I were not too stingy to buy personalized vanity license plates for my car, I would choose my favorite word. The word is <i>vivace.</i> <i>Vivace</i> is an Italian word used in music. It <i>sounds</i> like music. It means life, lively, quickening. It sounds alive. It reminds me to wake up, to be acute and sensitive, alert, alive. It means vitality, <i>la joie de vivre,</i> vibrance, vigor. It reminds me to touch the palpable gift and reality of life.<br><br>Joy often lights in little fairy twinkles. I call them angel gifts. They are fleeting moments of sparkling enlightenment, like gentle kisses of meaning when everything comes together. They are little heavenly glimpses of eternal joy. Joy can happen quickly, so you have to pay attention.<br><br>If you are not present in your life today, you will miss the joy as it happens. We cannot change the hurts of the past, but we can let go of the grudges and reflect today on past joys. We won't recognize joy in the future if we don't practice noticing it today.<br><br>I once heard Annie Dillard say, "Grace happens anyway; the least we can do is be there." The least we can do is be there in our own lives. It is not enough to simply take breath. We must <i>live</i> every moment of life. We must find the joy that is there to be had anyway. This life today is part of our eternal life and a time to practice knowing eternal joy.<br><h2><b>The Message of the Atonement Is a Message of Joy</b></h2><br>The message of the Atonement is a message of joy. Our Savior knows our suffering. He took upon Himself our suffering that we might have joy. Joy is life. To have joy is to live life fully. The meaning of the Resurrection in our own daily lives is that He lives! He lives, and because He lives, we live. This truth brings meaning, purpose, and joy to our lives. It gives us a reason to get up every morning even in times of despair, to laugh with abandon, to embrace life. The good news of the gospel is for each of us to live. To live is to know joy in our own personal lives, every day, every now.<br><br>We don't live only after we die. We don't find joy only in the hereafter. We live today because of His gift of the Atonement. To live anew, repent, and begin again are gifts from our Savior. We can live again every day. Some days are exhilarating; some days are exhausting. Some days are full of pain and others are full of grace. I get up every day and say aloud, "OK, I am going to try this just one more time . . ."<br><br>The Atonement allows us every day to try one more time. For a while after the death of my son, this principle did not matter to me. It didn't matter if I died. I might have wished it. All I knew was his absence. The void without him was all there was. I had no sense of where he was or if he was. All I knew was that he was gone.<br><br>But the greatest gift of the Atonement is that it is real and there for us regardless of the state of our testimony. Whether we believe it or not, it is true. The Savior lives. His Atonement allows us to try again, to repent, to have hope, and to live. He suffered, died, and rose again for us, regardless of where we are in our belief or doubt about that reality. Sorrows and losses will come. We will sin and regret and need to try again. We will be hurt and need to forgive again. We will grieve and need to find joy again. We must help each other to remember the gift of life, that "men [and women] <i>are,</i> that they might have joy" (2 Nephi 2:25; emphasis added). Our very existence today is to know joy.<br><br>That night with the wedding mints, hearing my mother's conversation, I made a decision. Perhaps it was not a decision but a gift. But I decided that since I cannot die, then I must live. If I must live, then I am going to live fully, embrace life, and engage in each moment. I have little patience for those who are not engaged. I have little patience for those who see some hassles of daily life as matters of life or death (unless, of course they are my own hassles). I have little patience for those who don't understand my favorite word: <i>vivace.</i><br><br>The Savior lives, and because He lives, we live. It is this life, one day at a time now to forever, in which we find joy. We learn that with Martha on the path to the house of her brother Lazarus as she grieved his death, when the Savior said, "I am the resurrection, and <i>the life</i>" (John 11:25; emphasis added). We learn it with the disciples on the road to Emmaus (see Luke 24:13–32), with Paul on the road to Damascus (see Acts 9:3–5), and with Mary Magdalene at the empty sepulcher (see John 20:17). How many times need He tell us?<br><br>The truth, the sacred truth, and our gift of joy is that He lives. Because of the Atonement, we can repent of sin and give up our fears and all of those mortal burdens that diminish our life. Because He lives, we must live every day of our eternal life. That includes today. We must live to bear vibrant testimony. We must live in joy. If we, who know the truth of salvation and the truth of the mission of Christ, if we are not the very model of joy in this often thankless world, who is left to show the world what is joy? If we do not have joy, who will?<br><br>Let's move out of Mudville. Let's practice the joy described so many times in the Psalms: to "be glad and sing for joy" (Psalms 67:4), to "make a joyful noise unto the Lord" (Psalms 100:1; see also Psalms 81:1, 98:6), to "make a joyful noise to the rock of our salvation" (Psalms 95:1). With Isaiah, let us say, "With joy shall [we] draw water out of the wells of salvation" (Isaiah 12:3), and "I will greatly rejoice in the Lord, my soul shall be joyful in my God; for he hath clothed me with the garments of salvation, he hath covered me with the robe of righteousness . . . as a bride adorneth herself with her jewels" (Isaiah 61:10).<br><br>In the Book of Mormon, King Benjamin blessed his people with a promise and assurance we may receive today:<br><br><i>For the Lord hath heard thy prayers, and hath judged of thy righteousness, and hath sent me to declare unto thee that thou mayest rejoice, and that thou mayest declare unto thy people, that they may also be filled with joy.</i> [Mosiah 3:4]<br><br>I take this as permission and assurance from God Himself that in this life I may have joy, that joy is a divine principle whose eternal implications may be beyond our understanding but are significant to God Himself. I pray that today and always we may all find the courage, gratitude, forgiveness, service, and presence to honor our divine gifts of joy. "In this life [let us] have joy" (Moses 5:10).<br><br><i>© Brigham Young University. All rights reserved.</i><br><br><i>Elaine S.

<h1>he Lord with Gladness” - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I had been on my mission in Taiwan only a few months when Sister Newton was preparing to return home. Several sisters were visiting with her on the eve of her departure, and someone asked, "What's the most important thing you've learned on your mission?" After a moment's reflection, Sister Newton replied, "I've learned about the joy of serving the Lord. If I'm called to be the light-bulb changer when I go home, I'm going to do it to the very best of my ability!"<br><br>I don't know which comes first--serving the Lord with gladness or knowing there is joy in service--but I think they're very closely tied. I'd like to read all of the 100th Psalm:<br><br><i>Make a joyful noise unto the Lord, all ye lands.</i><br><br><i>Serve the Lord with gladness: come before his presence with singing.</i><br><br><i>Know ye that the Lord he is God: it is he that hath made us, and not we ourselves; we are his people, and the sheep of his pasture.</i><br><br><i>Enter into his gates with thanksgiving, and into his courts with praise: be thankful unto him, and bless his name.</i><br><br><i>For the Lord is good; his mercy is everlasting; and his truth endureth to all generations.</i><br><br>Clearly joy, service, knowledge of the Lord's greatness, and thanksgiving are intertwined. Unfortunately for those of us who are "musically challenged," singing is blended into the mix as well.<br><br>When I was a freshman at BYU, I was so looking forward to receiving a call and beginning to serve in my campus ward. During our first week in the ward, we filled out surveys indicating our talents, interests, and experience. About a week later I had an appointment with the bishop. After the introductory exchange he said, "Sister Nyland, we'd like you to serve as the Relief Society chorister." I nearly fell off the chair. I said, "But Bishop, I don't know anything about music." He was quite surprised at that and said, "Well, let's look at the cards." All of the data from our surveys had been entered onto punch cards (something many of you are too young to remember), and he stuck a skinny little knitting needle into the hole for music ability. Mine was the only card that came out of the stack as having no musical skill. He thought that was interesting, as did I, but he asked me if I'd like to try anyway. Well, I'd been raised to accept callings, so I told him that I would accept this call and ask my roommate to help me. Susan and I went to the basement of our dorm, and she sat at the piano, plunking out the melody with one hand and showing me how to lead it with the other. We practiced and practiced each Saturday. I did learn the pattern for 4/4 and 3/4 time, but I never could quite get the pattern to match the beat of the music. Mercifully, after about a month I was released, and my roommate was called to lead the music!<br><br>I have since learned that there are many ways to make a joyful noise in the Lord's service--whether or not you can keep the beat.<br><br>In thinking about this talk, I've reflected on the unique nature of callings in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. I have friends of many faiths, some of whom give tremendous service in their respective churches. But the comprehensive nature of the service given in this church is truly remarkable. Why do we do what we do? Why are we willing to put time, effort, and emotion into things that no one could pay us enough to do? I found an interesting entry in the <i>Encyclopedia of Mormonism</i> under "Lay Participation and Leadership" (Daniel H. Ludlow, ed., <i>Encyclopedia of Mormonism,</i> 5 vols. (New York: Macmillan Publishing Company, 1992), 2:814–16), and I'd like to read some of it to you. Remember that this encyclopedia was written for a non-LDS audience:<br><br><i>Lay participation and leadership have several implications for the Church and its members. Part of the mission of the Church is to perfect the Saints (Eph. 4:12), to sponsor growth in individual members. Utilizing volunteer members at all levels of the organization may not ensure peak efficiency, but it does provide the experiences and interactions that will help members progress.</i> [2:815]<br><br>It goes on to say that members must balance church callings with other family and employment responsibilities:<br><br><i>This provides the opportunity for learning to sacrifice and to balance commitments. In general, members who serve maintain a high level of commitment to the Church, in part because of their awareness that they are responsible for making a contribution and because they take satisfaction from doing so. . . .</i><br><br><i>The gospel teaches that this life is a preparatory state for the life to come and that all people are on a course of eternal progression. Lay participation plays an important role in that progression by providing opportunities for service and learning. Church callings offer many opportunities to develop practical skills and spiritual qualities that contribute to continued service and fulfillment throughout life.</i> [2:815]<br><br>The next section describes the fact that people often receive callings of increasing complexity or scope, but that these are not considered promotions. It then makes this wonderful statement:<br><br><i>The progression that is important, to the individual and to the Lord, is not evidenced by the different callings held by a person, but by the increase in Christlike characteristics developed through years of prayerful and thoughtful service. The potential for personal growth and righteous influence is as great for a nursery leader as for a stake president.</i> [2:815]<br><br>I want to read one last snippet from the <i>Encyclopedia of Mormonism,</i> this time from the entry for "Magnifying One's Calling":<br><br><i>Magnifying one's calling means taking callings seriously, following through responsibly, and realizing the importance of one's efforts. . . .</i><br><br><i>To magnify a calling means to make it honorable and glorious, even to glorify God through service. . . .</i><br><br><i>Those who seek to respond to the Lord's admonition to magnify their callings take even the simplest calling seriously as an opportunity to glorify God and serve his children.</i> [2:850]<br><br>From those entries, we are reminded about several important aspects of service:<br><br>1. service is designed to perfect the Saints and contribute to progression,<br><br>2. service teaches us about sacrifice and balancing commitments,<br><br>3. service is related to increased commitment to the Church,<br><br>4. service allows us to make a contribution and brings satisfaction,<br><br>5. service develops practical skills and spiritual qualities,<br><br>6. thoughtful and prayerful service develops Christlike characteristics,<br><br>7. the potential for growth is the same regardless of the calling, and<br><br>8. to magnify a call is to glorify God and serve His children.<br><br>What a system! We are sent to earth to be tried and proven and to learn to be like God. As members of the Church, we are then given callings to help us develop the very attributes that will allow us to return to our Father's presence. I think that the working out of our salvation rests in large part, very literally, on the work we do and service we render in fulfilling our various church callings. Elder Dallin H. Oaks said:<br><br><i>We need to remember the purpose of our service to one another. If it were only to accomplish some part of His work, God could dispatch "legions of angels," as Jesus taught on another occasion (see Matthew 26:53). But that would not achieve the purpose of the service He has prescribed. We serve God and our fellowmen in order to become the kind of children who can return to live with our heavenly parents.</i> ["I'll Go Where You Want Me to Go," <i>Ensign, </i>November 2002,<i> </i>70]<br><br>Now that's all well and good when you get the call you've always dreamed of, when you have all the time necessary to do it just the way you'd like, when you have all the skills necessary to fulfill your call to perfection, and when the people in your stewardship are loving, cooperative, and appreciative. But what about the other 99 percent of the time?<br><br>What about the times when you receive the call that has always scared you spitless, when your time demands at work, home, or the community have just escalated, when you feel like you don't have a tenth of the skills needed to carry out the call, and to top it off, when you're called to work with the teenagers (or toddlers or Cub Scouts or adults--fill in the blank with whatever group scares you)?<br><br>There is no magic wand to easily transform those frightening or disheartening situations into treasured ones, but there are several keys that can help.<br><br>First, remember whom you serve. In Mosiah 2:17 we are reminded that "when ye are in the service of your fellow beings ye are only in the service of your God." Service to our fellow men shows our love, devotion, and gratitude to our Heavenly Father. It reflects the depth of our understanding of His purposes for us and our willingness to put Him first in our lives. Elder Henry B. Eyring, in the April 2004 general conference, stated simply: "The Lord's Church has been restored, and so any call to serve in it is a call to serve Him" ("In the Strength of the Lord," <i>Ensign,</i> May 2004, 16).<br><br>In the October 2002 general conference, Elder Eyring said:<br><br><i>You are called to represent the Savior. Your voice to testify becomes the same as His voice, your hands to lift the same as His hands. His work is to bless His Father's spirit children with the opportunity to choose eternal life. So, your calling is to bless lives. That will be true even in the most ordinary tasks you are assigned.</i> ["Rise to Your Call," <i>Ensign,</i> November 2002, 76]<br><br>Elder Dallin H. Oaks gave this gentle reminder in the October 2002 general conference:<br><br><i>There is room for improvement in the commitment of some. . . . Some are not committed and faithful. It has always been so. But this is not without consequence. . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . If you are delinquent in commitment, please consider who it is you are refusing or neglecting to serve when you decline a calling or when you accept, promise, and fail to fulfill.</i> ["I'll Go Where You Want Me to Go," <i>Ensign,</i> November 2002, 69]<br><br>Remembering whom it is we serve is a two-part issue. To put a different spin on King Benjamin's words, when you seek to be in the service of your God, you can do it only by being of service to your fellow beings. Our brothers and sisters, our fellow beings, are the key to our being of service to God.<br><br>Do we truly recognize the importance of the people we serve? It is so easy to be put off by mannerisms, attitudes, or behaviors that mask true potential. I think C.S. Lewis captured some of what God sees when looking at His children when he said:<br><br><i>It is a serious thing to live in a society of possible gods and goddesses, to remember that the dullest and most uninteresting person you can talk to may one day be a creature which, if you saw it now, you would be strongly tempted to worship. . . . There are no</i> ordinary <i>people. You have never talked to a mere mortal.</i> [<i>The Weight of Glory and Other Addresses</i> (New York: Harper SanFrancisco, 2001), 45–46; emphasis in original]<br><br>We're not just serving people, we're serving people who have the potential to become gods and goddesses. We're serving people who are precious to their Heavenly Father. Sometimes that knowledge is very helpful to me when I'm worried about a lesson or talk I'm preparing. When I realize that Heavenly Father wants His children to learn and grow and progress, I realize that He will help me prepare something that will help them do that.<br><br>Earlier this month I was released from an eight-and-one-half-year stint as the institute teacher for my stake and a neighboring stake. I learned so many things while doing that, but one of the most important was the incredible awareness of how much the Lord wants His children to learn and understand the gospel. The many times I received inspiration and insight beyond my own capacity and knowledge about how to teach or illustrate something testified to me of God's concern for each of us.<br><br>And that brings me to the second key: Seek the Lord early and often. His ability to change hearts and minds, including our own, is amazing.<br><br>Shortly after I began attending a ward, the counselor in the bishopric asked to visit with me after Sunday School. He said, "Sister Nyland, we'd like to call you to serve in the nursery." I began to laugh, assuming he was kidding, and said, "Really, what would you like me to do?" He was a little taken aback by my laughter, but said, "Really, we'd like you to serve in the nursery." I immediately sobered and said I'd be happy to do that. Now, to tell you the truth, I wasn't happy to do that. I liked children in the abstract, but the reality of twenty-five toddlers was a bit much. I was quite comfortable teaching college students, because they were quiet, they hung on my every word (in case it showed up on an exam), and they never chased each other around the room or crawled under their desks. The best words to describe my first day the in the nursery were <i>shell shock</i>. I have never felt more unprepared, unskilled, and ill suited for a calling in my life.<br><br>I was smart enough to know that the nature of two-year-olds wasn't going to change much, so if I was going to survive this calling, I was the one who would need to change. I made that call a matter of prayer night and day, and each Sunday for six weeks the nursery was, frankly, a nightmare. Then on the seventh Sunday, when I walked into the nursery, it was like a switch had been flipped. I absolutely loved it! I loved the children; I had fun playing with and teaching them; I didn't even mind sitting on the floor. From that day until I was released, the nursery was one of the favorite callings I'd ever had. I was so grateful for that change of heart.<br><br>Paul says in Galatians 5:13, "By love serve one another." The Lord can help us feel the love that both leads to and comes from service.<br><br>Another reason to seek the Lord often has to do with increasing our abilities. Sometimes we already have the skills a particular calling requires, but sometimes we don't. When we don't, the task can seem impossibly large. Elder Eyring addressed that concern in the October 2002 general conference when he said:<br><br><i>Just as God called you and will guide you, He will magnify you. You will need that magnification. . . .</i><br><br><i>There will be times when you will feel overwhelmed. One of the ways you will be attacked is with the feeling that you are inadequate. Well, you are inadequate to answer a call to represent God with only your own powers. But you have access to more than your natural capacities, and you do not work alone.</i> ["Rise to Your Call," <i>Ensign, </i>November 2002, 76]<br><br>Faith that the calling is inspired leads us to faith that the Lord can strengthen our deficiencies and enlarge our capacity. Remember--He wants His children to benefit from whatever you are called to do, and He wants to bless you, as well. Very early in my mission experience I came across this statement by Elder Neal A. Maxwell: "God does not begin by asking us about our ability, but only about our availability, and if we then prove our dependability, he will increase our capability!" ("It's Service, Not Status, That Counts," <i>Ensign,</i> July 1975, 7). I found that enormously comforting as I was trying to perform my labors, all in Chinese.<br><br>Our feelings of inadequacy are probably calculated to turn us toward Heavenly Father. If we choose to turn toward Him through pondering and prayer, our reward is comfort, peace, and increased strength. As we experience those feelings and see our skills develop, it becomes even easier to serve the Lord gladly and with gratitude.<br><br>And the next key is gratitude. Doctrine and Covenants 59:21 says, "In nothing doth man offend God, or against none is his wrath kindled, save those who confess not his hand in all things, and obey not his commandments." To confess His hand in all things is another way of saying to express gratitude for all that the Lord has provided.<br><br>Have you ever tried the exercise of listing ten things for which you are grateful at the end of the day? It is really quite amazing how detailed the list becomes after a week or so. Realizing the source of all those blessings is at once humbling and awe inspiring. King Benjamin taught his people:<br><br><i>I say unto you, my brethren, that if you should render all the thanks and praise which your whole soul has power to possess, to that God who has created you, and has kept and preserved you, and has caused that ye should rejoice, and has granted that ye should live in peace one with another--</i><br><br><i>I say unto you that if ye should serve him who has created you from the beginning, and is preserving you from day to day, by lending you breath, that ye may live and move and do according to your own will, and even supporting you from one moment to another--I say, if ye should serve him with all your whole souls yet ye would be unprofitable servants.</i> [Mosiah 2:20–21]<br><br>I know that when I have an attitude of gratitude, I have a strong desire to serve the Lord; to show Him that I appreciate all that He has given me. We can never get the Lord in our debt, but we can demonstrate our gratitude through cheerful, glad service and by using our gifts to glorify Him.<br><br>The final key for serving with gladness is having both a firm testimony of the truthfulness of the gospel and a desire to build the kingdom of God. A firm testimony--built through prayer, scripture study, pondering, and keeping the commandments (you know, the usual things)--creates a desire to be of use in the kingdom.<br><br>The hymn "More Holiness Give Me" includes these lines:<br><br><i>More fit for the kingdom,</i><br><br><i>More used would I be,</i><br><br><i>More blessed and holy--</i><br><br><i>More, Savior, like thee.</i><br><br>[<i>Hymns,</i> 1985, no. 131]<br><br>I really like the image those lines portray. When our deepest desire is to be more fit for the kingdom and to be of more use in it, we're able to swallow, smile, and serve when asked to do something we'd really rather not do. A recognition of the intricate pattern the Lord is weaving in the lives of each of His children gives us a sense of responsibility to be sure the thread we offer is acceptable.<br><br>Let me illustrate. When I was a Primary president, a counselor and I were visiting the home of a less-active child. In our very enjoyable conversation with the mother, we learned that she didn't know who her visiting teachers were, didn't know who her home teachers were, and didn't know who her child's Primary teacher was. Later that evening, I began thinking about how amazing it would be if every person in the Church truly fulfilled, to say nothing of magnified, his or her calling. Think of the web of love and support that would be woven around each member if every home teacher, visiting teacher, Sunday School or Primary teacher really understood and carried out his or her call. Think of what it would mean if every Scout leader, every Young Women leader and every Relief Society teacher and Home, Family, and Personal Enrichment committee member attended to their stewardship. Think of the strength of the web woven by so many strands of dedicated service.<br><br>The analogy of the body in 1 Corinthians 12:12 is so fitting as we think about serving in our callings: "For as the body is one, and hath many members, and all the members of that one body, being many, are one body: so also is Christ." Then Paul says, "If the foot shall say, Because I am not the hand, I am not of the body; is it therefore not of the body?" (1 Corinthians 12:15). He is emphasizing that each member needs to realize that it is important to the functioning of the whole body precisely because it is different from the other members. Paul brings it back to the Church in verse 25: "That there should be no schism in the body; but that the members should have the same care one for another."<br><br>Our testimonies let us trust that we are part of a very important pattern in building the kingdom of God, even if we can't see it in its entirety. Every skill, talent, and ability we have, whether inborn or developed in callings or other areas of our lives, helps us be more serviceable in the kingdom.

<h1>ike a River” - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
A few years ago, a film crew and I climbed into a rented green van at the Boston airport and set off up the coast to trace the unfolding of the Restoration. It was March--cold and blustery with sheets of ice and snow. We started in Topsville, Massachusetts, where Joseph Smith's ancestors settled and had a pew in the church on the commons. Taking each historic site in sequence, we then drove to Sharon, Vermont, the birthplace of the Prophet Joseph. It was a serene, somewhat isolated setting.<br><br>Next we went to Palmyra to that grand stand of trees--the Sacred Grove. I had been there several times. With each visit I felt the spirit of that setting. There, young Joseph Smith spoke to the Father and the Son, face-to-face. And reality changed forever. Church President Joseph F. Smith described it as "the greatest event that has ever occurred in the world, since the resurrection of the Son of God from the tomb and his ascension on high" (<i>GD</i>, 495). Think about it. From that moment Joseph Smith knew more about our Father in Heaven and our Savior, Jesus Christ, than anyone alive.<br><br>The Restoration is marked by significant settings like the Sacred Grove that string across America. But it is much more than rebuilt cabins, monuments, and places on a map. Joseph Smith described the Restoration as<br><br><i>a work that God and angels have contemplated with delight for generations past; that fired the souls of the ancient patriarchs and prophets; a work that is destined to bring about the destruction of the powers of darkness, the renovation of the earth, the glory of God, and the salvation of the human family.</i> [<i>HC</i> 4:610]<br><br>There is grandeur in the Restoration.<br><br>Elder Jeffrey R. Holland has taught:<br><br><i>The simple truth of the matter is that without the Restoration, the great Plan of Salvation would be forever thwarted . . . and the full blessings of the Atonement . . . would have been lost to almost all of God's children, past, present and future.</i><br><br><i>Almost all the work for the living and for the dead falls on the shoulders of the Dispensation of the Fulness of Times. Not Adam's time, or Noah's time, or Abraham's time . . . nor Peter's or Paul's in the Meridian of Time. Those churches and those efforts ended in disarray and decay, and they ended quickly.</i><br><br><i>Without the Prophet Joseph Smith, we . . . would be left with fragmented scripture, unrelated doctrine, conflicting opinions, uninspired practices that over time became binding traditions.</i><br><br><i>This is what existed prior to 1820.</i> ["Quotes by Members of the Twelve During New Mission Presidents Seminar," <i>Church News,</i> 6 July 2002, 13]<br><br>As it falls on our shoulders, our responsibility in the Restoration is sobering. We have work and responsibility that is ours alone. And, increasingly, we are standing alone. In my earlier life, I was a news junkie; but I can hardly stand to watch or listen to the rancor today. Crisis management has become a profession; there are few if any happy endings at the movies; television sitcoms herald what is clearly the underbelly of society; power has become a commodity brokered, sold, and abused; and recent studies show that stress is the reason we are fat. I thought it was the brownies I eat for breakfast.<br><br>President Harold B. Lee said,<br><br><i>We have been called to difficult tasks in a difficult age. . . . The converging challenges posed by war, urbanization, dilution of doctrine, and domestic decay surely provide for us the modern equivalent of crossing the plains, enduring misunderstanding, establishing a kingdom throughout the world in the midst of adversity.</i> [<i>Teachings of the Presidents of the Church: Harold B. Lee</i> (Salt Lake City: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 2000), 214]<br><br>No war, threat of terror, disappointment, absence of decency, morality, or civility can penetrate the peace promised by the Lord. That peace came with the Restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ. The ancient prophet Elisha understood peace and tumult. When he and his young servant arose early and went forth, "an host compassed the city both with horses and chariots. And his servant said unto him, Alas, my master! how shall we do?" (2 Kings 6:15). Can't you just see the servant thinking, <i>This is not good. Two of us, so many of them</i>? Elisha responded with calm: "Fear not: for they that be with us are more than they that be with them" (2 Kings 6:16). And then he asked that the Lord open the young man's eyes that "he may see. And the Lord opened the eyes of the young man; and he saw: and, behold, the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire round about Elisha" (2 Kings 6:17). So it is with us. As members of the Church of Jesus Christ, we gather in wards, stakes, and districts around the world, and we are promised, "My Spirit shall be in your hearts, and mine angels round about you, to bear you up" (D&amp;amp;C 84:88). With testimony of the Lord and His ways come peace.<br><br>I learned much more about peace in Harmony, Pennsylvania, during the tour of Church sites I mentioned earlier. I was not particularly interested in going to Harmony. In my mind I had already jumped ahead to Kirtland, Ohio. Kirtland was a happening place: Joseph saw the Lord Jesus Christ standing upon the breastwork of the pulpit in the temple at Kirtland; angels walked on the roof of the temple in the middle of the day.<br><br>But first the trip to Harmony. Harmony was a quiet little burg when Joseph Smith lived there and translated the gold plates. Today, it's not even a town. It's name, though, holds great significance, for here it was that heaven and earth came into harmony. A statue stands alone on a grassy plot; no Church missionaries, no visitors' center. It is isolated from the world. There is nothing but the Susquehanna River. When we left the highway in the van, we rumbled down a pot-holed dirt road past the cemetery where Joseph and Emma's infant son is buried, crossed railroad tracks, and stopped in a marshy field. We got out and walked to a thicket of trees that edged the river.<br><br>And then we walked down to the water.<br><br>I wasn't prepared for Harmony. In ancient times Moses heard the voice of God from the burning bush: "Put off thy shoes from off thy feet, for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground" (Exodus 3:5). The Susquehanna setting is also holy ground. In another dispensation, Saints had stood at the waters of Mormon and were "baptized in the name of the Lord" and felt His Spirit pour out of the heavens upon them (Mosiah 18:10). It was the same for me at that river.<br><br>There, the Aaronic Priesthood was conferred by John the Baptist upon his "fellow servants" (D&amp;amp;C 13:1). That priesthood "holds the keys of the ministering of angels, and of the gospel of repentance, and of baptism by immersion for the remission of sins" (D&amp;amp;C 13:1). Not long after, the Melchizedek Priesthood was restored with the authority to bestow the gift of the Holy Ghost, ordain, heal, bless, comfort, and seal for the eternities. Oliver Cowdery referred to that time as "days never to be forgotten" (JS--H 1:71, see footnote).<br><br>Today, peace still ripples down the Susquehanna. I felt it--I who had my eyes on Kirtland. And isn't that the way it is? The Lord's ways are not "in the wind" but in the "still small voice" (1 Kings 19:11–12). I had been looking for what I thought were the grandstand moments of the Restoration to compete with the grandstand actions of the adversary. Instead, I found "peace . . . like a river" (Isaiah 66:12)--steady, directed, clear, catching and reflecting the light from above.<br><br>These words of Isaiah point clearly to our source of peace: "For thus saith the Lord, Behold, I will extend peace . . . like a river."<br><br>The Restoration is all about that peace. It is about knowing that, notwithstanding the anxieties afloat in the world, Jesus Christ, our Savior, suffered and atoned for our sins. He lives. He loves us and He knows us. He has gone "to prepare a place for [us]" (John 14:2). The holy priesthood of God has been restored to the earth, and we are blessed beyond earthly measure by that authority. We have covenanted to take His name upon us. Many of us have made further covenants in the holy temple, the house of the Lord. With this knowledge comes peace. Jesus Christ said, "My peace I give unto you: not at the world giveth, give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid" (John 14:27).<br><br>Peace comes from the Spirit testifying to our spirit, "Happy day! All is well!" ("Come, Come, Ye Saints," <i>Hymns,</i> 1985, no. 30). Think of the context of that familiar phrase. The Saints were crossing the plains; they were burying family members and walking on. I can't imagine the challenge. And yet they "[pressed] forward with a steadfastness in Christ" (2 Nephi 31:20). They relied on the words of the Lord: "Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid" (John 14:27). Why? Because of revealed truth--that He lives.<br><br>President Boyd K. Packer described looking at a two-year-old grandson and thinking,<br><br><i>"What kind of a world awaits him?"</i><br><br><i>. . . Everywhere we go fathers and mothers worry about the future of their children in this very troubled world.</i><br><br><i>But then a feeling of assurance came over me. My fear of the future faded.</i> ["Do Not Fear," <i>Ensign,</i> May 2004, 77]<br><br>Assurance and peace, they are the same.<br><br>Still, the adversary is attacking the very heart of God's plan for His and our family. When our prophet, seer, and revelator Gordon B. Hinckley presented the "The Family: A Proclamation to the World" in 1995 at the general Relief Society meeting, he calmed our fears for the family with these prophetic words:<br><br><i>Sacred ordinances and covenants available in holy temples make it possible for individuals to return to the presence of God and for families to be united eternally. . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . The sacred powers of procreation are to be employed only between man and woman, lawfully wedded as husband and wife. . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . Parents have a sacred duty to rear their children in love and righteousness. . . .</i><br><br><i>The family is ordained of God. Marriage between man and woman is essential to His eternal plan. </i>[<i>Ensign,</i> November 1995, 102]<br><br>Jesus Christ said, "In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world" (John 16:33). Think about it. Peace comes in having a witness of the Spirit that He, the Lord Jesus Christ has already overcome the world. For us. In knowing that, we know the adversary is fighting a losing battle. This work will march on just as the Susquehanna flows to the ocean.<br><br>What gets in the way of our peace? For many of us it is busy lives. We have perfected marathon mothering--the daily race of getting to the finish line, one step in front of the other, grabbing a drink before we pass out, not thinking about our time because we know we are so off pace. So we just plan to run faster and, next time, get running clothes that match the number so we'll look better. We are all too busy: too busy to "meet together oft" (Moroni 6:5) as the scriptures say; too busy to read the scriptures; too busy to ponder their meaning in our lives and to find the direction, solace, and peace that we so desperately need. President Gordon B. Hinckley has counseled us, "There is a better way than the way of the world. . . . It is so tremendously important that the women of the Church stand strong and immovable for that which is correct and proper under the plan of the Lord. . . . They must begin in their homes" ("Standing Strong and Immovable," Worldwide Leadership Training Meeting, 10 January 2004 [Salt Lake City: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 2004], 20).<br><br>Does the Spirit of peace abide in our homes? The Susquehanna River was home to the Lord's restored peace. We invite the Spirit into our homes by the way we live the Lord's commandments, by our priorities, and by the way we follow the prophet. He has asked us to hold regular family prayer, to have family time at dinner, to hold family home evening and counsel together, to study the scriptures and the words of our living prophets as a family, to bear testimony to our children and grandchildren, nieces and nephews. We need to help them know that we know that Jesus Christ is the Redeemer of the world, that we are accountable to the Lord for our actions, that our Father in Heaven loves us, and that through the mission of our Savior Jesus Christ, we can return to Him. My question is this: How are we doing? What can we do differently so that peace abides in our homes?<br><br>We are counseled in the scriptures, "Lift up an ensign of peace" (D&amp;amp;C 105:39). We are that ensign. People watch us and they will be watching more if, as President Spencer Kimball counseled, we are "different--in happy ways" (<i>My Beloved Sisters</i> [Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1979], p. 44). They will watch more if we distinguish ourselves by dressing modestly and being examples to our daughters, who also watch our ways. They will watch more if we are treating one another with charity, forgiving and then forgetting, acting with integrity and honor, and living providently. These bring peace.<br><br>Peace comes by inspiration. When the Lord said to troubled Oliver Cowdery, "Did I not speak peace to your mind?" (D&amp;amp;C 6:23), He taught us a great lesson. We must learn to hear and feel the language of the Spirit. Then we will know when prayers are answered and when the Spirit is directing us.<br><br>A few years ago I was writing about the Prophet Joseph Smith. I did not view myself as the obvious choice for that assignment, as servants of the Lord go. My credentials were more being "steadfast and immovable" (Mosiah 5:15) than being an expert on the Joseph Smith story. I had to become an expert--on the job. When you think about it, most of our work for the Lord is like that. He calls us to do things so that we can learn how to do them. I gave days and nights for more than two years to study and write about Joseph Smith. It was consuming. I love him as the prophet of the Restoration. I came to understand his single-minded devotion to the cause of Christ, his willingness to give his life for the work of the Lord. I testify to you that he was and is a prophet of God.<br><br>I wanted, more than anything, to get the story of his life right--for him. I wanted to tell of his nobility, goodness, devotion to the Savior. I could almost hear him testifying of the work of the Lord. But here's the rub. When I finished with my writing and watched it move forward to print and screen, there was an ache in my soul. I felt it wasn't good enough.<br><br>Day after day I walked in the cemetery near my home thinking that all those pioneers buried row upon row could somehow help me. (It was an odd place to search for peace.) I struggled with the thoughts that I had let Joseph Smith down. Worse, I had let the Lord down. Yet I had tried so hard. Perhaps some of you identify. You too may have unresolved issues or efforts in your own life. You've done all you can do. Your desires are righteous. You've put them before the Lord and hoped for resolution.<br><br>And there's the lesson. We seek resolution, saying, "Fix this, Lord," instead of seeking peace.<br><br>To the beleaguered Saints clutching to life in tents and dugouts along the bank of the Mississippi in 1840, the Prophet Joseph Smith said, "I intend to build a temple as great as Solomon did if the Church will back me up." And then this personal desire: "If I can behold that temple completed . . . I will say, 'O Lord it is enough. Let thy servant depart in peace'" (<i>Words of Joseph Smith: The Contemporary Accounts of the Nauvoo Discourses of the Prophet Joseph Smith,</i> comp. and ed. Andrew F. Ehat and Lyndon W. Cook<i> </i>[Provo: Brigham Young University, 1980], 418<b>??</b>). It seems a fair request from a man whose whole life was given to the Restoration, who had faced mobs, been tarred and feathered, experienced repeated financial reverses, had friends turn against him, and been unjustly jailed time and again. Would he live to see the temple completed and the power of the priesthood unite families for the eternities? No.<br><br>Two years later, in May 1842, with the temple not yet above ground and baptisms for the dead being conducted in the cellar font, Joseph Smith knew the Lord was not going to grant him his worthy wish. Without waiting to complete the temple, he invited nine men into his Red Brick store and gave them the endowment. Over the next two years, nearly sixty men and women received their endowments from the Prophet Joseph. Bathsheba Smith, my third great-grandmother, was one of them. She wrote at the time, "[We felt privileged to be] led and taught . . . by the prophet himself who explained and enlarged wonderfully upon every point" (Diary of Bathsheba Wilson Bigler Smith, in author's possession). The work of the Restoration would roll on without him. Peace is often spoken in these words: "Not my will, but thine, be done" (Luke 22:42).<br><br>So there I was, walking in the cemetery, weeping as I talked out loud to the Lord, and knowing it was too late for Him to fix the book or documentary. The men mowing the lawns were looking at me. They thought I was talking to myself. They thought I was crazy. And then in this obscure and unlikely setting, a thought came to me. (Isn't that the language of the Spirit?) It was this: <i>Joseph Smith wanted more than anything to see the temple completed. He had to give the endowment in the Red Brick Store. It wasn't the way he wanted it, but it worked.</i> It worked for the Restoration. It worked for Joseph--he did all the Lord asked of him. So had I. "My peace I give unto you" (John 14:27) still sounds in my soul. As Joseph Smith rode to Carthage, he turned in his saddle to catch one last glimpse of Nauvoo from up on the bluff, the half finished temple before him, the Mississippi River winding along. Then he rode on to Carthage, "calm as a summer's morning" (D&amp;amp;C 135:4). Circumstances had not overwhelmed his soul. Peace was his. It can be ours.<br><br>Our prophet has asked us to do the very best we can ("Standing Strong and Immovable," Worldwide Leadership Training Meeting, 10 January 2004 [Salt Lake City: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 2004], 21); and the Lord has urged us to "be still and know that I am God" (D&amp;amp;C 101:16). I knew my offering had worked because I had felt it. Faced with the reality of his shortened tenure, Joseph Smith did the very best he could in the unfolding of the Restoration. And it worked.<br><br>The Lord has called us to "stand . . . in holy places, and be not moved" (D&amp;amp;C 87:8). The Restoration has made a mark in places all over the world, through temples, in particular. Elder Dallin H. Oaks "[borrowed] a metaphor from the familiar world of athletic competitions" in describing the latter days. "We do not know when this game will end, and we do not know the final score, but we do know that when the game finally ends, our team wins" ("Preparation for the Second Coming," <i>Ensign,</i> May 2004, 10).<br><br>If anyone should be at peace in their souls, it is us. We know the Lord is on our side. He has overcome the world--for us. Not everything in our lives will turn out the way we want it, but if we give place for and honor to the Restoration in our lives, it will work. And we will have peace--flowing from us--like a river. As the Apostle Paul said, "The peace of God, which passeth all understanding, shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus" (Philippians 4:7). Of this I testify in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Heidi S.

<h1> of Relationships - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I am very grateful for my affiliation with this university. Five of my children have also enjoyed attending BYU. I remember one of them suddenly becoming aware of changes in his life after he entered BYU following service as a missionary. He had dated in high school and had had a lot of fun just "hanging out" with girls. After his mission he resumed dating and expected the same casual fun and games. He returned from his first postmission date, however, somewhat pale and shaken. When I asked about the date, he replied, "This is not just high school fun and games. These women are playing with real bullets." Yes, you are not just playing a game at this stage of life. This is for real.<br><br>The young adult years lay the foundation for your future. Changes in relationships are one of its most powerful challenges. Leaving the home and family environment, living with roommates, making new friends, and establishing the relational habits for eventually marrying and building a family of one's own are challenges that become very real. Relationships form the very basis of the gospel of Jesus Christ. Christ taught that all of the gospel laws hang on our ability to love God and others (Matthew 22: 37–40). All of God's laws are ultimately laws of love. Every commandment is given out of love for you and concern for your happiness. Every commandment ultimately tests your ability to love Him and your fellowman.<br><br>Just as God has a gospel of relationships, Satan proposes counterfeit principles that eventually lead to the destruction of relationships, both with God and with others. God teaches you to love others and to learn to live in a Zion society. Satan encourages jealousy, competition, and uncharitable judgments. These keep you from feeling close and connected to others. God teaches you eternal progression and faith in the Atonement, while Satan teaches its counterfeit--perfectionism--which destroys your confidence in yourself and others. God teaches eternal marriage, where love lasts forever. Satan encourages relationships that are selfish and end when they become inconvenient. I would like to discuss these three principles and their counterfeits in the context of what I have learned about relationships from the gospel of Jesus Christ, my work as a clinical psychologist, and 34 years of happy marriage.<br><br>I once took my little grandson to a seafood restaurant. They had a large tank full of live lobsters. My grandson watched with awe as the lobsters moved around in the tank, seemingly oblivious to the fact that they would soon be selected for somebody's dinner. My grandson watched entranced for a while and then asked me, "There is no lid on the tank and it's not very deep. Why don't the lobsters just crawl out and go home? And then nobody will eat them." We watched for a few minutes more, and then I noticed a curious phenomenon. If one lobster began to try to crawl out of the tank, the others would grab, pull, push, or tug to get the lobster back down into the tank. None could escape and go home because they were all too busy pulling each other back into the tank. I wondered what would happen if they ever figured out that if they could lift and help each other, there might not be any more lobster on the menu of that restaurant.<br><br>Sometimes people behave like the lobsters. If one gets a little ahead or looks like they might have figured out a way to safety, others clamor to pull them back, and in so doing, no one escapes. Why do people do this? Is it jealousy?<br><br>Look around you. Notice how much people vary. They vary not only in appearance but also in their personalities, life experiences, mortal challenges, and missions here on earth. When we become aware of those differences we may feel jealous of others. Yet the scriptures teach that there are reasons for our differences. We learn from the scriptures that "all have not every gift given unto them" (D&amp;amp;C 46:11). We are all given weaknesses to teach us humility and compassion (1 Corinthians 1:27, 2 Corinthians 12:10, Ether 12:27). We also are different so that we each might have something to contribute and some way to belong (1 Corinthians 12:14–22, 25, 26). When we learn to love each other and have respect for our different abilities, we prepare ourselves to live in a celestial order. Each person edifies the other, and then the whole can become a Zion society.<br><br>God teaches us to love one another, and yet you may still find yourself experiencing feelings and thoughts that are less than loving. Sometimes it is a challenge to stop being jealous and wrongly judge each other. We all see "through a glass, darkly" (1 Corinthians 13:12). Our personal experience is limited. It is often easy to look at another's situation and believe that we see it accurately when, in fact, we do not. It is easy then to come to believe that you can "work out another's salvation" for them because <i>you</i> know what is wrong with their life. However, we do not always know another's private challenges, sorrows, and disappointments. Even more important, we do not know God's unique plan for that person's life and may risk prescribing the wrong solutions. When we judge uncharitably and attempt to prescribe solutions for other people's lives, we run the risk of speaking counter to the Lord's will for that person.<br><br>Let me illustrate with an object lesson. Here is a pair of glasses that was prescribed for me. The optometrist did a careful examination of my eyes and discovered that I must meet some specific needs to see correctly. These glasses are bifocals. They are also especially ground for a prescription that is a –11 in one eye and a –13 in the other. I suspect there are few individuals in the audience that would see well out of these glasses. Think what your experience would be like if I insisted that you wear my glasses every day to do your work. They work great for me, but what if I assumed that they would also be perfect for you and imposed that solution on you? You would be miserable, and you would probably resent me for imposing the wrong prescription on you. Even more important, with my prescription you could not do the work that is yours alone to do. God is the one who must fit the prescription for each of us. Only He has the knowledge and wisdom to know our unique needs.<br><br>How does He reveal His will to an individual? One of the greatest gifts you have with which to work out your own salvation is the gift of the Holy Ghost. The Holy Ghost can help each of us understand what the Lord would have us do. The Holy Ghost, however, is like the Liahona of old in that it works on condition of our obedience to commandments. In addition, we have the words of both ancient and modern prophets. We can trust the Holy Ghost to help us understand their words in the context of our own lives. We can also have more personal instruction from prayerful temple attendance, patriarchal blessings, and additional priesthood blessings.<br><br>We must be careful not to interfere with these spiritual processes in each other's lives by gossiping, judging, or giving uninspired advice that may come from our own biases, prejudices, and blind spots, however well meaning we may be. A study that I did on LDS women and depression showed that LDS women who relied on a process of personal spiritual introspection, then seeking answers and spiritual confirmation from the Lord through prayer, had better mental health than those who were overly concerned about judgments, gossip, and evaluation from others who had not been given any divine authority to do so.<br><br>Another reason that it is difficult to escape the trap of uncharitable judgments and jealousy is because you live in a world that is constantly evaluating and judging <i>you.</i> So many opportunities and evaluations are based on "beating out" someone else. The world teaches you that you have no right to self-respect unless you are first, get the highest grade, are number one, or win a competition. There is only room at the top for a few in this telestial world. Nevertheless, you are not here to prepare to live in a telestial world. You are here to learn how to prepare yourself to obtain celestial glory. In the celestial kingdom there is room for all who qualify. Entrance is not determined by winning a competitive race (Ecclesiastes 9:11). <i>All</i> who enter into the covenants set by God and then keep those covenants can qualify (Mosiah 5:5–9, D&amp;amp;C 25:13–15, D&amp;amp;C 66:2, D&amp;amp;C 97:8). You need not be the "swift nor the strong," the most beautiful, the thinnest, the most talented, nor the highest achiever. What God requires of each of us is that we do whatever is our unique mission on earth to do and "stay in the race" that eventually culminates with exaltation and eternal life (1 Nephi 22:31, 2 Nephi 31:15, Omni 1:26).<br><br>When we are consumed with competition, we lose sight of that which God has given to us personally. When we fail to value our own gifts and instead covet those of others, we risk losing the chance to magnify our own calling in life. We cannot rise to the full measure of our own creation if we are continually trying to be someone else.<br><br>The second pair of opposing principles is becoming perfected through Christ and the Atonement versus Satan's counterfeit of perfectionism. Christ's admonition "Be ye therefore perfect" is not a commandment to possess all skills, knowledge, and good qualities immediately. It is a commandment to enter into a covenant process that involves repentance, change, and growth. This process is dependant on the Atonement, which makes repentance possible. President Joseph Fielding Smith clarified this concept in saying,<br><br><i>Salvation does not come all at once; we are commanded to be perfect even as our Father in heaven is perfect. It will take us ages to accomplish this end, for there will be greater progress beyond the grave, and it will be there that the faithful will overcome all things, and receive all things, even the fulness of the Father's glory. </i>[Joseph Fielding Smith, <i>Doctrines of Salvation, </i>comp. Bruce R. McConkie, 3 vols. (Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1954–56), 2:18]<br><br>The prophet Joseph Smith also described the path to perfection as a journey rather than as an attribute acquired in mortality. He stated,<br><br><i>When you climb up a ladder, you must begin at the bottom, and ascend step by step, until you arrive at the top; and so it is with the principles of the gospel--you must begin with the first, and go on until you learn all the principles of exaltation. But it will be a great while after you have passed through the veil before you will have learned them. It is not all to be comprehended in this world; it will be a great work to learn our salvation and exaltation even beyond the grave</i>. [<i>History of the Church,</i> 6:306–7]<br><br>Have you ever wondered how perfectionism can influence relationships? Perfectionists experience excessive shame in having weaknesses and making mistakes. They believe that they are only of value if they are performing perfectly in all that they do. Perfectionists may also believe that other people must excel and perform in all areas of their lives or they are inadequate and unworthy. Close relationships provide us with a ringside seat to each other's struggles, sensitivities, and shortcomings. If you demand instant perfection from yourself or others, it becomes difficult to share struggles and disclose your weaknesses for fear of losing the relationship. There is then no way to provide support for each other in overcoming those weaknesses and challenges. Alma taught at the waters of Mormon that one of the first covenants of baptism is to bear one another's burdens (Mosiah 18:8–10).<br><br>When you can openly discuss weaknesses and problems without fear of rejection or ridicule, you can create a "safe place" in the relationship. Having the safety to explore problems in an empathic and caring relationship facilitates the kind of self-examination that is necessary for change and growth to take place. When you can let go of perfectionism, it is easier to feel emotionally close to others. Ironically, we often love those people most whose weaknesses and struggles we know.<br><br>Learning how to have close friendships is one of the best ways to prepare for marriage. Whether or not you have the opportunity to date, meet a romantic partner, and marry at this stage of your life, you can still progress toward that goal by learning how to have good friendships with others. Therefore, the third principle I want to discuss is God's plan for eternal marriage vs. Satan's plan to destroy relationships. Love has been described as "friendship that has caught fire." Learn how to be friends first, as the foundation for the relationship. Add the capstone of romantic attraction last. A relationship where you can be friends and share thoughts, feelings, beliefs, values, activities, and interests with one another is more likely to stay on fire than one that can share only physical attraction. That capstone of attraction can then be a great gift from God. When you use that attraction as God intended and keep it within the bounds that God has set, it has the force and power to keep the friendship of marriage "on fire" and forge a bond of love between a man and a woman that can last through all eternity.<br><br>God created you in His image so that you might become like Him. The Lord teaches in latter-day revelation that one of the purposes of the earth's creation was to provide the opportunity for marriage, which enables us to progress toward exaltation. "And again, verily I say unto you, that whoso forbiddeth to marry is not ordained of God, for marriage is ordained of God unto man. Wherefore, it is lawful that he should have one wife, and they twain shall be one flesh, and all this that the earth might answer the end of its creation" (D&amp;amp;C 49:15–16).<br><br>Many young people fear making a commitment to marriage because they fear they cannot keep love alive. Others may also mistakenly believe, "If I can only find the 'right one,' then my marriage will be perfectly happy all of the time and we will never have any problems." How do you stay in love with someone through all of the challenges of real life, e.g., raising children, disappointments, trials, and discovering each other's weaknesses and vulnerabilities?<br><br>Heinz Kohut, a psychologist who studied human relationships, stated, "Love is the very painful realization that other people are real." A person may enter marriage with the belief "If my spouse truly loves me, he or she will always think what I think, want what I want, and feel what I feel. Then I will know I have married the 'right' person." If you believe this then it is easy to believe that any differences are a betrayal of that love or a sign of incompatibility. You may even believe that you must compel your spouse to become a replica of yourself in order to be compatible. In reality, all marriages have differences. People enter into marriage having different genetics, backgrounds, childhood experiences, family dynamics, traditions, and personal meanings of events. When you can understand your spouse through the lens of <i>their</i> own background and experiences, it can help you have a more empathic and accurate understanding of their behavior.<br><br>In troubled marriages individuals are often quick to jump to the most condemning, negative explanations for their spouse's behavior. You can explain most behaviors in more than one way. When multiple explanations are available, choosing with charity and compassion will strengthen goodwill in the marriage. It is helpful to communicate this goodwill and good intentions to one another.<br><br>Let me share a personal story of how I learned this lesson. When I was first a young bride, I noticed that my husband and I had differences in our needs for orderliness. My husband was a scientist and performed best under conditions of exactness. I have more of a creative temperament. I perform best when I can act more spontaneously. I began to notice that he would follow me around as I did creative projects and clean up everything before I even finished. I interpreted this as a criticism of my housekeeping and felt threatened and hurt. I thought, "He thinks I am a bad wife, because I am not as orderly as he is."<br><br>When I tearfully confronted him with what I perceived as his displeasure with me, he was genuinely surprised. He explained that he recognized that I did not enjoy cleaning up and he honestly desired to do something to lighten my responsibilities and make my creative projects more fun for me. He further explained that because he enjoyed organizing things, he saw this as a way that he could show his love for me by doing what he did best. When we were able to communicate honestly and nondefensively with one another, the bad feelings went away. It helped me that he could verbally express his good intentions to me so that I could understand him more accurately. It helped him that I was able to trust those good intentions instead of judging his behavior wrongfully.<br><br>Often those differences between marriage partners are what attracted you to each other in the first place. Differences can help to fill the gaps in abilities that may be missing in our own personality and help to round out the family. For example, when a child falls off a bike, one parent might say, "You're okay. Get up and try again." The other may respond, "Are you okay? Do you need a Band-Aid?" These subtle differences between the two parents can help the child to get a more balanced experience in the family than if one parent's style must always prevail. The child needs to learn both courage as well as tenderness. If the parents are caught in an argument over whose response is correct, the child may miss the benefit of the gifts of both parents.<br><br>When couples disagree, they often waste time and emotional energy trying to attach blame to each other. Each believes that the other is at fault and that convincing the spouse of his or her guilt will then solve the problem. They may also believe that nothing can change unless their spouse changes first. The argument goes back and forth like a Ping-Pong ball, but nothing ever really changes. For example, one says, "You're mean, and you are mad all of the time." The other responds, "I am only mad because you are always telling me what to do." Then the ball goes back to the first: "Well, I have to tell you what to do because you are selfish. I can't ever get you to do anything I ask of you." Then back to the second one: "I only do that because you are a nag."<br><br>In this dialog neither is willing to accept responsibility for <i>their own</i> need to grow, because neither will let go of what they cannot change in the other. It remains a battle of who must change first. Neither will accept the challenge to grow and become more like Christ unless the other does so first. Accepting responsibility is the beginning of real personal power in relationships. If you can be courageous and loving with yourself, you can begin to look at your own personal areas of needed growth. You are then empowered to have a very different experience. You no longer need to consider yourself a victim who cannot grow because of another's behavior. Even when you cannot change another, you can still choose to continue your own growth toward becoming a celestial person. Although the relationship may not be perfect, it can still become a means through which you can grow.<br><br>Taking responsibility for our own growth requires both love and faith. When we are willing to examine our lives, we become aware of our need for the Atonement. This draws us closer to Christ. As we struggle with our weaknesses, we develop empathy for how hard it is to change and we become less angry with our spouse for not being able to change as quickly as we wish. When we can acknowledge our dependence upon the Atonement, we realize how much Christ loves us. Christ did not wait to love us until we were perfect, had overcome all our weaknesses, or had fully developed our ability to love him. He loved us <i>first</i> and was willing to show that love by suffering in Gethsemane and dying on the cross for our sins, infirmities, and weaknesses (1 John 4:19). By drawing closer to Christ, we can build our spiritual and emotional reserves and have more love and patience to give to our spouse. Ironically, it is often our own capacity to love that makes us more loveable to others.<br><br>Learning how to love requires that we stretch and extend ourselves in service to another. When we truly love, service can be experienced as a gift we freely choose to give rather than a chore or burden that is demanded. When we are willing to sacrifice to provide dependable, consistent concern for the life, welfare, and feelings of each other, love can be kept alive even through life's difficult challenges.<br><br>Sometimes individuals are afraid of service because they confuse it with subservience, subjugation, or loss of power. The Lord's plan for relationships does not include any form of unrighteous dominion or dictatorship. Power in marriage, as in any other context, should be "inseparably connected" to principles of righteousness (see D&amp;amp;C 121:36–42). Real power comes from doing service in a spirit of love, kindness, gentleness, meekness, and love unfeigned. This kind of service can bind another to us so that they are in the relationship because they choose it freely, not because they are forced or compelled. In this kind of relationship, no one need fear submission to the other.<br><br>Paul's admonition to wives to "submit yourselves unto your own husbands" (Ephesians 5:22) has sometimes erroneously been used as justification for unrighteous dominion in marriage. A more careful reading of the surrounding verses, however, makes it clear that the command is to <i>submit to love</i> rather than to domination. Husbands are commanded to "love [their] wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself for it" (Ephesians 5:25). Submitting to love means that we allow our hearts to be vulnerable to a righteous spouse. We become more tenderhearted and gentle with our husband or wife. We then no longer consider kindness and service as subjugation or a burden. They are gifts of love. When <i>both</i> husband and wife provide consistent, dependable service to one another to show their love, no one need fear vulnerability or loss of power.<br><br>Some worldly philosophies suggest that service and sacrifice to another will cause you to lose your own identity. President Spencer W. Kimball wisely counseled that service can strengthen identity rather than diminish it. He stated,<br><br><i>There is great security in spirituality, and we cannot have spirituality without service! . . . So often, our acts of service consist of simple encouragement or of giving mundane help with mundane tasks, but what glorious consequences can flow from mundane acts and from small but deliberate deeds! . . . In the midst of the miracle of serving, we find ourselves.</i><br><br>Not only do we "find" ourselves in terms of acknowledging guidance in our lives, but the more we serve our fellowmen [and I would add our spouse]<i> . . . the more substance there is to our souls . . . Indeed, it is easier to "find" ourselves because there is so much more of us to find!</i> [Spencer W. Kimball, "Small Acts of Service, <i>Ensign,</i> Dec. 1974, 2, 5]<br><br>A marriage need not be perfect and without challenges to be one of great joy and peace. Peace comes not from a lack of problems and disruptions but from knowing that one's life is in harmony with the will of God (John 14:27, 16:33). When we struggle in important relationships and we lack the wisdom we need, these problems can bring us to our knees in prayer. The Lord can then instruct us how to learn to live more closely to an eternal model of relationships. You need not fear the challenges of marriage if you and your spouse will <i>both</i> commit yourselves to this process of learning how to become eternal, celestial companions. Elder George Q. Cannon said it beautifully:<br><br><i>We believe in the eternal nature of the marriage relation, that man and woman are destined, as husband and wife, to dwell together eternally. We believe that we are organized as we are, with all these affections, with all this love for each other, for a definite purpose, something far more lasting than to be extinguished when death shall overtake us. We believe that when a man and woman are united as husband and wife, and they love each other, their hearts and feelings are one, that that love is as enduring as eternity itself, and that when death overtakes them it will neither extinguish nor cool that love, but that it will brighten and kindle it to a purer flame, and that it will endure through eternity.</i> [George Q. Cannon, in <i>Journal of Discourses, </i>14:320]<br><br>If you have not yet found some of these blessings in your life, do not give up. God knows the righteous desires of your heart. He has promised his children that these blessings will eventually be available to <i>all</i> who are faithful and put their trust in the Lord throughout the heartaches, trials, and disappointments of mortality.I bear my personal testimony that the gospel of Jesus Christ as found in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is the truth. I bear my testimony that in the Lord's own time and in His own way the great blessings of eternal marriage can belong to each of us through our faithfulness. Although God has not revealed all to us in this life and we must walk by faith, He has promised us that through the infinite power of the Atonement we can come forth in the resurrection of the just. We will then be free from the thorns and afflictions of mortality and sealed into loving family relationships that will never be taken away. These relationships will last forever. I am thankful for my beloved family and friends who have helped me to appreciate these great promises. I say this in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Marleen Williams was an associate clinical professor of counseling psychology at Brigham Young University when this devotional address was given on 4 May 2004.</i><br><br><i>© Brigham Young University.

<h1>Stories of the Heart in the 21st Century - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
The following season there arose a great persecution; the Saints were able to escape in the best manner they could. Joseph was carried away in a box nailed on an ox sled to save his life. Old father Joseph was taken out of a window in the night and sent away on horseback.<br><br>These are the words of Zera Pulsipher, a third-great-grandfather of mine and probably a number of you--he had a large posterity. He continues:<br><br>After most of the saints were gone to Missouri I remained in Kirtland with about four of the First Presidents of Seventies. We continued to hold our meetings in the Temple. Accordingly while we were at a meeting one Sunday, we took a notion to put our property together and remove in that way and when we had made that calculation we felt a great flow of the spirit of God, not withstanding the great inconvenience we labored under for want of means. We lacked means to move ourselves and many poor that were yet remaining had neither clothing nor teams to go with. But when they heard that we were going together and would help one another they wanted to join us and get out of that Hell of persecution. Therefore, we could not neglect them, for all there was against them was that they were poor and could not help themselves. We continued to receive them till we got between five and six hundred on our hands. We counciled together from time to time on the subject and came to the conclusion that we could not effect the purpose short of the marvelous power of God by the power of the Priesthood. Therefore, we concluded to best go into the Temple in the attic story and pray that our Father would open the way and give us means to gather with the saints in Missouri which was near a thousand miles away. Accordingly, one day while we were on our knees in prayer I saw a messenger apparently like an old man with white hair down to his shoulders. He was a very large man near seven feet high, dressed in a white robe down to his ankles. He looked on me then turned his eyes on the others and then to me again and spoke and said, "Be one and you shall have enough." This gave us great joy; we immediately advised the brothers to scatter and work for anything that they could get that would be useful in moving to a new country. . . . A methodist meeting house stood a few rods from the Temple which took fire one night. . . . Most of the people being very hostile, the mob laid the charge of burning the house to the Council of Seventies . . . but we knew we were innocent and trusted in God. We continued our course steadily along and paid no attention to them. There was a universal determination that we should never leave that place in a company and they knew as well as we that the poor could not go out alone; therefore, they had a deep plot laid for our destruction. . . . But the Lord dictated to the great leader of that mob who had once been a Mormon and well calculated to carry out his devilish designs. . . . He had a vision and saw those that fired the house and seemed to be greatly astonished for a while and then met with the mob and informed them that it was not the Council that burned the house and he knew who it was but dared not tell on account of the law because he could prove only by vision, which they would not believe . . . But he swore by all the Gods that lived that he would have revenge on them if they lost a hair of our heads. He had a large store of goods and could swear and get drunk. He had some influence with them so that we were preserved by the hand of God. We obtained money and clothing for the company and the 4th day of July this man that had led the mob invited me to take all our teams and company and camp in a clover field which was about one feet high. I thanked him and embraced the offer. The next day we all went out all in order as we said we should in the beginning with about 65 teams and seventy cows.<br><br>I find this story meaningful. Who would have thought the Lord would help the Saints through a mob leader? Who would have thought the Lord would be so moved by their oneness of heart? It gets me thinking about my experiences here at BYU. In universities we often leave the poor behind--that is, we ignore the less educated; we even ignore those less acquainted with our own particular discipline. When we do bring each other along, on and off campus, I believe it pleases the Lord immensely and he opens the windows of heaven on our efforts in the most unexpected ways.<br><br>Today my topic is telling stories in the 21st century, and I would like to follow Zera's lead and see how we can tell our stories so that others can come along with us. How can we tell stories that engage us all in understanding them? How can stories be meaningful not just to our families and us but to those with interests other than our own? Let's look at a story from the Book of Mormon.<br><br>Nephi and his brothers have gone to Jerusalem to, somehow or other, get the brass plates, and their parents are waiting for their return. What will their parents do? What would you do in that situation?<br><br>Here is what Sariah does: She calls Lehi "a visionary man[,]saying: Behold thou hast led us forth from the land of our inheritance, and my sons are no more, and we perish in the wilderness" (1 Nephi 5:2).<br><br>What do you think of Sariah here? Nephi doesn't tell us what to think. Instead, having told us her words, he lets us figure things out for ourselves. Notice how she calls her sons "my sons," not "our sons." She feels the loss of her sons as though it was just affecting her: "my sons are no more." And notice how she speaks in the present tense: "my sons are no more, and we perish in the wilderness." She feels everything bad coming in on her at once. Nephi writes, "And after this manner of language had my mother complained against my father" (v. 3). Why does Nephi mention the manner of her language? I think he wants us to notice the spirit of her criticism. Her spirit isn't hidden deep inside her; it shows in her language.<br><br>Joseph Smith wrote, "It is in vain to try to hide a bad spirit from the eyes of them who are spiritual, for it will show itself in speaking and in writing, as well as in all our other conduct" (HC 1:317). Our spirit is our attitude, our orientation toward what is happening, continually reformed, moment by moment, in hardness or tenderness. Are we hard-heartedly holding onto ourselves by demeaning or ignoring what others are thinking or feeling or trying to do? Or are we tenderheartedly losing ourselves by bringing along something worthwhile of their spirit in ours? Are we being hard or tender? That is the question the Book of Mormon prompts us to ask.<br><br>Has Sariah hardened her heart against Lehi? Nephi doesn't tell us. But he does tell us her words, many of which were used earlier by Laman and Lemuel when they murmuringly belittled their father and his decision to leave Jerusalem:<br><br>Laman and Lemuel . . . did murmur in many things against their father, because he was a visionary man, and had led them out of the land of Jerusalem, to leave the land of their inheritance, and their gold, and their silver, and their precious things, to perish in the wilderness.<br><br>Nephi concludes the passage with "And this they said he had done because of the foolish imaginations of his heart" (1 Nephi 2:11).<br><br>After Sariah has spoken in this spirit, how will Lehi respond to her? How would you respond if your wife was that upset and unsupportive? May we always remember his response. As much as Lehi can, he agrees with Sariah, repeating several of her phrases: "I know that I am a visionary man; for if I had not seen the things of God in a vision I should not have known the goodness of God, but had tarried at Jerusalem, and had perished with my brethren" (1 Nephi 5:4).<br><br>He then follows Sariah's lead and speaks in the present tense about future events: "But behold, I have obtained a land of promise, in the which things I do rejoice." And like her he calls his sons "my sons": "Yea, and I know that the Lord will deliver my sons out of the hands of Laban, and bring them down again unto us in the wilderness" (v. 5).<br><br>Nephi then says, "And after this manner of language did my father, Lehi, comfort my mother, Sariah, concerning us" (v. 6). What is Nephi saying here about his father's spirit? Comfort comes from the words com, meaning "with," and forte, meaning "strong." Lehi was with Sariah, strengthening her. He was bringing her along. He was tenderhearted. He was Christlike.<br><br>When Nephi and his brothers finally arrive, Sariah says:<br><br>Now I know of a surety that the Lord hath commanded my husband to flee into the wilderness; yea, and I also know of a surety that the Lord hath protected my sons, and delivered them out of the hands of Laban, and given them power whereby they could accomplish the thing which the Lord had commanded them. [v. 8]<br><br>Nephi adds, "And after this manner of language did she speak" (v. 8). Sariah's spirit has changed. She is tenderly supporting Lehi.<br><br>Why does Nephi include this story? He didn't need to. He could have simply glossed over the moment and said his mother was worried. Why show his mother behaving like this? Clearly, Nephi wasn't there when this exchange took place between his parents, so he must have heard it from them or perhaps read it in his father's account. Did he consider this a sacred story, something of great worth to his people and to us? He must have. I believe Nephi was writing in the great Biblical tradition of meaningful family stories.<br><br>Meaningful stories, like this one, aren't about making ourselves look good or about telling the truth no matter how it makes us look. They aren't about good guys being rewarded and bad guys punished. They needn't be about miracles. Nor need they be about life-and-death situations. Meaningful stories aren't about reconfirming what we all, deep down, already believe or want. Nor are they about opposing what we currently believe or desire.<br><br>Meaningful stories are first of all about characters, like Lehi and Sariah, coming to respond tenderly to each other and thus drawing us into responding tenderly to them ourselves. Meaningful stories are secondly about narrators tenderly dealing with their characters and their readers. When we tenderheartedly write about a hard-hearted character, we grieve; we mourn; we feel ashamed ourselves for the behavior of our character. When we tenderly tell a story, we don't block our listeners' participation in the story by nailing the story's meaning down. Instead, we tell our story and submit it to our listeners and invite them to join with us in understanding what it means.<br><br>In effect, we invite our listeners to bear with us the responsibility for our story. That's what Nephi was doing. That's what sometimes happens in families; we tell our stories hoping that our loved ones can help us make sense of them. That's what Zera was doing; he tells us the significant details--"The next day we all went out all in order as we said we should in the beginning with about 65 teams and seventy cows"--and he invites us to understand for ourselves what that wonderful exodus meant. Tenderhearted narrators and characters, inviting our tender response--that's how meaningful stories work.<br><br>If our hearts are right, I believe we all can tell meaningful stories. And now, in the 21st century, with increasingly inexpensive yet high-quality digital cameras and editing systems for the common man, we can tell our meaningful stories in more ways than ever. Here are six ways.<br><br>First, we can photograph meaningful moments. My daughter Alisia lives in New York City and photographs people as she interacts with them. She never asks them to pretend that she and her camera aren't there. Instead, she helps them relax and be at their best by engagingly talking with them. Along the way, she snaps a digital camera, shot after shot, hoping to catch their tender responses. She says she knows when a photo is going to be a good one. When she photographed Dennis Rasmussen, our department chair, she got into a conversation with him about Schopenhauer. At the time he wondered if they shouldn't just concentrate on getting his picture taken. Later he understood how essential the conversation was.<br><br>Second, we can videotape meaningful moments. Cristy Welsh, a young mother who lives in my stake, brought two of her nephews together in a beautifully lit space, gave them something to do that she knew would be meaningful to them, and then videotaped them.<br><br>Third, we can recount meaningful moments. Here is a brief story written by my father about a moment in his childhood. When he retired, instead of sitting on a rocking chair and watching TV, he learned to type, took college writing classes, and read his stories over the radio. He is now working on a series of novels. Notice how he tenderly picks up the voice of himself as a child in this story, and how the child, in his own tender way, comes to feel the concerns of his parents.<br><br>Mama told me not to go upstairs in that bedroom--the one across from mine. She told me that, but I was only three, and she didn't tell me why. I wanted to see. I knew baby Carter was in that room, so why couldn't I go see?<br><br>Dee and Beth were on the living room floor [looking] at toys in the Christmas catalog. They kept the book all for them because they were older and bigger. They made it so I couldn't see, and I didn't like them. I went to the end of the room to get away, and I sat where the stairs turn to go up, and I watched them. Cleo couldn't see the pictures good either. She was bigger than me, but she cried more, and she went for Mama to hold her. Mama always had something to sew, but this time she was on a rocker chair, by the barrel stove, just to be warm and look at the wall across the room. Cleo wanted Mama to hold her and squeak the rocking chair, so that she could stop crying and suck her thumb. Papa got a chunk of coal and put it in the barrel stove to keep the fire going.<br><br>When no one looked, I sneaked up to the room. It was cold in the room. There was nothing there but a dresser at the side of the door, with a wood box that Papa made sitting on top of it. I pulled the drawers out to make steps to go up like a ladder, and I climbed my way up. I reached up and held on the edge of the box so I could stand on a drawer and be tall enough to reach in.<br><br>I put my hand way down in. And my fingers touched something like skin, but it was cold and I jerked back. I knew it was baby Carter. I was sure it was. There was no other place in the room for him to be. But he was cold. Why was he so cold? And why wasn't he crying?<br><br>I climbed down fast. I almost fell over the drawers. I ran out the door and down the stairs, but I hung onto the rail so I wouldn't fall. Then I went slow so they wouldn't know I was gone. I sat on a step to look through the spindles at Papa and Mama, so I could think.<br><br>Why isn't Carter crying? Carter didn't cry all day. Why isn't Papa playing with Carter? Papa always plays with Carter in the evening. Why doesn't Mama get Carter and nurse him like before? Why doesn't Mama get Carter and bring him down here where it's warm, and hold him and kiss him?<br><br>Do they know he's cold?<br><br>Fourth, we can film our stories if we write them with scenes. An example is "Hamburger Soup," on the BYU Web site lifesong.byu.edu. This piece was filmed with members of my stake. Youth in my stake are writing anecdotes like this for talks and filming them for stake cultural arts night. Another example on the site is called "Kelli's Rose." A freshman wrote the story, and another freshman videotaped the last scene of it.<br><br>Fifth, we can turn our accounts of meaningful moments into short novels. A number of such novels are currently in draft form at BYU, most written by students, some by alumni. A Boston-based company wants to publish three of these BYU novels every six months. Can we deliver? Of course we can. Will it be hard? It will take the best writers from across the campus and beyond. In Zera's words, we won't be able to "[a]ffect the purpose short of the marvelous power of God."<br><br>Sixth, we can tell these longer stories in movie theaters. I have been reading the teachings of President Hinckley, and he writes:<br><br><em>Two of our Brethren were recently in Washington and called on three or four people of national prominence back there. Among those they met was the man who speaks for the motion-picture industry and now for the television industry on morality in the media. He said, in essence, to our Brethren, "We do what we can, but it is a well nigh impossible task to change the moral perspective of the media, writers, and programmers. There is only one force in America with enough clout to turn this thing around, and that is the Mormon Church."</em> [Gordon B. Hinckley, Teachings of Gordon B. Hinckley (Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1997), 333]<br><br>President Hinckley concludes, "What a tremendous compliment that is."<br><br>Last semester, 90 accounting students, under the direction of professors Monte Swain and Shannon Leikem, wrote business plans for filming some of BYU's short novels. Film production and distribution companies have stepped forward and expressed interest in cooperating with BYU in producing and distributing these films for theatrical release. To foster meaningful storytelling, BYU is also launching a television series of stories written and filmed by viewers like you.<br><br>We all have meaningful stories to tell. I know we do. If we tell them and let this marvelous generation of computer- and video-literate youth film them, I know we will draw others into tenderly telling their meaningful stories, too. Like Zera, we'll be journeying toward Zion and bringing those who want to join us along. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><em>Dennis Packard was a professor of philosophy at Brigham Young University when this devotional address was given on 11 May 2004.</em><br><br>© Brigham Young University.

Elder David B. Haight once told this story:<br><br>James Peter Fugal was an honest man! He herded sheep much of his life in the rolling hills of Idaho--both his own sheep and sheep for others.<br><br>On one bitterly cold winter night, he was herding sheep for another man when a blizzard set in. The sheep bunched together, as sheep do, in the corner of a fenced area, and many died. Many other sheep on surrounding ranches also died that same night because of the weather.<br><br>Though the death of the sheep was no fault of his, James Fugal felt responsible and spent the next several years working and saving to repay the owner for his lost sheep.<br><br>This was the type of deep moral honor and accountability that was fostered by scripture reading, God-fearing settlers on the early frontier. [David B. Haight, <a href="https://www.lds.org/ensign/1987/11/ethics-and-honesty?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="color: #33cccc;">"Ethics and Honesty,"</span> </a><i>Ensign,</i> November 1987, 13]<br><br>I have pondered this story many times and wondered what guided Brother Fugal in his commitment to repay the owner for the sheep that died. It appears he had no contract to compel his actions. Something greater than a contract guided Brother Fugal's behavior. He could have easily told the rancher he was sorry for the situation and left it at that. For many, that might have been good enough.<br><br>How do we measure our behavior? Is 90 percent good enough? Is 99.9 percent good enough? Being 99.9 percent right seems quite good. However, did you know that accuracy of 99.9 percent would mean that we would still have<br><br>1 hour of unsafe drinking water every month<br><br>2 unsafe plane landings per day at O'Hare Airport in Chicago<br><br>16,000 pieces of mail lost by the U.S. Postal Service every hour<br><br>20,000 incorrect prescriptions every year<br><br>500 incorrect operations each week<br><br>50 babies dropped at birth every day<br><br>22,000 checks deducted from the wrong bank account each hour<br><br>32,000 missed heartbeats per person each year<br><br>[Gloria Diaz, "Quality Counts," Arizona Department of Economic Security, <i>The DEScriber </i>9 (February 2002): 12]<br><br>Is 99.9 percent good enough? Based on these statistics, would you be satisfied? What should we be seeking for? How much allowance for error are we willing to accept?<br><br>We know that "the Lord cannot look upon sin with the least degree of allowance" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/1.31?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="color: #33cccc;">D&amp;amp;C 1:31</span></a>). In living our lives we have daily opportunities to make choices that lead us to be more like Christ, or lead us away from Him. In our attitude and choices, how much sin, or error, should we accept? How much do we accept? Can we do better?<br><br>I teach in the Manufacturing Engineering Technology Program. One thing we teach students is how excellent products are produced. This means that the products perform their function very well and last a long time. More important, it means that each particular product--every single one--is made the same way. That is the way the customer wants them, and it is the right thing to do. There are a couple of important principles in accomplishing this. One principle of making high-quality products--called the Taguchi loss function--also applies to the standards by which we live. Today I will call it looking toward the mark.<br><br>A few years ago a large American computer company decided to have some parts manufactured by a Japanese supplier as a trial project. The American company told the Japanese firm it would accept up to 2 percent defective products in the 10,000-piece order. Later, the shipment arrived with 100 percent of the order without defects. In a separate box was a note: "Sorry, we do not understand American company production practices. However, this box contains the 2 percent defective product you wanted. Sorry for the delay in producing, but these parts had to be made separately, which required changing our process in order to make the bad product. Hope this pleases you."<br><br>When we design a part we always determine a target dimension that is the desired value at which the part should be produced. Making the part to that value results in the "perfect" product. Because every process has variation and it is difficult to produce exactly to the target value each time, every part also comes with tolerance limits. These limits are the amount of deviation from the target we can tolerate and still expect the part to function at least reasonably well. If there is more deviation from target than the tolerance limit allows, the part will be rejected. However--and this point is critical--as soon as the part deviates from target, it is in error, and the farther a part deviates from the target, even if it is within the tolerance limit, the worse it performs.<br><br>Some companies are concerned only with producing products within the tolerance limits, but wise companies constantly seek to produce on target. The differences between these companies in focus and attitude are quite significant, as are the results. The difference comes not because of the distance, which is often only a couple thousandths of an inch. It is the difference between an average company and an excellent company. For a company to move from the tolerance mind-set to the target mind-set requires an entirely different way of looking at targets, processes, tolerance limits, and improvement. It is a new way of thinking.<br><br>Companies that desire to produce excellent products are not satisfied at producing just within tolerance. They strive, constantly and forever, to produce at target. And they believe it is possible. Average companies, or those that are known for average or poor quality, tend to focus on the tolerance limits because they believe being just within the limits is good enough.<br><br>What does this have to do with us? In our attitudes and actions we are much the same way. Either we are focused on and striving to move toward the target or we are focused on what is "allowable" based on a tolerance limit. These tolerance limits may be rules, codes, guidelines, or even commandments. Whatever we call them, we are surrounded by them. Living within them is certainly important, but it is not sufficient.<br><br>The rating system for movies is a good example. I hasten to add that I fully understand the rating system is not perfect, and I am not suggesting that it is. But I will use it for two reasons. First, all of you are familiar with the system, and second, it is a guide that many use to judge the "goodness" of movies they watch.<br><br>If someone uses the rating system as their only guide to determine what they will watch or not watch and if their guide is simply no Rrated movies, then any G, PG, or PG-13 movie is allowable. At least two things are wrong with this idea. First, I'm confident that most of us here know that many movies that would be allowed based on the rating system would not be acceptable to the Lord. The second problem is that ratings change and, in today's world, seldom for the better. What was at one time rated R is now rated PG-13 or PG. It is the nature of the degenerating world in which we live to allow more and more immoral and inappropriate behavior. It is sometimes defended in the name of tolerance. It is entirely possible that the rating system will get so confused with what is right and what is not that it will be of little or no use to us.<br><br>What could we use then as our guide to decide what movies we watch? Perhaps this: "If there is anything virtuous, lovely, or of good report or praiseworthy, we seek after these things" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/pgp/a-of-f/1.13?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="color: #33cccc;">Article of Faith 1:13</span></a>). Or the prophet rule, which is: If the prophet knocked on my door and asked if he could join me for a few minutes in the activity in which I was involved--be it watching a movie or TV show, my conversation, or surfing the net--would I feel comfortable having him there? If not, should I be doing it? If I am looking toward the mark, the answer will come to me and I will respond accordingly.<br><br>Think of it this way. Imagine yourself on a line between the target value, or the mark of perfection, on one side and the tolerance limit on the other. We can ask ourselves, "Which way am I facing?" and "What do I take as my guide?" If the tolerance limit is my guide, then my tendency is to move as close to the limit as I can and, if at all possible, try to relax those limits to make more of my behaviors allowable. However, there is an even bigger problem with facing the tolerance limit. It is that my back is to the target. I am not looking toward the mark of perfection. Also, since I am facing the limit, if the limit moves, then I move with it and, therefore, accept more defective behavior.<br><br>On the other hand, if I am facing the target, the mark of perfection, and constantly striving to reach that mark, then my back will be to the tolerance limits. If the limits move, they have no effect on me because my focus is not on the relaxing tolerance but on approaching the mark of perfection.<br><br>Another illustration of this point, important to us here at BYU, is the Honor Code and the Dress and Grooming Standards. Unfortunately, some seem to struggle with what is appropriate grooming and what is not, desiring to be as close to the tolerance limit as they can. President Samuelson talked on this earlier in the year, saying, "Things that once might have been considered slovenly or totally inappropriate are now celebrated and even modeled by those in the public eye, who often seem to revel in their capacity to shock and 'push the envelope' of propriety" (Cecil O. Samuelson, <a href="https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/cecil-o-samuelson_outward-expressions-inner-self/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="color: #33cccc;">"Outward Expressions of the Inner Self,"</span></a> <i>BYU 2003–2004 Speeches</i> [Provo: BYU, 2004], 172). "Pushing the envelope" is an attempt to relax the tolerance limit to accept more error. If I am attempting to push the envelope of propriety, my back is to the target and I am moving away from it.<br><br>How can we know what the mark for good grooming is so we can focus on it rather than the limits? We could ask ourselves, "Am I striving to have the image of God (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/5.14?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="color: #33cccc;">Alma 5:14</span></a>) or the image of the world in my countenance?" Also, we are not without patterns to which we can look for guidance. The patterns of appropriate dress and behavior are instilled in every faithful missionary. Elder M. Russell Ballard said,<br><br><i>Please remember that you were released from your missions but not from the Church. You spent two years as a representative of the Lord Jesus Christ. We expect you to always look and act like one of His disciples. Look the part. Act the part. Don't follow worldly trends and fashions... . The rules for happiness and success after your mission are pretty much the same as they were during your mission: pray hard, work hard, and be obedient. </i>[M. Russell Ballard, <a href="https://www.lds.org/ensign/2002/11/the-greatest-generation-of-missionaries?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="color: #33cccc;">"The Greatest Generation of Missionaries,"</span></a> <i>Ensign,</i> November 2002, 49]<br><br>If we have been on a mission, we know what the expectations are; if we have not, it is easy to find out what they are and follow them. We also have excellent models to look to for examples. Elder Nelson recently counseled, "In your personal grooming, follow the example of the living prophets" (Russell M. Nelson, <a href="https://www.lds.org/ensign/2003/11/personal-priesthood-responsibility?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="color: #33cccc;">"Personal Priesthood Responsibility,"</span></a> <i>Ensign,</i> November 2003, 46).<br><br>Does my grooming and dress really matter? Some say that it does not matter how you look; what matters is what's inside. However, how you look gives an indication of what's inside. It tells others and ourselves what we are focused on. For example, the title of President Samuelson's address that I cited earlier is "Outward Expressions of the Inner Self." President Harold B. Lee said,<br><br><i>Do not underestimate the important symbolic and actual effect of appearance. Persons who are well groomed and modestly dressed invite the companionship of the Spirit of our Father in Heaven and are able to exercise a wholesome influence upon those around them. Persons who are unkempt and careless about their appearance, or adopt the visual symbols of those who often oppose our ideals, expose themselves and persons around them to influences that are degrading and dissonant. Outward appearance is often a reflection of inward tendencies.</i> [Harold B. Lee, <i>The Teachings of Harold B. Lee,</i> ed. Clyde J. Williams (Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1996), 220; from <a href="https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/harold-b-lee_loyal-royal-within/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="color: #33cccc;">"Be Loyal to the Royal Within You,"</span></a> 11 Sept 1973, in <i>Speeches of the Year, 1973</i> (Provo: Brigham Young University Press, 1974), 92]<br><br>Grooming and media, however, are not the fundamental points of this discussion. I use those examples, with which we are familiar, to emphasize that we would be greatly blessed by taking Christ as our guide and striving constantly and forever to be like Him, not spending our time flirting with tolerance limits and worldly ways. Whether it be grooming, choice of media, the Honor Code, honesty in business or personal practices, church attendance, magnifying our callings, home and visiting teaching, modesty, or anything else, those who focus on the rules and limits rather than the target are confusing what is technically allowable with what is right. They are seldom the same thing.<br><br>Where we focus has a great impact on our happiness and worthiness. It reflects on our preparation and ability to serve the Lord. It gives others, especially our Heavenly Father, an indication of our willingness to be obedient. If we are constantly and consistently focused on improving ourselves and being closer to the target, we are happier, more faithful, and better prepared to serve our Father in Heaven, whenever He calls.<br><br>We are living in a world that is a PG-13 and R-rated world. Sometimes we are tempted to compare our actions to what the rest of the world is doing, and if our actions are not as bad, then we figure we are still OK. Using the world as our benchmark is focusing on the tolerance limits, not the target. We cannot use the world as our guide. Doing so is falling into the trap described in 2 Nephi; "And others will he pacify, and lull them away into carnal security, that they will say: All is well in Zion; yea, Zion prospereth, all is well--and thus the devil cheateth their souls, and leadeth them away carefully down to hell" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/28.21?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="color: #33cccc;">2 Nephi 28:21</span></a>).<br><br>We must be very cautious about the carnal security offered by the world. When those of the world say they are "stretching the limits" or "pushing the envelope" or "living on the edge," be assured that they are most likely trying to destroy religious values, eliminate commandments, relax laws, and violate social norms. They are focused on relaxing or removing the limits of acceptable behavior. If we are using those limits as our guide, we will go down with them. Not only must we <i>not</i> follow but we must be fixed and immovable in taking the Holy Spirit as our guide in a life patterned after Christ, who is our mark.<br><br>President Faust taught,<br><br><i>Staying away from the edge is an individual responsibility. Occasionally our well-meaning young people want every detail of appropriate and inappropriate conduct to be specified, perhaps so they can feel comfortable in getting closer to the edge. They sometimes seem more concerned with what the gospel prohibits than what it gives. For instance, some young adults were surprised when they learned that it was inappropriate for mixed young single adult groups to be involved together in overnight activities. They said, 'Why hasn't the prophet told us?' The Church counsel in this matter has been clear for many years. It should not have been necessary to tell these young people to avoid the appearance of evil. My strong advice is, if there is any question about your personal conduct, don't do it. It is the responsibility of prophets to teach the word of God--not to spell out every jot and tittle of human behavior. Our moral agency requires us to know good from evil and choose the good.</i> [James E. Faust, <a href="https://www.lds.org/ensign/1995/11/acting-for-ourselves-and-not-being-acted-upon?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="color: #33cccc;">"Acting for Ourselves and Not Being Acted Upon,"</span> </a><i>Ensign,</i> November 1995, 47]<br><br>Looking toward the mark brings real benefits. Companies that continuously strive to make their products on target have smoother production operations, their plants are in better order, their customers are happier, their facilities are cleaner, they are able to produce more product at less cost, and, of course, the products are of better quality.<br><br>What is the benefit for us to continuously strive to be like Christ? Striving constantly to be more like Christ means we have more order in our lives: our minds are clearer, our intellects are sharpened, we have more faith, we have a feeling of love rather than mere tolerance for others, we are more honest, our humility is stronger, we are more confident in tackling challenges, learning is more enjoyable, we are on time for classes and more attentive when there, our rooms are cleaner, we serve more faithfully in our callings, we are modest, and we are willingly obedient.<br><br>This does not mean we are perfect. We may slip on occasion, but if we are striving to be ever closer to the mark, we will slip less often than if we are simply trying to live within allowable tolerances. In addition, when we slip it won't be as far, and the need for recovery and the way to repent will be apparent.<br><br>Even though we may not be perfect now, can we become so? <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/moro/10.32?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="color: #33cccc;">Moroni 10:32</span> </a>promises,<br><br><i>Come unto Christ, and be perfected in him, and deny yourselves of all ungodliness; and if ye shall deny yourselves of all ungodliness, and love God with all your might, mind and strength, then is his grace sufficient for you, that by his grace ye may be perfect in Christ; and if by the grace of God ye are perfect in Christ, ye can in nowise deny the power of God.</i><br><br>So how do we know, in terms of living our day-to-day lives, when we are looking toward the mark? We see things differently than we may have seen them before. We think differently than the world. Things we may have done before "because everyone does them" come under new scrutiny. We strive to develop "the mind of Christ" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/1-cor/2.16?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="color: #33cccc;">1 Corinthians 2:16</span></a>).<br><br>Living on target requires work and thought. We must study, search, ponder, and pray. We will look for patterns, types, and models from Christ and those who live like Him. It means not only are we always living well within the letter of the law but, knowing that "salvation doth not come by the law alone" (Mosiah 13:29), we also seek to understand and strive to live the spirit of the law. It is important for us to "study it out" by diligently searching the scriptures and constantly reviewing the words of the prophets. President Packer taught that we "learn by observation, learn by teaching, learn by experience. Most of all, we learn because we are motivated by the Spirit" (Boyd K. Packer, "The Unwritten Order of Things," BYU devotional address, 15 October 1996).<br><br>Most important, we must always remember who the Mark is to which we should look. Elder Bruce R. McConkie testified,<br><br><i>Christ is not only the Savior and Redeemer, the one by whom salvation comes, the one whose atoning sacrifice puts into operation all of the terms and conditions of his Father's plan. He is also the Prototype, the Pattern, the Type, and the Model of salvation</i>. [Bruce R. McConkie, <i>A New Witness for the Articles of Faith</i> (Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1985), 381]<br><br>President Hinckley challenged,<br><br><i>This is the great day of decision for each of us. For many it is the time of beginning something that will go on for as long as you live. I plead with you: don't be a scrub! Rise to the high ground of spiritual, mental, and physical excellence. You can do it. You may not be a genius. You may be lacking in some skills. But so many of us can do better than we are now doing. We are members of this great Church whose influence is now felt over the world. We are people with a present and with a future. Don't muff your opportunities. Be excellent.</i> [Gordon B. Hinckley, <a href="https://www.lds.org/ensign/1999/09/the-quest-for-excellence?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="color: #33cccc;">"The Quest for Excellence,"</span></a> <i>Ensign,</i> September 1999, 4–5]<br><br>Brothers and sisters, what we choose as our guide determines the kind of life we will live and the blessings we will enjoy. Just as the companies to which I referred can produce no better product than the standard they choose to pursue, we will live a life and receive rewards consistent with the law by which we are willing to abide (D&amp;amp;C 88:20–40). In other words, we will receive the rewards of the god that we worship. If the god we worship is a god of this world, or a temporal god, then the rewards we receive will be only of this world and will be temporary. But if the God we worship is the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; if He is the God of the eternities; if He is the God who gave His life that we might live; then we will be given the rewards of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; we will receive the rewards of eternal life and exaltation; we will obtain the blessings of the Atoning Sacrifice and all that goes with it. That Christ will be our pattern, our model, and the mark to which we look, is my prayer, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br>&amp;nbsp;<br><br><i>Val D.

<br>
What I will say to you today will only have meaning as you make room in your heart for the Spirit. You surely have many things on your mind as you come to this devotional. Our time together will quickly pass. You probably will not remember much of what was said. As the Spirit prompts you with a feeling or thought to attach to your life, please don't let it pass you by.<br><br>Our message today is simple: God wants you to find and keep joy in this world and in the world to come. You have been specially endowed with a celestial nature that is to grow into a fullness of joy. That thought can get lost too easily in today's world.<br><br>These are turbulent times. There is not much of good report on the six o'clock world news these days. The former prophets practically wrote the six o'clock world news for you in prophecies. They are signs of our time. The kingdom of God on earth and the kingdom of the adversary are on a collision course of great proportions. You can hardly be blamed for putting on your headphones and turning up your MP3 players to block out the realities around you. However, <i>God has a work for you to do!</i> Within that work--and because of it--you are promised great joy.<br><br>You are principle players in this great contest between good and evil. How we pray for you that you will be heavily armed with the standard of truth and righteousness! In the circle of the General Authorities, we frequently comment among ourselves that you are the best prepared of any former generation. You pray more; you study the scriptures more; you are more obedient to the commandments of God. You have a great destiny ahead of you. Although this will become more important to you as life moves on, how great the need is <i>now</i> to develop yourself into the peaceable followers of Christ. How much this world, your future family, and the people around you need the strength of your righteous influence and your joyful countenance.<br><br>So let's discuss today how to obtain lasting joy in your life.<br><br>On June 24 of this year, Laurel and I will have been married for 44 years. Over these years we have found some very helpful tools in working toward a joyful life, even during the challenging times. We share our experiences with you, hoping that you will think on these experiences and, where appropriate, apply them to yourselves.<br><br>From our experience, developing joy brings emotional rewards of inner peace and the healing of pains that often can beset you. Let's see if we can understand how this works <i>doctrinally</i>.<br><br>Undergirding the gospel of Jesus Christ is the concept of eternal and permanent happiness. Joseph Smith stated the doctrine in very few words:<br><br><i>Happiness is the object and design of our existence; and will be the end thereof, if we pursue the path that leads to it; and this path is virtue, uprightness, faithfulness, holiness, and keeping all the commandments of God.</i> [<i>Teachings,</i> 255–56]<br><br>That is the essence of the religion you have embraced. The Book of Mormon contains more than 150 references to joy. To quote an early reference in the Book of Mormon: "Adam fell that men might be; and men are, that they might have joy" (2 Nephi 2:25).<br><br>I am indebted to Elder Bruce Hafen for a thought he left us in the last general conference:<br><br><i>So if you have problems in your life, don't assume there is something wrong with you. Struggling with those problems is at the very core of life's purpose. . . . If you're seeing more of your weaknesses, that just might mean you're moving nearer to God, not farther away.</i> [Bruce C. Hafen, "The Atonement: All for All," <i>Ensign,</i> May 2004, 97]<br><br>There is great peace of mind in that thought. Trials and tribulations are part of the formula for getting us back to God. In this mortal life He does work within you, moving you into position to face and overcome your personal challenges. I have been a witness to that process many times. You are to grow your happiness here in mortality, primarily by being nurtured and enlightened by the good word of God. This doctrine lays out a pathway toward happiness markedly different from that of the world.<br><br>President David O. McKay clarifies a significant difference between our doctrine of happiness and that of the world:<br><br><i>It is true that wealth and friends and material success may make</i> [happiness] <i>the brighter when it is already shining within, but when it is not in the heart, all outward contributions are like paint and powder on the sallow cheek, the mere semblance of the thing desired.</i> [David O. McKay, <i>Pathways to Happiness,</i> comp. Llewelyn R. McKay (Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1957), 107]<br><br>We are to look primarily within ourselves to build joy.<br><br>True doctrines bring joyful hearts to an intensity unknown to the world. Alma the Younger may have conveyed it best: "And oh, what joy, and what marvelous light I did behold; yea, my soul was filled with joy as exceeding as was my pain!" (Alma 36:20). That's quite a range of emotion!<br><br>Alma holds out great hope to you. There is joy to be felt exceeding the greatest of pains. He also implies that you can build for yourself high pain thresholds through understanding the Atonement. He describes how he was caught up in great emotional pain: "I cried within my heart: O Jesus, thou Son of God, have mercy on me, who am in the gall of bitterness, and am encircled about by the everlasting chains of death" (Alma 36:18).<br><br>He sounds pretty hopeless, doesn't he? But he goes on to say:<br><br><i>And now, behold, when I thought this</i> [speaking of the teachings of his father, Alma, concerning the Atonement of Jesus Christ], <i>I could remember my pains no more; yea, I was harrowed up by the memory of my sins no more</i>. [Alma 36:19]<br><br>This is a very practical doctrine for you to lay hold of. Alma is telling you that the Savior's Atonement holds full power to grant mercy sufficient to completely cleanse the mind and soul. What is profoundly crucial to you is to understand that this mercy holds sufficient power for you to achieve complete peace and healing.<br><br>Many scriptural evidences demonstrate that the Atonement gives healing to both body and soul. Think on the miracles performed by the Savior wherethrough He healed physical infirmities, at the same time forgiving the repentant sinners and bringing peace to their souls. Of particular note is Alma's comment to Helaman, "But behold, my limbs did receive their strength again, and I stood upon my feet, <i>and did manifest unto the people that I had been born of God</i>" (Alma 36:23; emphasis added). Both body and soul were healed in his conversion.<br><br>In our day the Lord has entrusted you with His power to heal by faith and by the power of the priesthood to bring about this peace and healing.<br><br>Time isn't sufficient today to name all the ingredients for bringing peace and healing to the soul. Certainly the power of the Atonement, coupled with our true and full conversion, is the greatest ingredient in finding joy.<br><br>Allow me to mention other patterns in your lives to build joy. These patterns have greatly helped Laurel and me in our journey through life together.<br><br>You always have to keep humor as a significant part of your lives. We often reflect on humorous moments. Our family has grown up with humor. Home movies attest to the joyful times, particularly during family gatherings. These moments we treasure; they lift us when we are apart. We encourage you to keep humor and the memories of good times as a part of dealing with the everyday vicissitudes of life.<br><br>One caution: Don't ever use humor at the expense of someone else! I learned that lesson early in life, to my constant remorse. To tell the story quickly: My growing-up years were in Southern California. My parents socially traveled with the then "elite" of Hollywood. Although I had "goodly parents," they took on the social customs of the world for a time. When I was about seven years of age, my father planned a birthday celebration for my mother. He invited the important people of Hollywood, particularly a number of the leading actors of that day. My older brother and I came into the kitchen during preparations. We saw champagne poured into glasses to toast my mother. I said to my brother, "This is not right!" When no one was looking, we poured the champagne down the sink and refilled the glasses with vinegar. In my moment of self-righteousness, I thought we needed to teach an object lesson. Besides, we thought it would be funny to watch everyone swallowing vinegar at the same time. Big mistake. <i>I hadn't considered that my older brother could run faster than I could!</i><br><br>You may not know that there is occasional humor mixed into our work at Church headquarters. The General Authorities and officers are typically happy, optimistic people. Humor shows up at times in unexpected ways. Here are some graphics of recent examples intended to highlight challenges that you may deal with. Here we have a busy bishop. [A slide photo of a bishop with a cell phone at each ear was shown.] Here we have a bishop's mail coming from Church headquarters. [A slide photo of a donkey cart loaded with mail was shown.] Here we have a priesthood leader chasing down a priest on Sunday morning. [Slide photos were shown of (1) a priesthood leader awaking a young man in bed, (2) the priesthood leader greeting the young man as he comes out of his house on the way to the beach, and (3) the priesthood leader, in water up to his Sunday shirt and tie, with his hand on the shoulder of the boy as they walk out of the ocean.] The senior Brethren really do emulate a quality noted about Joseph Smith: having a "native cheery temperament" (JS--H 1:28).<br><br>Let me recommend another ingredient of joy. I was fortunate to marry a girl with music in her soul. As she sits at the piano playing the classics and hymns, it brings a great sense of peace and enjoyment. Incidentally, she could step up to this pulpit and sing almost every popular song written in our time--excluding grunge, hip-hop, and rap, of course! To keep our relationship harmonious, I won't ask her to receive your requests now.<br><br>Each of our children--and now our grandchildren--has learned to play musical instruments. Our experience leads us to recommend that you steer your children away from learning to play drums. Let them take that up when they move into their own homes!<br><br>Recently I saw this quote at our granddaughter's violin recital: "Music washes away from the soul the dust of everyday life." I believe that. I have come to recognize much later in life the importance of bringing into my soul the melodies and words of our hymns and other uplifting music. Now as I sing sacrament hymns, they become my words, my prayers, and my thanksgivings.<br><br>We possess particular hymns especially written to bring peace and healing to our souls. Let's listen for a moment as the Tabernacle Choir sings to lift our souls. [Music was played.] "Peace Like a River" and "Deep River," both with arrangements by Mack Wilberg, use rivers as metaphors for our constancy of hope and faith. Did you feel a sense of peace? Uplifting music is designed to bring peace into our lives.<br><br>Another lesson about happiness occurred while I was serving as a mission president in Venezuela. The assistants came into my office one day and said, " President, there are two types of missionaries in our mission: those who use most of their week preparing for PDay and those who use their P-Day to plan their week." There is a message here. You returned missionaries know what I am talking about. We notice a great difference in those who come into the mission prepared to work hard because they have had earlier experiences of working hard. They gain satisfaction in life from accomplishing worthwhile goals.<br><br>President David O. Mc Kay commented on the importance of work in bringing happiness:<br><br><i>One source of happiness springs from the realization of having accomplished something worth while. . . . The accomplishing of a fixed determination in the quest for truth and nobility of soul always produces happiness.</i> [<i>Pathways,</i> 107]<br><br>That is why effective missionaries do not want to leave their missions and always look back on mission life with satisfaction. When you look back from the other side of the veil, will you feel likewise? Remember President McKay's counsel: "The accomplishing of a fixed determination in the quest for truth and nobility of soul always produces happiness."<br><br>Has it occurred to you that sincere and heartfelt prayer brings discovery, and discovery brings joy? Of all the challenging times in our lives, I think Laurel would agree with me that our three-year mission in Venezuela would count high on the list. We had our young family with us. Their happiness and well-being were an ever-important issue balanced with the everyday challenges of the missionaries, culture, language, illness, crime, political turmoil, and so forth.<br><br>I remember so well a particular day on the island country of Trinidad and Tobago. We were trying to gain official recognition for the Church. After many failed attempts I remember falling to my knees in my hotel room in the capital city, Port of Spain. I poured out my heart to God, saying, <i>"Heavenly Father, I can't do this alone! The obstacles are too great."</i> I remember feeling waves of peace coming over me. A voice came to my mind saying, "Be patient. I will open the pathway to establish my Church here." The Spirit spoke to my mind, bringing great peace and consolation to my heart. Prayer indeed brings peace, healing, and a sense of joy.<br><br>Please consider prayer as an active and open channel to a loving and listening Heavenly Father. It helps at times to have the image of His countenance before you, the Savior at His side advocating on your behalf. He does listen. I testify of that. He always listens to the prayers of your heart.<br><br>Peace and joy come from pondering scripture. You can sense the joy that prophets describe within themselves. It is a marvelous thing to contemplate the joys coming to Joseph Smith as revelation after revelation poured upon him from heaven. What joy he expressed in receiving visits from the Savior and the great prophets of old! Just one example in his life can give you a flavor:<br><br><i>Immediately on our coming up out of the water after we had been baptized, we experienced great and glorious blessings from our Heavenly Father. No sooner had I baptized Oliver Cowdery, than the Holy Ghost fell upon him, and he stood up and prophesied many things which should shortly come to pass. And again, so soon as I had been baptized by him, I also had the spirit of prophecy, when, standing up, I prophesied concerning the rise of this Church, and many other things connected with the Church, and this generation of the children of men. We were filled with the Holy Ghost, and </i>rejoiced<i> in the God of our salvation.</i> [JS--H 1:73; emphasis added]<br><br>President Spencer W. Kimball also commented on the importance of the scriptures, saying:<br><br><i>I find that when I get casual in my relationships with divinity and when it seems that no divine ear is listening and no divine voice is speaking, that I am far, far away. If I immerse myself in the scriptures the distance narrows and the spirituality returns. I find myself loving more intensely those whom I must love with all my heart and mind and strength, and loving them more, I find it easier to abide their counsel.</i> [In <i>TSWK,</i> 135]<br><br>There is a great spiritual enrichment in pondering scripture--not just reading nor just studying but truly pondering. When you get it fixed right in your minds, your hearts begin to open up to feelings that bring lasting joy. Pondering scripture also stores up great knowledge useful throughout life in solving the everyday problems that vex you. It helps keep a pure conduit to heaven, allowing joy to replace indecision and lack of direction. Pondering scripture is a discipline to learn early in life and insist on maintaining throughout.<br><br>Now let's talk about love. It seems like such a short time ago that Laurel and I were sitting in your seats listening to similar speakers. We were engaged to be married and very much in love. Over the years we have learned much more about love. We have learned that "being in love" is a wonderfully blissful state. But eternal companionship is much more. The term <i>being in love</i> uses the word <i>love</i> as a noun, a state of being. The other meaning of love is in its condition as an action verb. To love and be loved transcends "being" in love. Scripture is quite clear on that topic. "If ye love me, keep my commandments" (John 14:15). Although you may feel love toward the Savior, feeling love is not enough. You must demonstrate your love in a contractual way. It is the giving of that love that brings true and lasting joy. The same is true in marriage. Paul's counsel to the Saints in Ephesians underscores this principle:<br><br><i>Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself for it; . . .</i><br><br>[Here Paul makes an important analogy:] <i>That he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish. </i>[Ephesians 5:25, 27]<br><br>Loving others means helping them to become better.<br><br>Lasting joy comes from combining the "being in love" with a loving behavior. In the words of C. S. Lewis:<br><br><i>Love as distinct from "being in love" is not merely a feeling. It is a deep unity, maintained by the will and deliberately strengthened by habit; reinforced by (in Christian marriages) the grace which both parents ask, and receive, from God. . . . "Being in love" first moved them to promise fidelity: this quieter love enables them to keep the promise</i>. It is on this love that the engine of marriage is run: being in love was the explosion that started it. [C. S. Lewis, <i>Mere Christianity</i> (New York: Macmillan, 1952) 99; emphasis added]<br><br><i>Love</i> is both a noun and a verb in the celestial kingdom. The closing words of the Savior's great Intercessory Prayer sum it up: "that the love wherewith thou hast loved me may be in them, and I in them" (John 17:26).<br><br>Let us return now to our earlier statement: "Certainly the power of the Atonement, coupled with our true and full conversion, is the greatest ingredient in finding joy."<br><br>Our baptism does not necessarily indicate conversion. Having a testimony does not necessarily indicate conversion. I quote from President Marion G. Romney's general conference talk given October 4, 1963:<br><br><i>As used in the scriptures, "converted" generally implies not merely mental acceptance of Jesus and his teachings but also a motivating faith in him and in his gospel--a faith which works a transformation, an actual </i>change<i> in one's understanding of life's meaning and in his allegiance to God--in interest, in thought, and in conduct. While conversion may be accomplished in stages, one is not really converted in the full sense of the term unless and until he is at heart a new person. "Born again" is the scriptural term.</i> [<i>CR</i>, October 1963, 23; emphasis in original]<br><br>One who walks in a newness of life is converted. President Romney continued:<br><br><i>Conversion . . . is the fruit of, or the reward for, repentance and obedience. . . .</i><br><br>. . . His spirit is healed. . . .<br><br>. . . Sometimes there is also a healing of the nervous system or of the mind. But always the remittance of sins which attends divine forgiveness heals the spirit. This accounts for the fact that in the scriptures conversion and healing are repeatedly associated. . . .<br><br><i>"And after their temptations, and much tribulation, behold, I, the Lord, will feel after them, and if they harden not their hearts, and stiffen not their necks against me, they shall be </i>converted,<i> and I will heal them."</i> <i>(D&amp;amp;C 112:12–13. </i>[Emphasis]<i> added.) . . .</i><br><br><i>Somebody recently asked how one could know when he is converted. The answer is simple. He may be assured of it when by the power of the Holy Spirit his soul is healed. When this occurs, he will recognize it by the way he feels, for he will feel as the people of Benjamin felt when they received </i>[a] <i>remission of sins. The record says, "The Spirit of the Lord came upon them, and they were filled with joy, having received a remission of their sins, and having peace of conscience." (Mosiah 4:3.) </i>[<i>CR,</i> October 1963, 24–25]<br><br>President Romney concluded by saying:<br><br><i>Getting people's spirits healed through conversion is the only way they can be healed. I know this is an unpopular doctrine and a slow way to solve the problems of men and nations. . . . Nevertheless, I know and solemnly witness that there is no other means by which the sin-sick souls of men can be healed or for a troubled world to find peace.</i> [<i>CR,</i> October 1963, 26]<br><br>I add a humble second witness to the truths that President Romney taught. True and full conversion is the only way to bring complete peace and healing to the soul. It is the balm of Gilead, the ultimate fount of joy.<br><br>Laurel and I find great joy in the great goodness of God. He is merciful. He stands ready to heal you when you need healing. He offers peace of soul through the Atonement of His Son, Jesus Christ. Truly joy and happiness are the objects of our existence. May you capture the pathway to that happiness, becoming "as a river" in your constancy of pursuit. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Dale E.

<h1> Sufficiently Retained in Remembrance?” - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I appreciate this opportunity to address you in this devotional setting. Let me be among the first to welcome you to this summer term of 2004. I remember a summer term 29 years ago when I was interviewed and offered a job in Special Collections at the library. I remember the exhilaration of beginning my career. I also remember looking young enough to pass for a student here. Look at the full head of brown hair I had! Each time that I walked past the gauntlet of students passing out flyers, I ended up with a handful of notices. So it was with a good deal of sadness that one day I noticed that the students didn't hand me anything anymore. To them I was old and clearly not a student. Now, with my thinning gray hair, the young men and even some of the young women hold doors open for me. But, you know, age has a lot of advantages. One is that I have 29 years worth of memories that are wonderful and special to me.<br><br>With this past Memorial Day, the remembering of D-day 1944, and the recent passing of President Reagan, thoughts came to me concerning the purpose of remembering and what a wonderful gift a memory is to us. It reminded me of an incident in the Book of Mormon as Alma gave up the position of chief judge to focus on the spiritual needs of his people. He said to them:<br><br><i>And now behold, I say unto you, my brethren, you that belong to this church, have you sufficiently retained in remembrance the captivity of your fathers? Yea, and have you sufficiently retained in remembrance his </i>[the Lord's]<i> mercy and long-suffering towards them? And moreover, have ye sufficiently retained in remembrance that he has delivered their souls from hell?</i> [Alma 5:6]<br><br>As I read this passage, I asked myself the question, "Have you, Scott Duvall, 'sufficiently retained in remembrance' the things you should remember?" My answer was, "No, I have not." But my pondering and praying about this question has led me to some conclusions that I would like to share with you as we all ask ourselves the question, What specific aspects of our lives should we "sufficiently retain in remembrance?"<br><br>As we contemplate this question together, may I suggest three elements of our earthly existence that we need to remember: One, we need to remember the past. Two--and this will sound like a contradiction--we need to remember the future. And three, we need to remember our Redeemer and Savior, Jesus Christ, and the covenants we have made as part of belonging to the Church of Jesus Christ.<br><h2><b>Remembering the Past</b></h2><br>There are many accounts in the scriptures that tell us <i>why</i> we should remember the past. I think of Paul writing to the members of the Church in Jerusalem and bringing their history to their remembrance. In Hebrews, chapter 11, Paul reminded them of Abel, Enoch, and Noah. He brought to their memory the accounts of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. He exhorted them to remember Moses and the deliverance of the chosen people from the hands of Pharoah. Why did he tell them what they already knew? Because he used memory to build their faith. Paul emphasized in almost every verse that all of these prophets acted by faith. Is it not the same with us? As we "sufficiently retain in remembrance" our own past, our faith will be strengthened.<br><br>Consider the words of President Hinckley in April of 1997 as the Church began the celebration of its sesquicentennial. He said, "What a wonderful thing it is to have behind us a great and noble body of progenitors! What a marvelous thing to be the recipients of a magnificent heritage that speaks of the guiding hand of the Lord, of the listening ear of His prophets, of the total dedication of a vast congregation of Saints who loved this cause more than life itself!" He then recounted a list of marvelous accomplishments performed by these great and noble pioneers. At the conclusion of this conference talk, President Hinckley said this: "As great things were expected of them, so are they of us. We note what they did with what they had. We have so much more, with an overwhelming challenge to go on and build the kingdom of God. There is so much to do." Just as Paul in his day, President Hinckley asks us to remember the heritage of our Church history. He wants us to move forward in faith and do our very best to build the kingdom of God.<br><br><i>How</i> do we "sufficiently retain in remembrance" our past? When I asked myself this question, I was astonished at the thought that came to my mind. It hit me that, in fact, my entire career here at BYU has revolved around the theme of remembering, because the main purpose of all curators of books and manuscripts in Special Collections is to collect and make available the cultural memory of the past. Whether it be manuscripts from the Middle Ages or books since the printing of Gutenberg's Great Bible until now, whether it be our collection of unpublished letters of King Philip II of Spain or the thousands of pamphlets printed in France between 1550 and 1650 that we have, whether it be the hundreds of pioneer and missionary journals in Special Collections or the correspondence of our ancestors who lived long ago, my job has been to make all of this available to you so you can remember.<br><br>Let me share with you a passage from one of the journals found in Special Collections. It is from the journal of an 18-year-old woman. I have read this passage to many different classes who have come to Special Collections over the years. This young woman's name was Emmeline B. Wells. She was born in 1828, and she died in 1921. Her life is an example of faith and devotion. In her later years she served as the general president of the Relief Society of the Church. How do we know of her faith? Because she kept a journal almost all of her long life. These journals are found in Special Collections. One day they all will be found on the Internet and accessed through the library Web site, as you see here. The passage is dated 27 February 1846.<br><br><i>Mrs Whitney, Sarah Ann and myself crossed the river to go to the encampment of the saints. Br. Lot and his wife took Mrs. W. And myself in their carriage. We crossed the river a part of the way on foot, and then went on to the encampment about 7 miles beyond; we reached the destined place about sunset when we came in view it looked like pictures I have seen of the ancients pitching their tents and journeying from place to place with their cattle and their goods. We repaired immediately to Br. H.C. Kimball's tent, took supper and slept for the first time on the ground. There was a snow storm without yet all was peace and harmony within.</i><br><br>My eyes well up with tears when I read this passage. A refined young woman is forced to leave her comfortable home, cross the frozen river, and sleep for the first time in her life on the ground. If <i>my </i>emotions are tender when I read this, how do you think her own descendants feel when they read her diaries? So, how do we remember the past? We study our history, and we specifically study the lives of our own ancestors. In short, we become involved in family history.<br><br>In addition, we should "sufficiently retain in remembrance" experiences from our own life. I believe we need to have a memory of our own lessons learned and our own personal feelings felt. Let me give you an example. In 1987 I suffered an accident when I fell 19 feet from the roof of our neighbor's home onto a concrete driveway. In the middle of a six-hour surgery, Dr. Robert Jackson left the operating room to tell my wife that he would probably have to fuse my ankle bone and that I would not be able to bend my ankle ever after. Try walking without bending your ankle. He returned to the operating room, and he said that as he resumed his efforts, he imagined a way--in his mind's eye--to fashion 11 screws and 2 plates into a working ankle joint depending almost solely on that hardware because there were no solid pieces of bone with which to work.<br><br>I spent almost two weeks in the hospital at that time, and I remember very clearly the overwhelming feelings of an experience that I had one week after the surgery. The nurses had carried me to a chair that Sunday evening to watch television. It was tuned to KBYU, and a program entitled "How Rare a Possession" came on. As I watched that production, a swirling of simultaneous emotions swept over me. I felt gratitude for an outstanding doctor. I felt the love of our Heavenly Father and His Son. I felt a powerful reaffirmation of the truth of the gospel of Jesus Christ. As a result, I felt a strong feeling of recommitment to be a better person and to serve the Lord in any way he desired. I will never ever forget the tears that poured from my eyes as I felt those feelings and learned some valuable lessons. As I look back on it, I know that I was given a gift that without the accident I would not have received. There will be events and happenings in all of our lives that will become defining moments for us. You will know them when they come. We need to "sufficiently retain in remembrance" such times.<br><h2><b>Remembering the Future</b></h2><br>Now, let's discuss for a moment what I call "remembering the future." What I mean by remembering the future is simply that we need to ensure that what we do in the present will serve to help us and our posterity in the future. We should work hard to have good, fun experiences and loving and service-minded relationships now, each day of our life.<br><br>I firmly believe that, in addition to being tested in one way or another, we are also here to experience all of the happiness and joy possible. "Men are that they might have joy" (2 Nephi 2:25). The Son of God truly meant it when he said, "I am come that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly" (John 10:10). There is an abundant life to experience, and we can make it happen.<br><br>One of my favorite scriptures is found in section 58 of the Doctrine and Covenants. It says that we, as sons and daughters of God, have power within us because we are agents unto ourselves and that our mission and purpose is to be "anxiously engaged in a good cause" (D&amp;amp;C 58:27–28). I submit that as we choose to do good things for and in behalf of our fellow men and women that we will have joy and will fill our memory with good things.<br><br>Now, we can do a little more than just fill our memory. We can write down our feelings and fill pages in a diary. We can record our present thoughts so that we can refer to them later and so that our descendants can learn from our experiences. That's what Emmeline did. There is a part of the promise of the Spirit of Elijah that we sometimes forget. The hearts of the children will turn to their fathers, but the hearts of the fathers will also turn to their children. In a sense we are all fathers and mothers, and those who come after us are our children. We should remember that our contribution to their future is to leave them our legacy of the present.<br><br>For we who are past our youth, we have the opportunity to endure to the end and to make our life full of happy and fulfilling experiences. In May 1831 the Lord counseled Joseph Smith to teach the members of the Church emigrating to Ohio to organize themselves according to the Lord's laws and that He would provide for them until He commanded "them to go hence." Then He said, "And the hour and the day is not given unto them [to go hence, to leave], wherefore let them act upon this land as for years, and this shall turn unto them for their good" (D&amp;amp;C 51:17). In other words, the Lord teaches us to live in our present circumstances, to live the abundant and happy life where we are, "as for years." What a lesson to learn. I submit that as we do so, we will leave a legacy of living because we will remember our children, our grandchildren, and our great grandchildren, just as we were counseled to do by Elder Boyd K. Packer in our last conference.<br><h2><b>Remembering Our Savior, Jesus Christ</b></h2><br>Each week, on the Sabbath Day, we have the opportunity to renew our baptismal covenants and remember Jesus Christ anew. We listen to young men who have authority given to them to break the bread and bless the water. They say,<br><br><i>O God, the Eternal Father, we ask thee in the name of thy Son, Jesus Christ, to bless and sanctify this</i> [water]<i> to the souls of all those who drink of it, that they may do it in remembrance of the blood of thy Son, which was shed for them; that they may witness unto thee, O God, the Eternal Father, that they do always remember him, that they may have his Spirit to be with them.</i> [D&amp;amp;C 20:79]<br><br>As these young men ask our Heavenly Father to bless and sanctify the water, they pray that we who drink of it may remember our Savior, and further, the emblems are blessed that we may witness to the Father that we do always remember His Son. To witness means to attest, to testify that we remember Jesus Christ. How do we witness to the Father that we remember Him? There are many ways, of course, to remember Christ. We can learn of Him and remember His example and teachings by reading the scriptures. We can remember Him and come to know Him more fully through our prayers. We can demonstrate that we desire to follow Him through our attendance at sacrament meeting. But let me elaborate a bit on two other ways to witness to the Father that we do remember Jesus Christ, His Son. First, our ability to witness will grow stronger day by day as we actively live according to His gospel day by day. Second, as we learn what it feels like to have the Holy Ghost witness to us of the divinity of Christ, we will, in turn, be able to witness unto the Father and others that we remember His Son.<br><h2><b>Living the Gospel of Jesus Christ</b></h2><br>In the corporate and academic world, we compose vision statements and mission statements as guides for action and behavior in the workplace. Jesus Christ himself stated His vision for our earthly behavior. Simply put, the Sermon on the Mount (Matthew 5:1–7:29) is Christ's vision for living a higher law--the law of the gospel, if you will. In the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus Christ, the Son of God, fulfilled and superseded his own law of Moses and provided a vision for all mankind.<br><br>He said: Blessed are the poor in spirit; blessed are the meek; blessed are they who hunger and thirst after righteousness; blessed are all the pure in heart. He goes on to say: You are the salt of the earth; let your light so shine before this people, that they may see your good works; don't be angry with your brother; don't swear; turn the other cheek; go the extra mile; love your enemies; pray for them; don't be hypocrites; learn to pray to the Father; learn to serve God and not mammon; seek ye first the kingdom of God; judge not; and do unto others as ye would want them to do unto you. Then at the end of the sermon, Christ counsels us to build our lives (and our homes) upon the rock of His gospel. He asks us to see the vision and fulfill our earthly mission.<br><br>In her book <i>No Doubt About It, </i>Sister Sheri Dew relates an experience she had while attending a stake conference. A General Authority posed the following question: "How can you tell when a person is converted to Jesus Christ?" The answer, according to this General Authority, is by the way he or she treats other people. Let me suggest to you that the Sermon on the Mount teaches us how to treat other people. This is part of the law of the gospel. As we treat others with kindness, with gentleness, with love unfeigned, as we truly understand that we are agents unto ourselves, we will do good things; and as we do so we will sanctify ourselves, and thus we will actively and daily witness unto our Father that we do indeed remember His Son. Christ really does want us to incorporate the elements of the Sermon on the Mount into our daily interactions with other people. The advice given to little children to ask themselves, what would Jesus do? is good advice for all. Living His gospel, remembering our covenant to keep the law of the gospel, helps us remember Jesus Christ.<br><h2><b>Understanding and Remembering the Feelings of the Holy Ghost</b></h2><br>At the Feast of the Passover, Christ called the Apostles together for a last supper with them. He taught them that He would soon leave them, and He said, "Let not your heart be troubled" (John 14:1), for "the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you. Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you" (John 14:26–27). After his Resurrection, on the day of Pentecost, the gift of the Holy Ghost came upon the Apostles. They did receive comfort and peace. Furthermore, they received confidence in and the promised remembrance of the Lord that enabled them to continue their ministries.<br><br>We are promised the same comfort, peace, and power to act as we receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.<b> </b>As we learn what it feels like to experience the promptings of the still, small voice, our witness of Jesus grows stronger. Let me bring to your remembrance the experience of Oliver Cowdery. He sought the ability to translate the plates and the Lord told him:<br><br><i>Be faithful and diligent in keeping the commandments of God, and I will encircle thee in the arms of my love. ...</i><br><br><i>Verily, verily, I say unto you, if you desire a further witness, cast your mind upon the night that you cried unto me in your heart, that you might know concerning the truth of these things.</i><br><br><i>Did I not speak peace to your mind concerning the matter? What greater witness can you have than from God? </i>[D&amp;amp;C 6: 20, 22–23]<br><br>The Lord, in effect, said, "Don't you remember how you felt the other night? Don't you remember the peace and happiness you felt?" I submit that when we feel discouragement and depression, we should talk to ourselves, like this: "Scott, don't you remember when you felt peace before when you had a problem? Don't you remember when things worked out and you felt better the last time you felt this way? Don't you remember those feelings of relief and thanksgiving? If things worked out then, why won't they work out now?"<br><br>These are the times when we need to reread accounts of feelings felt and lessons learned. In such times of peace, happiness, and comfort, we are feeling the gift of the Holy Ghost at work with us. When we experience those good feelings, we can rest assured that we are feeling the consequences of possessing the gift of the Holy Ghost, and we are thus feeling the witness to us, on the part of this member of the Godhead, that Jesus Christ is real. In this way we also become a witness of Christ. I have often noticed that some people, like my own father and my father-in-law, as they approach the time to leave this life, are at peace with their circumstances. Why? Because they have lived a good life, and they have been tutored by the teachings of the Holy Ghost. They have had problems, to be sure, but they have also learned to feel confident in the witness of our Savior that comes through the gift of the Holy Ghost.<br><br>Sometimes the Holy Ghost will give us a warning, a loving chastisement, if you will, that can also serve as a witness to us of the love of Jesus Christ. I recall just such an experience. I had been a bishop of our ward in Payson for a little over five years when a young man who was graduating from Primary and entering the Young Men's organization came into my office. I knew this 12-year-old. You see he was only 7 when I first became his bishop. From the time he was 7 years old until he was 12--well, let's just say that he presented a challenge to his teachers. He came into the office and I remember very distinctly thinking to myself, "Oh, so I have an appointment with ----. I wonder if he will sit still while I talk to him. I hope he grows up soon. I don't know how he can possibly be a responsible deacon, holding the Aaronic Priesthood. I don't see how he will be a Boy Scout." At that moment, as he sat down across from my desk, the Lord spoke to me. I must have sat there for a long moment not uttering a word as I listened to the still, small voice say: "You must quit thinking ill of this young man. You cannot judge him in that way. You, as a judge in Israel, of all people, must listen to me, because I love this boy. He will one day be a leader in my kingdom."<br><br>Do you know what that experience taught me? Well, I left the office that Sunday afternoon and related the experience to my wife and told her that I knew now, more than ever, that the Lord loves us all. Else, why would he teach me that lesson? You can also guess that as I remember that lesson, I remember the feelings and the promptings of the Holy Ghost. Because of that experience, I will always be able to recall that our Savior loves us, and I will become a better witness of Him.<br><br>Now, one last point here. There is a blessing attached to our ability and willingness to witness to our Father that we will always remember His Son. The words of the sacrament ordinance end with these words: "That they may always have his Spirit to be with them. Amen." What a wonderful blessing! As we listen to the Holy Ghost, we witness and attest that we will always remember Christ. Then, as we always remember Christ, the Holy Ghost is with us even more. So it goes, from light to light, precept upon precept, we progress.<br><br>I have suggested a pattern of remembering the past, living in the present to leave a legacy for the future, and in all of this remembering Jesus Christ. After substantially preparing this talk, I read again chapter 5 of Helaman and found this pattern there. In verse 6 Helaman, son of Helaman, grandson of Alma the Younger, said to his two sons that he had named them Lehi and Nephi after the first Lehi and Nephi.<br><br><i>Behold, I have given unto you the names of our first parents who came out of the land of Jerusalem; and this I have done that when you remember your names ye may remember them</i>; <i>and when ye remember them ye may remember their works; and when ye remember their works ye may know how that it is said, and also written, that they were good.</i> [Helaman 5:6]<br><br>He wanted them to remember the past.<br><br>Then he said:<br><br><i>Therefore, my sons, I would that ye should do that which is good, that it may be said of you, and also written, even as it has been said and written of them. </i>[Helaman 5:7]<br><br>He desired that his sons live good lives here in the present, that they might leave a legacy of doing good for the future.<br><br>Then he spoke to his sons these words:<br><br><i>And now, my sons, remember, remember that it is upon the rock of our Redeemer, who is Christ, the Son of God, that ye must build your foundation; that when the devil shall send forth his mighty winds, yea, his shafts in the whirlwind, yea, when all his hail and his mighty storm shall beat upon you, it shall have no power over you to drag you down to the gulf of misery and endless wo, because of the rock upon which ye are built, which is a sure foundation, a foundation whereon if men build they cannot fall. </i>[Helaman 5:12]<br><br>He fervently counseled his sons to remember, remember their Redeemer and ours, Jesus Christ, the Son of God.<br><br>My young brothers and sisters, as a person who is now 29 years beyond his student days--as attested by the gray hair--but has memories of lessons learned and feelings felt, I bear you my solemn testimony that Jesus Christ is the Son of God. I witness to you that He wants us to be happy and that He has shown us the way. I also bear testimony to you that he does in fact want us to "sufficiently retain in remembrance" lessons learned and feelings felt from our past. Furthermore, He desires that we fully love and enjoy living in the present to the extent that our hearts are turned to remember our children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren of the future. We have the power within us to do good. Finally, Jesus has taught us of the necessity of remembering Him, not for any selfish reasons on His part but to remember Him that we may follow His example and thus be worthy of "peace in this world and eternal life in the world to come" (D&amp;amp;C 59:23). As we remember Him, He promises that He will remember us and that our names will be written in His eternal "book of remembrance" (3 Nephi 24:16). I say this in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Scott Duvall was assistant university librarian for Special Collections in the Harold B.

<h1>ng the Will of the Lord for Me - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
As I have thought about what I could say during this devotional today that might be of value and use to you, my thoughts took me to this question: "What do I wish I had known or better understood when I was your age?" Upon pondering that question, many topics came to mind. However, one that stands out is that I wish I had better understood how to discern the will of the Lord for me. President Ezra Taft Benson said, "<i>The great task of life</i> is to learn the will of the Lord and then do it" (Ezra Taft Benson, "<a href="https://www.lds.org/ensign/1988/05/the-great-commandment-love-the-lord.p1?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Great Commandment--Love the Lord</a>," <i>Ensign,</i> May 1988, 4).<br><br>President Benson continues by noting that our happiness in this life consists in freely and lovingly acknowledging God's will for us and in doing it in all ways, big and small. Every action performed in accord with God's will strengthens us spiritually and enhances our growth toward perfection. Discerning the will of the Lord has been difficult for me because intricately tied to this task are the doctrines of agency and inspiration--two doctrines that I was rather clueless about as a young adult.<br><br>In my youth I understood the doctrine of agency to mean God's gift to us of freedom to choose. I learned early on, as Elder Neal A. Maxwell noted, that choosing is not always a picnic (see Neal A. Maxwell, "Free to Choose," <i>BYU 2003–2004 Speeches</i> [Provo: BYU, 2004], 217–21) and that sometimes the consequences of my choices could be painful. Over the years I think I developed a phobia of making "wrong" choices or "mistakes." Thus, I made decisions by default, leaving things to chance, or asking someone else what they thought I should do rather than seeking the will of the Lord and being an active participant in determining the direction of my life.<br><br>When we dwelt in the presence of our Heavenly Father, we were endowed with agency--the opportunity or the privilege to choose what we would do. A whole family of words has descended from the word <i>agent,</i> including such words as <i>act, action, active,</i> and <i>actor</i> (Joseph Fielding McConkie, <i>Understanding the Power God Gives Us</i> [Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 2004], 11). It seems that this gift of agency endows us with the freedom to act and that God expects us to use our gifts, abilities, and judgment to develop our capacity to make wise choices.<br><br>This idea is supported by Doctrine &amp;amp; Covenants 58: 26–28:<br><br><i>For behold, it is not meet that I should command in all things; for he that is compelled in all things, the same is a slothful and not a wise servant. . . . </i><br><br>Verily I say, men should be anxiously engaged in a good cause, and do many things of their own free will, and bring to pass much righteousness;<br><br>For the power is in them, wherein they are agents unto themselves.<br><br>In a BYU devotional address on September 15, 1981, Elder Dallin H. Oaks recounted an example of the misunderstanding of this principle:<br><br><i>I once heard a young woman in testimony meeting praise the spirituality of her husband, indicating that he submitted every question to the Lord. She told how he accompanied her shopping and would not even choose between different brands of canned vegetables without making his selection a matter of prayer. That strikes me as improper. I believe the Lord expects us to use the intelligence and experience he has given us to make these kinds of choices.</i> [Dallin H. Oaks, "<a href="https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/dallin-h-oaks_revelation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Revelation</a>," <i>BYU 1981–82 Fireside and Devotional Speeches</i> (Provo: BYU, 1982), 26; see also <i>New Era,</i> September 1982, 46]<br><br>Okay, so those kinds of choices are easy: What brand of cereal should I buy? What color of pants should I wear? Who should I ask out this weekend? Should I watch TV or read the scriptures? Should I go to Relief Society or go shopping? But what about those more difficult choices: Where should I go to college? What should I study? What should my profession be? Should I go to graduate school? Which job offer should I take? Where should I live? Whom should I marry?<br><br>I have often asked myself, How can I make these "big" decisions when I don't know what the future holds? When it comes to big decisions, you don't want to make a mistake. Sometimes I have wondered why the Lord doesn't just tell us what to do concerning the big things. The answer is simple: If we are going to become as God is, we will have to learn to make decisions--even decisions of great importance--on our own initiative.<br><br>The principle of agency requires that we gain experience in learning to act as independent beings and to develop our own resources. Yet, in the Book of Mormon Alma exhorts us, "Counsel with the Lord in all thy doings, and he will direct thee for good" (Alma 37: 37), implying that we are to seek the Lord's wisdom and guidance in all that we do.<br><br>Elder Bruce R. McConkie notes,<br><br><i>And so we're faced with two propositions. One is that we ought to be guided by the spirit of inspiration, the spirit of revelation. The other is that we're here under a direction to use our agency, to determine what we ought to do on our own; and we need to strike a fine balance between these two. . . .</i><br><br>There's a fine balance between agency and inspiration. We're expected to do everything in our power and then to seek an answer from the Lord, a confirming seal that we've reached the right conclusion. [Bruce R. McConkie, "<a href="https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/bruce-r-mcconkie_agency-inspiration/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Agency or Inspiration</a>?" <i>New Era,</i> January 1975, 39, 41]<br><br>Even though this process seems quite clear, I have struggled with striking this balance between agency and inspiration. At one extreme, I have felt that the Lord has more important things to do than listen to my concerns. This attitude has at times fostered a spirit of pride and a propensity to not seek His input at all and to just do things my own way. On the other extreme sometimes I have been paralyzed into inaction, unwilling to do anything without an answer from the heavens. How can we avoid relying too much on our intellectual powers while ignoring the Spirit, or expecting spiritual solutions while ignoring our own power to reason things out for ourselves?<br><br>President Marion G. Romney described how he has found this<br><br><i>When confronted with a problem I prayerfully weigh in my mind alternative solutions and come to a conclusion as to which of them is best. Then in prayer I submit to the Lord my problem, tell him I desire to make the right choice,</i> [and] <i>what is, in my judgment, the right course. Then I ask him if I have made the right decision to give me the burning in my bosom that He promised Oliver Cowdery. When enlightenment and peace come into my mind, I know the Lord is saying yes. If I have a "stupor of thought," I know he is saying no, and I try again, following the same procedure. When we learn to distinguish between the inspiration that comes from the Spirit of the Lord and that which comes from our own uninspired hopes and desires, we need make no mistakes.</i> [Marion G. Romney, "<a href="https://www.lds.org/new-era/1975/09/qa-questions-and-answers?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Q&amp;amp;A: Questions and Answers</a>," <i>New Era,</i> October 1975, p. 35]<br><br>So, how do we distinguish between inspiration from the Lord and "that which comes from our own uninspired ambitions and desires"--or even from our own warm, earnest, and well-motivated desires? How do we tell the difference between inspiration and our own thoughts and ideas or from a counterfeit that Satan throws out there to confuse us? The Lord assures us that if a decision or course of action is right, "I will cause that your bosom shall burn within you; therefore, you shall feel that it is right. But if it be not right you shall have no such feelings, but you shall have a stupor of thought that shall cause you to forget the thing which is wrong"<i> </i>(D&amp;amp;C 9: 8–9).<br><br>How do we discern the burning in the bosom from the stupor of thought? What is a stupor of thought? Sometimes I feel like I'm always in a stupor of thought. I looked up the word <i>stupor</i> in the dictionary and found the descriptions a "dazed state, a . . . lack of mental alertness" (<i>Encarta World English Dictionary,</i> s.v. "stupor"). Other descriptors are <i>sluggish, numbness, absence of the ability to move or feel, apathy, languidness, dullness,</i> or <i>not feeling inspired to go forward.</i> I was struck by the depressive mood created by all of these words. There is nothing inspiring, exciting, or comforting about any of them.<br><br>Contrast the <i>stupor</i> descriptors with words describing the Spirit: <i>enlightens, enlivens, quickens, enlarges, expands, purifies, inspires, fills the soul with light, peace, love, clarity,</i> and <i>joy</i> (see Parley P. Pratt, <i>Key to the Science of Theology,</i> 9th ed. [1965], 101). Other descriptors of how the Spirit confirms our course are "much assurance," "peace to your mind," "confidence wax strong," and "feel that it is right."<br><br>Even though we must all learn how the Spirit speaks to us individually, I found these descriptions to be helpful in making righteous choices. Growing in our ability to receive revelation is like learning a new language or learning to play a musical instrument. We must practice diligently for a long time before we feel comfortable with it. We must be patient with ourselves, recognize that we might have some setbacks, and persist until we become masters at recognizing a witness of the Spirit.<br><br>Heavenly Father loves us and wants us to succeed. When we are having difficulty getting answers and discerning His will, we may be doing something to complicate the process. Today, I will focus on six barriers that might interfere with our ability to receive personal revelation.<br><h2><b>1. We haven't made a decision.</b></h2><br>This principle is illustrated by a story told by Elder Merrill C. Oaks.<br><br><i>Some years ago while I was serving as a bishop of a Brigham Young University ward, a young woman came to me for counsel concerning a marriage proposal. She really liked the young man but was strongly committed to not taking a step as important as marriage without receiving inspiration that it was right. She had been praying about whether to marry him and had received no answer. I assured her that the Lord would surely answer her prayers and that she should keep on praying. </i><br><br>The following Sunday she asked to see me again. She felt she was receiving no answer. I interviewed her and established that she was worthy. I again assured her that the Lord does hear and answer prayers and that she should continue praying.<br><br>The young man was really pressing her to make a decision. He loved her but felt she was stalling because she probably did not love him. He was approaching the time he might terminate the relationship. She was very concerned but felt she could not marry him without an answer from the Lord. I was very troubled by this. I knew the Lord answered prayers. I knew this young woman was worthy to receive answers to her prayers. Why was she not receiving an answer?<br><br>The key came to me in a moment of clear enlightenment. I told her she was expecting the Lord to completely make the decision for her, but He would not do that. Even a decision as important as marriage requires us to exercise our own agency. . . .<br><br>Like Oliver Cowdery, she had taken no thought except to keep asking the Lord. I told her she must exercise her own agency by studying it out in her mind, making a tentative decision, and then asking the Lord for a confirmation of her decision. . . .<br><br>[The young lady in this story eventually] <i>received her answer. She explained, . . . "I just began to feel </i>[more and more positive and] g<i>ood about getting married, and I knew that my prayers were being answered. </i>[Merrill C. Oaks, "<a href="https://www.lds.org/new-era/2001/08/how-to-get-an-answer?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">How to Get an Answer</a>," <i>New Era,</i> August 2001, 47]<br><br>Do I expect the Lord to do all the work and reveal things to me that I haven't bothered to study out in my own mind beforehand?<br><h2><b>2. We haven't learned how to listen.</b></h2><br>In his book <i>The Lost Art of Listening,</i> Michael Nichols states, "True listening has become a rarity in modern life." We live in a noisy, busy, hurried world and rarely take the time to listen. He notes that listening is so basic that many of us take it for granted and think we're better listeners than we really are. In reality most of us hear only what we want to hear or what we have trained our minds to hear. He notes that good listening takes effort and can be achieved only by suspending our preoccupation with ourselves and with our needs (Michael P. Nichols, <i>The Lost Art of Listening</i> [New York: The Guilford Press, 1995]).<br><br>When it comes to communicating with the Lord, these obstacles to listening can be difficult to surmount. After we have studied, pondered, and prayed, we must listen carefully to our Heavenly Father or we will miss His answers. Elder Boyd K. Packer notes, "The voice of the Spirit is a still, small voice--a voice that is <i>felt</i> rather than heard" (Boyd K. Packer, "<a href="https://www.lds.org/liahona/2000/07/the-cloven-tongues-of-fire?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Cloven Tongues of Fire</a>," <i>Ensign,</i> May 2000, 8). If we are not in a quiet, still place when we approach Him, we might not hear or feel His answers. That quiet, still place must extend to our state of mind. The Spirit has difficulty impressing a busy, racing, anxious mind. More often than not, whisperings of the Spirit will go unheard if we are too busy to listen.<br><br>In addition, we live in a time when many of us turn to addictive substances and behaviors such as television, shopping, eating, computer games, surfing the Internet, and busyness for comfort and avoidance from the problems and stressors of life. These habits can desensitize us and deaden our sensibilities to the promptings and feelings of the Spirit. Plus, much of our modern day entertainment with its increase in stimulation, gratification, and indulgence is offensive to the Spirit.<br><br>We each could ask ourselves: What could I turn off, turn down, or tune out in order to hear the voice of the Spirit in my life? Am I doing anything in my life that is offensive to the Spirit and preventing the Holy Ghost from being my constant companion? Is there anything I could eliminate from my busy life so that I would have more time to be still, to study scriptures, ponder, and pray?<br><h2><b>3. We're too intent on wanting what we want.</b></h2><br>Sometimes answers to prayers are not recognized because we are too intent on wanting a confirmation of our own desires. We fail to see that the Lord would have us do something else. In some cases the answers require us to stretch and grow and to leave the comfort of what is familiar to us. At other times we may want to move forward or act when the answer is to wait. Often waiting can be as difficult and require as much faith as acting. When we seek the will of the Lord, we must be willing to be obedient to it.<br><br>I recall a decision I was struggling with during my college years. I fasted and prayed and wrestled with this decision for a whole semester. Looking back, I can now see the Lord was giving me my answer early on, but I didn't like the answer; it wasn't the answer I wanted. So I convinced myself that I hadn't really gotten an answer yet. I continued to fast and pray and to pester the Lord, suggesting that maybe the timing wasn't right, maybe I needed to be patient, and down the road I could have this thing I wanted. One Sunday as I was pondering about the decision, the answer came into my mind with unmistaken clarity. There was no doubt in my mind what I was to do.<br><br>However, I determined that I just wasn't going to accept this answer. Surely the Lord would forgive me someday. It wouldn't hurt to go against His guidance just this once. It's not like I was committing a huge sin. As I entertained these thoughts and determined to pursue the course of what I wanted to do, I recall with vividness the feelings of emptiness and loss. I felt a tangible withdrawal of the Spirit. Yes, I could refuse to follow the guidance of the Lord, but how could I bear the loss of His Spirit? I changed my course and now prayed for the courage and strength to accept and follow His will.<br><br>Ideally, we should go to the Lord with a humble spirit and ask Him to write His will upon our hearts, rather than go to Him determined to carry out our own will. Elder Henry B. Eyring said, "I have had prayers answered. Those answers were most clear when what I wanted was silenced by an overpowering need to know what God wanted. It is then that the answer from a loving Heavenly Father can be spoken to the mind by the still, small voice and can be written on the heart (Henry B. Eyring, "<a href="https://www.lds.org/ensign/2000/11/write-upon-my-heart?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Write upon My Heart</a>," <i>Ensign,</i> November 2000, 86).<br><br>How submissive am I to the will of the Lord in my life right now? How often do I try to counsel the Lord, rather than take counsel from Him? (see Jacob 4:10).<br><h2><b>4. Our hearts are not prepared to receive His answers.</b></h2><br>H. Burke Peterson said,<br><br><i>As we go through life, we ofttimes build a rock wall between ourselves and heaven. This wall is built by our unrepented sins. For example, in our wall there may be stones of many different sizes and shapes. There could be stones because we have been unkind to someone. Criticism of leaders or teachers may add another stone. A lack of forgiveness may add another. Vulgar thoughts and actions may add some rather large stones in this wall.</i> [H. Burke Peterson, "<a href="https://www.lds.org/ensign/1981/06/prayer-try-again?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Prayer--Try Again</a>," <i>Ensign,</i> June 1981, 73]<br><br>In spite of the wall we build in front of us, when we cry out, the Lord in His mercy still sends His messages from heaven; but instead of being able to penetrate our heart, they hit the wall that we have built up and bounce off. When His messages don't penetrate so easily, we say, "He doesn't hear," or "He doesn't answer." It is our challenge and responsibility to destroy this wall, to repent and cleanse ourselves so that we can be in tune with the Spirit. Revelation is the reward of repentance, obedience, and righteousness.<br><br>Is there a sin or habit in my life for which I need to repent? Is there anyone in my life that I need to forgive?<br><h2><b>5. We lack faith or confidence in Heavenly Father.</b></h2><br>Often this lack of faith is manifested by a lack of confidence in ourselves and in our ability to get answers. We struggle with feelings of unworthiness and do not feel that we are important to the Lord. We might think that others can approach the Lord and receive instruction from Him, but we cannot. The truth is we can build our faith by knowing that God lives, that He knows us, that He loves us, and that He has a plan for us.<br><br>President Benson stated, "Nothing is going to startle us more when we pass through the veil to the other side than to realize how well we know our Father and how familiar his face is to us" (Ezra Taft Benson, "Jesus Christ--Gifts and Expectations," <i>Speeches of the Year</i> [Provo: BYU, 1974], 313). Perhaps when we pray, we can picture Him as a loving, kind, wise, understanding Father who wants us to succeed. The Savior teaches of the pure love our Heavenly Father has for us, "If a son shall ask bread of any of you that is a father, will he give him a stone? or if he ask a fish, will he for a fish give him a serpent? (Luke 11:11).<br><br>Elder Scott teaches that "when answers . . . don't seem to come" or they don't come in the way we expect, we can remember that<br><br><i>when we explain a problem and a proposed solution</i> [or come to Him with a decision we have made],<i> sometimes He answers yes, sometimes no. Often He withholds an answer, not for lack of concern, but because He loves us--perfectly. He wants us to apply truths He has given us. For us to grow, we need to trust in our ability to make correct decisions. We need to do what we</i> feel <i>is right.</i> <i>In time, He will answer. He will not fail us. </i>[Elder Richard G. Scott, "<a href="https://www.lds.org/ensign/1989/11/learning-to-recognize-answers-to-prayer.p1?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Learning to Recognize Answers to Prayer</a>," <i>Ensign,</i> November 1989, 30–31; emphasis in original]<br><br>When was the last time I received revelation from the Lord? How can I feel the love of the Lord more consistently in my life?<br><h2><b>6. We don't recognize answers when they come.</b></h2><br>Referring to the Holy Ghost, Joseph Smith said, "If you will listen to the first promptings, you will get it right nine times out of ten." How often have you had an impression and rationalized it away as your own thought? For instance, when faced with a particular challenge or problem, an impression might come as to what to do about it. Instead of acting on that prompting, many of us second- and third-guess the prompting and begin to doubt that it actually came from the Spirit.<br><br>One of our problems is we do not pay attention to the Lord when He whispers to us on seemingly insignificant things. Then when something big comes along and we really want inspiration, we're out of practice and don't know how to receive it. President Harold B. Lee counseled<b>, </b>"All of us should try to . . . give heed to the sudden ideas that come to us, and if we'll give heed to them and cultivate an ear to hear these promptings we too--each of us--can grow in the spirit of revelation" (<i>Teachings of Presidents of the Church: Harold B. Lee</i> [Melchizedek Priesthood and Relief Society course of study, 2000], 51).<br><br>Sometimes we've already received the answer, and we don't realize it. In Section 6 of the Doctrine and Covenants, the Lord had to remind Oliver Cowdery that he had already received many answers concerning the veracity of the Church and the course he was to take. To teach Oliver, the Lord said:<br><br><i>Behold, thou knowest that thou has inquired of me and I did enlighten thy mind; and now I tell thee these things that thou mayest know that thou hast been enlightened by the Spirit of truth.</i> . . .<br><br><i>Did I not speak peace to your mind concerning the matter?</i> [D&amp;amp;C 6: 15, 23]<br><br>If we feel that our prayers are not being answered, we, like Oliver, may need to review the scriptures about how God speaks to us.<br><br>Ask yourself: Is there evidence in my life that Heavenly Father has already answered me concerning a given issue or problem? Do I pay attention to the Lord when He whispers to me on seemingly insignificant things? Do I write down and act on impressions and promptings from the Lord?<br><h2><b>Listen to Your Heart</b></h2><br>Over the years as I have struggled with decisions, I am frequently asked the question, "What does your heart tell you?" Or I've been advised, "Follow your heart." I would often walk away wondering to myself, "What does that mean?" The scriptures tell us that revelation speaks to both the heart and mind (see D&amp;amp;C 8: 2). I fear I have been guilty of leaning too heavily on the mind, thinking and analyzing, trying to be very rational and logical. President Harold B. Lee frequently said that "when your heart begins to tell you things that your mind does not, then you are getting the spirit of the Lord" (Harold B. Lee, "<a href="https://www.lds.org/new-era/2002/06/when-your-heart-tells-you-things-your-mind-does-not-know?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">When Your Heart Tells You Things Your Mind Does Not Know</a>," <i>New Era,</i> February 1971, p. 3).<br><br>As we journey through mortality, sometimes painful or disappointing life experiences cause us to build walls around our hearts. Feelings of inadequacy or unworthiness might cause us to turn our hearts away from God to seek acceptance and approval from other sources. Sometimes our "hearts are set [too] much upon the things of this world" and "aspire to the honors of men" (D&amp;amp;C 121: 35). Disobedience can cause our hearts to harden and stiffen and sometimes even turn to stone. Hearts in these conditions have difficulty choosing in accordance with God's will.<br><br>We, like Nephi, can pray that our hearts will be softened (see 1 Nephi 2:16) and be made pliable to the teachings of the Lord. We can pray as Ezekiel suggests for a "new spirit" or that our hearts will be transformed from a heart of stone to a "heart of flesh" (Ezekiel 11: 19). We can ask Him to heal our broken hearts (see Psalms 147: 3). We can turn our hearts back to the Lord and learn to trust in Him with all our heart (see Proverbs 3: 5).<br><br>As our hearts become softer and more pliable toward God, we will be more inclined to be obedient to His commandments and compliant with His will. I testify that the joy associated with God's gift of freedom to choose is in learning to choose rightly, to choose in accordance with His will. I testify that Heavenly Father loves us, that He is mindful of us, and that He is patient with us as we strive to discern His will for us. I know that it is in freely, lovingly, and joyfully acknowledging His will for us that we find true happiness. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>LaNae Valentine was the director of BYU Women's Services and Resources at Brigham Young University when this devotional address was given on 29 June 2004.</i><br><br><i>© Brigham Young University.

<h1>I - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
As I begin I would like to give special thanks to my wife and my best friend, Janice, who has been such a wonderful companion and influence in my life. Sweetheart, I love you with all my heart and thank you for being you.<br><br>As I prayed about and pondered what I should say today, I turned to a study of our Savior's life, beginning with the first recorded knowledge we have of Him. In Abraham 3:22 we read about the premortal Grand Council that was held in heaven. There God the Father laid out the plan whereby the world would be created, and we would be sent to prove ourselves.<br><br>Then the Lord asked that simple but critical question:<br><br><i>Whom shall I send? And one answered like unto the Son of Man: Here am I send me. And another answered and said: Here am I, send me. And the Lord said: I will send the first.</i> [Abraham 3:27]<br><br>As I contemplate this scripture, I am impressed by the fact that Jehovah's act of stepping forward and proclaiming, "Here am I," was completely voluntary. He was not coerced, for that would have been contrary to God's will and the eternal law of agency. Rather, God asked the simple question, "Whom shall I send?" In response, our Savior took the initiative to step forward to take upon Himself our sins.<br><br>In taking this initiative, the Savior committed Himself to be personally involved in our lives. He knew that He couldn't pay or entice someone else to do the task. Only His own personal involvement--His sacrifice--was sufficient to pay the price.<br><br>This account in Abraham contains another extremely critical message for us. A second spirit came forward saying:<br><br><i>Behold, here am I, send me, I will be thy son, and I will redeem all mankind, that one soul shall not be lost, and surely I will do it; wherefore give me thine honor.</i> [Moses 4:1]<br><br>Nevertheless, Jehovah was chosen because, as God explained to Moses,<br><br><i>My Beloved Son, which was my Beloved and Chosen from the beginning, said unto me--Father, thy will be done, and the glory be thine forever.</i> [Moses 4:2]<br><br>What a difference! Jesus Christ stepped forward because of His infinite love and His devotion to His Father. He and His Father were One because of His faithfulness and steadfast devotion to do His Father's will, no matter the circumstances. Only He was capable of paying the price. The other spirit was a complete fraud who wanted things his own way and all the glory for himself. He was willing to lie, bend the rules, break eternal laws, coerce and trample on others, and ignore the Father's will.<br><br>As I study and ponder the scriptures and many talks and articles by latter-day prophets, I realize that the term <i>integrity</i> is used many times to describe one who loves the Lord with all his or her heart and whose whole life, thoughts, and actions are consistent with the Father's will.<br><br>Thus, this account of the premortal Grand Council illustrates three principles: (1) initiative, (2) involvement, and (3) integrity, which serve as a blueprint for us in our daily lives.<br><h2><b>Initiative</b></h2><br>We are all familiar with D&amp;amp;C 58:26–28, which states:<br><br><i>For behold, it is not meet that I should command in all things; for he that is compelled in all things, the same is a slothful and not a wise servant; wherefore he receiveth no reward.</i><br><br>Verily I say, men should be anxiously engaged in a good cause, and do many things of their own free will, and bring to pass much righteousness;<br><br>For the power is in them, wherein they are agents unto themselves. And inasmuch as men do good they shall in nowise lose their reward.<br><br>This is a very powerful scripture, but it is also one that causes us consternation and feelings of guilt. Just how do we take the initiative to do good, especially when we're so pressured with our studies, our jobs, and our families? We rationalize that perhaps now is not the time. Perhaps we should take the initiative to do good tomorrow. Yet the scripture doesn't exempt students, faculty, or other people from its direction. President Gordon B. Hinckley has stated:<br><br><i>You want to be happy? Forget yourself and get lost in this great cause, and bend your efforts to helping people. Cultivate a spirit of forgiveness in your heart against any who might have offended you. Look to the Lord and live, and work and lift and serve His sons and daughters. You will come to know happiness as you've never known it before. I don't care how old you are, how young you are. You can lift people and help them. Heaven knows there are so very, very many people in this world who need help.</i> [Mike Cannon, "Missionary Theme Was Pervasive During Visit of President Hinckley," Liverpool England Fireside, August 31, 1995, in <i>Church News</i>, 9 September 9 1995, 4]<br><br>In this quote President Hinckley tells us all to take the initiative to get involved. He does not say that we must do something big and overwhelming. We are to do now what we have the power to do. If we do, the world will be better, and we will be happier.<br><br>How then do we take the initiative to help others, when we're under such tremendous time pressures? I think one excellent way of doing so is to attempt to put ourselves in the other person's shoes--to see the world from the other person's perspective. This can be a roommate, family member, friend, or simply someone that we heard or found out about. We must get out of ourselves and see things from a different perspective. As we prayerfully open our eyes and change our perspective, we can begin to actually <i>feel</i> and understand what the other person is feeling and experiencing. If we don't, wonderful opportunities to really make a difference, even with relatively little effort, can be lost.<br><br>A few months ago some old friends from my college days visited me. They had come to BYU to their daughter's graduation, and since they were here, they took the time to look me up. We had lost contact with each other because our lives had taken different paths. I was greatly saddened to hear that their daughter's last year here at BYU was a very difficult one. She had suffered from some health problems but also from great loneliness. There had been many opportunities for roommates, home teachers, visiting teachers, and others to simply sit and listen or to merely say hi. Yet few had taken the opportunity to do so. That simple act would have made a tremendous difference in her life. Unfortunately, others are here who are facing the same loneliness.<br><br>Contrast this experience with one my daughters had. Our granddaughter, Kayla, was born in October 2002 with an extremely serious heart defect. She needed to have open-heart surgery immediately, or she would suffocate. The first surgery was not totally successful, and so within a week a second surgery was necessary. During the second surgery the sutures around Kayla's little aorta tore, and the doctors worked frantically to keep her from bleeding to death. Periodically a nurse would come out of the operating room to keep us notified of her situation. The news was always extremely bad.<br><br>During the surgery two of our daughters tried to continue on with their lives here at BYU. When Jill got the message that Kayla probably would not make it, she went over to the Harris Fine Arts Building to find Kim to tell her the news. As the two girls cried and hugged each other, a young man noticed them and sensed their distress. Quietly he stepped over to them and simply said; "I hope you feel better and that everything will be okay." He then handed them a BYU Men's Chorus CD that contains wonderful, healing music. That young man didn't know my daughters, but he kept his eyes and his heart open, was sensitive to the Spirit, and took the initiative to act. His simple action gave them comfort and support. Fortunately, through the prayers and faith of many, and because it's our Father's will, today 20-month-old Kayla loves to sing "Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star" and to give her Grandpa kisses!<br><br>These experiences and others like them have caused me to examine my own life and to prayerfully sharpen my perspective as I take the initiative to be aware of others' needs. I've also encouraged my students to open their eyes and take the initiative to bless family, friends, and others through quiet acts of service.<br><h2><b>Involvement</b></h2><br>The second principle that the Savior demonstrated in that Grand Council was personal involvement. He volunteered to take upon Himself our sins. His involvement required a caring, loving attitude. It meant getting involved for the right reason. Without this attitude and reason, all efforts would have been meaningless.<br><br>I believe the concept of involvement encompasses even more than merely going through the motions. I think this is the concept that my dad was trying to teach me and my brothers when we were growing up in a small farming community in southeastern Arizona. At the time the Church in Duncan owned a large cotton farm. Because the weeds always seemed to grow faster than the cotton, the priesthood brethren were often called to hoe out the weeds. For a young boy, in the hot Arizona sun, that was no small task. Every time the request came, Dad would work shoulder-to-shoulder with his sons as we moved slowly up and down the rows of cotton.<br><br>When I got older I asked Dad why he just didn't hire someone to fulfill his obligation. After all, his personal time was much more valuable than what it would have cost to hire a farmhand. Dad simply smiled and replied, "Son, it is because the welfare farm needs us, and we need the welfare farm." I learned that service rendered with personal involvement becomes much more beneficial, both to the recipient and to the giver. When we render service with the proper attitude and for the right reasons, we benefit from being involved because we are expanding and developing our love and charity for others.<br><br>Let me tell you about some individuals who have truly learned and applied these concepts in their own lives. Melanie Hall and Marty Tidwell were typical BYU students. Like you, they were extremely busy with their studies and their jobs. But they both found time to take the initiative to get involved. Among other things they were involved with Special Olympics, field trips with the American Fork Training School, and BYU Management Society community clean-up projects. Melanie was from Durango, Colorado; and Marty was from Prineville, Oregon. Melanie's uncle was Marty's home ward bishop in Oregon. So one year Melanie's aunt invited her to their home for Christmas, and she arranged for Melanie to ride to Oregon with Marty. Thus, Melanie tells me their first "date" was prearranged by her aunt and was 14 hours long! They eventually fell in love and married, and after graduation they worked for a while in Portland, Oregon, and then moved to Singapore, where they work today.<br><br>Several years ago a woman in their ward, Leearne DiMichiel, was trying to adopt a baby girl from an orphanage in Cambodia, and she asked Melanie to accompany her there to help clear up some medical issues with the baby. Before leaving, they made baby quilts and collected toys and clothes for the children at the orphanage. But once there they met two little boys who changed their lives forever.<br><br>One was 18-month-old Ratana, who was very near death. He had both AIDS and tuberculosis, and at the time they saw him, he was nothing more than skin and bones. He was lying on a towel he had just vomited on, and he was naked except for a dirty cloth tied around his waist as a diaper. When Melanie and Leearne tried to get close to him, he would cover his mouth with his bony hands, whimper, and turn away from them as if to say, "You mustn't look at me. I'm too sad." They sensed that he knew something was wrong with him, and he seemed embarrassed for anyone to pay any attention to him. The other baby, Han, was four months old and weighed only four and a half pounds. When Melanie asked the ladies working at the orphanage what was wrong with Han, they repeatedly said, "No mama, no papa, not enough milk." With that response, the two women knew what they had to do. They agreed to pay for private care for both Ratana and Han. Immediately both boys were cleaned up and taken care of. Melanie tells me:<br><br><i>It was such a moving thing to watch Ratana take it all in. He went from being a child left in the corner with nothing to a child who was getting the attention he deserved. He was calm and serene as the ladies fixed him up. He had a peaceful, relieved look on his face.</i><br><br>Less than a week after the two women returned home, Ratana died--but since the day that they'd found him he had been dressed, fed, cared for, and loved. What a blessing to him and to them that they had taken the initiative to become involved. Because of this experience, Melanie, Leearne, and others sponsored other critically ill babies. They even hired an artist to paint murals of nature scenes and Disney characters on the walls of the orphanage.<br><br>Now what about Han? Well, Melanie and Leearne introduced him to Sister White, the wife of the mission president. She agreed to visit Han frequently and serve as a surrogate grandmother. He responded well to the love and attention and was eventually adopted by a family in Hawaii.<br><br>This was only the beginning. Over the years, as they continued their efforts with fund-raisers and baby showers for these children, word seemed to spread magically and many other individuals and organizations became involved. The work continues today. Three years ago the Tidwells adopted an 11-year-old Cambodian girl themselves. With her adoption, Melanie and Marty needed to redirect their focus to their new daughter. Even though she is not as involved today with the Cambodian efforts, Melanie continues helping in other areas. She and several sisters in the Singapore Stake visit residents of the Singapore Leprosy Home. Although the residents are completely cured of leprosy, they suffer from deformities and disfigurements; thus, many have not left the home in over 30 years. I quote one small part of an experience Melanie had there:<br><br><i>I had a delightful interchange with one woman. She spoke pretty good English. After I talked with her a little bit, she turned to me and, with a big smile on her face, said, "Why are you here? Don't you have any friends?" We laughed together. I asked if I could have my photo taken with her. She said no, because she was too old and ugly. I said, "Maybe that is what you think, but I think you have a beautiful heart." She agreed to be in the photo.</i><br><br>Thank you, Melanie, Marty, and Leearne for following the Savior's example to truly become personally involved.<br><h2><b>Integrity</b></h2><br>As the Savior has demonstrated, initiative and involvement must be undertaken with integrity. Integrity includes honesty in both word and deed, even when it might hurt. Children, for example, are totally honest. Just a few months ago, Janice and I took our grandkids out to dinner. When the server brought the bill, she also brought some lollipops for the kids. One of them was green, which just happens to be the favorite color of our four-year-old grandson, Spencer. With a smile he took the lollipop and exclaimed, "Look, my lollipop is the same color as my shirt!" Then he picked up his fork and thoughtfully declared, "Look, my fork is the same color as Grandpa's hair!"<br><br>In the July 2003 <i>Ensign,</i> Elder L. Tom Perry states:<br><br><i>What is the meaning of </i>integrity<i>? We can find several definitions in the dictionary: rigid adherence to a code or standard of values; moral soundness, especially as it relates to steadfastness to truth, purpose, responsibility, or trust; moral and ethical strength; or the quality of being whole, complete, undivided.</i> ["Staying Power," L. Tom Perry, <i>Ensign</i>, July 2003, 42]<br><br>Note that the concept of integrity encompasses both the principle of honesty as well as the concept of completeness, or wholeness. Through his desire and unshaken steadfastness to God's will, Jesus Christ and the Father became One--complete and undivided.<br><br>Integrity is definitely an endangered concept today. I am greatly saddened by the accounting and other professional scandals that have come to light over the last several years. I applaud the efforts spent on shoring up the statutes and regulations in an attempt to prevent future problems. These certainly will help. But legislation and regulation, while necessary, simply are not sufficient for a society to operate properly. Legislation and regulation are not a substitute for integrity.<br><br>President Hinckley put it this way:<br><br><i>What was once controlled by the moral and ethical standards of the people, we now seek to handle by public law. And so the statutes multiply, enforcement agencies consume ever-increasing billions, and prison facilities are constantly expanded--but the torrent of dishonesty pours on and grows in volume.</i> ["We Believe in Being Honest," Gordon B. Hinckley, <i>Ensign</i>, October 1990, 4]<br><br>When I first read this statement from President Hinckley about statutes multiplying, my reaction was, "President Hinckley's been reading the Internal Revenue Code!" Talk about multiplying statutes! For example, the definition of the word <i>employment</i> in the code is only one sentence long. Now that sounds okay until you realize that sentence goes on for five pages and contains 21 paragraphs!<br><br>I once had a conversation with a friend who is not of our faith. As we discussed the principle of tithing, he stated that his church defined tithing as 10 percent of one's income "after necessary living expenses." He went on to indicate that his church was studying whether vacations should be considered "a necessary living expense." How grateful I am for a tithing system that is properly based upon personal integrity. If it were not, I'm afraid that the "tithing code" would rival the Internal Revenue Code in length and complexity! Yet, note the tremendous responsibility that is ours to ensure that the system is whole. How grateful I am for parents who, through their example, taught that the question to ask when considering tithing is, "Have I paid enough?" Now I'm not suggesting that we should ask the same question in all of our business dealings and when we pay taxes. But we must apply the same strict standard of integrity.<br><br>Let me give you a simple example. The tax law clearly states that expenses incurred while traveling away from home are deductible as business expenses only if "the trip is primarily related to the taxpayer's trade or business" (Treas. Reg. §1.162-2). Thus, the reason the taxpayer takes the trip becomes the critical issue. Sadly, I know individuals among us who, with a wink and a smile, proudly declare that every vacation they take is now deductible because somewhere along the way they just might have a business discussion with someone. The same logic is used to make the family pet a deductible watchdog. Without an audit of all taxpayers, the system itself simply cannot eliminate such abuses. Changing the tax system is not the answer, because without integrity on the part of taxpayers, the new system would also suffer the consequences of unethical behavior.<br><br>This concept applies in all areas of our lives. Certainly, we must follow the law in all of our actions. But, if we rely solely upon a strict interpretation of the letter of the law rather than on our own personal integrity, society becomes much more complex and difficult--even self-destructive. One may outwardly appear to act or speak correctly by not technically breaking the law, stealing, cheating, or lying. But if the individual is improperly motivated, he or she may not be acting with integrity. Do we focus on only the "letter of the law," or do we live our lives with integrity? I am greatly saddened to read in the local newspaper about young men and young women who are completely willing to compromise their morality as long as they don't "go all the way" as they interpret it. Yet, they lie to themselves and others, claiming to still live by strong moral values (see Lucinda Dillon Kindead, "Sexual Attitudes," <i>Deseret News</i>, 30 June 2004, 10).<br><br>Through this lack of integrity they withdraw themselves from the Spirit and lose its guiding influence. Elder Joseph B. Wirthlin has stated:<br><br><i>The consummate reward of integrity is the constant companionship of the Holy Ghost. (See D&amp;amp;C 121:46.) The Holy Ghost does not attend us when we do evil. But when we do what is right, he can dwell with us and guide us in all we do.</i> ["Personal Integrity," Joseph B. Wirthlin, <i>Ensign,</i> May 1990, 33]<br><br>Certainly throughout our lives we repeatedly have opportunities to step forward and declare, "Here am I!" Some of these times are formal, such as when we receive a mission call, have a temple recommend interview with our bishop, or receive a calling in the Church. As we're reminded in the hymn "A Poor Wayfaring Man of Grief," other times may come to us unexpectedly (<i>Hymns</i>, No. 29).<br><br>Of course, the time will come for all of us when we ultimately must present ourselves before our Maker, stripped of any pretense, and simply declare, "Here am I." The outcome of that experience is largely dependent upon how well we follow our Redeemer's example as He stepped forward with initiative, involvement, and integrity.<br><br>May we all do as He has done is my prayer in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Robert L.

<h1> Follow the Holy Spirit - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
In the late 1940s a young man named Tom was at a dance for the freshman class at the University of Utah. As he was dancing with a girl from West High School, a young lady from East High came dancing by. Tom took one look and decided that there was a young lady he needed to meet. However, she danced away and the evening concluded before Tom could dance with this mystery girl, much less find out her name. Several months later, while waiting for a streetcar at Thirteenth East and Second South in Salt Lake City, Tom looked up and could hardly believe his eyes! There was the young lady he had seen at the dance! She was with another young lady and a young man who Tom recognized from his days in grade school. However, Tom couldn't remember his name. He squared his shoulders and plunged into his opportunity.<br><br>Tom walked up to the young man and said, "Hello, my old friend from grade-school days."<br><br>The young man responded, "I can't remember your name."<br><br>Tom told the boy his name and then was introduced to Frances Johnson, who later became his wife (from Thomas S. Monson, <i>Be Your Best Self </i>[Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1979], 131).<br><br>I wonder if Tom ever wonders what would have happened had he not gone to the freshman dance? What if he had decided to go somewhere else? What if he had decided that he was too tired or didn't want to go dancing that night? Was Tom's sudden interest in Frances just a random thing or was it something more than that?<br><br>We may not know the answers to these questions, although we certainly seem to enjoy asking them, but I believe some greater questions could be examined. Let's assume that Tom had indeed felt the prompting of the Spirit that evening at the dance. Could he have felt what he did if he had been behaving in a disorderly manner? What if Tom had decided to just hang out with his buddies at the refreshment table? What if there had been something amiss in his life that would have prevented him from feeling the Spirit? How is it that the future President Thomas S. Monson was in the right place at the right time?<br><br>Young Nephi was another great example of someone who also was in the right place at the right time. After his family had left Jerusalem and camped in the wilderness, Nephi and his brothers were sent back to Jerusalem--at no small risk--by their father. Their mission was to obtain and bring back the plates of brass that were in the possession of Laban. When things did not go so well on their first few attempts, Nephi's brothers were ready to quit, but Nephi held firm and on several occasions declared to his brothers: "Let us be faithful in keeping the commandments of the Lord" (1 Nephi 3:16; 4:1). Later, when Nephi went alone, while his brothers hid outside the city, he said, "And I was led by the Spirit, not knowing beforehand the things which I should do" (1 Nephi 4:6).<br><br>Where might we be today if Nephi had decided to go somewhere else--or that he just didn't want to go? Could he have felt the Spirit if he had been behaving in a disorderly manner? I believe that these men were in the right place at the right time because they were able to both feel and follow the Spirit.<br><br>Laman and Lemuel, on the other hand, seemed to demonstrate qualities more like the people described in Helaman 12:4, where we read:<br><br><i>O how foolish, and how vain, and how evil, and devilish, and how quick to do iniquity, and how slow to do good, are the children of men; yea, how quick to hearken unto the words of the evil one, and to set their hearts upon the vain things of the world!</i><br><br>In the early 1800s, at the time of the beginning of the restoration of the gospel, the attitudes of many religions seemed to focus upon how foolish, vain, evil, devilish, quick to do iniquity, and slow to do good people really were.<br><br><i>In New England in particular, dancing was severely frowned on, the belief being that people should be continuously occupied with work so as not to be drawn into vain amusements of the world that would surely entice them to greater temptations and lead, finally, to the loss of their souls to sin. The clergy condemned not only dancing, but almost any other pastime that appeared to give worldly pleasure.</i> [Larry V. Shumway, "Dancing the Buckles off Their Shoes in Pioneer Utah," <i>BYU Studies</i> 37, no. 3 (1997–98): 10]<br><br>No wonder the great English writer Charles Dickens confirmed how dreary and staid life in America appeared to him. After spending three days on a steamboat traveling from Pittsburgh to Cincinnati, he wrote:<br><br><i>At dinner, there is nothing to drink upon the table, but great jugs full of cold water. Nobody says anything, at any meal, to anybody. All the passengers are very dismal, and seem to have tremendous secrets weighing on their minds. There is no conversation, no laughter, no cheerfulness, no sociality, except in spitting; and that is done in silent fellowship round the stove, when the meal is over.</i> [Charles Dickens, <i>American Notes</i> (1842), chapter 11]<br><br>Joseph Smith was not like the other clergymen of his time. His appreciation for many so-called "vain amusements of the world" helps us to understand how our Church differed significantly from many of the other religions of that day. Leona Holbrook, the first chair of what eventually became the Department of Dance at BYU, wrote the following about the Prophet Joseph:<br><br><i>He enjoyed pistol shooting, baseball, walking, hiking, wrestling and horseback riding. . . . According to his own writings, he ice skated and engaged in "pulling sticks," a popular sport of those days. . . .</i><br><br><i>Joseph Smith was a competent, skillful performer in active sports, he encouraged others in those events, and promoted many other recreational activities. He favored music, drama, boating . . . , dancing, and wood cutting bees.</i><br><br><i>In his own words, "A large party supped at my house, and spent the evening in music, dancing, etc., in a most cheerful and friendly manner" (</i>HC <i>6:134).</i> [Leona Holbrook, "Dancing as an Aspect of Early Mormon and Utah Culture," <i>BYU Studies</i> 16, no. 1 (autumn 1975): 121–22]<br><br>In the early days of the Church it quickly became apparent that the feelings toward appropriate recreational activities seemed to revolve around not what the activity was but rather what environment was the activity performed in, what kind of influence did it have upon the individual, and whether the Spirit of the Lord could be present. Or, in other words, it was all about being in the right place at the right time and doing the right thing for the right reason.<br><br>I would now like to talk more specifically about counsel that we have received over the years regarding dance in the Latter-day Saint culture. However, for those of you who do not dance, I believe this same counsel could, and should, be applied to a wide variety of similar recreational activities.<br><br>In March of 1844 a letter addressed to the editor of the <i>Times and Seasons,</i> the official Church publication, queried:<br><br><i>I should be very much gratified by your informing me, and not only me, but the public . . . , what your views are in regard to balls and dancing, as it has lately existed in our city.</i> ["To the Editor," <i>Times and Seasons</i> 5, no. 5 (1 March 1844): 459]<br><br>John Taylor, the editor, responded as follows:<br><br><i>There certainly can be no harm in dancing in and of itself, as an abstract principle, but like all other athletic exercises, it has a tendency to invigorate the system and to promote health. . . . Therefore, looking at dancing merely as an athletic exercise, or as something having a tendency to add to the grace and dignity of man, by enabling him to have a more easy and graceful attitude, certainly no one could object to it. . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . But when it leads people into bad company and causes them to keep untimely hours, it has a tendency to enervate and weaken the system, and lead to profligate and intemperate habits.</i> ["To the Editor," 459, 60]<br><br>We can see here that the leaders of the Church did not appear to object to dancing in and of itself, but they did have definite concerns about the environment and company in which the dancing might take place. Even during those early years of the Church, the danger of keeping untimely hours was preached--a lesson that today still seems hard for some young people to learn. The important thing--then as now--was not so much the activity itself but rather the time, the place, and the environment.<br><br>After the martyrdom of the Prophet Joseph Smith, Brigham Young became the leader of the Church. This was a most difficult time for the Latter-day Saints. The people in Nauvoo experienced unbelievable hardships, yet even so they managed to find rejuvenation and relief through activities--including dancing. How would the Church, with a new leader, feel about these types of activities? We find one answer from an experience that took place as the Saints were preparing for their exodus.<br><br>After a full day of temple worship, the Saints gathered again in the house of the Lord, where they shared some excellent music, both instrumental and vocal. Then President Brigham Young broke the gravity of the scene by getting up and dancing, and he was joined by a number of others. Following this the president made a short address. Helen Mar Whitney recounted that he "said that we could worship God in the dance, as well as in other ways." He went on to say:<br><br><i>Now, as to dancing in this house--there are thousands of brethren and sisters that have labored to build these walls and put on this roof, and they are shut out from any opportunity of enjoying any amusement among the wicked--or in the world, and shall they have any recreation? Yes! and this is the very place where they can have liberty.</i> ["Scenes in Nauvoo, and Incidents from H. C. Kimball's Journal," <i>Woman's Exponent</i> 12, no. 8 (15 September 1883): 57, 58; also included in Helen Mar Whitney, <i>A Woman's View: Helen Mar Whitney's Reminiscences of Early Church History,</i> ed. Jeni Broberg Holzapfel and Richard Neitzel Holzapfel (Provo: BYU Religious Studies Center, 1997), 313]<br><br>After the Saints left Nauvoo, they still danced. Countless stories are recorded of the Saints gathering around their campfires at the end of a day's trek and dancing into the night on dance floors of dust, mud, or even packed-down snow. Their music wasn't what we hear today: maybe a violin or a coronet, other times a whistler or two, and of course they could sing--but, yes, they always danced! (See Davis Bitton, "'These Licentious Days': Dancing Among the Mormons," <i>Sunstone</i> 2, no. 1 [spring 1977]: 16–27; this paper by Davis Bitton was originally prepared for presentation to the staff of the LDS Church Historical Department on 14 May 1976.)<br><br>In the mid-1800s a new "round" dance, called the waltz, was catching on in America. For the first time the gentleman actually placed his hand on his lady's waist and faced her at close proximity. They then circled the dance floor in a whirling and free manner, which is why the term <i>round</i> was used. This was a huge change from the line dances and reels that had been done for many years. Those dances had been carefully structured, ordered, and controlled. Some individuals saw this change in social dancing as symbolic of a breakdown in the order and structure in society. The man and the woman in proximity, along with the closed dance position, was indicative to them of a general and pervading moral decline (see Davis Bitton, "'These Licentious Days,'" 25).<br><br>Jesse N. Smith, president of the Eastern Arizona Stake, reported that "the round dance [had] been termed 'the dance of death'" (in<i> Journal of Jesse Nathaniel Smith: The Life Story of a Mormon Pioneer, 1834–1906</i> (Salt Lake City: Jesse N. Smith Family Association, 1953), 258).<br><br>The leaders of the Church responded to the waltz and other round dances in a cautious and careful manner. Guidelines were put forward that initially allowed for two or three round dances to be included at Church dances. However, their expressed concerns were primarily about the environment in which the dancing took place. Counsel was given that dancing was best done among other members of the Church. The Brethren were not comfortable with "public dancing" because of the worldly elements that could not be controlled. Dancing was fine to do, but on our own terms, not those of the world.<br><br>A practice that was part of LDS culture for many years had to do with dancing and departing missionaries. Shortly before the young elder left for the mission field, a dance in his honor took place in the cultural hall of the church. In the February 1904 issue of the <i>Improvement Era,</i> Don C. W. Musser explained why the Latter-day Saints would find this appropriate. He said:<br><br><i>They find nothing incompatible with their ideas of true religion, in the innocent pleasure of dancing. In fact, like God's people of ancient times, they find this one way of rejoicing together, and of giving vent to their feelings of gratitude for blessings daily received. In early times, while pushing their handcarts across the plains, they frequently danced under the light of the moon and stars, and around their camp fires, because their hearts were so full of praise, words could not express it, and they had to dance. And it has always been a custom with them, to give their departing missionaries a farewell . . . , and in no way can this end be better accomplished than in a dance.</i> [Don C. W. Musser, "A Peculiar Custom of a Peculiar People," <i>Improvement Era</i> 7, no. 4 (February 1904): 297–98]<br><br>It was at his missionary farewell dance that young Spencer W. Kimball was introduced to a pretty blonde girl who was new in the valley: Camilla Eyring. I would like to paraphrase the story as it appears in the biography of President Kimball, written by his sons Edward and Andrew. Shortly following his mission Spencer picked up the local newspaper one evening and noticed a photograph and article in the upper right-hand corner. It was about Camilla, who was now teaching home economics at the Gila Academy. He read the article several times and then said aloud to himself, "I am going to marry her."<br><br>He lost no time in asking around about Camilla and discovered that she lived with her parents in Pima--several miles down the valley. She rode the bus to Thatcher each day to teach at the Academy. Well, one day soon after that, when Camilla arrived at the bus stop in Thatcher to return home, there was Spencer--on his way to visit his friend Lawrence Holladay, who just happened to live in Pima. During the bus ride "Spencer talked about Shakespeare and art, certain that was the way to a teacher's heart." Before the ride ended Spencer asked Camilla if he might call on her sometime, and she invited him to do so.<br><br>One evening a short time later, Spencer showed up at her house unannounced. Camilla was preparing to go dancing with another boy named Alvin, but she sat on the porch and visited with Spencer anyway. When it became apparent to her that Spencer had no intention of leaving soon, she said she "fudged." A crowd of people were going dancing, she told him. Would he like to come along? And so it was that when Alvin drove up, he found two people waiting to pile into the car. As you might imagine, Alvin was not very happy with this arrangement, and he applied his foot to the accelerator to show his anger. Camilla said later that Alvin drove "like the devil was after him." By the time they arrived at the dance, Alvin was so mad he decided he was through with Camilla--which goes to show you that one man's bad luck is another's good fortune! (From Edward L. Kimball and Andrew E. Kimball, Jr., <i>Spencer W. Kimball: Twelfth President of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints </i>[Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1977], 71, 83–84.)<br><br>I wonder if Spencer ever wondered what would have happened if he had not arranged to be at the bus stop? What if he had decided that he was too tired or didn't want to go to the effort that afternoon? Was Spencer's sudden interest in Camilla just a random thing or was it something more than that? How is it that the future President Spencer W. Kimball, along with Camilla, was in the right place at the right time?<br><br>In 1912 the First Presidency addressed dancing as part of their annual Christmas message to the Church. They recognized that dancing parties were<br><br><i>a diversion permitted to Latter-day Saints, but under certain rules that ought to be strictly observed. The indiscriminate association of saints and strangers in public balls . . . is not productive of that good and wholesome spirit that is desirable. . . . Dances that require or permit the close embrace and suggestive movements . . . ought to be utterly prohibited. . . . The shameless exhibitions of the human form purposely presented in modern styles of dress, or rather undress, are indications of that sensuous and debasing tendency toward moral laxity and social corruption.</i> [In James R. Clark, comp., <i>Messages of the First Presidency of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, </i>6 vols. (Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1965–75), 4:280–81]<br><br>Every generation seems to feel the need to discover themselves through something new. Many of you are too young to remember the 1960s, but they were the era of bell-bottoms, platform shoes, love beads, mood rings, tie-dyed T-shirts, hippies, bouffant hairdos, go-go boots, miniskirts, and--to top all this off--a whole slew of new dances such as the twist, the mashed potato, the monkey, the swim, the funky chicken, the dog, the locomotion, the shampoo, and the jerk. Finally we didn't have to worry about dancing too close to each other--but wait, now there was a whole new set of concerns! The 1966 <i>For the Strength of Youth</i> pamphlet added some additional counsel for the young people regarding dance. Here are a few excerpts:<br><br><i>If one concentrates on good dance posture, many dances can be danced in a manner which will meet LDS standards. Some examples of these dances are the waltz, fox trot, tango, rhumba, cha-cha, samba,</i> [and] <i>swing. . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . Members of the Church should be good dancers and not contortionists. Extreme body movements--such as hip and shoulder shaking, body jerking, etc.--should be avoided, and emphasis should be placed on smooth styling and clever footwork.</i> [<i>For the Strength of Youth,</i> 2nd ed. (Salt Lake City: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latterday Saints, 1966), 13]<br><br>In an issue of <i>Brigham Young Magazine</i> a few years ago, we learned that this counsel was not entirely taken to heart, for in 1966 the president had found it necessary to ban fad dances at BYU!<br><br><i>The monkey, the dog, the frug--everyone at BYU was doing them; that is, until President Wilkinson gave a controversial speech at the beginning of the year banning all fad dances. The student body split into two opposing camps, one arguing that such dances were indeed against Church standards, the other saying that there was nothing wrong with them. Discussions grew heated, and prejudiced letters to the editor filled the columns of the</i> Universe <i>until the issue was finally settled by a letter from President McKay.</i> [The] <i>verdict--No</i> [fad dances]. [<i>1966 Banyan: The Yearbook of the Associated Students of Brigham Young University,</i> May 1966, vol. 52, 174; excerpted in "Stories of the Century," <i>Brigham Young Magazine,</i> winter 1999–2000, 29]<br><br>Now we can see why Beginning Social Dance 180 became so popular at BYU back then: fully one-half of the student body agreed on the dances that best met LDS standards! They were the waltz, fox-trot, cha-cha, and swing! Actually, I believe that Beginning Social Dance has great value to the entire university community. Not only do the almost 2,000 students each year who take this course learn beginning social dances, but they also learn social skills and graces, etiquette, and how to interact with the opposite sex in appropriate ways. If you see in the mirror the type of person that Charles Dickens saw in 1842, then you might want to enroll in Beginning Social Dance 180. And for you single brethren, there is always the chance that things could turn out for you like they did for Presidents Kimball and Monson!<br><br>The most recent <i>For the Strength of Youth</i> pamphlet reads a lot like the 1966 version. In fact, it sounds a lot like what the First Presidency said in 1912, as well as the counsel that was given when the waltz became popular. And, yes, what John Taylor had to say really wasn't much different either.<br><br>As we go back to our roots as a church, it becomes clearly apparent how consistent the counsel and instruction has been from our leaders. What a powerful lesson we can learn, and not just about dancing: to appreciate the wisdom of placing ourselves in situations where the Spirit of the Lord can be present. Perhaps it really does make a difference where we are, what we are doing, and when we are doing it.<br><br>I have firsthand knowledge about being in the right place at the right time. Back in the early 1970s we did not register for classes online. In fact, there was no such thing as a desktop or laptop computer. We had to register the "prehistoric" way. On the day before the start of the semester we would first assemble in the green seats in the Smith Fieldhouse: graduate students and seniors first, then on from there until it was time for the freshmen to register. When our turn came, we would stand up and follow a never-ending line through the underground tunnel to the Richards Building. As we emerged, we were inspected for compliance with the university dress and grooming standards. If we passed that test, we were then allowed to enter the various gymnasiums and begin the registration process. Hundreds of tables, each with a line of hopeful students, filled the gyms. To enroll in a class you had to stand in a specific line to see if any computer punch cards for the section you wanted were available. One bad result, especially near the end of the process, could really foul things up and require you to start all over again.<br><br>One early January morning in 1973 I was a student teaching assistant helping give out cards for the ballroom dance classes at registration. All of a sudden along came a pretty, black-haired freshman, new in town for the winter semester and hoping to gain admittance to the ballroom dance team. The moment I saw her I knew that for some reason I had to meet this girl. Helping to give out registration cards was the perfect way to facilitate my sudden objective, so when classes began the next day, I knew where Linda Marie Baes would be at a certain time each day.<br><br>Linda had been willing to leave her home in Tennessee as a nonmember and come to this Mormon university because she felt compelled to continue with the ballroom dancing that she had been involved in. Linda's dance teacher in Oak Ridge just happened to know Alma Heaton here at BYU. Linda had been offered a small dance scholarship for the previous fall semester but had chickened out when her Catholic priest described in great detail how many wives everybody would have here in Utah. Well, one thing led to another (you know how that goes), and that summer Linda asked me if I would baptize her a member of the Church. A year later I asked her the question that I had had on my mind since we first met, and, lucky for me, she said yes. Since then Linda and I have had a wonderful life, spending much of our time together each day doing something we both love in the same building where we first met.<br><br>Was my sudden interest in Linda just a random thing or was it something more than that? In my mind I know the answer to that question without a doubt. What if I had been disinclined that day to go and help out with the registration process? What if things had been amiss in my life? What if Linda had come to BYU the previous September when my high-school sweetheart and I were still dating? How is it that we just happened to be in the right place at the right time? I have a personal testimony that it does make a difference when you can not only feel but also follow the Spirit.<br><br>This past month the BYU Ballroom Dance Company traveled to Europe, where we competed at the British Open Ballroom Dancing Championships and then continued with a performance tour that took us through England, Belgium, France, and Spain. We won both the modern and the Latin-American formation team competitions, bringing our count to 18 titles won at this most prestigious event. However, the competition experience was not the most important reason for our going to Europe.<br><br>After we competed in Blackpool and began our performance tour, the Ballroom Dance Company had opportunities to help further the work of the Church in a number of ways. It was not uncommon to have stake and mission presidents express appreciation for the good that had been accomplished and the success they anticipated in their areas as a result of our visit. In France and Spain we had significant opportunities to perform before important government officials in settings and ways that could be best accomplished only by a BYU performing group. We had the highest expectations placed upon us by the Church and the university. We could not have met those expectations without conscious efforts to both feel and follow the Spirit.<br><br>These efforts began before we ever left the Richards Building in the form of a letter of counsel from our dean, Robert K. Conlee. He reminded us of the real reasons that we were going on this particular tour. He pointedly asked us to always behave in such a way that we would be eligible to have the Spirit manifest itself through us, individually and collectively, so that the purposes of the Lord might be fulfilled.<br><br>Today I can testify of the blessings, both individual and collective, that flowed to the Ballroom Dance Company as we lived each day with this wise counsel in our minds. How thankful I am to have the opportunity to work at Brigham Young University, where this type of devotion is not just tolerated but encouraged--even expected. I also bear testimony of the blessings we can and will receive in our personal lives as we make efforts to be in the right places at the right times and to do the right things for the right reasons. By following the counsel of our Church leaders, we will be better able to feel and follow the Holy Spirit in our lives and realize great blessings. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Lee Wakefield was a BYU professor of dance when this devotional address was given on 13 July 2004.</i><br><br><i>© Brigham Young University.

This photograph was taken on the old steps of the Harris Fine Arts Center in the summer of 1974, a few months before my wife and I were married. It was published in a brochure for the Provo City Chamber of Commerce with the caption "Between classes at Brigham Young University." I don't know what you do between classes, but apparently I was mostly looking for Ruth. What a journey then lay before us--one with only vague outlines, but full of hope and dreams, promising new places, and unexpected strangers. That journey has been a bit nomadic. In 1976 my wife and I and our two-month-old son left BYU for Manhattan, where I studied musicology for six years and watched large numbers of MBA and law students come and go. We eventually took a job teaching in Michigan, later moved to take a post in Pennsylvania, and five years ago returned to Provo. Of all the places we've lived, we particularly fell for the rolling, tree-covered hills of central Pennsylvania, which we often still call home.<br><br>I have only a simple message for you today, a story about a young woman I watched grow up in a small branch of the Church in rural Pennsylvania. Her father worked for much of his life in one of the few coal mines still operating and was a counselor in the bishopric; her mother served in the Relief Society. At age 12 this young woman had those eager, faithful eyes you can see in young Beehives almost anywhere. I have her image fixed in my own memory on a stake youth handcart trek when she was 14, reading the scriptures in solitude on a brisk early morning. By the time she was 17, we didn't see her much, and at 18 she went away to college, where she struggled with the criticism of her beliefs she heard there. I haven't seen her in the last half-dozen years. You might not recognize right away that she is, in fact, the subject of this story, so I thought it a good idea to tell you what I'm doing in advance. I'll call her Erika, though that's not her real name.<br><br>On His way from Jericho to Jerusalem, where He would share His last Passover meal, Jesus was stopped by a blind man at the side of the road, a beggar.<br><br><i>As he went out of Jericho with his disciples and a great number of people, blind Bartimaeus, the son of Timaeus, sat by the highway side begging.</i><br><br>And when he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth, he began to cry out, and say, Jesus, thou Son of David, have mercy on me. [Mark 10:46–47]<br><br>Our family has been thinking quite a lot about the blind lately, since Evan, our 15-year-old, has taken it in hand to give a home to a puppy from one of the two national seeing-eye dog foundations. This is Bernie, our black lab, whom we've had in our home since mid-May. His sponsor and owner, Guide Dogs for the Blind, gives all the puppies from a single litter names beginning with the same letter. They'd gotten around to the letter <i>B, </i>so our dog's name is Bernie.<br><br>He is a remarkable animal. Raising him isn't anything like coping with our last dog, Bär, whose name, spelled with an umlaut (a result of the year our family lived in Germany), had nothing to do with his litter but rather described his appearance and sometimes wild, unpredictable behavior. Bär was all exuberance and frolic; he failed all the rigorous training we put him through with a carefree willfulness. His obedience instructor used to plead with us, "Can't you control your dog?" But Bär was far too excited, surrounded by so many other dogs, to pay attention to what must have seemed silly commands to heel, sit, and lie down. Bernie, on the other hand, is by his breeding calm and sedate, submissive and predictable--perhaps that's why the foundation chooses names for their dogs like Bernie and Calhoun, instead of naming them after bears, wolves, and other wild animals.<br><br>Our job is to teach Bernie simple commands, to familiarize him with the conditions and situations he'll likely face later on as a working dog, and to attend training classes together with him. He'll go to Orem High School this fall with our son, in his uniform (the dog, I mean) and hopefully on his best behavior (both of them). When he's about a year and a half old, he'll go away to guide-dog school in California, where he'll work alongside his new owner, who will be blind. If Bernie gets that far, our purpose in raising him will have been met, and some of the pain of losing him will be tempered with the good he'll do for his new owner.<br><br>Bartimaeus was blind and a beggar when he called to Jesus, who was traveling on his way from Jericho to Jerusalem.<br><br><i>When he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth, he began to cry out, and say, Jesus, thou Son of David, have mercy on me.</i><br><br>And many charged him that he should hold his peace: but he cried the more a great deal, Thou Son of David, have mercy on me. [Mark 10:47–48]<br><br>In all the places my wife and I have traveled since we left the steps of the Harris Fine Arts Center, I've struggled with what it means to have mercy for beggars. I've certainly seen real need from time to time, the face of poverty and want, but I've been troubled mostly, I suppose, because sometimes I'm too much an amateur to tell the genuine from the professional--real need from opportunism or even thievery--and I doubt whether I even know what a beggar ought to be.<br><br>Years ago, while a student in Manhattan, I tried giving an apple to someone I saw every day on the street asking for money; I figured if he was hungry, like he said he was, he would want what I offered him. He didn't, and he followed me for a while down the street to let me know what he thought of me. A friend of mine was walking with a lawyer near that same spot when an apparently crippled woman in a wheelchair blocked their path and held up a bent tin cup. My friend reached for his pocket--while the lawyer reached for the cup, which he crushed and threw with disgust into the gutter. He jerked the rusted wheelchair around and announced that they were off for the nearest police station. My friend froze at his audacity--that is until the woman leapt out of the wheelchair and escaped at a dead run down a side street. The lawyer had recognized her, having prosecuted her in court for fraud.<br><br>What are the differences among the beggars I've met in my life? In uptown Manhattan near one of the music conservatories, I often passed a young man who played his violin on the sidewalk, his open instrument case usually stuffed with cash. His feigned artistic idealism appealed to the yuppie crowds, who blindly financed his chauffeured limousine. On the other hand, what of the young, filthy woman with an outstretched hand I passed in Milan, sheltering an obviously sick child in a rancid quilt, the two of them huddled tightly together against the cold? I remembered at the time the advice of a relative living in Mexico City, who warned me of beggars with rented children, preying on the pity of rich American tourists. If a person was truly in need, how was I to know?<br><br>I've spent some time working in Naples, Italy, sequestered in dusty archives, pouring through old manuscripts and books as part of my research as a historical musicologist. The old Italian music I study is strange to the city now and seldom heard. When the libraries close, early and often, I'm back on the streets, sometimes in sections of Naples that are very poor, with beggars everywhere.<br><br>In the summer of 1987 a young boy there asked me for money in a subway station, and I ineptly shook my head and glanced away. At first I blamed my poor Neapolitan dialect for not understanding him (except for his open hand), but when others also looked puzzled, I realized that he too was foreign. I watched him go as he walked the length of the station.<br><br>It was always the same. He took a few slow steps, bent his right arm at the elbow, and rested it on his bony hip, his left hand behind his back reaching through to grab his upper-right arm. His right hand was cupped near to his body and almost closed, weakly drifting back and forth. He shifted all his thin weight to his left leg, turned his other foot to its outside edge, and bent his back in a slow arch. He never looked those he confronted in the face; his gaze went past you, about chin height. He repeated the same incomprehensible words over and over, and after each rejection he scuffed his feet, shuffled a bit sideways, and moved on, first to this group, and then that--a businessman, a mother, some imitation punk rockers, a factory worker, a man in uniform. He went to each person in the crowded station, a captive audience for his pitiful performance, and no one gave him anything. A few laughed. The teenagers mocked him. Most just ignored him.<br><br>As I watched the scene unfold, I thought, "He's about the same age as my own 11-year-old son, about the same height, same hair color, same complexion, same awkward, uncomfortable posture that all 11-year-old boys have." Then suddenly, as I stood in that crowded Neapolitan mélange of humanity, I saw my son in his face as he stumbled into the press around me, and I panicked and wanted desperately to go after him. But my train arrived, and I got on, maneuvering next to the window to search for him. I saw him standing there, alone in the deserted station, and then he was gone.<br><br>In Milan I reversed my steps and sought out that woman huddled in a blanket with her child and gave her a few dollars in lire, but only after I had walked on several blocks and then turned back, ignoring stories about rented children. She saw me approaching, and with a troubled American accent I said, "This is for you and your child." She looked surprised but grateful, and I remember feeling at that moment that either she or I was very foolish. This time, in Naples, I couldn't go back.<br><br>The face of that young boy in a subway station will be one of those images that will never leave me. Like the face of my young brother, years ago, as I led him into a hospital room to say goodbye to our father, or the face of my firstborn child, the face of that young beggar was the face of need. I've thought a good deal about beggars since then. The young boy had no money, and I had no will to help him. Which of us was the beggar? "For behold, are we not all beggars?" was the question posed by King Benjamin (Mosiah 4:19).<br><br>When blind Bartimaeus, at the roadside, heard it was the Christ passing by, he could not be silenced,<br><br><i>but he cried the more a great deal, Thou Son of David, have mercy on me.</i><br><br>And Jesus stood still, and commanded him to be called. And they call the blind man, saying unto him, Be of good comfort, rise; he calleth thee.<br><br>And he, casting away his garment, rose, and came to Jesus.<br><br>And Jesus answered and said unto him, What wilt thou that I should do unto thee? [Mark 10:48–51]<br><br>Throughout my life I've wondered when I would next see that boy's face, and even more, what I would do when he approached me once again. What will he ask of me this time, and what will I offer? I've often thought of how Christ responded to Bartimaeus: "What wilt thou that I should do unto thee?" For each time I see that boy's face now, I think, "What can I do?" and these days he, like Bartimaeus, almost never asks for money.<br><br>I saw his face again about 10 years later. This time he was an old man, excommunicated from the Church for nearly 20 years. In his youth, Paul had been a stalwart Saint and a civic leader. He helped build the local LDS chapel with his own hands and served in it as bishop for 10 years. Then later he deliberately stepped off the path, let go of the rod, and closed his eyes. He was blind, by his own account, as Isaiah chided, "We grope for the wall like the blind, and we grope as if we had no eyes: we stumble at noonday as in the night" (Isaiah 59:10).<br><br>I first heard of Paul from one of his close friends, a man who had also left the Church, but who had been loved and taught and had reached decisions that were bringing him back home. He told me that Paul had promised to come when he was rebaptized. When the day arrived, it was easy to pick out Paul as he slipped surreptitiously into the back of the room. He was neat and well groomed, acted with great reverence, and tried to be as inconspicuous and anonymous as possible. He sat right at the side, just inside the door, with his eyes fixed on the floor, his hands twisted together in his lap.<br><br>As the service progressed and the baptism was performed, with everyone's attention fixed on that sacred ordinance, I stole a quick glance at Paul and was astonished to recognize him now so clearly. It was the same face I remembered, the same yearning and helplessness I had seen before, imprinted on my mind by a young boy in a crowded crush of uncaring humanity in Naples. Paul didn't speak as he watched his friend go down into the water, but I've never heard a plea for mercy more clearly. I remember thinking as I looked at Paul, "What can I do?"<br><br>[Bartimaeus] <i>cried the more a great deal, Thou Son of David, have mercy on me.</i><br><br>And Jesus stood still, and commanded him to be called. And they call the blind man, saying unto him, Be of good comfort, rise; he calleth thee.<br><br>And he, casting away his garment, rose, and came to Jesus.<br><br>And Jesus answered and said unto him, What wilt thou that I should do unto thee? The blind man said unto him, Lord, that I might receive my sight. [Mark 10:48–51]<br><br>Well, the service ended, and Paul was out the door, sprinting for the exit. Could I once again watch him move off into the distance? I found myself bolting down the hallway behind him, calling his name. And he stopped to talk. Over the next year we became friends, and later, surrounded by friends new and old, and armed with a remembered testimony, he himself was rebaptized in a small, quiet ceremony in that same room. Today he travels three hours each way to the temple once a week, wondering how he could have been blind for so long, struggling to find the words to thank his Heavenly Father for allowing him to see once again.<br><br>The meaning of King Benjamin's sermon was never more plain to me.<br><br><i>For behold, are we not all beggars? Do we not all depend upon the same Being, even God, for all the substance which we have, for both food and raiment, and for gold, and for silver, and for all the riches which we have of every kind?</i><br><br>And behold, even at this time, ye have been calling on his name, and begging for a remission of your sins. And has he suffered that ye have begged in vain? Nay; he has poured out his Spirit upon you, and has caused that your hearts should be filled with joy, and has caused that your mouths should be stopped that ye could not find utterance, so exceedingly great was your joy. [Mosiah 4:19–20]<br><br>Who, then, was that blind beggar Christ met on the road but each of us, blind and begging in our own ways, crippled by emotions, pride, tragedy, a fainting heart, doubt, or sin. At times we seem blind and surrounded by darkness. It can be so difficult to see the tree, the path, and the iron rod. As Nephi warned us, "The mists of darkness are the temptations of the devil, which blindeth the eyes, and hardeneth the hearts of the children of men, and leadeth them away into broad roads, that they perish and are lost" (1 Nephi 12: 17). There to one side you might come across a young girl without hope or a young man confused by the iridescent reality of a hectic, modern world. There are people all around us, in our classes in school, in our work, in our homes and families, who cry, like Bartimaeus, "Have mercy on me." And we, in turn, reflect on the Savior's answer to Bartimaeus:<br><br><i>What wilt thou that I should do unto thee? The blind man said unto him, Lord, that I might receive my sight.</i><br><br>And Jesus said unto him, Go thy way; thy faith hath made thee whole. And immediately he received his sight, and followed Jesus in the way. [Mark 10:51–52]<br><br>I warned you earlier that my story was about Erika, the young girl from a humble family in central Pennsylvania. I first met her in the autumn of 1991, when the scenery in Appalachia takes your breath away. Our stake was mostly rural, with a small LDS population of less than 2,000, although it was large in geography, spread out over an area about the size and shape of New Jersey. I grew to love its obscure back roads, where directions are given by landmarks, churches, and John Deere dealerships, rather than street signs, and I almost looked forward to the hours of driving, particularly in the comfortable, brilliant coloring of fall. The land is wrinkled with rolling hills smothered in trees, acre after acre of corn, abandoned coal mines, the Amish, warmhearted neighbors, and a sense of home that rooted one branch president to the very neighborhood settled by five of his own ancestors who fought in the American Revolution.<br><br>There, as everywhere, you can find the sort of faith that makes people whole. I wish each of you could enjoy with Bishop Carter and his family, as I've done, a meal of dumplings, mashed potatoes, wurst, and homemade sauerkraut. Bishop Carter was branch president and bishop in Huntingdon, Pennsylvania, for more than 17 years. He once told me a story that reflects their kind of faith--about their chapel, built years ago on choice donated property in a beautiful, wooded, idyllic setting that looks almost too perfect to be accidental. After the building plans were drawn up and the contracts negotiated, the city council, resistant to Mormons building in their town, declared an ancient, gigantic oak tree in the middle of the property to be a historic landmark, a move to prevent construction. Members gathered in prayer, and that very night something the town couldn't legislate happened: a terrific storm swept through the valley, and lightning struck the tree, splitting it right to the ground and turning that historic oak into humble kindling. Construction began the next week.<br><br>It was in such a ward, in a group of about 80 members, that I met Erika at a ward conference. She was one of 15 young women, and one young man, seated in a circle during Sunday School. One of the ward leaders was addressing the youth, and as I looked around the room into their faces, I found 12-year-old Erika, who looked back at me with a face of simple trust, innocence, and faith. I looked from each youth to the next, one at a time, thinking, "What can I do?" And then over the next eight years, I watched Erika grow from a radiant Beehive to a tearful 14-year-old in a pioneer dress, wrapped in her scriptures outside a handcart camp on a damp summer's morning, to a struggling young adult on her way to college.<br><br>There's much more, of course, to Erika's personal story--of what I and others did to reach out to her as she grew older--but in many ways I've told you what I believe are the most important things I know about her. Actually, her name and the particulars of her story don't really matter. She could have any name. She could be anywhere. She is out there, somewhere, although for you her name might be Mindy or Emily. You'll recognize her because you've seen her face before, just as I have. For me it's the face of an 11-year-old beggar I found in a Neapolitan subway. You may find someday, as I did, that she has a face that somehow looks like the face of your own child. You will find her along the side of the road on the journey you are now beginning, huddled with her child against the cold or trying to slip out unnoticed from a church meeting or even eagerly gazing at you in innocence in a Sunday School class; and in some way or another you'll recognize the child asking for mercy whom I know so well. You'll see the eyes I saw in an innocent youth and in a wounded grandfather.<br><br>You'll know when you see them that if you have the will, you might walk just a bit in front, or better yet, by their side--not in a uniform or on a leash as our guide-dog Bernie will do someday, but like Bernie you can be someone else's eyes for just a little while. You yourself may, at some point, need to lean on someone else's arm just a bit, trusting in their sight, which may for the moment be just a little clearer than your own, relying on someone who can help you find your way back home. For we are all beggars.<br><br>When the Savior met Bartimaeus, He had begun His final journey, on His way from Jericho to Jerusalem, where He would make the greatest sacrifice of all time. The New Testament account of their meeting, in Mark, chapter 10, is directly preceded by these verses, in which the Savior, the greatest example of all, taught us the true purpose of His life and mission:<br><br><i>Whosoever will be great among you, shall be your minister:</i><br><br>And whosoever of you will be the chiefest, shall be servant of all.<br><br>For even the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many. [Mark 10:43–45]<br><br>So, wherever our roads lead each of us, beginning from here at this moment, whether to rural Pennsylvania, Naples, BYU, or back to your own hometown, you and I must find Erika, the face of need, and fulfill Isaiah's prophecy that "the eyes of the blind shall see out of obscurity, and out of darkness" (Isaiah 29:18), that we can say, as Job, "I was eyes to the blind, and feet was I to the lame," (Job 29:15).<br><br>It is my hope and prayer that you will go find Erika, wherever she is, and help her to see again. I say this in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Dale E.

<h1>Sojourn in the Land” - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Several years ago while participating in a BYU Study Abroad program, our family visited the National Gallery in London during an exhibit on contemporary art. My husband thoughtfully took the children so I could have some time alone to enjoy the galleries. At the time, the oldest of our four children was eight and our youngest was about three. Out of the corner of my eye, I observed that he kept the children quite interested, even when looking at abstract works that really challenged my own attention span.<br><br>Our youngest child, who was holding on to his hand, appeared to be making a great effort to concentrate. After a few minutes of listening and walking from one abstract work to another, she planted herself in front of my husband until she got his attention. "Daddy," she said, "Did adults do these things?" My husband, quite puzzled, answered, "Yes, of course." "Well, daddy," she said, "I can do better than that." Even at that young age she had already acquired the basics of art appreciation, and she could articulate an informed opinion! On another occasion, as we were leaving Paris, another of our children said, "Which is taller, the Eiffel Tower or the Empire Strikes Back Building?"<br><br>These and other anecdotes have found a place in our family lore due to our participation in university-sponsored programs. Associating with students at BYU has been one of the most enjoyable and rewarding things I have done professionally in my life, and it continues to have great significance for me and for my family because it has taught us principles of eternal importance. Among many such opportunities, we have especially relished our participation in Study Abroad experiences. The personal growth that comes from sharing most of the waking hours with the same group of students continues to enrich our lives and to define more clearly in my mind the educational value of these opportunities abroad and the impact that a commitment to gospel truths and practices can make in our learning process.<br><br>Having been born in Spain, my favorite Study Abroad program is, of course, the one in Madrid. I am quite passionate about Spanish culture, and I delight in introducing others to it: the beauty of the Generalife gardens of Granada, designed with intimate spaces and harmonic simplicity [picture shown]; the sense of reverence gained from ancient cloisters [picture shown] with moving Romanesque art representing episodes about the life of Christ [picture shown]; the old Visigothic church standing since the seventh century in a remote corner of the Castilian plain and still in use by a handful of country people [picture shown]; the magnificent vistas of the Alcazar in Segovia, redolent with knightly deeds and adventure [picture shown]; the stark row of windmills in Consuegra, La Mancha, legendary home of Don Quixote [picture shown].<br><br>While in residence in Madrid with the students, I relish the opportunity to make weekly visits to the Prado Museum. It never fails to gladden my heart to hear a student say on an optional, last-day visit to the museum, "Sister Hoskisson, I really was not very interested in art at the beginning of this program, but I really like it now. I never thought I would."<br><br>I know that these experiences abroad can sometimes challenge our comfort zone. Through personal experience and the counsel of others, I have also learned that those who are well prepared, who have realistic expectations of themselves, who respect the role of others in the group, who understand the goals of the program, and who make a commitment to make the best of the experience seem to be successful. On the other hand, I have also seen that a selfish attitude by any participant, together with a lack of appreciation for the guidelines established, usually results in personal dissatisfaction that often also affects others negatively.<br><br>In those rare contemplative moments of life, as I have thought back and basked in the wonderful memories of our days and weeks as a family together with the students, it has seemed to me that all of us on this earth are in the midst of a form of Study Abroad. We have left our heavenly home, our familiar surroundings, where loving parents watched over our well-being. We were given a passport issued by the kingdom of heaven with which we were to travel throughout this strange land we call mortality, and, thus, we enthusiastically embarked on a great voyage of exploration and self-discovery.<br><br>Our heavenly home prepared us through premortal experiences to come to this earth. We participated in councils where we learned about the great plan of salvation, and we knew, became acquainted with, and sustained Christ as our director, our "tour guide," and our Redeemer. We made commitments to live on this earth in harmony with the principles that we were taught. We understood that we were going to stay with a "host family" during our sojourn on earth, and we also knew we would have to make some adjustments in submitting our will to that of our Savior's in order to achieve our supreme goal: that of returning to our heavenly home with all the knowledge, the experience, and the talents we could acquire from our own tailor-made adventures in mortality. With this glorious opportunity to be abroad, away from our heavenly parents, to expand our perspectives, and to have our horizons broadened came the challenge to travel like strangers in a strange land, removed from our heavenly culture.<br><br>One day many years ago, I stood in a train station in Reutlingen, Germany, with our first daughter, then three and a half months old, in my arms. I felt loneliness come over me as I had never before experienced. Not even the happy reunion with my husband after three weeks of separation could contain a wave of self-pity that washed over me. I felt completely alone, vulnerable, and in a different world.<br><br>I was among total strangers. I did not speak the language and I could not communicate. I was in surroundings that were so austere, so German, that I wondered in my mind: "How can I possibly stay here for two years? I don't want to be here. I want to go home." I know that many of you have probably experienced such feelings at one time or another in your life. I was overwhelmed. It was not as though I had not already experienced displacement in my life. I was born in Spain. I had moved in my preteenage years with my parents to Uruguay. In my college years I had taken up residence in the United States under trying and difficult circumstances. Even in my newly married life I had moved from Utah to Boston--talk about a culture shock! Yet, standing on that train platform in Reutlingen, Germany, that August day, I was completely overcome by feelings of loneliness and estrangement. I was weary after a long transatlantic flight; drained from caring for the baby; and tired from an interminable train ride from the Zürich, Switzerland, airport and navigating through Swiss and then German immigration and customs, all the while transporting my meager worldly belongings in a couple of suitcases. Now we had to wait for a friend to pick us up, because we ourselves had no means of transportation.<br><br>It was then, standing in the train station in my utter exhaustion, that my husband told me we were to stay that night in the apartment of a total stranger, a sister from the local LDS branch. Sensing my feelings, he quietly explained that hotel accommodations were quite scarce in the town and that our funds were somewhat meager. Therefore, he had accepted the hospitality tendered by a kind sister whom he had just met that same week.<br><br>I was dismayed, and I just wanted to get back on a train and go home, right across the Atlantic! But, of course, I couldn't, and eventually we were on our way to Sister Eberhard's home. This good sister lived with a grandson in an older but adequate apartment overlooking a quaint square. She received us very graciously. Though it was the end of August, a chill was already in the air, and she had heated her home to make it more comfortable for us. She had also prepared a lovely supper of good Swabian food, which my husband wolfed down immediately. I, on the other hand, because of my weariness, had to force myself to eat. When it came time to retire, she took us to a bedroom with immaculate feather beds made up with pristine white bedding, together with a makeshift crib for the baby. Before leaving, she offered to take care of our daughter through the night so that we could rest undisturbed. Of course, I declined. She then visited with us about breakfast. After she left, my husband and I noticed that we had not seen signs of another spare room in the apartment.<br><br>In the morning when we awoke, she had already heated up the bathroom for my shower and had prepared a large pan of warm water so I could bathe my baby. It became clear to me then that she had given up her own room and bed and had spent the night on a very uncomfortable couch in her grandson's small bedroom. This may not seem much for some of you, but those familiar with conditions in other places will understand the time and the care she had devoted to these preparations in our behalf. She had also gone very early to the bakery and had a wonderful breakfast waiting for us. Even though my contribution to the ensuing conversation was just <i>ja </i>and <i>nein</i>--the only words I knew in German at the time--and a smile, I understood her concern and her offer of help.<br><br>I felt a great warmth fill my heart, and I knew that I was not among strangers, that I was not alone. I was going to make it in that foreign environment. Just as the Lord had declared to the early saints, in Ephesians 2:19, a promise that encompasses both the spiritual and material aspects of our lives: "Now therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners, but fellowcitizens with the saints, and of the household of God." I had felt such a bond.<br><br>Nevertheless, while on this earthly journey with fellow citizens of the kingdom of God, often among strangers and foreigners, we at times are tempted to let a self-centered attitude of cultural superiority take over. But if we do this, we reject the directions that will lead us to the joyful fulfillment of our goals while in mortality. Perhaps the promptings of our Tour Guide for this life do not match those that we had in mind, or perhaps we think we are required to expend more effort than we believe we need to make. If we ignore the knowledgeable guidance given us to navigate this life and we strike out on our own, we will surely squander much time, waste many efforts, and suffer numerous false starts. If, however, we are willing to become "as a child, submissive, meek, humble, patient, full of love, willing to submit to all things which the Lord seeth fit to inflict upon [us], even as a child doth submit to his father" (Mosiah 3:19), then we will not be left to wander through unfamiliar roads, to experience anxiety and apprehension, and to end up far from our intended goal.<br><br>Like most mothers, I was and always will be anxious about my children's safety. When our oldest child first started school only a couple of blocks away from our home, she and I prepared thoroughly for the short journey. We walked the route together, and we talked about the crossing guard and about others she could walk with. We planned as well as we could. When school began I walked there with her, and I went back later to pick her up. Soon this became very trying for her, because, like all children are preprogrammed to do, she wanted to try things on her own. So, for a while, I would wait down by the corner where I could see the children coming from school. My daughter was very independent and reassured me she could do it on her own, so together we agreed on what was acceptable.<br><br>For a week or so she kept to the routine, but as her self-confidence grew, so did her desire to explore. One day the hour of arrival passed and she was not home. I waited; I grew impatient; I walked to the corner, but I could see no sign of her. I asked other children if they had seen her, but I got no results. Finally, I ran home to call the school, but they also knew nothing. By now she was almost an hour late, and I was beginning to panic.<br><br>Shortly thereafter, in bounded my daughter. Thankful to see her safe, but also upset, I asked her why it had taken her so long to come home. She looked at me and said brightly, "But Mom, I took the shortcut!" Her own wishes, you see, had caused her to forget the rules she had agreed to keep. This choice could have put her at great risk, and she had caused her mother great anxiety. As with all of us, she could and did choose her behavior. But she could not choose the consequences.<br><br>Because our Father in Heaven loves us deeply and wants us to succeed, He has not only given us His Beloved Son to be our earthly guide, our director, our compass, but He has given us His words and the testimony of the Holy Spirit. We read in Alma 37:44-45:<br><br><i>For behold, it is as easy to give heed to the word of Christ, which will point to you a straight course to eternal bliss, as it was for our fathers to give heed to this compass, which would point unto them a straight course to the promised land.</i><br><br>And now I say, is there not a type in this thing? For just as surely as this director did bring our fathers, by following its course, to the promised land, shall the words of Christ, if we follow their course, carry us beyond this vale of sorrow into a far better land of promise.<br><br>With the promised constant companionship of the Holy Spirit to accompany us, if we will but pay attention to and obey that still, small voice, we can be guided every step of our way through this wonderful adventure we call mortality. We need not feel lost, unprotected, or unimportant. The Lord has promised us in 2 Nephi 32:5,"For behold, again I say unto you that if ye will enter in by the way, and receive the Holy Ghost, it will show unto you all things what ye should do." The Lord is then willing to walk with us every step of the way if we do not wander off on our own. This benefit is freely included in the individual study program that our Heavenly Father has laid out for each of us, and it can continue to bless us while in this mortal life. Though I do not completely understand the nature of this miracle, I know that I have felt the influence of the Holy Spirit many times in my life in a variety of circumstances, and I have a testimony that this gift is given to all of us regardless of who we are, if we are only willing to listen.<br><br>In my office I have a plaque with a favorite scripture found in Alma 26:12:<br><br><i>Yea, I know that I am nothing; as to my strength I am weak; therefore I will not boast of myself, but I will boast of my God, for in his strength I can do all things; yea, behold, many mighty miracles we have wrought in this land, for which we will praise his name forever.</i><br><br>Alma recognized his utter dependency on the Lord, and he was firm in his determination to keep to the program.<br><br>I also know that many mighty miracles have taken place in my life. As each of us contemplates his or her own life and the many paths we all have traveled to be here today, we will see clearly the hand of the Lord and His exquisite care, even if at times we find ourselves or those we love in trying circumstances.<br><br>So, the question then becomes, what are we doing during our sojourn on this earth? Do we resist the directions of a loving, kind, and all-knowing Tour Guide, or do we embrace with our whole heart, might, mind, and strength the program God has worked out for us?<br><br>We would do well not to forget that our loving Father never promised us that this trip would be free from trouble, cares, or doubts. We often worry about our worthiness, our lack of talents, and which paths we are to take. During such times we need to remember that we are part of a divinely designed plan and that our Heavenly Father and His Son, Jesus Christ, want us to succeed.<br><br>In his April 2004 general conference address, Elder Bruce C. Hafen declared,<br><br><i>This earth is not our home. We are away at school, trying to master the lessons of "the great plan of happiness" so we can return home and</i> know what it means to be there.<br><br><i>Christ's Atonement is at the very core of this plan. Without His dear, dear sacrifice, there would be no way home,</i> <i>no way to be together, no way to be like Him.</i> [Bruce C. Hafen, "The Atonement: All for All," <i>Ensign,</i> May 2004, 98]<br><br>My brothers and sisters, although we are all traveling in this world, through this strange land, we are not bound to this world, because Christ has reconciled all of us to Him without consideration of language, culture, or status. He has given us a passport bought with His own life. Indeed, as Elder Neal A. Maxwell pointed out, we should always carry the passport issued to us by the kingdom of heaven as we pass through this land of mortality. We may be tempted to trade in this divine passport for one issued by the world, thinking--in error, to be sure--that it will be easier to get around in this life with this new document. But we are not ultimately of this world. Jesus has paid the price to redeem every one of us, so that we will not be left behind in a lesser sphere. He has made it possible for us, at the end of our mortal Study Abroad, to return to the safety and the glory of our heavenly home, carrying with us our heavenly credentials stamped with the experiences we gained in this world.<br><br>We know that if we keep our covenants, if we follow the plan prepared for us before we came to this earth, if we listen to the promptings of the Holy Spirit and keep our eyes on the Divine Guide--our Savior and Redeemer--we will complete this journey successfully, and we will honor His name, even the sacred name of Jesus Christ. I pray that we may so live and that we may help others we meet along this journey, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Joaquina Hoskisson was an associate lecturer in the Department of Spanish and Portuguese at Brigham Young University when this devotional address was given on 3 August 2004.</i><br><br><i>© Brigham Young University.

<h1>Women for All Seasons - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
If you could choose one season to live in permanently, which would it be? Honestly, living here in Provo the past few years makes it hard for me to decide. I grew up in La Cañada, California, convinced that there was only one season. Leaves changing colors and snow covering the ground were the stuff of fairy tales. Yes, I was one of the freshman herd from California and Arizona who gleefully galloped around outside the first night of snow and then froze the next day when we realized all we had packed for the year were shorts and sandals. Once I was safely bundled up in the jacket I had my mother quickly send from home, I found this variation from the perpetually mild summer days of Southern California exhilarating.<br><br>I had never seen anything in nature so pristine and pure as the sun coming through a snow-brushed Rock Canyon the morning after a night of snow. A whole new world opened up to me of skiing, sledding, and rolling Volkswagen Bug–sized snowballs around the DT field. And, of course, then comes spring--with that week in March or April when all of the trees on campus seem to burst with bright blossoms in unison, bringing meaning to the phrase "popcorn popping on the apricot tree." In the fall the red-turned oaks on the mountainside were like nothing I had ever seen at home, where palm trees remain the same dull green year-round. I marveled at the Creator who would tilt the earth relative to the plane of its orbit around the sun <i>just</i> enough to bring color and variety to our lives. I had to get out of Southern California long enough to find it.<br><br>That same Creator, who so often tucks natural treasures away where you only find them if you go looking, has also placed treasures of truth and understanding all around us. We would miss it all if we never ventured out of the narrow world defined by our majors and our natural inclinations. Just as I was lucky enough to make it out of the pseudo-paradise of Southern California to discover something as simple as the changing seasons, we have all been blessed to have had--and hopefully taken--the opportunity to discover these treasures that are reserved for the adventuresome learner, simply by being given the opportunity to come to this university.<br><br>In fact, have you ever thought about what the word <i>university</i> means? It sounds an awful lot like <i>universe,</i> and actually these two words come from the same Latin root meaning "the whole." I love the feeling conveyed by this concept of "the whole" (that is w-h-o-l-e). A profound implication of the theory of relativity is that a whole can be more than the sum of the separate parts. A heavy atom such as uranium has more mass than the sum of its fragments if it is broken apart.<br><br>The university is the same way. Together, with our varied interests, abilities, and fields of expertise, we make up something much more than our separate sums. Believe me, no one is more arrogant in thinking he has a handle on how the universe works than a physics student who has just solved the Schrödinger equation to explain hydrogen, the simplest of all atoms. But that same physics student would be helpless with his methods to explain the complicated interactions of nucleic acids in living cells. We need biochemists for that. And even the biochemists among us--who are striving to understand the very workings of life--don't have the tools to understand the intricate responses of the human mind: hence, psychology.<br><br>Even with all of a psychologist's training, can a person really explain being moved almost to tears by the sounds of Mendelssohn's violin concerto? Only the performer drawing the bow across the strings begins to understand that. Although each of these fields makes a unique contribution to our collective body of knowledge, some of our greatest realizations are in finding the connections between seemingly disparate fields. Some of my most satisfying moments come when I can apply a principle learned in economics to elucidate a difficult concept in physics. These kinds of moments show us again and again that all truth really can be circumscribed in one great whole.<br><br>Each discipline is essential to the university living up to its Latin root as <i>whole</i> or <i>complete,</i> but, more important, we ourselves would not be whole people if we put on intellectual blinders and shut out everything that doesn't directly touch our individual fields. Instead we must try to embody the attitude of the namesake of this university, Brigham Young, who said:<br><br><i>How gladly would we understand every principle pertaining to science and art, and become thoroughly acquainted with every intricate operation of nature, and with all the chemical changes that are constantly going on around us! How delightful this would be, and what a boundless field of truth and power is open for us to explore!</i> [<i>JD</i> 9:167]<br><br>This doesn't mean we have to go back and major in everything--although I'm sure some of us here have tried. Our appetites have already been whetted by our BYU education. We have been exposed to Nietzsche and Newton, Darwin and Dante. The challenge before us now is to continue in the curiosity we have cultivated as students and to make learning in all areas a lifelong passion--not merely a temporary phase to be shed along with these robes. In my view, two of the greatest causes we can be engaged in are the pursuit of truth and to seek to improve the well-being of others. The One who perfectly embodies both of these gave us the directive "Be ye therefore perfect" (Matthew 5:48). This may be more accurately understood to mean "Be ye therefore complete, or whole," and is a challenge for us to emulate Him who is the Master of all subjects.<br><br>How much I would have missed out on if I had never left my familiar surroundings long enough to discover something as simple as the changing seasons! Similarly, let us continue to do what we have learned from our university experience and seek out truth and understanding everywhere it can be found. Let's be men and women for all seasons.<br><br>Thank you.<br><br><i>Brigham Russell Frandsen spoke as the representative of his graduating class at BYU commencement on 12 August 2004.</i><br><br><i>© Brigham Young University.

<h1> Role to Help Others - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I appreciate the opportunity of being here today. Many of the defining experiences of my life were obtained here at BYU, on what I believe is hallowed ground.<br><br>• I solidified my testimony of the gospel of Jesus Christ.<br>• I confirmed my desire to fulfill a mission.<br>• I was introduced to my beautiful wife.<br>• I was educated with the basics of my occupation.<br>• I learned the importance of service to others.<br><br>What an honor it is to serve this university and the students it graduates.<br><br>In April I shared with the graduates an experience I had while I was a student on campus. Today I would like to share a more recent experience to emphasize how BYU continues to influence me--long after my formal education has ended.<br><br>Call it a "midlife crisis" or just searching for meaning in my career, but I was recently struggling with finding purpose in my work. As part of my normal practice I attended our monthly BYU Management Society luncheon, organized by dedicated alumni in the Seattle area.<br><br>The speaker that day, Edmond Lee, is a successful entrepreneur and the fourth of 13 children. He related the following story:<br><br>In the late 1960s Dad supported our family by working full-time at Boeing during the daytime and delivering newspapers in the early morning. He would rise at 3:45 a.m. to work the paper routes, return at 5:45, eat a quick breakfast, then drive us to early-morning seminary on his way to work. There was little time for rest. In addition to overtime work and the day-to-day demands as father of a large family, he spent two evenings per week serving as a stake missionary.<br><br>Dad's modest income somehow met the family's needs. However, by 1969, with three children serving full-time missions, two in college, and eight to follow, additional income was needed.<br><br>About this time there was advertised an opening for a part-time janitor position at the institute of religion building. It required evening work three nights per week. The Seattle economy was slow, so there were numerous applicants, all waiting in line for a chance at the job. Dad didn't feel confident in his chances.<br><br>However, during his interview the institute director didn't ask the typical questions. Instead he simply asked Dad to explain the circumstances of his life.<br><br>Upon hearing of the 13 children, the paper routes, the church service, and the added financial obligations of missions and college, to Dad's great surprise, he was offered the job on the spot.<br><br>Additionally, the institute director made special arrangements to make the job a family affair. Instead of Dad toiling alone late in the evening, we would often work there as a family and do the job in an hour or less. Not only did it take less time, but the chance to work together served to teach us responsibility and to strengthen our family.<br><br>This institute director was none other than Elder Jeffrey R. Holland, now a current member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles and former president of Brigham Young University.<br><br>As I returned to my office after this Management Society luncheon, I was struck with how this BYU "classroom away from campus" had enlightened my soul. My somewhat selfish questions of what I was gaining from my profession were replaced with a newfound understanding of how to use my role to help others. Instead of only evaluating how an employee could serve my needs, I learned to be an employer who viewed every job as a valuable asset--an asset to be used in the most profitable way to bless the life of some worthy person. I learned that this was something with which the Lord had blessed me and that I could use it to build the kingdom of God.<br><br>Brigham Young University teaches more than life skills--it teaches how to live life. With the lessons we gain here, we become stewards of this knowledge, of this university's reputation, and of its prophesied success.<br><br>Please make a commitment with me today to serve Brigham Young University and begin fulfilling your stewardship responsibilities!<br><br>• Serve BYU by mentoring those who follow you.<br>• Serve BYU by donating your time and financial support every year.<br>• Serve BYU by never doing anything that would reflect poorly on its name.<br>• Serve BYU by being the employee/manager/owner/citizen who acts only with the highest integrity.<br>• Serve BYU by growing the testimony of the gospel that was nurtured here.<br>• Serve BYU by sharing all you have been blessed with to help others.<br><br>I congratulate you on your accomplishments to date.<br><br>As president of your alumni association, I hereby confer on each of you lifetime membership in the Brigham Young University Alumni Association and welcome you to this honored fraternity of more than 350,000.<br><br>As Elder Holland exemplified more than 35 years ago, I invite each of you to "ask the right questions"--namely, how you can use what you have learned at BYU to serve others. I pray that you will exemplify BYU's influence in your lives by joining me in serving this great university and the students it produces. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><em>Carr Krueger was president of the BYU Alumni Association when this BYU commencement address was given on 12 August 2004.</em><br><br>© Brigham Young University.

<h1> by Heart - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
It is my privilege to be able to say a few words to you. I would like to begin by offering my personal congratulations to the graduates and to the families and friends here today. It is a day of joy and a day when we praise the Lord for the many mercies He has given us.<br><br>My husband, John, just had a birthday. As we gathered to give him our gifts, our celebration looked a little different from that of most families. There was very little wrapping paper and ribbon and hardly any tangible evidence of gifts. Instead we presented him with memorizations as our gifts. For as long as I can remember John has discouraged using store-bought presents to celebrate his holidays. Instead he has asked that we memorize a poem, song, or scriptural passage to recite for him. This way our offerings could be described the same as William Shakespeare described mercy: "It is twice blessed; It blesseth him that gives and him that takes" (<i>The Merchant of Venice,</i> act 4, scene 1, lines 186–87). I know this passage because I once memorized it for John. He has always felt that memorization gives our children and me a chance to give him something that we can also keep for ourselves. It is a gift from the heart.<br><br>I have learned that there are many benefits to memorizing. For me, personally, it deepens my understanding of the passage and fixes it in my heart. As you go over and over a passage in your mind, you think about it again and again. The richness of the words, the way they are put together, the possible symbolisms, the clever use of literary devices, and new meanings that you may never have noticed or understood before--all become apparent in the process of memorizing. Memorizing can put words in our hearts as well as in our minds. Learning by heart--which may be somewhat of a dying tradition--means to learn something so deeply that it becomes part of our core: it fills us; it changes us. Often my heart has been filled during early morning runs as I have gone over in my mind the words from "The Family: A Proclamation to the World" (<i>Ensign,</i> November 1995, 102), "The Living Christ" (<i>Ensign,</i> April 2000, 2–3), or some scripture or poem I was memorizing.<br><br>I had read the family proclamation many times and felt love and appreciation for it. But as I memorized each word and sentence, I began to see how it spoke in detail to each of the cultural ills that plague our society. I felt hope that the eternal truths taught in the proclamation could arm me as I faced current and difficult moral issues. I began to feel greater personal affirmation from apostles and prophets and from the Lord for the family choices I had made over a lifetime. I felt strongly the knowledge that we have a Father in Heaven who has an unfailing plan for us. I felt His matchless love and goodness. I felt, as it explains in Proverbs, that "the Lord giveth wisdom: out of his mouth cometh knowledge and understanding" and "wisdom entereth into thine heart" (Proverbs 2:6,10). My heart was filled with knowledge, understanding, wisdom, and love. This knowledge encouraged gratitude, personal improvement, and the desire to strengthen others.<br><br>This tradition of memorizing and reciting has allowed us as parents additional glimpses into the hearts of our children. As they choose their own passages, we often discover what challenges or joys they are experiencing. We also learn of their wisdom and sometimes of their sense of humor. I remember on John's 40th birthday when our then 15-year-old daughter presented a poem by Lewis Carroll:<br><br><i>"You are old, Father William," the young man said,</i><br><br><i>"And your hair has become very white;</i><br><br><i>And yet you incessantly stand on your head--</i><br><br><i>Do you think, at your age, it is right?"</i><br><br>["You Are Old, Father William," stanza 1]<br><br>Although somewhat dismayed that year at feeling kind of old, my husband was even more delighted at our daughter's sense of humor. Another time a daughter chose to recite Shakespeare's "Sonnet 29": "When in disgrace with fortune and men's eyes / I all alone beweep my outcast state" (lines 1–2). This came at a time when she was feeling inadequate and friendless. One child chose a love poem when he was feeling heady and in love. Another memorized section 4 of the Doctrine and Covenants and announced to us that she had decided to serve a mission. What our children learn by heart and share with their father becomes an expression of their own heartfelt emotions.<br><br>Learning by heart is a rich phrase. Think about the word <i>heart.</i> We all know that our hearts are central to life. Physically the heart is the life-sustaining organ of our bodies. Likewise, <i>heart</i> is used to describe the essential, most vital part of our spiritual being--one's innermost character, feelings, or inclinations. In a gospel sense the heart is our spiritual core. Hence the scriptures teach that "as [a man] thinketh in his <i>heart,</i> so is he" (Proverbs 23:7; emphasis added) and that "where your treasure is, there will your <i>heart</i> be also" (Matthew 6:21; emphasis added). The gospel must be "written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tables of stone, but in fleshy tables of the <i>heart"</i> (2 Corinthians 3:3; emphasis added). Over and over in the scriptures prophets remind us, as Alma told his son, to "let the affections of thy <i>heart</i> be placed upon the Lord forever" (Alma 37:36; emphasis added). Learning by heart in its richest sense is a gospel duty. It is a twin commandment to remembering. We are to learn spiritual truth by heart and then retain in remembrance what we have placed deep in our hearts.<br><br>Many of you here today have spent the last four years (or maybe more) at this wonderful university to become educated. What have you learned by heart? Some of it is factual or informational. Such learning is useful. It helps us solve daily problems and meet immediate needs. Dr. Todd Britsch, former academic vice president of BYU, said:<br><br><i>We remember some data that helps us solve a problem, we direct someone to a particular location, we discuss a painting without a copy of it in front of us, we order a part for a computer without a catalog at hand. In each case we have memorized something that helps us shorten the process of dealing with daily experience. Without this storehouse of facts and data, we would be helpless.</i><br><br>Other things we learn by heart serve even more profound ends, as Dr. Britsch goes on to describe:<br><br><i>A scripture that aids in counseling a sorrowing friend; a hymn whose words and music express our most profound religious feelings when we are struggling with a matter of faith; . . . a technical point that helps us defend a position that is important for us, our family, or our community.</i> [Todd A. Britsch, "Memorization: 'Regurgitation' or 'Learning by Heart'?" <i>Focus on Faculty</i> 5, no. 3 (summer 1997): 2]<br><br>Have you deposited rich and worthwhile learning into your memory bank so that when you need to make a withdrawal there will be abundant treasures of knowledge and wisdom available to you? Have you acquired both the skill and the love of learning so that you can continue throughout your life to fill your bank and thus be more serviceable to others?<br><br>Learning by heart enables us to pursue lifelong learning and service more fully--which should be an ongoing outcome of a BYU education. <i>The Aims of a BYU Education</i> states:<br><br><i>BYU should inspire students to keep alive their curiosity and prepare them to continue learning throughout their lives. . . . A BYU degree should educate students in how to learn, teach them that there is much still to learn, and implant in them a love of learning "by study and also by faith" (D&amp;amp;C 88:118).</i> [In <i>The Mission of Brigham Young University</i> and <i>The Aims of a BYU Education</i> (Provo: BYU, 1996), 12]<br><br>Brigham Young stated: "We might ask, when shall we cease to learn? I will give you my opinion about it; never, never" (<i>JD</i> 3:203). He also taught: "Our education should be such as to improve our minds and fit us for increased usefulness; to make us of greater service to the human family" (<i>JD</i> 14:83).<br><br>I am grateful for powerful examples in my life of people who are continually learning and serving--thus making the world a better place by using their vibrant minds and hearts.<br><br>John's 84-year-old mother is one such example. She is currently serving a temple mission--her sixth mission. It is always fun to talk to her because there is such excitement in her voice about each new discovery--be it about our church or a country's history or the local culture. She has taught herself to speak several languages to be more useful in her temple service. Over the years she has been a great source of suggested reading ideas for my book group because she is continually learning from interesting books. She is the mother of 13 children who follow her example in hungering for knowledge. She is someone who has taken learning to heart.<br><br>I likewise saw a pattern of learning by heart in my family that began with my grandpa. It then extended to my dad and now to my generation. My grandfather and father had a love for geography, history, and cultures. They traveled as much as they could and can still recount in great and correct detail names of villages, mountains, rivers, and lakes they have visited. In my home as we grew up we had contests to memorize the county seats of all the counties in the state, then the capitals of all the states in the United States, then the capitals of the countries on each continent. Of course in the process we studied maps, learned about languages and cultures, and visited lots of beautiful places of interest. My grandpa took us on trips and thus began the tradition of filling our hearts with knowledge and memories. He believed in giving his posterity experiences rather than things. My father has continued this.<br><br>One of the experiences my dad gave me that has filled my memory bank is climbing mountains together. It was hard work, but he taught me that the spectacular view from the top was more magnificent because I had earned it. He taught me to photograph exquisite scenes in my memory so that I could recall them anytime I needed the serenity of soul they could bring to me. I gained the knowledge that Heavenly Father loved me enough to create this world "to please the eye and to gladden the heart; . . . and to enliven the soul" (D&amp;amp;C 59:18–19).<br><br>My dad just returned from Nauvoo, where he served as temple president. He is almost 80 now and sadly admits that he probably won't stand on top of any of his favorite mountain peaks again. But he has those vistas that he loves so much stored in his memory bank, reminiscent of William Wordsworth's poem about seeing a host of golden daffodils that Dad so often quoted to me:<br><br><i>I gazed--and gazed--but little thought</i><br><br><i>What wealth the show to me had brought:</i><br><br><i>For oft, when on my couch I lie</i><br><br><i>In vacant or in pensive mood,</i><br><br><i>They flash upon that inward eye</i><br><br><i>Which is the bliss of solitude;</i><br><br><i>And then my</i> heart <i>with pleasure fills,</i><br><br><i>And dances with the daffodils.</i><br><br>["I Wandered Lonely as a Cloud" (1807), stanzas 3–4; emphasis added]<br><br>Because my dad memorized those mountain scenes, he can return to them when in "vacant or in pensive mood" and again fill his heart with pleasure.<br><br>One of the many things I love about our dear President Hinckley is his bright mind and his love for learning. At the dedication of the remodeled library on this campus, there was much talk about the vast technology we had acquired that would help people distant from the campus access information from our great collection of books. President Hinckley was grateful for that, but then he tenderly held a beautiful book in his hands. He talked of his great love for the heft and feel of a book, about how nothing surpassed the pleasure of holding it and reading from its pages. He inherited a vast library of books from his father, and he knew its contents. Books have become part of him. His daughter Virginia Pearce said of him, "He frequently quotes Shakespeare. He quotes Kipling. Passages of great literature are just floating around in his head" (quoted in Jake Parkinson, "U. Endowment Expands," <i>Deseret News,</i> 6 April 2003, A7). This is because he memorized them in his youth and sometimes recited them to his parents--as our children have done for us.<br><br>My husband and I have heard lots of other relevant information "pop out" as we had the opportunity to take two ambassadors to visit him--one from the Czech Republic and one from China. In each case we were astounded at the depth of his knowledge of the historical and political events of those lands. He is well read. He is a good thinker. He has a good memory and is wise in his ability to assimilate and utilize his knowledge. This lifelong learning has allowed him to be much more serviceable in the kingdom. He is able to draw treasures of wisdom out of the abundance of a heart well stocked with knowledge.<br><br>The BYU <i>Aims</i> document explains that greater knowledge gives us the ability to be more serviceable:<br><br><i>Well-developed faith, intellect, and character prepare students for a lifetime of . . . service. . . . BYU students strengthen not only themselves--they "also bring strength to others in the tasks of home and family life, social relationships, civic duty, and service to mankind" (Mission Statement).</i> [<i>Aims,</i> 12]<br><br>I memorized a poem by George Eliot that speaks eloquently about developing ourselves so that we may become one of the "choir invisible" whose lives "bring strength to others":<br><br><i>O may I join the choir invisible</i><br><br><i>Of those immortal dead who live again</i><br><br><i>In minds made better by their presence: . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . May I . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . be to other souls</i><br><br><i>The cup of strength in some great agony,</i><br><br><i>Enkindle generous ardour, feed pure love,</i><br><br><i>Beget the smiles that have no cruelty--</i><br><br><i>Be the sweet presence of a good diffused,</i><br><br><i>And in diffusion ever more intense.</i><br><br><i>So shall I join the choir invisible</i><br><br><i>Whose music is the gladness of the world.</i><br><br>["O May I Join the Choir Invisible," 1867]<br><br>Through lifelong learning and service we may "join the choir invisible Whose music is the gladness of the world." As graduates of BYU we have a special duty so to live. As President Kimball said at the dedication of the Carillon Tower, may "the morality of the graduates of this University provide the music of hope for the inhabitants of this planet" (Spencer W. Kimball, "Second Century Address and Dedication of Carillon Tower and Bells," Brigham Young University, 10 October 1975, 12).<br><br>For our lives to become the music of hope for the world, our learning must be heart deep; it must reach our very core. We must be able not only to access information but to understand; we must acquire not only knowledge but wisdom. In this day and age we can look up anything, but it can only change us if we know it in our hearts. T. S. Eliot said, "Where is the wisdom we have lost in knowledge? / Where is the knowledge we have lost in information?" (<i>The Rock</i> [1934], I).<br><br>"O remember, remember," Alma said to each of his sons (Helaman 5:9). Let us "treasure up wisdom" in our hearts (D&amp;amp;C 38:30) by dwelling in our hearts on blessings of protection, comfort, and peace; by pondering in our hearts moments of inspiration and revelation; and, above all, by remembering that we are covenant children of Heavenly Father. We must engrave our covenants in the fleshy tables of our hearts.<br><br>It is my hope and my prayer that, as Jeremiah said, God "will put [His] law in [our] inward parts, and write it in [our] hearts" (Jeremiah 31:33). May we learn by heart those things that will continually fill our memory banks with wisdom and then use that wisdom in His service is my prayer, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Susan W.

<h1>ectations - Cecil O. Samuelson - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Graduates, families, brothers, sisters, and friends, it is a privilege, pleasure, and opportunity to be with you as we congratulate those we honor--including especially those who have sacrificed for and contributed to all graduates whose names we find in the program. We are especially pleased to welcome Elder Richard G. Scott, a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles and chairman of the Executive Committee of the Board of Trustees. We are grateful for the presence of Sister Susan W. Tanner, Young Women general president of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and a member of the BYU Board of Trustees, who has been assigned by the officers of the board to conduct today's exercises and speak to us. We also acknowledge the presence of Elder D. Todd Christofferson of the Presidency of the Seventy, who is here in his key role as a father and father-in-law, and of Sister Bonnie D. Parkin, Relief Society general president and a member of the BYU Board of Trustees. We recognize with appreciation the many other special friends and honored guests who are with us today. Welcome to all.<br><br>As I approach the middle of my second year at BYU and am attending my fourth commencement exercise, I feel to express my continued appreciation for the privilege of being at BYU. I am grateful for the support of the students, faculty, staff, and administration and for the confidence expressed in all of us by our board of trustees, who provide us with so much and sustain us so well with their counsel, faith, and prayers. My wife, Sharon, joins me in expressing our thanks to all of you and especially to those who have made special efforts of many kinds in our behalf.<br><br>It has long been a BYU custom--started many years before my arrival--to share some interesting statistics about our graduates and our university community. It is a remarkable place, and our students are truly remarkable people!<br><br>Our youngest graduate is still in the teenage years, and our oldest is a few years older than even am I. This represents a span of more than 50 years--which I find to be impressive. Equally impressive is that each graduate is distinctive and distinguished when described by those who know her or him best. Today we will recognize 2,821 total graduates, with 2,429 bachelor's, 355 master's, and 37 doctoral degrees being awarded. Female graduates outnumber their male counterparts by 35, and the men have requested that I refrain from mentioning additional spheres in which the women excel.<br><br>Slightly more than half of the class are married, and 51 percent have attended other institutions of higher learning prior to coming to BYU. All of the 50 states but one are represented in the graduating class, which also includes students from 52 foreign countries and one U.S. territory. A quarter of you come from Utah and 15 percent hail from California. Your vastly differing previous experiences and unique perspectives add greatly to the richness of the BYU experience for all of us.<br><br>A further statistic that is surprising to many around the world who do not know us well is the tremendous facility so many on this campus have with languages. Seventy-eight percent of all our students report some proficiency with a second language, and this rises to 85 percent with our seniors. Interestingly, 49 percent of you said you acquired your second language at the Missionary Training Center or on a mission, but a full third (33 percent) of you also credit BYU language courses. Over a quarter of our students report that they came to BYU with some pre-university language fluency.<br><br>On previous occasions I have reported on the high volume of food and treats served and sold here at BYU. I'll not repeat statistics in this respect except to say that the ice cream, fudge, and pizza consumption continues to be impressive!<br><br>As I hope you know, our bookstore provides excellent service and sells many things more than books. I was pleased to learn that the best-selling book ever, excluding the scriptures, is President Gordon B. Hinckley's book <i>Standing for Something.</i> I expect and hope that reading and listening to the words of the prophet will be a lifelong habit for all of us, in addition to our other efforts at continuing and continuous learning.<br><br>With that thought in mind, let me share a few words from President Hinckley concerning BYU. Many of you have heard his counsel and instruction when he has visited this campus. Last Saturday's <i>Church News </i>reported some comments he made during a dedication ceremony at BYU--Idaho a year or two ago. Said he:<br><br><i>Brigham Young University--Provo has become a truly great institution, now recognized across the nation for the quality of the education it provides, for the strength of its faculty, and for its unique and large student body. It is a credit to the Church and will continue to be so. . . .</i><br><br><i>The mission</i> [of the Church schools] <i>is to impart secular knowledge in a first-class manner while building faith in the Eternal God and His Risen Son, the Lord Jesus Christ.</i><br><br><i>This Church will never fail. Jesus Christ stands at its head. And just as it will never fail, neither will its institutions and programs.</i> [Dedication of the Gordon B. Hinckley Building, BYU--Idaho, 22 October 2002, quoted in "Messages of Inspiration from President Hinckley," <i>Church News,</i> 7 August 2004, 2]<br><br>It continues to be my privilege on a regular basis to report that this university is meeting the expectations President Hinckley has explicated and that, further, almost all of the students reflect in their lives and their accomplishments the fruits of this special and wonderful BYU education.<br><br>While you have been at BYU, you can certify that our expectations for you have been high. Please also know that as you leave, our anticipations are even higher. Because you have received many of the blessings possible that come from being at BYU, you will make remarkable and ever-stretching contributions as you enter the real world of family, society, church, and work.<br><br>Just a week ago, Elder Henry B. Eyring, a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles and the Church commissioner of education, gave a remarkable talk that was transmitted worldwide to Church Educational System employees and volunteers. His remarks were targeted to the teachers of our youth--most of whom will not have the opportunity for a BYU experience as you have had. He asked teachers to raise expectations for these young people, and I ask that you continue to have high expectations for yourselves, because we certainly do as well. Elder Eyring mentioned four personal expectations or choices that will allow us to reach our true potential. Let me mention them briefly.<br><br>First, we must pray with faith that the gifts of the Spirit will extend us beyond our normal, human capacities. We need not only the hope but the conviction that we will receive revelation when we are worthy and properly prepared to receive it.<br><br>Second, we need to choose to trust the scriptures with the simple faith of a child as they speak of spiritual gifts. Note he did not say we should be childish! Although the rigors of a university education usually chase some of the childishness out of us, there is also the risk in the process that we may inadvertently discard the necessary simple faith with which we were blessed as children.<br><br>Third, we need to learn to be obedient to the impressions of the Spirit when we receive them. The best way to receive regular impressions of the Spirit is to act on them when they come. And, of course, we need to work very hard to be sure that we are listening to the promptings of the true Spirit and not just justifying our own wishes or listening to the minions of the adversary.<br><br>Fourth, Elder Eyring stated his opinion that the most important choice teachers and students can make is to invite the Spirit to testify of the Savior and His Restoration of His true Church through His prophet Joseph Smith. Why would this be so important? I would suggest that having a regular spiritual confirmation of foundational principles and premises will familiarize us with the reality of spiritual promptings and also give us a vital standard by which we can measure other inspiration that may come. By being absolutely loyal and secure in the basics, we are better equipped to deal with the vagaries and vicissitudes that all of us will encounter. It is both helpful and healthy to be able to say, as did Nephi, "I know that he [meaning God] loveth his children; nevertheless, I do not know the meaning of all things" (1 Nephi 11:17).<br><br>In addition to the expectations expressed by Elder Eyring that I have mentioned briefly, let me mention one more that needs to be raised with you. You have been among the most fortunate and blessed of all students, even in this day and age. One of the most difficult tasks I share with my associates in the administration is trying to explain to those who would very much like to come to BYU why this is not always possible. You are a select and often envied group. And yet much of the substance of the support for your first-class education has come from faithful members of the Church all around the world. Their tithing and the additional funds faithfully contributed by special university friends and supporters have helped make you beneficiaries of what we call the BYU experience. I hope that you will never forget those who have sacrificed and contributed in your behalf. Of course you will always be grateful to parents, spouses, other family members, and friends who have helped you directly. Please do not forget those you don't know and likely will never meet who, because of their love of the Lord and their responsiveness to His servants, pay their tithes and offerings. You are in their debt.<br><br>We hope also that you will never forget your teachers, your classmates, and the many devoted and capable people in the BYU community who have contributed to your success and opportunities. We promise we will never forget you and expect that you will not forget BYU. You will demonstrate your great love for this institution and all that it represents by the way you live your life. You will live in such a way that objective observers will be able to tell that you are different--in a very positive way. They will usually not know exactly how or why, but they will appreciate the goodness and example of your life.<br><br>We also hope and expect that you will join the ever-increasing throng of generous alumni and friends who financially contribute to BYU as your circumstances permit. Most will not be able to do much soon, but the habit of contributing regularly, at least yearly, will grow--as will your capacity. You will then be able to demonstrate in a very tangible way that you have caught the vision of what BYU is and what it has done for you.<br><br>Know again of our gratitude for you and your accomplishments. It is a great privilege to be part of the wonderful BYU community, and we hope that you will visit regularly and keep in touch with the university.<br><br>I have a witness that all President Hinckley has said about BYU is absolutely true. I want you to know that I also testify of the vision and the correctness concerning the potential of Brigham Young University seen by Brigham Young himself. In his lifetime, what we enjoy today seemed at best to be remote if not impossible.<br><br>God's hand is on this great university and will be on all associated with it when they live to so qualify. I testify of this in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Cecil O. Samuelson was president of Brigham Young University when this commencement address was given on 12 August 2004.</i><br><br><i>© Intellectual Reserve, Inc. All rights reserved.</i>

<h1>sdom and Great Treasures of Knowledge&quot; - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Perhaps it is because I cannot help but wonder why you are all here! Some have traveled a considerable distance. Almost all have taken precious vacation days. So, why <i>here?</i> Why <i>Education Week?</i> Why not waterskiing? Or the beach? (Some of you may be asking that very question right about now!) If you think about it for a moment, I believe you will agree that it really is a pretty good question. Why <i>did</i> you choose Education Week over some recreational activity or simply lying adrift on a plastic air mattress in a backyard swimming pool?<br><br>In a way, I believe that the answer is reflected in the theme of this conference--Finding "Wisdom and Great Treasures of Knowledge, Even Hidden Treasures" (D&amp;amp;C 89:19). In a very real sense the answer to that question--<i>What am</i> I doing here?--is what I would like to address. The fact is, brothers and sisters, that you are here instead of somewhere else because for you there is more to life than the proverbial "news, weather, and sports."<br><br>Some years ago, I had some responsibility for the open house and dedication of the San Diego California Temple. One Saturday afternoon, one of our committees for the open house was holding a meeting in a stake center adjacent to a large sectarian chapel. The parking lots for these two buildings are contiguous, resulting in an immense expanse of asphalt between them. I thought it was quite remarkable that our committee meeting was so well attended at a time when most people are outside playing--especially in San Diego! Then, I walked into the foyer of our building. Through the glass doors I had a panoramic view of that large parking area and the other church's meetinghouse. To my surprise the parking lot was filling with cars as people arrived for a meeting at that <i>other</i> building. They were coming as families mostly--fathers, mothers, and children--carrying their scriptures. They were more casually dressed than are we customarily in going to church. But they were flocking to a meeting in that other church much as our people flock to meetings in our buildings. As I watched, the thought forcefully impressed itself upon my mind that this is just the way it was in 1820 when a 14-year-old and his family flocked to religious assemblies--looking for something. The impression continued that for these people--as for those in Joseph's day, as for us--there really <i>is</i> more to life than "news, weather, and sports"!<br><br>These people in that San Diego parking lot were also searching for something. But what? Many have so searched in vain. Scripture records that<br><br><i>the days come . . . that I will send a famine in the land, not a famine of bread, nor a thirst for water, but of hearing the words of the Lord:</i><br><br>And they shall wander from sea to sea, and from the north even to the east, they shall run to and fro to seek the word of the Lord, and shall not find it. [Amos 8:11–12]<br><br>Even would-be disciples in the very Church of Christ may at times experience periodic "whiteout" conditions in the blizzards of Babylon and not see "the word of the Lord" that is right in front of them. Recall the two on the road to Emmaus, whose "eyes were holden" that they could not recognize the Savior when He "talked with [them] by the way" (Luke 24:16, 32).<br><br>And that, my dear brothers and sisters, is where we here in this congregation come in. We are here in this congregation, rather than at the swimming pool or at some seaside resort, because there really is more to life for us than "news, weather, and sports." We are here in this place today because we don't want a whiteout; we don't want an Emmaus road experience. We don't want to search and not see. We are here because we are looking for "wisdom and great treasures of knowledge, even hidden treasures." We are here because--quite literally--we are seeking the <i>word</i> of wisdom.<br><br>What, then, is the Word of Wisdom? Section 89 of the Doctrine and Covenants is usually regarded by Church members as the setting forth of the Lord's law of health. Mention Doctrine and Covenants 89 and one immediately thinks, "Word of Wisdom." Say "Word of Wisdom" and the subject of health quickly comes to mind. For some the word association with section 89 or the Word of Wisdom is even narrower--an abstinence from tea, coffee, tobacco, and alcohol. Of course each of these is important and correct--as far as it goes.<br><br>But there is more hidden in the spare syntax of section 89 than a <i>pro</i>scription of harmful substances or even a <i>pre</i>scription of a healthy diet. Beyond a mere declaration of principles of a healthy <i>life</i> is captured the essence of a <i>disciple's</i> life<i>style</i>--a mind-set, a personal <i>discipline--</i>that brings not only "health . . . and marrow to [one's] bones" but also "wisdom and great treasures of knowledge, even hidden treasures" (D&amp;amp;C 89:18–19).<br><br>Twice in his first epistle to the Corinthians, Paul referred to the body as a temple: "Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?" (1 Corinthians 3:16). As if for emphasis as well as for clarification, he later asked:<br><br><i>What? know ye not that your body is the</i> temple of the Holy Ghost<i> which is in you,</i> which ye have of God, and ye are not your own?<br><br>For ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God's. [1 Corinthians 6:19–20; emphasis added]<br><br>We really are not our own. We are the Father's. And we are the Son's. The First created us; the Latter saved us--"bought [us] with a price," to use Paul's words. These mortal tabernacles of ours are, in this critical phase of existence, like cars borrowed from the motor pool. We may use them. We may drive them fast or slow, here or there. We may race the engines. We may take them on the freeway. We may even go "off road" if we wish. We can keep them polished and well-tuned--or not. But ultimately each must be returned--temporarily, at least--until "title" is eventually passed to us in the Resurrection. And then--what will we have?<br><br>The answer to that question is not in the nature of the tabernacle itself. The Savior has already seen to that. Staying with the automobile metaphor for another moment, there will be no "jalopies" in that great day, no Edsels. Each will be a Rolls Royce, for "all things shall be restored to their proper and perfect frame" (Alma 40:23). No, the answer to the question--What will we have?--is not to be found in the chassis but in the "interior." The answer is to be found not in the <i>form</i> of the <i>tabernacle</i> but in the majesty of the <i>temple</i> inside.<br><br>Hence, in the here and now, wisdom is to be found not just in living a health code but in earnestly seeking to make the mortal tabernacle a temple to the Most High--a by-product of obedience to <i>all</i> the commandments. <i>For the "great treasures of knowledge, even hidden treasures" to be found are nothing less than the mysteries of godliness.</i><br><br>"But where shall wisdom be found? and where is the place of understanding?" (Job 28:12). That is how the ancient Job put it. It is a question for the ages. Wisdom's acquisition has occupied the attention of poets and prophets. Many have sought it; comparatively few have truly found it. Some have spent years and fortunes in gathering books and other artifacts of knowledge, and yet real wisdom has escaped them. Others--fishermen, shepherds, men of limited education, and a Carpenter--have possessed it.<br><br>In a world where illiteracy is in full retreat, where frontiers of knowledge seem to expand at warp speed, and where we are literally awash in information, why is <i>wisdom</i> so elusive? And why is it that the unlearned and unlettered are as likely to possess it--if not more so--as the educated and erudite? Like the prophet Elijah, who found not the Lord in the wind, the earthquake, or the fire, neither is the man of wisdom to be found encrusted with ciphers, bits, and bytes--no matter how voluminously gathered or prestigiously accumulated, and no matter how stunningly retrievable. The Lord has always been revealed by the "still small voice." And, in the words of the Psalmist, "the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom" (Psalm 111:10).<br><br>In biblical parlance, "fear of the Lord" means a profound reverence for Him. So, the honest seeker after wisdom must begin with a reverence for the Lord and be alert to His unique directional equipment.<br><br>Almost four decades ago, I was a newly commissioned lieutenant in the United States Army assigned to the U.S. Army Ranger School for qualification in what since has become known as "special operations"--long-range reconnaissance and combat patrols, commando raids, and elite infantry tactics. Several weeks of our training took place in the swamplands of Eglin Air Force Base in the western panhandle of Florida. Much of our training was at night in the swamps. I described that experience in an <i>Ensign</i> article as follows:<br><br><i>The swamp was pitch-black. Inky water, cold in the early spring, crept above our waists to our chests, bringing an incessant shiver. Mangrove trees scratched our faces and hands and pulled at our clothing, and submerged logs seemed to throw themselves in our path. An occasional slough opened under our feet, and suddenly we would be over our heads in the fetid water. Sodden clothing and equipment and heavy weapons seemed to weigh a ton, pulling us down into the murky bog.</i><br><br>From somewhere deep in the swamp an alligator bellowed. Deadly water moccasins silently slithered off nearby tree stumps into the water. The blackness of the night and the heaviness of the pungent, stagnant air was like a suffocating blanket. But [we] <i>moved steadily and surely toward our destination, our course clearly pointed by a diminutive device worth at most a few dollars in the marketplace but of immeasurable value to soldiers swallowed up in an alien wilderness--a lensatic compass. . . .</i><br><br>. . . Less than a year later I would find myself leading a platoon of infantry in the jungles and rice paddies of Southeast Asia. My experience in Vietnam would attest that of all the skills taught in Ranger School none was more important than the ability to read--and the confidence to follow--that simple little gadget, the compass. Even on the darkest night its luminous dial reliably pointed the route. No matter how hedged up the way, no matter how dangerous and foreboding the surroundings, the compass faithfully led to safety the soldier wise enough to follow its bearings. [Lance B. Wickman, "Of Compasses and Covenants," <i>Ensign,</i> June 1996, 37–38]<br><br>Father Lehi also knew something about the wilderness. In fact, for him life <i>was</i> a wilderness--literally. He also knew something of the lifesaving qualities of a reliable compass. The Liahona guided him--its bearings not coming from a magnetic field but rather through a function of "faith and diligence and heed" (1 Nephi 16:28).<br><br>But life for Lehi was also a <i>spiritual</i> wilderness, a circumstance that created "opposition in all things" (2 Nephi 2:11). This metaphoric "wilderness" and the spiritual orienteering to guide one safely through it is powerfully captured in Lehi's dream of the tree of life:<br><br><i>Methought I saw in my dream, a dark and dreary wilderness.</i><br><br>And it came to pass that I saw a man, and he was dressed in a white robe; and he came and stood before me.<br><br>And it came to pass that he spake unto me, and bade me follow him.<br><br>And it came to pass that as I followed him I beheld myself that I was in a dark and dreary waste.<br><br>And after I had traveled for the space of many hours in darkness, I began to pray unto the Lord that he would have mercy on me, according to the multitude of his tender mercies.<br><br>And it came to pass after I had prayed unto the Lord I beheld a large and spacious field.<br><br>And it came to pass that I beheld a tree, whose fruit was desirable to make one happy.<br><br>And it came to pass that I did go forth and partake of the fruit thereof; and I beheld that it was most sweet, above all that I ever before tasted. Yea, and I beheld that the fruit thereof was white, to exceed all the whiteness that I had ever seen.<br><br>And as I partook of the fruit thereof it filled my soul with exceedingly great joy. [1 Nephi 8:4–12]<br><br>In his dream, Lehi's "compass" was the Man in the white robe--the Savior. Notwithstanding the "dark and dreary waste" through which he was called to pass, Lehi's direction was clear and sure--marked for him by that Man who served as his Compass.<br><br>We in our day also desperately need a spiritual compass to point the way across the dark and dreary wastes that constitute the world and its influences through which we and our loved ones must of necessity pass in this mortal sphere.<br><br>Job answered his own question--Where is wisdom?--in these words: "Behold, the fear of the Lord, that is wisdom; and to depart from evil is understanding" (Job 28:28). The answer to that same question--Where is wisdom?--presented by Lehi's dream is the same. Wisdom and its eternal companion--understanding--come from following the Man in the white robe, even from a <i>profound reverence</i> for Him. The key to wisdom, therefore, is in knowing where to find Him and how to follow Him, notwithstanding the "dark and dreary waste[s]" and the "mists of darkness" (1 Nephi 8:7, 12:17; see also 1 Nephi 8:23) so prevalent and so potentially captivating!<br><br>We need not dwell long on a review of the mists and the wastes that hedge up our way. They are all too familiar to us all. In a recent address to the J. Reuben Clark Law Society, President Boyd K. Packer offered this compelling description of today's world:<br><br><i>Paul prophesied word by word and phrase by phrase, describing things exactly as they are now. I will quote from Paul's prophecy and check the words that fit our society:</i><br><br><i>This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come.</i><br><br>For men shall be lovers of their own selves--Check!<br><br><i>covetous--</i>Check!<br><br><i>boasters--</i>Check!<br><br><i>proud--</i>Check!<br><br><i>blasphemers--</i>Check!<br><br><i>disobedient to parents--</i>Check! Check!<br><br><i>unthankful--</i>Check!<br><br><i>unholy--</i>Check!<br><br><i>Without natural affection--</i>Check! Check!<br><br><i>trucebreakers--</i>Check!<br><br><i>false accusers--</i>Check!<br><br><i>incontinent--</i>Check!<br><br><i>fierce--</i>Check!<br><br><i>despisers of those that are good--</i>Check!<br><br><i>Traitors--</i>Check!<br><br><i>heady--</i>Check!<br><br><i>highminded--</i>Check!<br><br><i>lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God--</i>Check! Check!<br><br><i>Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof: from such turn away.</i><br><br>For of this sort are they which creep into houses, and lead captive silly women laden with sins, led away with divers lusts,<br><br>Ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.<br><br><i>(2 Timothy 3:1–7; emphasis added)</i><br><br>[Devotional given to the J. Reuben Clark Law Society at the Conference Center, Salt Lake City, 28 February 2004; "On the Shoulders of Giants," <i>Clark Memorandum,</i> fall 2004, 9]<br><br>Television, magazines, pulp novels, the Internet--these comprise a familiar litany of those media influences that thrust before us the vilest lusts and most insidious wiles of the adversary. Enticing and addicting, they cause many to lose their way--even "the very elect," as Jesus said (Matthew 24:24)--much as those seen by Lehi in his dream became lost in "an exceedingly great mist of darkness" (1 Nephi 8:23). Even our very homes are no longer an automatic refuge from such things. It is as though these mists aggressively chase us, like the ancient destroying angel, seeping in through cracks in the doors and the windows, over the transom, and across the threshold. They are before us with the single touch of a remote control button or a computer keystroke.<br><br>Like the ancient Israelites, our only protection is in the blood of the Lamb. But we are past the day when we can merely paint the blood of a sheep on our doorposts as protection against the onslaught of this modern destroying angel. Our devotion to the Lamb must be inscribed on the "fleshy tables of the heart" (2 Corinthians 3:3)--an endeavor more easily spoken of than accomplished in today's world.<br><br>Ominous is this insightful parenthetic observation about the members of the Church in Helaman's day:<br><br><i>And in the fifty and first year of the reign of the judges there was peace also, save it were the</i> pride <i>which began to enter into the church--</i>not into the church of God, but into the hearts of the people who professed to belong to the church of God. [Helaman 3:33; emphasis added]<br><br>Mormon seems to be describing an ancient church characterized by concentric circles. The outer circle circumscribed all who <i>professed membership</i> in the church; but only a smaller inner circle encompassed those who were truly "the church of God." Well might we ask whether such is true today. Are there some of us professing membership but, in a manner of speaking, with one foot in the world and the other on a banana peel? Are there some of us, titillated by worldly enticements, who seek to have both God and Mammon? Are there some of us in our present go-along-get-along culture who have slouched into a casualness about spiritual things? Some of us are like the ancient king of Israel, Jehu, who did much of what the Lord commanded "but . . . took no heed to walk in the law of the Lord God of Israel with <i>all</i> his heart: for [we are told] he departed not from the sins of Jeroboam" (2 Kings 10:31; emphasis added).<br><br>In such a state, our divine nature can be gradually enveloped and sedated in a creeping asphyxiation by a kind of spiritual carbon monoxide poisoning. We aren't bad people. We may even regard ourselves as good people. But the hard truth is that the near-invisible poison of our circumstance dulls our sensitivities. Like Lehi's Liahona, in such a state our spiritual compass will not function. The Man in the white robe becomes "whited out"--obscured from view. Wisdom eludes us.<br><br>In that circumstance, we are susceptible to being victimized by what could be called "ersatz" religion--a kind of inferior substitute or imitation for the real thing. Jesus warned of such as a defining characteristic of the latter days:<br><br><i>Then if any man shall say unto you, Lo, here is Christ, or there; believe it not.</i><br><br>For there shall arise false Christs, and false prophets, and shall shew great signs and wonders; insomuch that, if it were possible, they shall deceive the very elect. [Matthew 24:23–24]<br><br>Such pretenders have many faces, their ersatz doctrines many names. Some appear on stage in a doctrinal masquerade of sorts, costuming contemporary sociology in a kind of philosophical cheesecloth labeled "theology." Some emerge as a preoccupation with a warped perception of a single gospel principle. Some appear as doctrinaire political creeds. Some take the form of pricey seminars, conferences, and "touchy-feely" sensitivity sessions. Some are deceptively packaged at the movie theater--even as the purported story of the Atonement of Christ, but with an R rating! And so it goes. All of them carry a singular label: the philosophies of men mingled with scripture.<br><br>To my mind, influenced as it is by defining experiences in a war distant both in time and place, they represent a kind of jungle or swamp where men and women--good people--become lost. To such, ersatz religion becomes an entanglement of false notions--an immersing slough of counterfeit congregations. Fraudulent doctrines and ideas--like venomous snakes--poison and distort true gospel principles.<br><br>But a compass is available with a true azimuth back to firm ground! The Man in the white robe is still there to guide across the dark and dreary wastes to the eternal tree of life. Following the compass--the Man in the white robe--<i>that</i> is wisdom. <b>For wisdom is knowing </b><b><i>what</i></b><b> we worship and </b><b><i>how</i></b><b> we worship.</b><br><br>A most revealing insight is provided in section 93 of the Doctrine and Covenants. The section begins with these words:<br><br><i>Verily, thus saith the Lord: It shall come to pass that every soul who forsaketh his sins and cometh unto me, and calleth on my name, and obeyeth my voice, and keepeth my commandments, shall see my face and know that I am;</i><br><br>And that I am the true light that lighteth every man that cometh into the world;<br><br>And that I am in the Father, and the Father in me, and the Father and I are one. [D&amp;amp;C 93:1–3]<br><br>Jesus Christ is, literally, the Man in the white robe. He is the light, the beacon, the luminescent Compass that enlightens every soul coming into the world. He is the One who leads us back to the Father--our ultimate destination, the very tree of life--because Jesus is in the Father and the Father is in Him. Jesus is both the Way <i>and</i> the Destination. "Coming unto Christ" therefore means, quite literally, safely traversing the dark and dreary wastes of mortality to return safely home to the Father and the Son.<br><br>This, of course, is familiar doctrine. The challenge is in the practicalities of knowing <i>how</i> to come unto Christ, in knowing <i>how</i> to follow Him. The first verse of section 93 that I just read is a good summary of the practicalities: forsaking sin, calling on His name, obeying His voice, and keeping His commandments. But, like a carefully drawn topographic map, section 93 provides even more exacting reference points from which we can obtain our bearings. Quoting John the Revelator, it tells us something about how the mortal Jesus came unto His Father. John tells us, "He received not of the fulness at first, but continued from grace to grace, until he received a fulness" (D&amp;amp;C 93:13). Continuing, he said:<br><br><i>And I, John, bear record, and lo, the heavens were opened, and the Holy Ghost descended upon him in the form of a dove, and sat upon him, and there came a voice out of heaven saying: This is my beloved Son.</i><br><br>And I, John, bear record that he received a fulness of the glory of the Father;<br><br>And he received all power, both in heaven and on earth, and the glory of the Father was with him, for he dwelt in him. [D&amp;amp;C 93:15–17; emphasis added]<br><br>There was no "free pass" for Jesus in mortality. To ultimately accomplish the great Atonement whereby He descended below all things, He first had to experience mortality as other men do. As Paul put it, "Though he were a Son, yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered" (Hebrews 5:8). And so it was that in His early life, before the commencement of His public ministry, He proceeded "from grace to grace"--that is, from one plateau of wisdom and understanding to the next--until at the time of His baptism He "received a fulness of the glory of the Father; . . . for [the Father] dwelt in him." Jesus was always good; but in His earnest quest to come to know His Father under the conditions applicable in mortality, the doctrines and principles of the gospel distilled "upon [His] soul as the dews from heaven" (D&amp;amp;C 121:45) "here a little and there a little" (2 Nephi 28:30) until at last He reached a fulness.<br><br>Why is this important for us to know? Well, for one reason--also quoting Paul: "We have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin" (Hebrews 4:15). Jesus has been there. He <i>knows</i> what we face. But, more, in His very negotiation of the challenges of mortality He <i>becomes</i> the compass, the Man in the white robe! He knows the way across the dark and dreary waste because He has already covered that ground! It is familiar territory. Continuing in section 93, the Lord Himself teaches us the ultimate lesson:<br><br><i>I give unto you these sayings</i> [that is, regarding His own experience in growing from grace to grace] <i>that you may understand and know how to worship, and know what you worship, that you may come unto the Father in my name, and in due time receive of his fulness.</i><br><br>For if you keep my commandments you shall receive of his fulness, and be glorified in me as I am in the Father; therefore, I say unto you, you shall receive grace for grace. [D&amp;amp;C 93:19–20; emphasis added]<br><br>Jesus really is the Compass! Or, to use His own words, He is "the way, the truth, and the life" (John 14:6). And just as He proceeded from grace to grace, so may we. Understanding this dynamic process is knowing how and what to worship. And knowing how and what to worship, my dear friends--<i>that</i> is "fear of the Lord." <i>That</i> is reverence for the Lord. <i>That</i> is <i>wisdom!</i><br><br>Nowhere, in my judgment, is this pivotal truth better illustrated than in a well-known episode from the Book of Mormon. I refer to Alma and Amulek's mission of recovery among the apostate Zoramites. It was an unusual mission for a number of reasons. One of those reasons was that the Zoramites (or the residents of the city of Zoram) were already acquainted with gospel principles. These were not untutored barbarians like the Lamanites had been when Ammon and his brethren went among them. They were not a people ignorant of the ways of the Lord. Rather, we are told, the Zoramites were a people "<i>perverting</i> the ways of the Lord" (Alma 31:1; emphasis added). They were a people who had adopted an ersatz religion--a poor substitute for the genuine article.<br><br>At first blush their religion seems bizarre, even ridiculous; but if we reflect for a moment, we are brought to the sobering realization that their substitute religion was not so much different from what we see about us today. It began with a raised platform in the center of their synagogue. On a given day each week, those desiring to worship would go to the synagogue, and each in turn would stand upon the platform reciting the same catechism--a purported "prayer" that was quite self-congratulatory in nature. (For often, what is ersatz religion if not self-promoting?) These apostate Zoramites proclaimed themselves "holy" and "elect." They rejected the notion of a Christ in favor of a philosophy of predestination. These false doctrines--philosophies of men mingled with scripture--had so invested their minds that they were deep in the swamp of fraudulent persuasions.<br><br>Gamely, Alma and his brethren sought to lead them back to high ground, but the more affluent were not much interested. However, these missionaries began to have some success among the poorer class of people--those not permitted entrance to the synagogues. (Then, as now, affluence tended to be a breeding ground for ersatz religion; the poorer classes seldom have the time, means, or patience for it!) As Alma was teaching one day, a large group of these humbler Zoramites approached him. They had a single question and had appointed a spokesman to pose it to Alma. They asked where they should worship, having been excluded from the synagogues. Alma beheld them "with great joy," for he perceived that in their humility "they were in a preparation to hear the word" (Alma 32:6).<br><br>What follows is one of the greatest sermons ever preached on this dynamic process we call <i>worship</i>. It spans multiple chapters in the Book of Mormon and involved a sort of "tag-team" approach between Alma and Amulek. Alma begins by extolling the virtue of genuine humility as the seedbed for faith (which, of course, is the springboard for real worship). Humility, he says, brings repentance, which in turn produces a worshipful mind and heart. Then one must proceed "to an experiment upon [the word]" (Alma 32:27). Likening that experimentation to planting a seed, he says that one's faith ripens to knowledge as one feels the swelling within the breast as the Holy Ghost attests to the validity of the word. This in turn leads to further experimentation and more swelling until eventually one reaches a perfect knowledge or, in the words of section 93, "receive[s] a fulness of the glory of the Father."<br><br>This dynamic process is what it means to grow from grace to grace. This is what it means to worship. Often we refer to Alma's discourse as his great lecture on faith. And so it is. But even more profoundly it is his great lecture on <i>worship</i>. And there is more.<br><br>Citing an ancient prophet about whom we know little--Zenos--Alma teaches that we don't need to be in a synagogue or church building to worship (although it is important to go there regularly). We can worship by involving ourselves in this dynamic process of worship--or experimentation upon the word--anywhere: in the wilderness, in our fields, in our homes, in our very closets, indeed, in our congregations. In this process we can cry unto the Lord in the midst of our afflictions, and He will be there for us. He is the Man in the white robe; and He will lead us along across the "dark and dreary waste" if we will constantly involve ourselves in experimenting upon His word in an attitude of humility and repentance.<br><br>Then Alma sat down and Amulek arose, preaching one of the great sermons of any dispensation on the infinite and eternal Atonement. In effect he teaches that as we fix our attention on the Man in the white robe, who descended below all things as the "great and last sacrifice" (Alma 34:13), we become encircled about "in the arms of safety" (Alma 34:16). Echoing Alma's counsel, Amulek reiterates the dynamic process of worship and crying unto the Lord in all our places and circumstances. And then he adds this admonition:<br><br><i>And now behold, my beloved brethren, I say unto you, do not suppose that this is all; for after ye have done all these things, if ye turn away the needy, and the naked, and visit not the sick and afflicted, and impart of your substance, if ye have, to those who stand in need--I say unto you, if ye do not any of these things, behold, your prayer is vain, and availeth you nothing, and ye are as hypocrites who do deny the faith.</i><br><br>Therefore, if ye do not remember to be charitable, <i>ye are as dross, which the refiners do cast out, (it being of no worth) and is trodden under foot of men.</i> [Alma 34:28–29; emphasis added]<br><br>Thus these two great ministers of the gospel lay before us the three <i>C</i>s--commandments, covenants, and charity--that make up the dynamic process, a divine dynamic, that is real worship.<br><br>Knowing <i>how</i> to worship and <i>what</i> to worship is the very essence of wisdom, and such wisdom truly unlocks the door to "great treasures of knowledge, even hidden treasures." These treasures are what John refers to as "grace." Hence, proceeding "from grace to grace" is the steady accretion of knowledge of God as it becomes reflected in our countenances and our behavior. The greatest treasure of all--the ultimate treasure--is to eventually come to a fullness of knowledge. And, in the end, is not this Alma's point in describing the process of experimenting upon the word?<br><br>All of which returns us to where we began--a focus upon the word, even upon the <i>Word</i> of Wisdom. For we see that in its ultimate expression, the Word of Wisdom is to fully embrace "the Word" Himself--even the divine Compass, the Man in the white robe. Having "health in [the] navel and marrow to [the] bones" and being able to "run and not be weary" or to "walk and not faint"--these are significant blessings to be sure. But they are only transitory--for, in the poet's lyrical expression:<br><br><i>Our hearts, though stout and brave,</i><br><br>Still, like muffled drums, are beating<br><br>Funeral marches to the grave.<br><br>[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, "A Psalm of Life" (1839), stanza 4]<br><br>In the end, the only lasting manifestation of embracing the Word of Wisdom--of following the Man in the white robe--is to be found in the "great treasures of knowledge," the "hidden treasures," that are the mysteries of godliness and the "fulness of the glory of the Father" and of the Son.<br><br>But, for the moment, here we are in this mortal sphere metaphorically described by Lehi as the "dark and dreary waste." Who knows how many "graces" removed from our ultimate quest are we! Yet, wandering memory's halls there emerges for me from the reaches of the past another time, another place, another very real "dark and dreary waste" that has become a metaphor within a metaphor, a living reality of the shadows and periodic despairs of mortality enlightened by the beckoning reassurance of the Man in the white robe.<br><br>The year was 1966. The place was Vietnam. I was a platoon leader in an infantry battalion. I remember the night as though it were yesterday. Our battalion was attempting to move cross-country deep in enemy-controlled territory using armored personnel carriers. The expedition became a nightmare. The weight of these armored vehicles proved to be too great for the soft crust of the rice paddies. One after another, several of them sank deeply into the ooze. Mine was among them. Because of the high vulnerability to attack in the darkness of the hour, the battalion commander did not want to stop the entire column. So he left me--as the only officer among the numerous stranded vehicles--in command while the rest of the battalion moved on.<br><br>I shall never forget the feeling of abject loneliness. The night was literally as black as pitch. The marooned personnel carriers, each with a half-dozen soldiers aboard, were stretched across the alien and forbidding landscape for a quarter of a mile or more like so many small islands in a dark and sinister ocean. Not wanting to telegraph our plight to the enemy, who often were listening to our radio frequency, I determined to move from one carrier to the next to make personal contact with the men, coordinate our improvised defense, and offer reassurance. It was a dangerous and harrowing experience--a night fraught with an anxiety that even the passage of nearly 40 years has not erased!<br><br>But what I remember the most that night is the artillery. Thank heaven for the artillery! At my request the howitzer battery assigned to cover us fired several phosphorescent air bursts--registered concentrations to serve as reference points for artillery support in the event of an attack. As they split the oppressive gloom, those artillery bursts seemed to offer a mathematical, visible umbrella of reassurance that our location was known to our friends, that we would be all right, and that in due course morning would break. The long night dragged on, but, as it always does, dawn eventually came and with it our pathway to safety.<br><br>And so it is with us, my dear friends, ourselves at times seemingly marooned in a "dark and dreary waste." Always there is the Word--the Word of Wisdom, our eternal Reference Point, the Man in the white robe, our everlasting Compass--illuminating, reassuring, and beckoning us to those "hidden treasures," even "peace in this world, and eternal life in the world to come" (D&amp;amp;C 59:23).<br><br>Why are we here today instead of at the beach? We are here because we are truly seeking "wisdom and great treasures of knowledge, even hidden treasures." We are here because, in the end, for us there really is more to life than news, weather, and sports. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Lance B.

<h1>xcellent Way: A Changing BYU in a Changing World - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
It is a privilege to gather with and greet you today. I look forward to our Annual University Conference because, in many ways, it signals the start of another academic year and the beginning of yet another series of special adventures here at BYU.<br><br>For me a sense of time has always been a little tricky. It certainly is today.<br><br>In some respects it seems that so much has transpired since we last met in this setting that it must have been years ago. Nearly a year ago I was formally installed in my current position after a summer's "test drive." We have had two more commencement exercises, graduating thousands and replacing them with incoming students. We have had honored and valued associates retire, have welcomed impressive new faculty and staff in hopes of matching our incredible students, and have had both sorrow in the death of colleagues and loved ones and joy in the birth of new babies and other wonderful events. We have suffered through some disappointments and rejoiced in tremendous successes in virtually every area of the university. And yet we are here: stronger, more vibrant, and with even greater potential for the future. As I tally the events, it seems like we have been together a long time.<br><br>On the other hand, it also seems as if we gathered in our last Annual University Conference just days or possibly weeks ago. As I have thought about our beloved friend and mentor Elder Neal A. Maxwell in the days since his passing, I smile at his comment made in his later years that he could remember when summers were three months long! This summer has seemed very short.<br><br>We all must deal constantly with the realities of the present, but we must never forget the past--particularly when that history has been so significant in shaping us as an institution and positioning us for our current success. Nevertheless, it seems to me that we have a particular responsibility as a university generally and as Brigham Young University specifically to look carefully and thoughtfully to our future.<br><br>As I have considered my comments for today and our directions for the coming year, it has seemed to me that two notions, quite separate in some respects, intertwine as we think about our unique situation at Brigham Young University. The first is that BYU is a changing university in a changing world. The second is that both change and order must be reflected in our thinking and considerations if we are to accomplish the purposes for our existence as a university. It is clear that much around us is changing and that we must often be both proactive and reactive in response. It is also apparent that, for us, some important things do not and cannot change. It behooves us always to be clear about these distinctions.<br><br>Although it is true that the past is only the prologue to the future, it is also true that our strength and potential have been and are deeply rooted in our past and the prophecies made about BYU. I mention this because, although many institutions of higher learning feel that they can excel only by escaping or even repudiating their roots and history, we are grateful to be at a place where our past lights the way to our future excellence if we are willing to do our parts. BYU was originally established not for what it might do in its first years or decades but especially because of what it must do now and in future years. The vision was clear at the beginning and it remains clear today as we attempt to travel through the waves and shoals of rapidly changing seas. It is comforting and necessary to understand things that must change as well as things that will never change.<br><br>In this context the Apostle Paul coined the phrase "a more excellent way" (1 Corinthians 12:31). Without the need to disown or apologize for what we have thus far done, we acknowledge that a fundamental principle is the need to seek and follow "a more excellent way."<br><br>All of the gospel gifts, attitudes, and principles articulated by Paul are appropriate for our consideration. For example, he described a diversity "of gifts" and "differences of administrations" (1 Corinthians 12:4–5). I do not believe that he had the Development Office or the Smoot Building in mind as he discussed gifts and administration, but he does describe much about the ideal university. Said he: "For as the body is one, and hath many members, and all the members of that one body, being many, are one body: so also is Christ" (1 Corinthians 12:12). All of us have differences in our gifts, strengths, and weaknesses, but we are all to be one and one with Christ.<br><br>As BYU strives to be "one," meaning united and pulling together, we recognize that we have many members: more than 33,000 students, 1,600 faculty, and 2,500 administrative and staff personnel. We have our own interests, personalities, preferences, strengths, and weaknesses, but we are also "one body" in that we share in a common mission to achieve academic excellence in the context of nurturing our testimonies of God the Eternal Father and His Son, the resurrected Jesus Christ, and of the reality of the restoration of the gospel through the Prophet Joseph Smith. This commonality of faith and testimony--together with our joined commitment to scholarly excellence in each of our disciplines and our commitment to the learning and teaching of our wonderful students--provides the basis for the "oneness" we seek and experience.<br><br>We are not really the same, except in the most important things. I am grateful when those with gifts and talents I do not have share them. Sharon and I have been warmed and blessed by your thoughtfulness and generosity. We have been welcomed and are now at home. Thanks to so many of you for your roles in our acceptance. And thanks also for being who and what you are.<br><br>As many of you know, at my inauguration in September 2003 President Hinckley gave us a charge to help BYU become the best it could be.<br><br>Perhaps with the goal of teaching correct principles but wanting us to govern ourselves, the prophet did not specify how or when we were to be the best or by what measure we are meant to be the best. He is the chairman of our board of trustees and the Lord's prophet. As a result, I have spent many hours reflecting on how we might merit his approval and meet his expectations and encouragement. Most of you have also thought about this, and I have benefited from your observations and counsel.<br><br>I confess that I still have not been at BYU long enough to know all the answers, and I hope that day never comes. If it does, in my mind then it will be time for me to leave. I hope you know that part of the reason for retaining my ignorance in some important areas is so that I can still legitimize my presence here. I love being at BYU!<br><br>I believe my previous university experience, now being supplemented, honed, and enlarged on this wonderful campus, allows me to have some feeling for a few of the questions we should be asking. I believe it is consistent with gospel principles that inspiration can occur bottom-up as well as top-down. By that I mean that the best insights often come from those closest to the issue being considered. Given that a wider perspective may occasionally also be useful, it is optimal when the streams of inspiration converge on common ground with all those involved. In the spirit of sharing ideas that may provoke or supplement your own, let me provide a context for my sense of some of our challenges and opportunities at a changing BYU--challenges and opportunities that will position us to be even better in fulfilling our roles within a changing worldwide Church and a rapidly changing world.<br><h2><b>Changing World</b></h2><br>If I may, let me mention some world changes that are shaping our futures. You will be able to think of many such examples.<br><br>First, amidst very dramatic shifts in global population concentrations, Christianity is moving southward (see Philip Jenkins, <i>The Next Christendom: The Coming of Global Christianity</i> [New York: Oxford University Press, 2002]). Many people, including Christians, from the Southern Hemisphere are moving north, but the growth of the Christian faiths is progressing most quickly and remarkably in the Southern Hemisphere--including Latin America, Africa, and Asia. Our Church is no exception, and the worldwide Church of the relatively near future is likely to be more "southern," less formally educated, less materially well off, and less Caucasian. No wonder President Hinckley was prompted to begin the Perpetual Education Fund.<br><br>Some developed countries, particularly in Europe, are seeing a drop in total population with very low birth rates and yet an influx of immigrants, mainly non-Christians, primarily from the south. The ethnic demographics of many nations are changing, including those of the USA. At the same time, many of the lesser-developed nations continue to have impressive population growth without always having the infrastructure to support and sustain their people.<br><br>Demographic shifts may bring the two great world religions of Christianity and Islam into increasing contact. We see evidence of confrontation in many places and cooperation in few. Perhaps in Africa we see the clearest beginnings of the battle for the souls of these people. With all of the obvious problems facing the developing world, family and other basic values may be more intact in Africa than in some Western and urban situations.<br><br>Second, resource and environmental management will likely focus not so much on finding energy sources, food, and useable water as it will on efforts to see these resources allocated and distributed appropriately (see Center for Strategic and International Studies [CSIS], Seven Revolutions, "Resource Management," at www.7revs.org/Resources/res2.htm). I'm told that some estimates indicate that population growth and increasing standards of living will double food consumption around the world in the next 30 years.<br><br>As many of us travel, we are frequently reminded of how fortunate we are with respect to our material circumstances in addition to our spiritual environment at BYU. It should give us pause that well over half the world's population subsists for a day or longer on less than what many of us spend for a quick lunch at the Cougareat. It is understandable and natural that our Church leaders, who travel the world constantly, are very much aware of the abundance we enjoy at this university. Although we could always use more resources to advance our work, we must also constantly think of how we can do more and be better with what we already have. I believe, and I have mentioned this before, that most often our limitations in our quests for excellence are not money or resource related. Rather, we limit ourselves with a lack of faith, imagination, or just hard work.<br><br>President Hinckley has invited us to think of what we will stop doing when we propose a new initiative. As I share his counsel with you, I ask that we do an even better job of balancing. We can do so by carefully shortening the list of good new things we want to start and thoughtfully adding to the list of those things still good but perhaps no longer of top priority. I express appreciation to and admiration for those who make things work well for our students. I have been particularly impressed with many of you in our latest cycle of university resource planning who are so clearly concerned about and dedicated to our students.<br><br>A third area of staggering world change with huge implications for all of us involves technology and the diffusion of knowledge and information (see CSIS, www.7refs.org/Technology/tech2.htm). These changes and expansions are occurring at a revolutionary--not evolutionary--pace. For example, changes in computation, genomics, and nanotechnology are reshaping materials science, chemistry, and physics--not to mention biology, engineering, medicine, and other disciplines.<br><br>This is one reason why BYU is investing as we are in the people and equipment relating to keeping on the advancing edge of relevant technology. We can't do all that we would like to do in this area, and it is only one of several that vies for our precious and scarce resources. By the way, in addition to the obvious merits and necessities of these endeavors, we must measure what we do by its potential contribution to advancing meaningful teaching and research across the university that supports, enriches, and particularly benefits our students.<br><br>We share much in common with other universities in this country and elsewhere as we analyze and study these trends and others I might mention. These changes have obvious impact on what we need to do and what we need to become. None of our disciplines are static and several are changing very rapidly. Although I maintain significant interest in my own professional discipline, my attention to other pressing and important matters these last few years has left me obsolete in places where my knowledge and skills were close to the advancing edge fairly recently. As with individuals, universities also quickly face obsolescence when they fail to continue to change, grow, and adapt to their new and often rapidly different environments. This is why lifelong learning is such an important BYU aim and why we must consider these issues thoughtfully even when they stretch us beyond our comfort zones.<br><br>BYU, like all vibrant living organisms, is changing and must change in some significant ways. As I discuss the modifications in our landscape though, we of all people must never forget that some things--our fundamentals and our "charted course"--do not and will not vary (see J. Reuben Clark, "The Charted Course of the Church in Education," talk given at Aspen Grove, 8 August 1938).<br><h2><b>Some Basic Questions</b></h2><br>Of the many important issues we could pursue, I introduced to key academic and staff leaders on campus last spring some questions I think are basic. There are many more that could be appropriately asked, but the ones I posed in our leadership retreat relate to standards, measurement, resources, faculty, and students. Let me mention each of these briefly because I wish to invite the entire campus community to engage in thinking about and discussing these kinds of inquiries in the months ahead.<br><br>By standards, I mean we need to consider questions such as these:<br><br>• How does BYU determine which external or nationally normative standards deserve our attention and effort in our quest to excel?<br><br>• How do we define our own or internal standards that will lead us to become the best we can be?<br><br>In this context, measurement includes issues such as the following:<br><br>• What are the most significant tangible measures of our success in achieving our mission and aims?<br><br>• How do we estimate or evaluate the intangible measures?<br><br>• How do we align these measures with our efforts to bless and benefit our students? After all, they are the reason the rest of us are here!<br><br>As we think of resources, questions such as the following come to mind:<br><br>• How do we prioritize our finite resources to accomplish our mission and aims?<br><br>• What are appropriate resources for us to seek? Which are not appropriate?<br><br>• How do we plan and prioritize resources in light of BYU's role as part of the kingdom with responsibilities unique to us?<br><br>Among our most precious resources are our faculty and staff. Thus we ask:<br><br>• Who will be the new faculty we recruit? How will we decide?<br><br>• What will be their qualifications?<br><br>• How will faculty FTEs be allocated or reallocated?<br><br>• How will we address such issues as rank and continuing status?<br><br>• How will we address teaching, mentoring, research, and citizenship work loads?<br><br>• How will we address changing faculty expectations as the university continues to change to become the best we can be?<br><br>Our reason for being here is our students, and they must be the beneficiaries of all that we do.<br><br>• Who will be the new students we admit?<br><br>• Are current selection criteria and procedures appropriate and adequate?<br><br>• How do we achieve excellence without being inappropriately exclusive?<br><br>• How will we serve (or will we?) "late bloomers" or nontraditional students?<br><br>• How will we fulfill our responsibilities to international students and the worldwide Church?<br><h2><b>Opportunities for Dialogue and Enlightenment</b></h2><br>You will all be able to think of additional, important categories of concern as well as multiple questions in each area. I encourage you to do so and to discuss them among colleagues and the administration. In addition, we will attempt to encourage inquiry and discussion via a number of various fora in the months ahead. These will include regularly scheduled events such as our leadership retreats and, in addition, some special gatherings to be developed shortly. Also, we will look to expand our dialogue and understanding of the changing world that I have addressed so superficially in my comments today. We have many on our campus who will be able to contribute very significantly in this respect. We will also have guests of many perspectives and experiences with us to strengthen our opportunities for enlightenment. This is an important part of the work of a university such as ours. We will have more to say about these matters as we work with you in the weeks ahead.<br><h2><b>Current Situations and Directions</b></h2><br>Let me now, in the remaining minutes allotted to me, share some perceptions of our current situation and direction as I see them. I will attempt to do what I ask of each of you: try hard to consolidate what I really know and what I believe while keeping an open mind and heart as we learn together about some of the details and new or changing opportunities and responsibilities that we face. Time permits a brief overview of three areas and then a few comments on the notion of order and change that I mentioned at the outset.<br><h2><b>Downtown Salt Lake Center</b></h2><br>One of the significant changes that we face is what I perceive to be a unique opportunity for BYU quite unlike any that we have had before. Because we are in the early stages, there are many details not known--at least to me. Further, the ground rules and circumstances are new to all of us here at BYU. I speak of the new BYU downtown Salt Lake Center. Let me tell you briefly what I do know and what I do not know and then share some possible implications and opportunities for us.<br><br>As is now widely known, President Hinckley announced last fall that a new campus would be located adjacent to the Church headquarters complex in downtown Salt Lake City. This campus will house the LDS Business College (now located a few blocks east on South Temple Street); the BYU Salt Lake Center (currently located on Highland Drive in the Holladay area); and some new or expanded BYU programs. Recently the Church has acquired the Triad Center buildings located on the city block between North and South Temple Streets and between 300 and 400 West. Tentative plans currently call for our initial occupancy of some of this space for these programs. It is our understanding from the trustees that although BYU will be colocated with the LDS Business College, each will remain separate entities with distinct institutional identities--as is currently the case. Although we hope to be able to share some classrooms and support services, the clearly different missions of these two institutions will be maintained.<br><br>Likewise, although there will be a significant expansion of BYU activities on the Salt Lake campus, this does not signal the creation of a new or separate institution. What we do will be part of BYU here in Provo and will be coordinated with and through our current academic structure. Because we will be on the Church campus, some of the support services will be provided by the Church rather than through our excellent people in Provo. Our current Salt Lake Center programs will generally continue to operate as they do now, with the understandable adjustments that occur in any organization over time and with changes that become appropriate.<br><br>The major and new difference that will be immediately obvious and substantive will be the location on the Salt Lake site of programs that we have thus far described as "clusters." They will be part of established colleges or schools here on the Provo campus. Although exactly who or what will be there is not yet fully clear, it is likely that there will be business and education clusters in addition to others over time.<br><br>Several dimensions of this new effort are unique. The first is that this project is being carried out at the direction of the First Presidency as part of their strategy to enrich, enliven, and preserve central downtown Salt Lake City. They approached us rather than our taking a proposal to the board of trustees, which is the usual procedure when BYU embarks on a new or expanded enterprise. The second dimension has to do with the criteria that have been receiving consideration in the decision as to whom will be the most likely candidates to locate there. Basically, the following are among the measures that affect the decision:<br><br>1. Is there a demand for the program on the part of BYU students that is currently not being met?<br><br>2. Does the college or school have the excellence, capacity, and willingness to have an expanded program if appropriate resources are made available?<br><br>3. Is there a high demand, currently unmet, for graduates in the area in question?<br><br>4. Will the cluster be able to function with relatively large numbers of students without the need for extensive space or unique, expensive equipment?<br><br>5. Are there sound academic reasons, even advantages, for our students to be located in downtown Salt Lake City?<br><br>Other considerations will also apply. These include things we can do to be good citizens in the city and also to avoid where possible becoming an additional threat or distraction to Salt Lake Community College, Westminster College, the University of Utah, and other institutions with a stake in Salt Lake City.<br><br>Most of our BYU academic programs can satisfy some of the criteria. Indeed, all of our limited enrollment programs can. But at the start we will be limited in the numbers we can accommodate in Salt Lake City. Likewise, disciplines that require large amounts of specialized space, have a low density of students in their academic space, or require expensive equipment and laboratories are not considered to be particularly good fits at this time. There will be more on this later, and even more of our faculty and staff will be broadly and deeply involved in the months and years ahead.<br><h2><b>Reaffirmation of University Accreditation</b></h2><br>On a different but important topic, let me remind all of us that we are now in the final two years leading up to our next round of accreditation. I believe most of us would not list the work and effort attendant to the accreditation process near the top on our agenda of things we most enjoy doing. Nevertheless, the exercise is essential as we attempt to maintain and, where possible, enhance the stature and reputation of BYU in the broad educational community. In addition, the necessity of self-examination, which is part of the process, is essential if we are to be the best we can be.<br><br>I have been involved with accreditation activities in various ways for more than 30 years. Although there is much that I would like to be different, one change seems very positive to me and to the advantage of Brigham Young University. There was a time when virtually all the criteria for success of an institution in meeting its goals and responsibilities were externally imposed. That is, we were judged on the basis of what others thought we should be rather than on what we are striving to accomplish.<br><br>Although sometimes subtle, the change is dramatic for places like BYU. Now we are basically asked to identify clearly who we are and what we expect to accomplish. We then are measured by our own standards. Although this seems to be a very welcome and appropriate change in attitude and direction, it is not without pitfalls.<br><br>In the "old days" when we might fall short in a particular area or activity, we could say, sometimes with justification, that this measure should not really apply to us because we are so different.<br><br>In our current environment we have in large part identified who we are and the measures to be used. The expectation is that we will be and do what we say we are and will accomplish. We must be both consistent and have complete integrity with our aims, mission, and selfdescriptions. No longer can we hide--except in a few limited ways--behind the notion that because we are different we do not require or deserve the scrutiny of others. In fact, it is part of our mission to represent this university broadly, and the accreditation process will be helpful in doing so. Nevertheless it is demanding, sometimes grueling work, and I express appreciation to the very many in our BYU community who are and will work so hard to see this process through to a wonderfully positive conclusion.<br><br>In all of this we will be working on the issues of standards, measures, resources, faculty, and students for our own purposes, but the activities will meld well with our accreditation efforts. In addition, we will be working even more vigorously and in more focused ways with our loyal alumni and generous supporters and friends.<br><h2><b>Loyal Alumni, Generous Supporters, and Friends</b></h2><br>We look to these groups for financial support and without apology will continue to court, pursue, and ask for their treasure. Beyond financial contributions, however, we are also learning much from them about their experiences with us. Many will know that we do extensive surveys of our graduates and alumni and are able to use their experiences and perceptions, for example, to improve our administrative processes, our counseling and advisement of students, and the interactions students have with faculty out of class.<br><br>For many years the building program has been an important part of BYU priorities. I suspect that this will always be the case because our needs for renovations and new facilities remain at a high level. I am impressed with the science and precision that go into the assessment and planning for our physical facilities. We are very close to completing the wonderful new Joseph F. Smith Building, which will be such a tremendous asset to our campus. We are finishing the new athletic complex and are on schedule in our student housing projects. We also are preparing for the next steps in the continued upgrading of our campus and buildings.<br><br>As important as these facility issues are, I mentioned on my arrival a wish that persists today. That is, that our "soft" infrastructure will receive the attention it needs so that our academic and student programs will match in their quality and availability the magnificent physical resources we enjoy. Much of the dialogue I cited and invited earlier will relate to this broad notion of helping us be the best we can be.<br><h2><b>Order and Change</b></h2><br>As I have described some of the changes in the world and at BYU, it is important to note that I do not believe our era is unique only because we are involved in rapid changes. Think of where we are and from whence we have come. The changes in BYU during its history have been dramatic, positive, and almost unimaginable when we think of what has transpired since 1875. Perhaps the greatest difference is that we no longer need to worry about the survival of our great university but rather primarily how to make it better. That is a great change, and our progress has been truly and wonderfully amazing to this point.<br><br>As we think about and work toward our continuing progress, I believe a statement by Alfred North Whitehead applies to us: "The art of progress is to preserve order amid change, and to preserve change amid order" (<i>Process and Reality: An Essay in Cosmology</i> [New York: Free Press, 1978], 339; part 5, chapter 1, section 3). BYU is a place of both change and order, and we must always be clear about which is which.<br><br>As I have stated, much of what we do to anticipate, accommodate, and master change is not unlike what is going on at other great universities. What we do with respect to order may also be consistent with the orderly efforts of others.<br><br>In another respect, the "order" at Brigham Young University is absolutely unique because it refers not just to policy, procedure, and practice but also refers to "the order of the priesthood" (D&amp;amp;C 94:6) under which we were established and by which we are governed and supported today. In a day when higher education has been largely secularized, even at nominally religious institutions, BYU is closer to its sponsoring Church than it has ever been--and it has always been close.<br><br>Although we still receive the majority of our financial support, and many other resources as well, from the Church, we are now in a position to contribute significantly to the kingdom in ways that were not possible even a generation ago. We have continued to provide a superb BYU education to faithful members and select others as we have from the beginning, but now we are also able to establish contacts and exert influences that have a potentially positive impact on and for the entire Church. I mention only a few examples of the many that are easily identified: BYU-TV, the combined Church and BYU data center, the work in preserving ancient religious texts, and the contributions of those who promote religious liberty. Just as we ask our students to "give back" to the university after they finish here, it is wonderful that we, in various ways, can "give back" to the Church that sponsors, strengthens, and supports us so well.<br><br>We know who we are. We know that we have made the commitment to do our parts in advancing scholarly excellence while lifting and strengthening the faith and testimonies of our students. Without apology, we affirm the supremacy of Deity, the reality of the Restoration unfolded through the Prophet Joseph, and our allegiance to today's presiding high priests who are also the officers of our board of trustees.<br><br>As I conclude, let me again express thanks to all who make BYU what it is and are committed to doing their parts in helping our university become what it should and must become. I am firm in my conviction that our work is the Lord's work when we truly focus on His agenda and not our own. I invoke the blessings of heaven on us all in this wonderful, new academic season. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Cecil O.

<h1>Triumph, and a Wedding Feast: the Last Days - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I want to excuse Sister Holland tonight. She would have dearly loved being with us, but she is in Houston, Texas, tonight, helping with a brand-new granddaughter born to our daughter and son-in-law there. If those of you gathered in Houston turn around slowly and look near the back of the room, you may see a cute little grandmother hiding on the back row pretending to be an institute student. Now I know full well how young she looks, brethren, but please, she is already taken. I appreciate her support there just as much as if she were here at my side tonight. I bring you her love, and only such duty as grandmothers have at such times would keep her from being here with us. "Hermana Holland, te amo."<br><br>As many of you know, Sister Holland and I have just returned from a two-year assignment in Chile, where, like so many of you tonight are doing, we sat with young adults and institute students in stake centers half a world away, receiving these broadcasts far from Church headquarters. We too felt the Spirit of the Lord and the love of our leaders. We especially felt the fellowship of thousands around the world, like you, who were the same age, shared the same faith, and wanted the same things for a full and happy future.<br><br>I come tonight very mindful of my young friends in Chile but equally mindful of all our other friends around the world--in England and France, in Korea and Japan, in Australia and Nigeria and the Ukraine, to say nothing of the legions of you gathered throughout North America. <i>Bienvenidos</i> to all of you, whatever language you speak, and please know that I love you. There is such strength in our numbers. I pray for the Spirit and blessings of the Lord to be upon all of us and earnestly desire that what I say will be of some value to each of you.<br><h2><b>Terror</b></h2><br>I want to speak to you tonight in the context of ongoing anxiety in the world and some of the challenges we face at home and abroad. Of course there have always been challenges in every age and dispensation, but yesterday--September 11--was the third anniversary of a violent and near-unimaginable event that rocked the whole world. Indeed, the aftermath of that act has dramatically and perhaps permanently affected many of the ways in which the world now lives. Perhaps with such an anniversary yesterday, the fears and concerns of our modern times are still in your hearts today.<br><br>In any case, certainly our neighbors--the citizens of the nations to which we are beaming this broadcast tonight--have, since September 11, 2001, been dangling off balance, have been made more fearful, and have been alarmed by international events and the almost wholesale new use of the word <i>terror.</i> Not many years ago that word was reserved almost entirely for B-grade movie advertisements and Stephen King novels. Now, sadly, it is daily fare in our newspapers and so common in conversation that even young children, including the schoolchildren in Russia, are conscious that the world in which we live can be brutally, criminally affected by people called "terrorists." And there are other disasters of other kinds, natural and otherwise, documented in the news that remind us that life can be fragile, that life can present fateful turns of events.<br><h2><b>The Last Days</b></h2><br>Against that backdrop, I know that many of you have wondered in your hearts what all of this means regarding the end of the world and your life in it. Many have asked, "Is this the hour of the Second Coming of the Savior and all that is prophesied surrounding that event?" Indeed, sometime not long after 9-11, I had a missionary ask me in all honesty and full of faith, "Elder Holland, are these the last days?" I saw the earnestness in his face and some of the fear in his eyes, and I wanted to be reassuring. I thought perhaps an arm around him and some humor could relieve his anxiety a little. Giving him a hug, I said, "Elder, I may not be the brightest person alive, but even I know the name of the Church." We then talked about being <i>Latter-day</i> Saints. I said, "Yes, Elder, we are in the last days, but there is really nothing new about that. The promised Second Coming of the Savior began with the First Vision of the Prophet Joseph Smith in 1820. So we already have about 184 years of experience seeing the Second Coming and the last days unfold. We can be certain that we are in the last days--years and years of them," I said, and gave him a friendly shake of the hand and sent him on his way.<br><br>He smiled, seemed more reassured to put all this in some context, and went on his way. I assume he has long since finished a successful mission and is now happily at home getting on with his life, perhaps even sitting in this audience somewhere looking for a wife! (He'd better be.)<br><br>I hasten to say that I <i>do</i> know what this young man was really asking. What he really meant was, "Will I finish my mission? Is there any point in getting an education? Can I hope for a marriage? Do I have a future? Is there any happiness ahead for me?" And I say to all of you what I said three years ago to him: "Yes, certainly--to all those questions."<br><br>As far as the actual timing of the final, publicly witnessed Second Coming itself and its earthshaking events, I do not know when that will happen. Furthermore, President Gordon B. Hinckley has said that <i>he</i> doesn't know when it will happen, and that is because <i>no one</i> knows when it will happen. The Savior said that even the angels in heaven would not know (see Matthew 24:36).<br><br>We should watch for the signs and read the meaning of the seasons, we should live as faithfully as we possibly can, and we should share the gospel with everyone so that blessings and protections will be available to all. But we cannot and must not be paralyzed just because that event and the events surrounding it are out there ahead of us somewhere. We cannot stop living life. Indeed, we should live life more fully than we have ever lived it before. After all, this is the dispensation of the <i>fulness</i> of times.<br><br>I say this because in recent times--post 9-11 times, I suppose--I have heard very fearful and even dismal opinions coming from some in your age group regarding the questions that missionary had in mind. I have heard some of <i>you</i> say that <i>you</i> wonder whether there is any purpose in going on a mission or getting an education or planning for a career if the world we live in is going to be so uncertain. I have even heard sweethearts say, "We don't know whether we should get married in such uncertain times."<br><br>Worst of all, I have heard reports of some newlyweds questioning whether they should bring children into a terror-filled world on the brink of latter-day cataclysms. May I tell you that, in a way, those kinds of attitudes worry me more than Al-Qaeda worries me.<br><br>I have just two things to say to any of you who are troubled about the future. I say it lovingly and from my heart.<br><br>First, we must <i>never,</i> in <i>any</i> age or circumstance, let fear and the father of fear (Satan himself) divert us from our faith and faithful living. There have <i>always</i> been questions about the future. Every young person or every young couple in every era has had to walk by faith into what has <i>always</i> been some uncertainty--starting with Adam and Eve in those first tremulous steps out of the Garden of Eden. But that is all right. This is the plan. It will be okay. Just be faithful. God is in charge. He knows your name and He knows your need.<br><br><i>Faith</i> in the Lord Jesus Christ--that is the first principle of the gospel. We must go forward, as it says in K. Newell Dayley's hymn commemorating our pioneers of the past, "with faith in ev'ry footstep."<sup>1</sup> But like those pioneers, you do have to keep taking them--one step and then another and then the next. That is how tasks are accomplished, that is how goals are achieved, and that is how frontiers are conquered. In more divine language, that is how worlds are created and it is how <i>your</i> world will be created.<br><br>God expects you to have enough faith and determination and enough trust in Him to keep moving, keep living, keep rejoicing. In fact, He expects you not simply to <i>face</i> the future (that sounds pretty grim and stoic); He expects you to embrace and <i>shape</i> the future--to love it and rejoice in it and delight in your opportunities.<br><br>God is anxiously waiting for the chance to answer your prayers and fulfill your dreams, just as He always has. But He can't if you don't pray, and He can't if you don't dream. In short, He can't if you don't believe.<br><br>Drawing upon my vast background of children's bedtime stories, I say you can pick your poultry. You can either be like Chicken Little and run about shouting "The sky is falling; the sky is falling" or you can be like the Little Red Hen and forge ahead with the productive tasks of living, regardless of who does or doesn't help you or who does or doesn't believe just the way you believe.<br><br>So much for farmyard stories! How about two scriptures, both directed at those who live in perilous times?<br><br>The first is from section 101 of the Doctrine and Covenants. If you recall, this revelation came as the Saints who were gathered in Missouri were suffering great persecution--were at the very height of their persecution. Mobs had driven them from their homes. Hostility, even hatred, followed them from county to county as they sought refuge. These frightened Saints lost land, livestock, clothing, furniture, crops, and a host of personal possessions. Threats of death were heard every day. I suppose, at its worst, this was the most difficult and dangerous time--may I say "terror-filled"--that the Church had ever known. Later on names like Haun's Mill and Liberty Jail would take their place in our vocabulary forever.<br><br>Yet in that frightening time the Lord said to His people:<br><br><i>Let your hearts be comforted concerning Zion; for all flesh is in mine hands; be still and know that I am God.</i><br><br>Zion shall not be moved out of her place, notwithstanding her children are scattered.<br><br>They that remain, and are pure in heart, shall return, and come to their inheritances, they and their children, with songs of everlasting joy, to build up the waste places of Zion--<br><br>And all these things that the prophets might be fulfilled. [D&amp;amp;C 101:16–19]<br><br>So, my young friends, let your hearts be comforted concerning Zion. And remember the most fundamental definition of Zion we have ever been given: those who are "pure in heart" (D&amp;amp;C 97:21). If you will keep your hearts pure, you and your children and your grandchildren shall sing songs of everlasting joy as you build up Zion--and you shall not be moved out of your place.<br><br>The other verse I refer to is from the Savior, spoken to His disciples as He faced His crucifixion and as they faced fear, disarray, and persecution. Talk about troubled times! In His last collective counsel to them in mortality, and knowing full well what lay ahead for Him and for them, He said: "These things I have spoken unto you, that in me ye might have peace. In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world" (John 16:33).<br><br>So, in a world of tribulation--and there will always be plenty of it--let's remember our faith. Let's recall the <i>other</i> promises and prophecies that have been given, all the reassuring ones, and let's live life more fully, with more boldness and courage than at any other time in our history.<br><br>Christ has overcome the world and made straight a path for us in the wilderness. He has said to us in our day: "Gird up your loins and be prepared. Behold, the kingdom is yours, and the enemy shall not overcome" (D&amp;amp;C 38:9). So let's gird up. Let's get some gusto into singing those songs of everlasting joy.<br><h2><b>Triumph</b></h2><br>That leads directly to the other related point I want to make regarding the day in which you and I live. In times of anxiety we tend to focus pretty much (like my young missionary friend did) on the "Latter-day" part of that title.<br><br>But tonight I issue a call to each of you to concentrate on the "Saint" portion of that phrase. That is the element in our Church title that should be demanding our attention. Think of the blessings we enjoy. Think of the remarkable age in which we live. Think of the economic and educational, scientific and spiritual blessings we have that <i>no</i> <i>other</i> era or people in the history of the world have ever had, and then consider the responsibility we have to live worthily in our moment in time.<br><h2><b>This Great Dispensation</b></h2><br>We are making our appearance on the stage of mortality in the greatest dispensation of the gospel ever given to mankind, and we need to make the most of it.<br><br>Here is a favorite quote of mine from the Prophet Joseph Smith:<br><br><i>The building up of Zion is a cause that has interested the people of God in every age; it is a theme upon which prophets, priests and kings have dwelt with peculiar delight; they have looked forward with joyful anticipation to the day in which we live; and fired with heavenly and joyful anticipations they have sung and written and prophesied of this our day; ... we are the favored people that God has</i> [chosen] <i>to bring about the Latter-day glory.</i><sup>2</sup><br><br>Note this similar affirmation from Wilford Woodruff in 1894. Perhaps I do not need to remind you of the staggering challenges President Woodruff faced. Those years here in the West were, I suppose, every bit as fearful in their own way as were the ones I described in Missouri: prophets in seclusion, apostles in prison, fear (in President Woodruff's words) "that the whole nation" was turning against our people, preparing to "make war upon" the Church.<sup>3</sup><br><br>Nevertheless, President Woodruff said in the midst of such troubles:<br><br><i>The Almighty is with this people. We shall have all the revelations that we will need, if we will do our duty and obey the commandments of God. ... While I ... live I want to do my duty. I want the Latter-day Saints to do their duty. ... Their responsibility is great and mighty. The eyes of God and all the holy prophets are watching us. This is the great dispensation that has been spoken of ever since the world began. We are gathered together ... by the power and commandment of God. We are doing the work of God. ... Let us fill our mission.</i><sup>4</sup><br><br>Lastly, let me share this from President Hinckley, our modern prophet, who currently guides us through the challenging times of our present hour. Citing just last April conference that very theme struck by President Woodruff, he said to all of us:<br><br><i>We of this generation are the end harvest of all that has gone before. It is not enough to simply be known as a member of this Church. A solemn obligation rests upon us. Let us face it and work at it.</i><br><br>We must live as true followers of the Christ, with charity toward all, returning good for evil, teaching by example the ways of the Lord, and accomplishing the vast service He has outlined for us.<br><br>May we live worthy of the glorious endowment of light and understanding and eternal truth which has come to us through all the perils of the past. Somehow, among all who have walked the earth, we have been brought forth in this unique and remarkable season. Be grateful, and above all be faithful.<sup>5</sup><br><br>It is interesting to me that in those three quotations, over a representative period of time, our prophets have focused not on the terror of the times in which they lived and not on the ominous elements of the latter days, in which we are all living, but they felt to speak of the opportunity and blessing, and above all the responsibility, to seize the privileges afforded us in this, the greatest of all dispensations. I love the line from the Prophet Joseph Smith saying that earlier prophets, priests, and kings "have looked forward with joyful anticipation to the day in which we live; and ... have sung and written and prophesied of this our day." What were they so joyful about? I can assure you they weren't concentrating on terror and tragedy. Brother Woodruff's words were: "The eyes of God and all the holy prophets are watching us. This is the <i>great dispensation</i> that has been spoken of ever since the world began."<sup>6</sup> Let me repeat President Hinckley's words: "Through all the perils of the past, [s]omehow, among all who have walked the earth, we have been brought forth in this unique and remarkable season. Be grateful, and above all be faithful."<br><br>I don't know how all of that makes you feel, but suddenly any undue anxiety about the times in which we live dissipates for me, and I am humbled and spiritually thrilled, motivated at the opportunity we have been given. God is watching over His world, His Church, His leaders, and He is certainly watching over you. Let's just make sure we are the "pure in heart" and that we <i>are</i> faithful. How blessed you will be. How fortunate your children and grandchildren will be.<br><br>Think about it. No earlier people down through the gospel ages--including our own parents, in many cases--have had anywhere near the blessings that you and I have been given.<br><br>Think of the help we have been given to take the light of the gospel to a darkened world. We have approximately 55,000 missionaries--obviously far more than in any other age in the history of the world since time began. And that number is repeated <i>every two years</i> by those going out to replace their predecessors! But we need even more. We have an LDS presence in some 170 countries. We publish our scriptures in more than 100 languages.<br><br>Over 6,000 years or so ago there was one temple in the old world (it was rebuilt two or three times, but it was always the same temple on the same mountain: Mount Moriah in Jerusalem) and two or three temples in Book of Mormon history, but now we live in a time when temples are multiplying so rapidly we can hardly keep up. As of a few minutes ago we had 119 active temples with more, I am sure, to be announced and put under construction.<br><br>Add the miracle of the computer, which helps us document our family histories and systematically perform saving ordinances for the redemption of our dead. Add modern transportation, which allows the First Presidency, the Twelve, and other General Authorities to circle the globe and personally bear witness of the Lord to all of the Saints in all of the lands. Add that where we cannot go we can now "send," as the scriptures say, with satellite broadcasts like the one we are using tonight (see D&amp;amp;C 84:62).<br><br>Add <i>all</i> the elements of education, science, technology, communication, transportation, medicine, nutrition, and revelation that surround us, and we begin to realize what the angel Moroni meant when he said repeatedly to the boy prophet Joseph Smith, quoting the Old Testament prophet Joel, that in the last days God would pour out His spirit upon "<i>all</i> flesh" and that the whole world, all humankind, would be blessed by the light coming in all fields of endeavor as part of the Restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ (Joel 2:28; emphasis added; see also Joseph Smith--History 1:41).<br><br>We consider all these blessings that we have in our dispensation, and we pause to say to our Father in Heaven, "How <i>great</i> Thou art"<sup>7</sup> and "How <i>good</i> Thou art."<br><br>In fact, I have a theory about those earlier dispensations and the leaders, families, and people who lived then, of those whom the Prophet Joseph, President Woodruff, and President Hinckley spoke. I have thought often about them and the destructive circumstances that confronted them. They faced terribly difficult times and, for the most part, did <i>not</i> succeed in their dispensations. Apostasy and darkness eventually came to every earlier age in human history. Indeed, the whole point of the Restoration of the gospel in these latter days is that it had <i>not</i> been able to survive in earlier times and therefore had to be pursued in one last, triumphant age.<br><br>We know the challenges Abraham's posterity faced (and still do). We know of Moses' problems with an Israelite people who left Egypt but couldn't quite get Egypt to leave them. Isaiah was the prophet who saw the loss of the 10 Israelite tribes to the north. Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and Daniel were all prophets of captivity. Peter, James, John, and Paul, the great figures of the New Testament, all saw apostasy creeping into their world almost before the Savior had departed and certainly while they themselves were still living. Think of the prophets of the Book of Mormon, living in a dispensation ending with such painful communication between Mormon and Moroni about the plight they faced and the nations they loved dissolving into corruption, terror, and chaos.<br><br>In short, apostasy and destruction of one kind or another was the ultimate fate of every general dispensation we have ever had down through time. But here's my theory. My theory is that those great men and women, the leaders in those ages past, were able to keep going, to keep testifying, to keep trying to do their best, not because they knew that <i>they</i> would succeed but because they knew that <i>you</i> would. I believe they took courage and hope not so much from their own circumstances as from yours--a magnificent congregation of young adults like you tonight gathered by the hundreds of thousands around the world in a determined effort to see the gospel prevail and triumph.<br><br>Moroni said once, speaking to those of us who would receive his record in the last days:<br><br><i>Behold, the Lord hath shown unto me great and marvelous things concerning that which must shortly come, at that day when these things shall come forth among you.</i><br><br>Behold, I speak unto you as if ye were present, and yet ye are not. But behold, Jesus Christ hath shown you unto me, and I know your doing. [Mormon 8:34–35]<br><br>One way or another, I think virtually <i>all</i> of the prophets and early apostles had their visionary moments of our time--a view that gave them courage in their own less-successful eras. Those early brethren knew an amazing amount about us. Prophets such as Moses, Nephi, and the brother of Jared saw the latter days in tremendously detailed vision. Some of what they saw wasn't pleasing, but surely all those earlier generations took heart from knowing that there would finally be one dispensation that would not fail.<br><br>Ours, not theirs, was the day that gave them "heavenly and joyful anticipations" and caused them to sing and prophesy of victory. Ours is the day, collectively speaking, toward which the prophets have been looking from the beginning of time, and those earlier brethren are over there still cheering us on! In a very real way, <i>their</i> chance to consider themselves fully successful depends on <i>our</i> faithfulness and <i>our</i> victory. I love the idea of going into the battle of the last days representing Alma and Abinadi and what they pled for and representing Peter and Paul and the sacrifices they made. If you can't get excited about that kind of assignment in the drama of history, you can't get excited!<br><h2><b>A Wedding Feast</b></h2><br>Let me add another element to this view of the dispensation that I think follows automatically. Because ours is the last and greatest of all dispensations, because all things will eventually culminate and be fulfilled in our era, there is, therefore, one particular, very specific responsibility that falls to those of us in the Church now that did not rest quite the same way on the shoulders of Church members in any earlier time. Unlike the Church in the days of Abraham or Moses, Isaiah or Ezekiel, or even in the New Testament days of James and John, <i>we have a responsibility to prepare the Church of the Lamb of God to receive the Lamb of God</i>--in person, in triumphant glory, <i>in His millennial role</i> as Lord of Lords and King of Kings. No other dispensation ever had that duty.<br><br>In the language of the scriptures, we are the ones designated in all of history who must prepare the bride for the advent of the Bridegroom and be worthy of an invitation to the wedding feast (see Matthew 25:1–12; 22:2–14; D&amp;amp;C 88:92, 96). Collectively speaking--whether it is in our lifetime or our children's or our grandchildren's or whenever--we nevertheless have the responsibility as a Church and as individual members of that Church to be worthy to have Christ come to us, to be worthy to have Him greet us, and to have Him accept and receive and embrace us. The lives we present to Him in that sacred hour <i>must</i> be worthy of Him!<br><h2><b>We Must Be Acceptable to Him</b></h2><br>So, setting aside fear of the future or concerns about the dimensions of a backyard bomb shelter, I am filled with awe, with an overwhelming sense of duty to prepare my life (and to the extent that I can, to help prepare the lives of the members of the Church) for that long-prophesied day, for that transfer of authority, for the time when we will make a presentation of the Church to Him whose Church it is.<br><br>I do know this: When Christ comes, the members of His Church <i>must</i> look and act like members of His Church are <i>supposed</i> to look and act if we are to be acceptable to Him. We must be doing His work and we must be living His teachings. He must recognize us quickly and easily as truly being His disciples. As President J. Reuben Clark Jr. once advised, our faith must <i>not</i> be difficult to detect.<sup>8</sup><br><br>Yes, if in that great, final hour we say we are believers, then we had surely better be demonstrating it. The Shepherd knows His sheep, and we must be known in that great day as His followers in deed as well as in word.<br><br>Surely that is why President Hinckley said: "It is not enough [for us, you and me, <i>now,</i> in our time] to simply be known as a member of this Church. ... We must live as true followers of ... Christ."<sup>9</sup><br><br>Yes, my beloved young friends, these are the latter days, and you and I are to be the best Latter-day <i>Saints</i> we can. Put an emphasis on the last word there, please.<br><br>When will all of this finish? When shall Christ appear publicly, triumphantly, and the Millennium begin? I have already told you that I don't know. What I do know is that the initial moments of that event began 184 years ago. I do know that as a result of that First Vision and what has followed it, we live in a time of unprecedented blessings--blessings given to us for the purpose of living faithfully and purely so when the Bridegroom finally and triumphantly arrives, He can personally, justifiably bid us to the wedding feast.<br><br>Is there a happy future for you and your posterity in these latter days? Absolutely! Most assuredly you have a beautiful future. All wedding feasts are happy occasions. Will there be difficult times when those ominous latter-day warnings and prophecies are fulfilled? Of course there will. There always have been. Be prepared. Will those who have built upon the great rock of Christ withstand such winds, such hail, and the mighty shafts in the whirlwind? You know that they will. You have it on good word. You have it on His word! That "rock upon which ye are built ... is a sure foundation, a foundation whereon if men [and women] build they cannot fall" (see Helaman 5:12).<br><br>My beloved young brothers and sisters, I leave you my love and my testimony that God not only lives, He loves us. He loves <i>you.</i> Everything He does is for our good and our protection. There is evil and sorrow in the world, but there is no evil or harm in Him. He is our Father--a perfect father--and He will shelter us from the storm.<br><br>I testify not only that Jesus is the Christ, the Holy and Only Begotten Son of God, but that He lives, that He loves us, that on the strength and merit of His atoning sacrifice, we too will live eternally. He conquered death and hell for us, and He conquered fear in the same way.<br><br>This is the Church and kingdom of God on earth. Joseph Smith was a prophet and Gordon B. Hinckley is a prophet. Truth has been restored. You and I are fortunate enough to have been born when all of this knowledge and all of this safety are available to us.<br><br>I leave an apostolic blessing on each one of you individually within the sound of my voice that you will live with confidence, optimism, faith, and devotion. I bless you that you will be serious about life's challenges but not frightened or discouraged. I bless you to feel the joy of the Saints in the latter days--never crippling anxiety or destructive despair. Indeed, the only concern I would have us entertain is a very personal one: How can we live more fully, more faithfully, so that all the blessings of this great dispensation can be showered upon each one of us and upon those whose lives we touch?<br><br>"Fear not, little flock. ... Look [to Christ] in every thought; doubt not, fear not." "Ye have not as yet understood how great blessings the Father hath ... prepared for you. ... Be of good cheer. ... The kingdom is yours and the blessings thereof are yours, and the riches of eternity are yours" (D&amp;amp;C 6:34, 36; 78:17–18).<br><br>I leave you my blessing, my love, and an apostolic witness of the truthfulness of these things in the protective name of the Lord Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Jeffrey R.

<h1>ame - A Priceless Possession - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
It is a privilege to stand before you this morning as we begin a new school year. My husband and I are now in our second year at Brigham Young University, and our lives have been enriched in so many different ways during our time here. We look forward to the days and months ahead in your midst.<br><br>In William Shakespeare's <i>Romeo and Juliet,</i> Juliet speaks to herself and says, "What's in a name? That which we call a rose / By any other name would smell as sweet" (act 2, scene 2, lines 43–44). By definition your name is a word by which you are known. As I was growing up, I often wished that I could have another surname than the one I had. I still wanted to be me and I still wanted the same family I had, but I really would rather have been known by a last name that others could pronounce and spell correctly.<br><br>Mine was a French name that had its origin in the eastern Mediterranean area. From there my ancestors immigrated to the Neuchâtel area of Switzerland. Upon hearing or seeing my surname for the first time, no one knew how to say it. Those few who did attempt to pronounce it most often were very wrong, and thus embarrassed--to say nothing of how I felt. It was spelled G-i-a-u-q-u-e, and we pronounced it "juke."<br><br>When I was young and would list the attributes that I wanted in a future husband, tacked on to the usual ones would be that he must have a last name that would be easy to spell and pronounce. I felt that I would be very happy when I could be known by another more familiar surname than the one I had received at birth. To me, <i>Samuelson</i> was a good choice in this regard.<br><br>In August 1995 my husband, two daughters, and I moved to Solihull, England, where my husband was to begin fulfilling a Church assignment that lasted three years. At that time my parents gave me a family history book they had compiled that included many stories of my ancestors. I started reading these stories and was very touched by them. I am sure visiting the areas where most of my ancestors had lived personalized the love I began to feel for them. I also gained a deep appreciation for the sacrifices they had made because of their testimonies of the gospel--especially leaving that beautiful green land to come to the dry Salt Lake Valley.<br><br>However, my Giauque ancestors had come from Switzerland, and my desire to visit this area grew very strong--particularly after I began to know them better after reading their histories and especially the story of my great-great-grandmother. May I just tell you a portion of what was written about her life in my family history book?<br><br><i>In the year 1860 the father died of typhoid fever, leaving the support of the four children to the mother. One day the LDS missionaries came, and Mother Giauque readily accepted the gospel and was baptized on 6 May 1864. After that her greatest desire was to go to Zion</i> [or the center of the Church]. <i>Every spare penny was saved from her earnings with this in view.</i><br><br>In June 1868, arrangements had been made to organize a company of Saints in Liverpool to go to Zion. This opportunity should not be allowed to pass! This placed mother in a position where she made the hardest decision of her life. There was enough money for one passage, so she decided to send her 11-year-old son to Zion to prepare the way for her and her youngest son. She said that when the leaving came, she could scarcely bear the suffering of parting with her boy. She was fortified with the knowledge that he was a serious, responsible boy and would be in the care of other Saints. When she had said good-bye to him and the missionary of that town, she stood in her doorway and watched them crossing the fields as they started on their journey. Several times the boy stopped and waved to her, and it was with the greatest restraint that she kept herself from calling to him to return. But she remained strong and watched until they passed from view.<br><br>This young boy did make it to the Salt Lake Valley with the help and love of other Saints and their families. After three years his mother and he had saved enough money for Mother Giauque and her other son to join him in Salt Lake. This second son was my great-grandfather, and because of the faith and testimony of my great-great-grandmother and other ancestors, I began to appreciate the fact that I bore their name. I should never have been embarrassed by the fact that it was different. In fact, I now feel an obligation to honor those who went before me and whose lives and names I represent.<br><br>Before we moved back to Salt Lake City in 1998, my husband, daughter Sara, and I did have the opportunity to visit the small village of Saint-Imier. We felt a thankfulness that the missionaries had found my great-great-grandmother in this small village nestled among the hills of Switzerland.<br><br>Each of you here today has your own history, ancestral line, and name. Each of your stories is different. In many areas of our lives, we are a compilation of what our ancestors were. Characteristics, traits, abilities, and virtues of ancestors can be observed in us, their descendants who bear their names. The lives led by our ancestors have determined in many different aspects how our lives are unfolding today. We are influenced by the actions and characteristics of our forebears. Blessings we receive in our lives today may be a direct result of the sacrifices and faith of those who lived before us.<br><br>Knowledge of our ancestors and appreciation for their names that we bear can give direction to our lives. In our ancestral lines may be individuals whose actions we would not or should not emulate. We do, however, have the agency to conduct our lives at present so that they will reflect righteousness for our posterity. The questions can be asked: What are we doing to ensure that the righteous legacies we have received will be passed on to our descendants? What are we doing with our names?<br><br>In Proverbs we read, "A good name is rather to be chosen than great riches" (Proverbs 22:1), and in Ecclesiastes it says, "A good name is better than precious ointment" (Ecclesiastes 7:1). In relating the details of the First Vision, Joseph Smith stated that one of the personages who stood above him "spake unto me, calling me by name" (JS--H 1:17). He was also called by his name when he was visited by the angel Moroni (see JS--H 1:33).<br><br>Each of our names represents who we are. We become known by our name to all with whom we associate. Our reputation or the opinion generally held of us is always inextricably linked to our name. Yes, our name and reputation are inseparable.<br><br>I know of one young man who was working for an accounting firm and assigned to do some work at a local business. Because this young man had the same last name as someone with whom the business had previously had a negative and unsatisfactory relationship, the firm would not let the young man stay and complete the project. The two men were not even acquainted, nor had they ever even met. They just had the same surname. This is an example of the power of a person's name and reputation. In this instance it was a very negative one.<br><br>A few months ago I received a call from a gentleman who had been a student of my father-in-law in the educational psychology department of a university more than 30 years ago. I was asked by him about Dr. Samuelson and what had happened in the intervening years. He told me how much he had respected my father-in-law as a professor and admired him as a man. Dr. Samuelson, he stated, always was an example of his beliefs in the Church and its teachings. Dr. Samuelson's name was known for his spiritual as well as professional and personal attributes. In this instance it was a very positive opinion.<br><br>Our good name and reputation are priceless. Shakespeare also said: "He that filches [or steals] from me my good name / Robs me of that which not enriches him / And makes me poor indeed" (<i>Othello,</i> act 3, scene 3, lines 163–65). One builds his reputation each and every day by his thoughts, actions, choices, and associations. We are all representatives of our own families, and the reputation of a family is established through the actions of each member of that family. Also, we are representatives of our community, church, nation, and, for all of us here, Brigham Young University. As we conduct our lives now, even the smallest actions reflect upon them and their names.<br><br>Most of us are familiar with the story of a time when President George Albert Smith was seriously ill and had a dream in which he saw his grandfather after whom he had been named. In his account President Smith stated:<br><br><i>He</i> [meaning his grandfather] <i>looked at me earnestly and said:</i><br><br>"I would like to know what you have done with my name."<br><br>Everything I had ever done passed before me as though it were a flying picture on a screen. . . . I smiled and looked at my grandfather and said:<br><br>"I have never done anything with your name of which you need be ashamed." [George Albert Smith, <i>Sharing the Gospel with Others,</i> comp. Preston Nibley (Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1948), 112; see also "Your Good Name," <i>Improvement Era, </i>March 1947, 139]<br><br>To have an unspotted name and reputation is of greater value than all the wealth one could acquire in a lifetime.<br><br>Our Savior Jesus Christ knows each one of us by name. He wants us to return to live with Him once again. He wants us to live eternally with our families. We therefore have a great responsibility to our ancestors as well as to our descendants to live in a way that will enable us to achieve this eternal goal. President Gordon B. Hinckley once stated to a group of college students:<br><br><i>To you I say with all of the energy of which I am capable, do not become a weak link in the chain of your generations. You come to the world with a marvelous inheritance. You come of great men and women. . . . Never let them down. Never do anything which would weaken the chain of which you are a fundamental part (</i>Scroll, <i>14 Sept. 1999, 20).</i> [From Ricks College devotional, 7 September 1999; student newspaper article quoted by Stephen B. Oveson in "Our Legacy," <i>Ensign,</i> November 1999, 30; see also BYU devotional, 30 November 1999, "Keep the Chain Unbroken," <i>Brigham Young University 1999–2000 Speeches</i> (Provo: BYU, 2000), 109, 111]<br><br>In the Book of Mormon, Helaman tells his sons, Nephi and Lehi, "I have given unto you the names of our first parents [so] that when you remember your names ye may remember them; . . . that they were good" (Helaman 5:6). He hoped that his sons would also "do that which is good," so that their descendants would remember them in the same manner (verse 7).<br><br>The scriptures teach us that our names are written in heaven. Our names in this "book of life" (Alma 5:58) will be known by our thoughts and actions during our sojourn upon the earth. We are also taught in the scriptures that a heavenly record is kept of the faithful--whose names are recorded, as well as an account of their righteous deeds (see D&amp;amp;C 88:2; 128:7).<br><br>There is another name by which we should all be known besides the one we received from our earthly fathers. That is the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. In Mosiah we are told by King Benjamin, "I would that ye should take upon you the name of Christ" (Mosiah 5:8). King Benjamin then continued:<br><br><i>Ye should remember to retain the name written always in your hearts, that ye are not found on the left hand of God, but that ye hear and know the voice by which ye shall be called, and also, the name by which he shall call you.</i> [Mosiah 5:12]<br><br>My dear brothers and sisters, may we honor our names and thus our forebears as we strive to live righteous lives so that it can be said and written of us and the names we bear "that they were good."

<h1>y and the Honor Code - Cecil O. Samuelson - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
It is my great pleasure and privilege to welcome you to the fall semester. Although many of you are new to BYU, there are also those who have returned following missions and other prolonged absences. Some of you have been with us throughout the summer. To all I say that we are very glad to have you here. We anticipate that this will be a wonderful year for all of us.<br><br>At the outset, I want to declare my admiration for so many of you who are doing the things that you should in exemplary ways. For example, we have talked about improving our sportsmanship, and most of you are demonstrating tremendous consideration for others as well as for yourselves. Some of you incur debt while in school, and we expect and know you will not borrow more money than is absolutely necessary. Our default rate on student loans is very low--among the lowest rates in the country. So few of you really misbehave in significant ways, and yet it is still newsworthy when one of our students stubs his or her toe. Let me just say that we are almost always proud of you and are almost uniformly grateful for your obvious goodness.<br><br>You might guess that I receive lots of mail, e-mail, and phone calls. You would be right. Most of it is positive and uplifting. Some letters express concerns or suggestions or even criticisms. Those making various requests are not rare--and some few, happily the minority, come close to evoking tears. I'll not read any of these letters to you for obvious reasons. I will share with you the thrust of some of the several that report personal distress on the part of the writers--which in some cases has persisted for many years.<br><br>These letters are confidential, uncoordinated with each other, and therefore unique. What they do have in common, however, is a strong thread of regret. The regret is often matched with a pervasive sense of guilt and usually an effort to make things right as part of the person's sincere repentance process. The specifics are fairly varied but the theme is consistent. Each has given an account of a particular violation of his or her integrity or the Honor Code. Examples include seemingly small things like failure to pay parking fines or receiving without correction too much change at the Bookstore. Larger issues like the destruction or theft of university property, cheating on examinations or term papers, misrepresenting credentials for admission or on job applications and the like are only a sample of the burdens people have carried needlessly for years because of their lack of judgment and the thought that these things would just go away. They do not.<br><br>By now you might think that this is a talk about repentance. In a way it is, but not the one you might suspect. I will say little about the repentance process itself. I will say that we all need to repent regularly, and I suspect that some might find an increased urgency should they listen carefully today. You may ask the question the Savior's apostles asked when He informed them that a traitor was in their circle. Their sincere query was, "Is it I?" (Mark 14:19). I don't think any of you are traitors. I do think that we have a number of temptations and errors in judgment that demand our serious attention.<br><br>Over the past many years, and particularly since our arrival at BYU last year, I have read several times the account of Karl G. Maeser and his chalk circle. Had I the time and compelling interest in Trivial Pursuit–like activities, I might have calculated the number of times preceding presidents have used this example in settings such as this devotional. Appropriately, it is very many, and I hope that you will think seriously about it today as I increase the telling by one.<br><br>Brother Maeser was asked about the meaning of the phrase <i>word of honor,</i> which he used frequently. This was his response:<br><br><i>Place me behind prison walls--walls of stone ever so high, ever so thick, reaching ever so far into the ground--there is a possibility that in some way or another I may be able to escape, but stand me on that floor and draw a chalk line around me and have me give my word of honor never to cross it. Can I get out of that circle? No, never! I'd die first!</i> [In Alma P. Burton, <i>Karl G. Maeser: Mormon Educator</i> (Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1953), 71]<br><br>I want to talk today about some of the chalk lines all of us should draw around ourselves with the same resolve expressed by Karl G. Maeser.<br><br>If this account of President Maeser is new to you, then I am very glad I have brought it to your attention. If you have heard or read it many times previously, then I hope you will consider it again with fresh eyes and open hearts as I attempt to share some counsel with you.<br><br>Because you as students are very able, you have great facility with words. You are able to define most common words and describe their meanings and contexts. I want to discuss a very ordinary word familiar to us all and even to those with much less experience and sophistication than most of you. Today I hope to speak also about some specific applications in addition to generalizations with which we expect you to be familiar and to endorse behaviorally and philosophically.<br><br>The word for today is <i>integrity.</i> I hope that you are not surprised, given my introductory statement by Brother Maeser. I hope also that you are not disappointed that I should choose this topic among the many deserving of our time and attention. At the outset, I believe that virtually everyone at Brigham Young University has a high level of integrity. I also believe that the attendant principles and practices of integrity are so important that all of us regularly need to think and act seriously on this topic. Although I am confident that you are in relatively high standing with respect to personal integrity, particularly when compared to the world around us, I am also persuaded that many of us overlook or fail to understand fully what it really means to have integrity in our lives. Because of where we are and who we are, I will frame my comments to the context of our university experience.<br><br>In my office I have a Merriam-Webster pocket dictionary that has been my friend and my guide for more than 30 years. I have larger, more complete, and more current dictionaries, but this little paperback edition has been my companion and helper all of this time. Let me tell you what it says about integrity. I'll skip the part that describes it as a noun and also gives its relationships to other words with the same roots. There are three definitions given:<br><br>1. Soundness.<br><br>2. Adherence to a code of values: utter sincerity, honesty, and candor.<br><br>3. Completeness.<br><br>Other dictionaries and the thesaurus give additional words and nuances, but for my purposes today, these three definitions suffice nicely. Likewise, many Church leaders and others concerned with morals and ethics have delivered significant treatises on this topic. I recommend that you consider and study what others have taught as you target the applications to your own situation.<br><br>All of us are aware that we live in a general environment awash in moral relativism. Matters of honor, truthfulness, respect for others, and the like were often in the past understood to be hallmarks of an educated and cultured person--someone, for example, who might be viewed as a sterling example of a BYU student or graduate.<br><br>In more recent years--when we have had increasing examples of moral, ethical, and legal lapses in those of prominent status and stature--the basic values related to integrity apparently seem to some to be old-fashioned and perhaps even outmoded at the practical level. Although we--at least I--may be old-fashioned, the issue of integrity with all of its facets is not related to a particular age, time, place, or circumstance. Brother Maeser understood this, and we must as well.<br><br>I confess that I do not lose much sleep worrying about whether one of you might rob a bank or create a Ponzi scheme or become involved in any number of dishonest activities that plague our society. Please also understand that I do not believe you are immune to any temptations--even those most egregious such as I have mentioned and others that are similar. Sadly, some few who might have been counted as part of our number have done some silly and evil things of great seriousness. Happily, such examples of these things are extremely rare.<br><br>It does seem to me that the issues of integrity are particularly important in the university setting and all the more so at BYU. We are here to seek knowledge and wisdom. We make clear statements to ourselves and to the world that we live in an environment that not only encourages but demands that what we do is in the context of our faith and best efforts to live gospel principles. Indeed, our final article of faith begins by stating, "We believe in being honest, true, chaste, benevolent, virtuous, and in doing good to all men" (Article of Faith 1:13; see also <i>HC</i> 4:535–41). In other words, we believe in integrity and all of its meanings--particularly the three definitions I mentioned that include soundness, completeness, and adherence to a code of values. At BYU we believe in the Honor Code. We preach it, we teach it, and we must practice it with soundness and completeness.<br><br>The relationship between knowledge and integrity is an old and important one. Almost 250 years ago, Samuel Johnson said: "Integrity without knowledge is weak and useless, and knowledge without integrity is dangerous and dreadful" ("Rasselas" [1759], chapter 41). Since you are all acquiring knowledge, we don't worry too much that you will be "weak and useless," but we are concerned that without impeccable integrity, your knowledge can become "dangerous and dreadful."<br><br>Let me mention some integrity issues that seem to be much more common in our university community than they should be and that do give me pause. Although less dramatic and superficially less serious than the reports of felonies that fill the news media, they do give me concern, and I hope they do you as well. Before I mention some specifics, let me share some dialogue from C. S. Lewis' <i>Screwtape Letters </i>that seems germane to this point. Screwtape, a senior and experienced devil, takes his role as a teacher very seriously. One of his students is his nephew, Wormwood, a young and inexperienced devil. Screwtape is trying very hard to help the young devil be more effective in his work. Now let me read part of a letter from Screwtape to Wormwood:<br><br><i>You will say that these are very small sins; and doubtless, like all young tempters, you are anxious to be able to report spectacular wickedness. But do remember, the only thing that matters is the extent to which you separate the man from the Enemy. It does not matter how small the sins are, provided that their cumulative effect is to edge the man away from the Light and out into the Nothing. Murder is no better than cards if cards can do the trick. Indeed, the safest road to Hell is the gradual one--the gentle slope, soft underfoot, without sudden turnings, without milestones, without signposts.</i> [C. S. Lewis, book 12 of <i>The Screwtape Letters</i> (New York: Macmillan, 1961), 56]<br><br>Please think about Screwtape's premise and any potential personal applications as I mention a few areas or problems of concern.<br><h2><b>Plagiarism</b></h2><br>The definition is straightforward, but the practicalities seem to trip many people--including some of you. Basically, to plagiarize is to take or pass off someone else's words, ideas, or work as your own. As with most infractions, there are both blatant and subtle examples of plagiarism. To lift pages or paragraphs from published works or from the efforts of a classmate or anyone else without permission or citation constitutes plagiarism. Of course it is appropriate and often helpful to quote the works of others, but it is always necessary to give clear and adequate attribution to your sources. Some believe that using materials from the Internet or obscure resources loosens the rules. It does not! Some consider it appropriate to change a few words or the sequence of a few sentences or paragraphs and then claim the product as original work. Again, think of the basic definition.<br><h2><b>Cheating</b></h2><br>A recent survey reported that three-fourths of high school and college students admit to some cheating on examinations (see Michael Behar, "Lies, Damn Lies, and Statistics," <i>Wired,</i> March 2004, 60). Although we think of tests taken in school or the university, there are other dimensions of cheating as well. All are manifestations of the dishonest person. Certainly the faculty and other proctors of performance have a responsibility in this. It is important to realize that this is not a game and the definition of honorable success is not just that you were not caught. When you signed the Honor Code, you drew a chalk line around yourself.<br><h2><b>Résumé Padding</b></h2><br>Sadly, I believe <i>résumé padding</i> is a fairly recent term that is now widely understood. Some believe that it may be worth a calculated risk to suggest achievements not attained or other misrepresentations of a personal record. What is not always appreciated is that in doing so, a different record is being made that will follow the offender throughout life. Not only have people of prominence and others lost coveted jobs, they have been branded forever as people without integrity. That is a heavy but probably fair burden.<br><h2><b>Downloading Music Illegally Online</b></h2><br>One-fourth of Americans in one survey admitted to having downloaded music illegally, and the practice appears particularly common in the age group of high school and university students (see Behar, "Lies," 60). A partial reason may be that older folks typically lack the technical expertise. It is also likely that "because everyone is doing it," consciences may be soothed in ways described by Nephi--even though he probably was not thinking about CDs and DVDs specifically. You will remember from your reading that he generalized over many ways we might lose our integrity. Let me share this familiar verse:<br><br><i>And there shall also be many which shall say: Eat, drink, and be merry; nevertheless, fear God--he will justify in committing a little sin; yea, lie a little, take the advantage of one because of his words, dig a pit for thy neighbor; there is no harm in this; and do all these things, for tomorrow we die; and if it so be that we are guilty, God will beat us with a few stripes, and at last we shall be saved in the kingdom of God.</i> [2 Nephi 28:8]<br><h2><b>Stealing</b></h2><br>In one survey, 80 percent of workers admitted that at some time they had stolen supplies, material, or equipment from their employers or others (Behar, "Lies," 61). This does not take into account the theft of time that occurs when we are late for appointments, class, or work or the time our thoughtlessness or selfishness may cost others. Some of our community who would never think of stealing a roommate's watch or wallet occasionally find it convenient to leave unpaid phone bills or rent or other obligations for their associates to pay. You will all be aware of other small but important examples, should we take the time to catalog them.<br><h2><b>Giving False Information</b></h2><br>All of us misspeak on occasion. In our case, I hope it is because of an honest mistake or a faulty memory. When unintentional, we hope for correction or the opportunity to set the record straight as soon as we recognize the error. Of much, much greater concern is the intentional communication of false information. Most of you are regularly interviewed by your bishops and less formally, but often more directly, by your parents. Although it is tempting to misrepresent the truth in some circumstances, a lie is a lie. More than 30 years ago, President Dallin H. Oaks told a BYU devotional audience, "A lie is not always told in so many words. It may be a creature of concealment or a misrepresentation by action or a half-truth" (30 January 1973, "Be Honest in All Behavior," <i>Speeches of the Year, 1972–73</i> [Provo: BYU, 1973], 89). He then went on to quote Elder Richard L. Evans, who said:<br><br><i>Truth or untruth is not always altogether a matter of literal language, but often of implication, of inflection, of innuendo, of subtle suggestion. A clever person intent on being untruthful can give a false impression, even when his literal words can little be called into question.</i> [The Spoken Word, "Neither Lie One to Another," <i>Improvement Era,</i> November 1961, 854]<br><br>By the way, I learned from President Oaks' talk that failure to register student automobiles on campus was a major problem way back then too. He felt, and I feel, that such behavior is just another form of lying.<br><h2><b>Dress and Grooming Standards</b></h2><br>As you know, I have spoken on this subject in significant detail. I do not propose to do so again except to certify that I believe adherence to the Honor Code, including the provisions related to dress and grooming, is a matter of integrity. Simply put, to sign your name in support of one standard and then to live another is just one more example of lying or promise breaking. Let me say how much I appreciate those of the tremendous majority who personally take this seriously and support others in making these sometimes difficult decisions.<br><br>All will recognize that this list of potential breaches of integrity is incomplete. In addition, there are multiple variations of those items I did mention that could be considered and were not. Lest anyone feel any license to limit their personal integrity on the basis that a specific matter was not mentioned by me today, I will remind you of the words of King Benjamin:<br><br><i>And finally, I cannot tell you all the things whereby ye may commit sin; for there are divers ways and means, even so many that I cannot number them.</i><br><br>But this much I can tell you, that if ye do not watch yourselves, and your thoughts, and your words, and your deeds, and observe the commandments of God, and continue in the faith of what ye have heard concerning the coming of our Lord, even unto the end of your lives, ye must perish. And now, O man [and woman], <i>remember, and perish not.</i> [Mosiah 4:29–30]<br><br>Let me mention our Honor Code briefly. It is often portrayed by the media and others as a set of rules. Although it does contain specifics with respect to honesty, appearance, and general conduct, it is really much more. It is an attitude. It is a personal commitment to live life in congruence with gospel principles. It is our recognition of the importance of others in our university circle and the respect we have for them and their sensibilities, as well as for their rights and property. It is the chalk line we draw around our conduct and our thinking.<br><br>I have shared the counsel of King Benjamin. Let me now share the counsel of Shakespeare's Polonius, with which I suspect and expect you are all familiar. Although these lines found in the first act of Hamlet are directed to an audience of one, they apply to all, especially those of us privileged to be associated with Brigham Young University. Said Polonius:<br><br><i>This above all: to thine own self be true,</i><br><br>And it must follow, as the night the day,<br><br>Thou canst not then be false to any man.<br><br>[William Shakespeare, <i>Hamlet,</i> act 1, scene 3, lines 78–80]<br><br>In 1979 President Spencer W. Kimball addressed a devotional audience. Many of you, sadly, do not personally remember this great prophet leader, but many of the faculty and administration do recall his visits to our campus. He often spoke of the Honor Code and our unique responsibilities. On the occasion I reference, he again mentioned that he would speak about integrity even though he had addressed the same topic the year before. He said the following:<br><br><i>I make no apology for returning to that theme, because integrity (which includes the willingness and ability to live by our beliefs and commitments) is one of the foundation stones of good character, and without good character one cannot hope to enjoy the presence of God here or in the eternities. In this institution students and faculty commit themselves explicitly to abide by a code of conduct which includes both living by the moral precepts of the gospel and conforming to a dress and grooming code. Some purport to accept the moral standards as important and denigrate the other as trivial and as intruding on their freedom of choice. These people fundamentally misperceive the question, which is not whether the . . . code is wise, but whether they should consider themselves bound by a promise. It is not that such a code is forced upon anyone; there is free choice to come here or to go to some other institution which makes no such demands. . . . There is no disgrace in making that choice; it is a wholly legitimate option. But once having elected to come here and to participate in this community with its special calling to represent the Church and its highest standards, you must not compromise your integrity by promising what you will not do. By taking covenants lightly, you will wound your eternal self.</i> [Spencer W. Kimball, BYU devotional, 4 September 1979, "Integrity: The Spirit of BYU," <i>1979 Devotional Speeches of the Year</i> (Provo: BYU, 1980), 162]<br><br>You will not be surprised that throughout our history the messages of all our prophets since Brigham Young himself and our university presidents too have been both clear and consistent on these matters. Given our time constraints today, I will draw your attention to just one more.<br><br>Ten years ago next month, President Gordon B. Hinckley spoke at our campus devotional. I join with you in the wish that he had been our speaker today. While he was here on that occasion a decade ago, he entitled his comments "Codes and Covenants." Listen to what he had to say about the Honor Code.<br><br><i>I remind you that the Honor Code of Brigham Young University was not initiated by the board and the administration. It is an outgrowth of the action of a group of students who felt strongly that the acceptance of a code of honor by those who attended this school would have a salutary effect upon all.</i><br><br>By an evolutionary process it has continued, with modifications, until it has become the standard behavior of those of the university and has been endorsed by its board of trustees. It is for all students to accept and agree to live by--a statement of principle concerning honesty, charity, purity, modesty, and commitment.<br><br>It is not an inflexible law written in tablets of stone. It is a code of conduct. It is a statement of principles. It is a guide and a reminder concerning expected deportment. It is no more than might be expected of any good Christian, and no less than might be required of one who comes to this great institution sponsored by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. The code is a guide, not a rigid set of rules. It does not address every specific issue. It is a table of standards, set forth clearly enough that there can be no question concerning what is expected and yet flexible enough to allow some freedom in application.<br><br>It represents an attempt to express, in terms of expected behavior, the principles set forth in the thirteenth article of faith:<br><br>We believe in being honest, true, chaste, benevolent, virtuous, and in doing good to all men. . . . If there is anything virtuous, lovely, or of good report or praiseworthy, we seek after these things. . . .<br><br><i>Is observance of the code too much to expect from any of us? I think not. Every one of you who is enrolled in this great institution and every one who is a member of its faculty or its staff is part of a family unique and unusual. You are, in a very real sense, a chosen people. You have been selected through a rigorous process and found to be deserving of what this institution has to offer.</i> [Gordon B. Hinckley, BYU devotional, 18 October 1994, "Codes and Covenants," <i>BYU 1994–95 Devotional and Fireside Speeches</i> (Provo: BYU, 1995), 36–37]<br><br>I can report with great confidence that President Hinckley's opinion on these matters has not changed. Although both gentle and considerate, he is clear and courageous in his stance toward matters of honor. I am convinced he expects no less from each of us.<br><br>Having spoken to you plainly about our standards and expectations for your behavior and conduct, let me now also speak as clearly as I can about our respect and affection for you. I am convinced that you are not here by chance. Although our admissions processes and standards are rigorous and even daunting, I do not refer to them. I refer to my absolute persuasion that you are here because heaven has helped you to be. You are not necessarily any better than some who do not share your good fortune of being a BYU student, but you are not insignificant by any measure. It is my prayer and expectation that, growing through your experiences and efforts while at BYU, you will step onto the stages of the world to make contributions that will far exceed even your fondest current expectations and dreams. You will have the high privilege of making real and substantive differences in your families, in the Church, in your communities, in your countries, and in your chosen professions. You will carry with you the light that you have experienced and gained while at BYU wherever you go and however you serve in the years and generations ahead.<br><br>It is thus imperative that you go forth without substantial regrets or the consequences of poor decisions to limit your potential and your effectiveness. Central to all that you are and that you have to offer is your integrity. Preserve it, honor it, and protect it. If you do, it will preserve, honor, and protect you.<br><br>Many years ago I was faced with what I considered to be at the time a serious professional dilemma. In reality it was more like the need to choose between two very attractive alternatives with respect to my future career. I thought and prayed about the matter a great deal and discussed it thoroughly with Sharon, my wife. I frankly wished that I could have had the steady counsel, experienced frequently over the years, from my father about this matter, but he had died the year before. Because the decision facing me potentially had some implications for my Church service, I sat with a senior, respected Church leader and sought his counsel. I weighed with him my alternatives and all of the potential considerations in detail. I waited for his direction or questions. After a moment he looked me in the eye and said, "Above all else, you need to protect your integrity." That is all he said, and it didn't initially seem to be responsive to my questions. As I thought about it, however, it almost immediately became clear what my best alternative was, and the test of time has proven it to be so.<br><br>As I conclude my message today, I bear testimony of the very special privileges we enjoy at BYU with their attendant responsibilities. This university has the protection and guidance of heaven, and we individually do as well--when we act as we should. Let my advice to you be that which I received from my trusted mentor: "Above all else, you need to protect your integrity." In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Cecil O.

<h1>itual and Temporal Foundation: Scriptures and Revelation - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Any listening to a talk or any reading of a book starts with an introduction. As you may be familiar with the Book of Mormon and particularly the first verse, may I personalize its introduction in this way: I, Charles Didier, was born in Belgium--and, paraphrasing Nephi--of goodly parents. Alas, the similitude stops there; I was not taught somewhat in all the learning of my father and in the knowledge of the goodness and the mysteries of God! Therefore I would like to share with you today a short record of my proceedings in my early days as a student in that country.<br><br>And it came to pass that I was blessed by the Lord because of my faith in Jesus Christ, for I sought Him diligently, with lowliness of heart, and later I was also led to this land of promise, a land which is choice above all other lands (see <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/2.19-20?lang=eng#p18">1 Nephi 2:19–20</a>). Here I am addressing you at BYU, Provo, USA--the university that is choice above all other universities.<br><br>I started my student life by attending the University of Liege in Belgium. At that time I made two of the most important decisions regarding my temporal and spiritual futures. One was about a temporal career by choosing the School of Economics, the other about a spiritual career by deciding to be baptized into The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.<br><br>The university I attended was secular--an institution of higher learning but without the benefits you have of spiritual devotionals or even inspirational talks given by church leaders or academic and prominent personalities. Sporting or social events or athletic programs did not exist and were not part of the curriculum. Everything was focused on learning and acquiring secular knowledge to prepare for a temporal career. There was no code of honor; there was never any mention of religion or service; there were no members of the Church around. I was the only member in the whole university. It seemed that spiritual matters had no place in that environment.<br><br>I had to find the spiritual aspect of my life in a different environment--the Church. At that time there were about 150 members in our small district. We were a real minority among 10 million people--a rare species! Spiritual and temporal survival was a constant struggle.<br><br>As students we were a generation coming out of World War II to face the challenges and events of the future and to prepare a better world in the midst of the Korean War and the so-called Cold War. Communism, instead of fascism, was the new threat. We were left to ourselves to make crucial choices about our future with little help from anyone. It was a time when you had to learn what and how to think, what to expect, and how to hope. It was all about making right choices. Graduation was the major preoccupation and hope the expected end result, but the chances to achieve this goal were slim. We started with a class of 100 students in that four-year cycle, but out of that group only 25 graduated!<br><br>During those challenging years I learned that the source of true knowledge was not just secular knowledge. Another dimension needed to be added: a foundation of spiritual knowledge. That came as the result of a personal quest, an exercise of faith, seeking diligently to preserve and defend the truth of the restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ. The scriptures and revelation representing true doctrine became my spiritual and temporal foundation: "Seek ye out of the best books words of wisdom; seek learning, even by study and also by faith" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88.118?lang=eng#p117">D&amp;amp;C 88:118</a>). The answer determined the various roles that I would play in society.<br><br>This short record of my student approach to life represents quite a contrast with your life and your attendance at this Church institution, BYU--the purpose of which is portrayed by the words "Enter to learn; go forth to serve." These words represent a vision of what is expected and what is hoped for. President Gordon B. Hinckley emphasized this vision by saying, "I invite you, every one of you, to make that your motto" (Gordon B. Hinckley, "<a href="https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/gordon-b-hinckley_remarks-inauguration-president-cecil-o-samuelson/">Remarks at the Inauguration of President Cecil O. Samuelson</a>," <i>BYU 2003–2004</i> <i>Speeches</i> [Provo: BYU, 2004], 103). President Samuelson, in his first impressions as your president, said:<br><br><i>I would hope </i>[the students]<i> will leave BYU with the ability and capacity to think and be comfortable that they know how to think. I also hope they recognize that even in a world of uncertainties, there are some fundamental and basic values that will always prevail, even though there will be changes in the environment in which they will need to adapt.</i> [Cecil O. Samuelson, in Shinika A. Sykes, "From Red to Blue," <i>Salt Lake Tribune,</i> 24 August 2003, A6]<br><br>What is the difference between my situation of the past and yours of the present as an individual? It is that fundamental spiritual and moral values were not part of my university's curriculum. These were left for the students to explore if they had such an inclination, which rarely happened. Our motto could have been stated, "Enter to learn; go forth to serve yourself"!<br><br>Today, with the new threat of terrorism, the world is still in commotion. Confusion about moral standards has increased, and the decline and retreat of human values has accelerated, as witnessed by the media. A new culture promoting the ethic of self-satisfaction--eliminating moral rules and replacing them with our own pleasing rules--is the fashion. Your challenge to become the next generation of leaders who will face and help find solutions to these issues is very similar to that of past generations. As Church and university leaders, we are here to help you in this spiritual thinking process; you are not left alone to go forth to serve.<br><br>We are entering an era of the history of the world where we are exactly where the prophets warned we would be. The Apostle Paul prophesied word by word, phrase by phrase, describing our present situation:<br><br><i>This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come.</i><br><br><i>For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,</i><br><br><i>Without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good,</i><br><br><i>Traitors, heady, highminded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God;</i><br><br><i>Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof: from such turn away.</i><br><br><i>For of this sort are they which creep into houses, and lead captive silly women laden with sins, led away with divers lusts,</i><br><br><i>Ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth. </i>[<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/2-tim/3.1-7?lang=eng#primary">2 Timothy 3:1–7</a>]<br><br>Is there a solution to this dark description of our times? There is. It is to build your spiritual and temporal foundation upon scriptures and revelation. It is to learn how to oppose the world's evil trends. By doing so you will be affecting your personal life, your environment, and this university and the role you play in it. The kind of role, right or wrong, played by the individual in a society or institution is of utmost importance. It determines the future of that society or institution.<br><br>For example, remember the role played by former President Ronald Reagan in the liberation of oppressed people. The greatest compliment that could be given to him was that he did not play the role of the president of this nation; he acted as a president who knew what his role was, the president of a nation that had strong beliefs in freedom as a true principle. He understood what the United States represented in the world: the symbol of freedom. President George W. Bush eulogized Reagan with these words: "He believed that America was not just a place in the world, but the hope of the world" ("President Bush's Eulogy at Funeral Service for President Reagan," 11 June 2004, Washington, D.C.; http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2004/06/20040611-2.html). And that happens because of the beliefs and subsequent behavior of people.<br><br>Another great statesman, Aristide Briand, a Nobel Peace Prize winner from France and one of the animators of the League of Nations (precursor of the United Nations), said that the institutions are worth what the individuals are worth. A prophet, Gordon B. Hinckley, wrote, "Reformation of the world begins with reformation of self" ("<a href="https://www.lds.org/ensign/2004/09/in-opposition-to-evil?lang=eng">In Opposition to Evil</a>," <i>Ensign, </i>September 2004, 4).<br><br>By the same analogy it could be said that the worth of this institution depends upon the worth of its students. This worth--the personal and moral value of the student--will rise or decline according to his or her belief in the true principles and doctrine of the gospel of Jesus Christ. Belief affects who an individual is. Faith determines behavior and actions. This is the spiritual side of your life as a student. Brigham Young said:<br><br><i>There is neither man or woman in this Church who is not on a mission. That mission will last as long as they live, and it is to do good, to promote righteousness, to teach the principles of truth, and to prevail upon themselves and everybody around them to live those principles that they may obtain eternal life.</i> [<i>JD </i>12:19]<br><br>Being on such a mission as a believer in Christ and acting on the knowledge that His gospel is true makes a difference in our society and in the Church. The Lord Himself emphasized this very principle, saying, "This is my church, and I will establish it; and nothing shall overthrow it, save it is the transgression of my people" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/27.13?lang=eng#p12">Mosiah 27:13</a>).<br><br>The combination of the spiritual and temporal aspects of your life is essential and cannot be divided according to circumstances or the environment. How do you perceive your role as students in this BYU institution? You are to be not only responsible university students--the temporal aspect--but also responsible members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints--the spiritual aspect. These two responsibilities cannot be disassociated to satisfy egocentric needs or wants as the world tempts you to do. Your question now should be: <i>What can I do today to improve the world of tomorrow?</i> Your answer now should be that you will make choices that correspond to these two fundamental responsibilities. Choices are made thanks to the use of your agency. Your future, temporal or spiritual, is a result of righteous choices based on thinking about the value of that agency.<br><br>How many of you have planned to graduate academically from this university and graduate spiritually from the Church? By the same token, how many of you have planned to fail to graduate academically and spiritually? No volunteers? Did you notice that I used the word <i>planned</i> in my question? You will succeed by planning or fail by lack of planning or by indifference in your life. You will succeed by making right choices or fail by making unrighteous choices or by indecision. Success is always a result of unlimited attention to a purpose. Your purpose must be to create, literally, your plan of salvation, temporally and spiritually. Your failure will be a result of not having such a plan or not practicing what you planned. Remember that faith without works is dead!<br><br>Life planning--what you would like your life to be--depends on the principles in which you believe, on your faith, and on what you believe should be your place in the world. How do you plant the seeds of righteous beliefs in your mind and in your heart? How will you make righteous decisions affecting your behavior if you do not have that foundation? This is why President Boyd K. Packer, when talking to the mission presidents about missionaries' conduct, said:<br><br><i>Teach them doctrine </i>[the principles, the beliefs]. ... <i>The study of doctrine will change behavior more quickly and more permanently than the study of behavior will.</i><br><br><i>The scriptures are rich with </i>information<i> and </i>inspiration<i> about discipline.</i><br><br><i>You </i>[mission presidents]<i> must learn and they </i>[missionaries]<i> must learn what the revelations say about conduct. If you visit the scriptures only in time of emergency, you may miss the very verse that will tell you plainly what to do against a very serious challenge.</i><br><br><i>Your guide as to handling problems of discipline is found in the revelations. That is our book of principles and our book of law.</i> ["Discipline--Principles to Consider," Seminar for New Mission Presidents--2000 (20 June), 1; emphasis in original]<br><br>The Apostle Paul taught this very truth 2,000 years ago when he said, "All scripture is given by inspiration of God ... for instruction in righteousness" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/2-tim/3.16?lang=eng#p15">2 Timothy 3:16</a>). The Apostles used the words <i>inspiration</i> and <i>revelation</i> as the source of true knowledge.<br><br>Let us examine this teaching of making right choices based on a belief in righteous principles. What about our clothing and our physical appearance on this campus or in other circumstances? Does it matter, or does it make a difference in your behavior and influence your environment if you wear baggy or immodest clothes or tattered jeans? Does what I read in the Honor Code about modesty really apply to you? "Modesty and cleanliness are important values that reflect personal dignity and integrity, through which students, staff, and faculty represent the principles and standards of the Church" (Dress and Grooming Standards, BYU Honor Code).<br><br>I cannot resist quoting from one of your professors, S. Neil Rasband, stating that what you wear affects the educational environment:<br><br><i>What about torn or tattered jeans? They simply suggest that someone is unable to distinguish between being engaged with intellectual challenges and working on the welfare farm. They're dressed for barn work, not for brain work....</i><br><br><i>Next time you are tempted to wear something that is too casual or inappropriate to class, think of what you are communicating to yourself and others. Think about the attitudes and manners you are adopting by wearing it. Think about the effect it will have on your learning and your learning environment. Then ask yourself, "Do I really want to wear this?"</i> ["Viewpoint: Do I Really Want to Wear This?" BYU NewsNet, 5 November 2002, http://newsnet.byu.edu/story.cfm/40706]<br><br>Once again our opinion about the way we dress depends on our beliefs, our principles, and how well we make choices in agreement with those principles.<br><br>The same choices about what is right and what is wrong also apply to language, tattoos, body piercing, pornography, transgressions, and whatever else you may have to consider in your daily life. Key indicators will help you in the decision process: learning doctrine and principles from the scriptures and revelation and thinking, asking, deciding, and answering about your choices. Life is made of not only daily problems but also daily solutions. The solutions of problems are always found in the resources that are available to us and that come from a loving God. He gives us divine knowledge about our nature and our destiny. He gives us answers about our behavior, what to do. An example is the prophet Micah teaching, "What doth the Lord require of thee, but to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God?" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/micah/6.8?lang=eng#p7">Micah 6:8</a>).<br><br>Solutions always come by revelation, and revelation becomes reality in our lives when we put it into action to become a testimony. A testimony is the assurance of the reality, the truth, that comes by divine personal confirmation from the Holy Ghost. That personal revelation is usually the confirmation in your mind of what you already know in your heart. Elder Henry B. Eyring said, "The words of God in pure doctrine go down deep into the heart by the power of the Holy Ghost" ("<a href="https://www.lds.org/ensign/2004/09/we-must-raise-our-sights?lang=eng">We Must Raise Our Sights</a>," <i>Ensign</i>, September 2004, 17).<br><br>However, "there is an opposition in all things" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/2.11?lang=eng#p10">2 Nephi 2:11</a>), as we may have learned not only from the scriptures but also by personal and painful experience. Jacob, in the Book of Mormon, taught this principle and some others for our profit and our learning (see <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/2.14?lang=eng#p13">2 Nephi 2:14</a>). He also taught about freedom, saying that we are<br><br><i>free forever, knowing good from evil; to act for</i> [ourselves] <i>and not to be acted upon.... </i><br><br><i>... Free to choose liberty and eternal life, through the great Mediator of all men, or to choose captivity and death, according to the captivity and power of the devil.</i> [<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/2.26-27?lang=eng#p25">2 Nephi 2:26–27</a>]<br><br>Opposition is not only found out in the world. It may also be found among good friends, even among returned missionaries. Individual freedom to think, to speak, or to act is easily misunderstood in our day as meaning the abolition of rules or the elimination of codes. Obedience is a test of humility. Walking humbly with the Lord helps us to understand what is right in the eyes of the Lord. The proper role of a disciple of Christ is determined by Christ, not by us: "What manner of men ought ye to be? Verily I say unto you, even as I am" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/27.27?lang=eng#p26">3 Nephi 27:27</a>).<br><br>So if we accept the notion that our behavior is a result of our beliefs and principles and that this behavior will affect not only us but also others and our environment, we also need to accept that this belief must be centered in the great Mediator, Jesus Christ, the Savior and Redeemer and the Son of the living God. We need to recognize that the principles and the doctrine to guide us are found in the gospel of Jesus Christ, where the <i>how, when, what, where, who</i> questions about this life and the next are answered.<br><br>The challenge is that as we learn to conquer this freedom to act for ourselves, we also are tempted to try to escape it for fear of being rejected by others. For example, are we not tempted at times, voluntarily or not, to escape the consequences of our spiritual choices and hide from the responsibility that is ours because of the covenants that we made in the waters of baptism and renewed by partaking of the sacrament that we would always remember Jesus Christ and His Atonement? Don't some try to escape the duty of marriage as ordained from God and replace it with a worldly substitute called cohabitation or by not even considering marriage? Is it unusual today for some to escape the principles directing the union of a man and a woman--called marriage--by accepting alternative lifestyles? What about the escape from the sanctity of marriage and its eternal nature by finding an easy exit called divorce? What is your thinking about the escape from the purpose of marriage--procreation, the principle to form eternal families of our own--by forsaking the plan of our Heavenly Father?<br><br>Again, this is why it is so important not just to know who you are but to know who you can become; not just to exist but to know how to live; not just to hope but to achieve; not just to dream but to realize. My life as a Church leader has been profoundly influenced by these simple words: "Do it! Do it right! Do it right now!" (in David L. Olpin, <i>Quiet Success Thoughts</i> [Provo: D. L. Olpin, 1983], 135).<br><br>By revelation we know that this life is the time for us "to prepare to meet God" and "to perform [our] labors" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/34.32?lang=eng#p31">Alma 34:32</a>). It is also revealed that we will be proved "to see if [we] will do all things whatsoever the Lord [our] God shall command" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/pgp/abr/3.25?lang=eng#p24">Abraham 3:25</a>). Thus choices based upon divine knowledge, divine beliefs, and divine principles become essential for our temporal and spiritual salvation and, especially, for our happiness.<br><br>Happiness during your student life or after will be a result of your spiritual choices. It is a personal task, it cannot be delegated! Someone a few years ago said: "If you have a happy life, it is not because you found it that way; it is because you made it that way." If you know the way, then you can invite others to follow you. If you know the truth, then you can share it. If you know the doctrine and the principles, then you will live in harmony with the understanding of the gospel of Jesus Christ and you will become a light and give worth to your life.<br><br>Scriptures and revelation teach us not only the doctrine of the reality of God and our role in His plan of salvation but also the need to understand this doctrine. Strangely enough, some of the great thinkers of our time discovered the same principle as they tried to find a reason for our existence and the final end of it. One of them was Jean Jacques Rousseau, a philosopher of the 18th century. Orphaned when his mother died in childbirth, abandoned by his father at age 10, and raised by an aunt, he was virtually self-educated. All of his principles of philosophy rested on the quest of listening to his conscience, his soul. Wouldn't we call that the Light of Christ today? Preoccupied by the search for happiness and the destiny of the human being, he believed that this search had to go far beyond the temporal to reach the spiritual or supernatural. At the end of the preface of his Second Discourse, Rousseau quoted a verse from the Latin author Perse: "Man, learn what God wants you to be" (Aulus Persius Flaccus, <i>Satires,</i> III, line 71).<br><br>Scriptures and revelation teach us the doctrine of the purpose of life--what God offers us to be and to become. The doctrine is centered on Jesus Christ: "This is my work and my glory--to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/pgp/moses/1.39?lang=eng#p38">Moses 1:39</a>). This scripture helps us to have a spiritual long-term vision of the world and our role in it. It gives us hope. On the contrary, if we look at the doctrine of the purpose of life according to the world, we will find a life centered on the fulfillment of the self. This will not help us. It will only give us a limited short-term vision of the world and our role in it. Righteous principles are being replaced by false principles centered on the satisfaction of carnal urges. It is a culture of hedonism rife with sexual pleasure; addictions; and easy money acquired through cheating, gambling, and lotteries. This worldly doctrine invites intellectual and moral laziness, summarized in one sentence during the 1968 intellectual revolution in France and on U.S. campuses: "It is forbidden to forbid!" It does not give hope; it creates despair and leads to destruction, as this type of life always ends rapidly and inevitably in the bottom of a pit where the exit too often is suicide.<br><br>Scriptures and revelation teach us the very doctrine of hope in the Atonement of Jesus Christ and tell us about our divine nature and our divine destiny. As children of our Heavenly Father, we were created with hope within ourselves, with the Light of Christ, with a divine potential. Physical death is not an end, therefore. It is only the beginning. It is a transfer of existence--of mortal life to immortal life--due to the Resurrection of Jesus Christ. It is the reality of reaching our final destination to live in the presence of our Heavenly Father because of the Atonement of Jesus Christ liberating us from spiritual death and transforming the natural man into a spiritual man.<br><br>Scriptures and revelation help us to understand the vital role that we have in this world because we have received true knowledge through living prophets. In scriptures and revelation we find power, the meaning of life, and how to keep ourselves spiritually alive.<br><br>We are back where we started. We live in perilous times, as declared by the prophets. As Moroni finished the record of his father, Mormon, he said to us: "I speak unto you as if ye were present, and yet ye are not" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/morm/8.35?lang=eng#p34">Mormon 8:35</a>). And in the final chapters of the Book of Mormon, Moroni included his father's testimony:<br><br><i>My son, be faithful in Christ; and may not the things which I have written grieve thee, to weigh thee down unto death; but may Christ lift thee up, and may his sufferings and death, and the showing his body unto our fathers, and his mercy and long-suffering, and the hope of his glory and of eternal life, rest in your mind forever.</i> [<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/moro/9.25?lang=eng#p24">Moroni 9:25</a>]<br><br>Your belief in Jesus Christ and in the principles of the doctrine of His gospel as a foundation of the secular knowledge that you are receiving here will be the determining factor of your role in this institution today and in the world tomorrow. May I conclude with my personal testimony of the scriptures and revelation and confirm that Jesus is the Christ, that He is my rock and my foundation in my life, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Charles Didier was a member of the Presidency of the Seventy of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when this devotional address was given at Brigham Young University on 21 September 2004.</i><br><br><i>© Intellectual Reserve, Inc.

The day was June 27, 1844. The place, Carthage, Illinois. In the early evening Willard Richards, a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, dispatched sobering news to the Saints in Nauvoo: "Joseph and Hyrum are dead. Taylor wounded, not very badly. I am well. . . . The job was done in an instant" (<i>HC</i> 6:621–22).<br><br>A cortege left the hostile county seat of Carthage early the next morning and arrived in Nauvoo just after three in the afternoon. The mourners were waiting in the streets for the return of their prophet-leader.<br><br>"My soul sickened and I wept before the Lord," William Hyde observed. "It seemed that the very heavens were clad in mourning" (William Hyde Journal, LDS Church Archives).<br><br>James Madison Fisher described the melancholy: "To see stout men and women standing around in group[s] crying and mourning . . . was enough to break the heart of a stone " (Aroet Hale, Reminiscences, LDS Church Archives).<br><br>"The love the saints had for him was inexpressible," Mary Alice Cannon Lambert lamented. "Oh, the mourning in the land!" (Mary Alice Cannon Lambert in "Joseph Smith, the Prophet," <i>Young Woman's Journal</i> 16, no. 12 (December 1905), 554).<br><br>These people had left homes, farms, and even families to gather for the Word's sake. They saw themselves as saints; they saw Joseph as a prophet called of God. For 14 years he had raised up this religion on American soil. It was a religious movement that had attracted the attention of the nation. Wrote Boston notable Josiah Quincy after an 1842 visit to the Mississippi river town of Nauvoo:<br><br><i>It is by no means improbable that some future textbook, for the use of generations yet unborn, will contain a question something like this: What historical American of the nineteenth century has exerted the most powerful influence upon the destinies of his countrymen? And it is by no means impossible that the answer to that interrogatory may be thus written: </i>Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet.<i> And the reply, absurd as it doubtless seems to most men now living, may be an obvious commonplace to their descendants. </i>[Josiah Quincy, <i>Figures of the Past</i> (Boston: Little, Brown, and Company, 1926), 317; emphasis in original]<br><br>We are those descendants. Our lives, our very salvation, hinge on our faith in the Lord Jesus Christ and in His gospel restored through the Prophet Joseph Smith.<br><br>It isn't the life and history of this New Englander that spurs a testimony. It is his words: "I had actually seen a light, and in the midst of that light I saw two Personages, and they did in reality speak to me" (JS--H 1:25). For years he stood all alone before the world and testified of his vision in the Sacred Grove. He spoke with God the Father and Jesus Christ face-to-face and shared what he had learned with us. Joseph's testimony of the Savior, "that he lives!" is as direct as it gets (D&amp;amp;C 76:22). Jesus Christ lives. Ponder on the significance of those words. Of his first vision of the Savior in the company of our Father in Heaven, Joseph wrote, "I knew it, and I knew that God knew it, and I could not deny it" (JS--H 1:25).<br><br>Years later, in Hiram, Ohio, he no longer stood alone. At his side was Sydney Rigdon as they "beheld the glory of the Son, on the right hand of the Father, and received of his fulness." Ponder on their words:<br><br><i>And now, after the many testimonies which have been given of him, this is the testimony, last of all, which we give of him: That he lives!</i><br><br><i>For we saw him, even on the right hand of God; and we heard the voice bearing record that he is the Only Begotten of the Father--</i><br><br><i>That by him, and through him, and of him, the worlds are and were created, and the inhabitants thereof are begotten sons and daughters unto God.</i> [D&amp;amp;C 76:20, 22–24]<br><br>We are those sons and daughters.<br><br>Joseph was born to two good souls--Joseph and Lucy--in Sharon, a quiet little community in the hills of Vermont. The year 2005 is the 200th anniversary of his birth. His mother wrote, "We had a son whom we called Joseph after the name of his father; he was born December 23, 1805" (Lucy Mack Smith, <i>History of Joseph Smith by His Mother,</i> ed. Preston Nibley [Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1954], 46). His grandfather Asael had predicted that God would "raise up some branch" of the Smiths "to be a great benefit to mankind" ("Sketch of the Autobiography of George Albert Smith," <i>Millennial Star</i> 26, no. 27 [1 July 1865]: 407; also George A. Smith, "My Journal," <i>Instructor,</i> January 1946, 9; see also <i>HC</i> 2:443).<br><br>Joseph was that man.<br><br>That the Lord chose to restore His Church through a young man, not a graduate of an acclaimed school of religion or a preacher from one of the high pulpits in a well-established neighborhood, is unbelievable to those who measure in earthly terms. But this is not an earthly church, nor are we simply living out our days knowing only what is here and now.<br><br>John Taylor said:<br><br><i>Joseph Smith, the Prophet and Seer of the Lord, has done more, save Jesus only, for the salvation of men in this world, than any other man that ever lived in it. . . . He lived great, and he died great in the eyes of God and his people.</i> [D&amp;amp;C 135:3]<br><br>Joseph was an uncommon man. Look at what he did. He translated the Book of Mormon by the power of God, received priesthood keys from ancient prophets, built temples, gathered the faithful to Zion, and taught doctrines that were given to him by direct revelation. The Lord said, "Whether by mine own voice or by the voice of my servants, it is the same" (D&amp;amp;C 1:38). When we hear Joseph speak, we hear divinity.<br><br>Joseph taught:<br><br><i>If you wish to go where God is, you must be like God . . . , for if we are not drawing towards God in principle, we are going from Him and drawing towards the devil. . . .</i><br><br><i>Search your hearts, and see if you are like God.</i> [<i>HC</i> 4:588]<br><br>How would you answer that challenge: "Search your hearts, and see if you are like God"? Joseph's life was one of pure integrity to the cause of Christ, who he loved. He loved what the Lord loved. He lived the Lord's way. It wasn't easy for him. It isn't easy for us.<br><br>In 1829, while serving as Joseph's scribe, Oliver Cowdery asked for direction for his part in the unfolding gospel. In the revelation from the Lord that followed, Oliver was told succinctly: "Stand by my servant Joseph, faithfully, in whatsoever difficult circumstances he may be for the word's sake" (D&amp;amp;C 6:18). As with all references in the Doctrine and Covenants, He wasn't speaking to just Oliver. The Lord has made it clear, "I say unto you, that this is my voice unto all" (D&amp;amp;C 25:16).<br><br>"Stand by my servant Joseph." What does that mean for each one of us? Where do we stand when it comes to Joseph Smith and what he called "the cause of Christ" (<i>HC</i> 1:468)? After his martyrdom, as Joseph was returned to his people in a pine box, the streets of Nauvoo were lined with faithful members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. They honored him both in life and in death. It was a moment of truth in the Restoration. This was not Joseph's church; it was the Church of Jesus Christ. These faithful picked up their meager belongings buttressed by a faith that commanded their hearts, and they walked west to begin again. That's what it means to stand by Joseph. We stand as witnesses that Jesus Christ lives, and if we are called to unfamiliar ground, that's where we go. Our testimony is the treasure we take with us.<br><br>Lofty words? Not really. You are going to leave this "Nauvoo" of sorts here. Brigham Young University is a haven from the world. You have gathered from all countries to learn and to serve. That was the pattern in Nauvoo. Though the Saints never built the "University of Nauvoo," they were schooled just the same from God's chosen teacher, Joseph Smith. They learned that in spite of death, disappointment, difficulty, and setbacks, the gospel is true, Jesus Christ lives and directs His work, and eternal life is promised to all who believe and act in His name. Keep that perspective in mind as you leave here with your handcart or your wagon and go forth. Stand by Joseph as you work and raise your family. Don't be like Simonds Ryder, who turned from the truth because his name was spelled wrong on his missionary letter (see <i>HC</i> 1:260–61). Joseph was jailed more than 50 times for standing up for the Lord's word and His ways. What did he do when his jailers with coarse language and abhorrent behavior rabbled around outside his cell? As Parley P. Pratt recorded, Joseph stood and commanded: "Silence!"<br><br>Parley P. Pratt went on to describe:<br><br><i>Chained, and without a weapon; calm, unruffled and dignified as an angel, he looked upon the quailing guards, whose weapons were lowered or dropped to the ground. . . . </i><br><br><i>. . . I have tried to conceive of kings, of royal courts, of thrones and crowns; and of emperors assembled to decide the fate of kingdoms; but dignity and majesty have I seen but </i>once,<i> as it stood in chains, at midnight, in a dungeon in an obscure village of Missouri.</i> [<i>PPP,</i> 1985, 180; emphasis in original]<br><br>Will we be so valiant? Remember Joseph's words: "If we are not drawing towards God . . . , we are going from Him." Search your heart for your testimony of the Prophet. If yours is casual, seek for a spiritual witness of Joseph Smith's calling as a prophet for the latter days. That testimony is received not through books, tapes, or even talks--like this one--but by the Spirit confirming to your spirit that Joseph Smith was and is a prophet of God.<br><br>I received my witness not from study but from the Spirit when I was standing by a fence in Fayette, New York, outside the Peter Whitmer farmhouse. That ground is sacred to me, much like the mount for Moses--"for the place where thou standest is holy ground" (Acts 7:33). The Church was established there in 1830, in the middle of nowhere, as the world gauges place. There I received from the Spirit of God the confirmation "that Joseph was and is a prophet of God." I remember thinking at first, "I know that. Everybody knows that."<br><br>Then the words came a second time: "Joseph Smith was and is a prophet of God. Someday you will need to know that."<br><br>It was like the description in Jacob: "I had heard the voice of the Lord speaking unto me in very word . . . ; wherefore, I could not be shaken" (Jacob 7:5).<br><br>Someday is here for every one of us. The world needs our firm testimony of Joseph and the Restoration--right now.<br><br>Why did he stand upon his feet the morning after being tarred and feathered and preach the gospel of Jesus Christ with great conviction? Why did he endure a dark, lonesome prison--appealing to the Lord for comfort rather than shaking his fist at the sky for the unjust treatment? Why did he bury one child, then another and another and another, and continue to proclaim his undying devotion to the Lord and a love for His work? Why did he carry on when friends turned against him, when enemies attacked and killed the faithful, when the forces of the adversary raged all around him?<br><br>The answer is best described in his own words: "I am a lover of the cause of Christ and of virtue chastity and an upright steady course of conduct and a holy walk" (letter to William W. Phelps, 31 July 1832, in Joseph Smith, <i>The Personal Writings of Joseph Smith,</i> comp. Dean C. Jessee [Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1984], 246; original punctuation). His characterization of himself is so telling. "A lover of the cause of Christ" is such a simple way of describing what it means to take His name upon us and to love what He loves. When we stand by Joseph, from our perspective we see the world as "the cause of Christ." That changes things, doesn't it?<br><br>Joseph sent his closest allies to England to preach the word of God when he could have used them by his side in Kirtland. At that time apostasy was rampant in Kirtland. To engage in "the cause of Christ" we have to leave our comfort zone. We have to "go where you want me to go, dear Lord," as the song says (<i>Hymns,</i> 1985, 270). Sometimes it is a march to Zion's Camp with no battle at the end. Do we decry the calling with "What was that all about?" or do we trust in Him whose work this is? He knows the battlefields and where the battles are best fought and what the battles really are. It is fair to say, "We fight most battles in our own hearts." That's why love of "the cause of Christ" is so critical.<br><br>Joseph Smith was not a self-absorbed leader demanding fealty from his followers. This was a man of God who understood the proclamation of his leader, the Lord Jesus Christ: "I came by the will of the Father, and I do his will" (D&amp;amp;C 19:24). Do we? Joseph lived such commitment to his death. Such devotion wasn't easy then. It isn't easy today in a world that cycles daily around wants, material possessions, passions, pleasures, and personal gratification. There is no peace in that lifestyle, no happiness. No matter how much glory or goods we get from the world, they will never be enough because within us is the Spirit of God. The Spirit thrives on goodness and light. The Spirit loves what the Lord loves. The Spirit seeks peace and the promise of worlds without end.<br><br>Joseph understood distractions and did not squander "the time . . . to prepare to meet God" (Alma 34:32). He said, "Wherever light shone, it stirred up darkness" (<i>HC</i> 6:51). Darkness fights for place in this world; it stirs around in our lives. Hopefully we are not among those "walking in darkness at noon-day" (D&amp;amp;C 95:6). Joseph described his difficult times: "Deep water is what I am wont to swim in" (D&amp;amp;C 127:2). He did not entertain the idea that he would sink. He kept swimming. The Lord's comfort to Joseph in the dim cellar in Liberty, Missouri, was this: "Know thou, my son, that all these things shall give thee experience, and shall be for thy good" (D&amp;amp;C 122:7). "Hold on thy way," the Lord told Joseph (D&amp;amp;C 122:9).<br><br>Are we holding on to that "way," the cause of Christ? Do we define ourselves with the terms Joseph used--<i>virtue, chastity, holy walk?</i> Or do clothes that are inappropriate, language that is not fitting, or actions and choices that do not fit "a holy walk" camouflage that cause?<br><br>Joseph's description of himself is a good example for us all. He said, "All I can offer the world is a good heart and a good hand" (<i>HC</i> 5:498). Good hearts. Good hands. Isn't that the description of a true disciple? Think of John the Baptist as he laid his hands upon Joseph and conferred the Aaronic Priesthood. That significant event was followed weeks later by Peter, James, and John appearing to Joseph and conferring the Melchizedek Priesthood by the laying on of hands. Do we appreciate the majesty of the priesthood? Do we recognize that worlds without number were created by that power?<br><br>I have sat in what we call the blessing chair at home and had my husband lay his "good hands" upon my head and through the power of the priesthood bless me with the desires of my heart. That power has healed wounds; it has given me peace, direction, insight, clarity, strength, and comfort. I am so grateful for the blessings of the priesthood and its influence in our family. We raised all sons. We were blessed with the best of boys who have become the best of men. Their hands have rested on my head and blessed me by the power of the priesthood. They have blessed others in Germany, England, Belgium, France, and Australia with that same power. That, brothers and sisters, is the cause of Christ.<br><br>The Lord said to the Saints in 1830, "Keep the commandments which you have received by the hand of my servant Joseph Smith, Jun., in my name" (D&amp;amp;C 19:13). What of forgiveness in a culture that seeks retribution, that sues for spilled drinks, that is in your face and on your case rather than offering mercy, patience, and encouragement to one who is struggling? And what of those times when we are feeling secure and successful? Do we pass by on the other side of those who are in need? What of courage to support another through the repentance process, courage to do the right thing, and courage to overcome addictions that can paralyze us in our progress home to our Heavenly Father?<br><br>Joseph's love of the Lord sustained him when the world was raging around him. He was even cheerful--cheerful because he really knew and believed the words of the Lord: "Be of good cheer, and do not fear, for I the Lord am with you, and will stand by you" (D&amp;amp;C 68:6). When we stand by Joseph, bearing witness of Jesus Christ, the Lord stands by us. He acts in our behalf. "I will go before your face," He has promised. "I will be on your right hand and on your left, and my Spirit shall be in your hearts, and mine angels round about you, to bear you up" (D&amp;amp;C 84:88).<br><br>The work of angels is often quiet or in secret. It is rarely of the magnitude heralded by the world. Sometimes we are those angels for others. Joseph learned that lesson in Harmony, Pennsylvania, when he was translating the gold plates. I have a favorite account from that period that speaks to my heart. It's about Joseph Knight, Sr., who gained a witness of the young Prophet in the earliest days of Joseph's ministry. He was the age of Joseph's father--an unlikely confidant or companion to the young Joseph.<br><br>One day Joseph Knight felt impressed to take some supplies to the Smiths down in Harmony, a quiet little community on the banks of the Susquehanna River. There in those waters just down the hill from their home, Joseph baptized Oliver and then Oliver baptized Joseph--the two having received the holy priesthood from John the Baptist. This is such a sacred place. There is still a spirit in the air--and a few less pebbles on the bottom of the river, because I waded in to bring some home.<br><br>Busy translating the gold plates in the spring of 1829, Joseph had little time to farm or make a living. Knight, who lived across the border in New York, wrote in his journal:<br><br><i>I bought a barrel of mackerel and some lined paper for writing . . . nine or ten bushels of grain and five or six bushels</i> [of] <i>taters and a pound of tea, and I went down to see him and they were in want.</i> [Joseph Knight, Sr., Reminiscences (n.d.), LDS Church Archives, 6]<br><br>Imagine Knight standing in the country store rattling off what he needed and then pausing: "And give me some of that lined paper for writing. That will do it." Sandwiched between the mackerel and bushels of grain was "some lined paper for writing." Perhaps it is the writer in me that loves the image so much, but I don't think so. I think it's the lesson learned from an older man, the age of Joseph's father, hearing the prompting to take what was needed to a young--and even then controversial--Joseph Smith.<br><br>Picture Joseph Knight loading up his wagon with supplies. Joseph hadn't sent a fax or called on his cell phone. The Spirit had prompted Knight to do the work of angels. What does this say to all of us? When we dash out the door in the morning, do we load up our backpacks with our essentials and some to spare for someone else in need? Do we pray about how we can further "the cause of Christ" as we pursue our tasks? Do we listen for promptings through the day or have we dismissed the still small voice calling us to service because of our pressures, our schedules, or simply the lack of time available in our Palm Pilot–packaged life?<br><br>There is a wonderful scripture in Alma 29 that may help us keep our priorities straight and our ears ready to hear. Alma said:<br><br><i>I do not glory of myself, but I glory in that which the Lord hath commanded me; yea, and this is my glory, that perhaps I may be an instrument in the hands of God.</i> [Alma 29:9]<br><br>Joseph Knight was an instrument, an angel.<br><br>What about us? I remember when I was writing about Joseph Smith for national television. When I thought about what I was doing, I was paralyzed. I could just see meeting Joseph Smith in the next life and accounting for my efforts. All I wanted to do was to get it right--for him, the Prophet of this dispensation.<br><br>I had written a working script for the documentary being produced by Lee Groberg, and it was sent off for review by the sponsoring station in Vermont. The early response was heartening. "The first part is pretty good," the reviewer said. The script began with the Martyrdom and then backed up to place Joseph in the context of American religious history. Then the story focused on the unfolding of the Restoration through Joseph's life.<br><br>The reviewer's next statement was something like "When you get to New York . . . " And then she paused. I knew what she was going to say: ". . . all these angels start dropping down from the sky." She paused again and then said, "No one is going to believe you."<br><br>I listened.<br><br>"Take this Moroni."<br><br>I corrected her pronunciation, saying, "It's Mō-rō-nī."<br><br>"Oh," she said, "Mō-rō-nī. How are you going to show him? You aren't going to hook him up to wires and then fly him through the sky?"<br><br>I explained that the show would use images of where things happened, paintings depicting the setting, and stained-glass windows.<br><br>"I hate this part," she said, and then she hung up.<br><br>A few days later she called back: "I've got an idea. Why don't you show the gold plates? You could put one of your experts there next to the shiny little volumes, and he could point to them and talk about them. Then people would believe you, because they could see something."<br><br>"There's a problem with that," I said.<br><br>"I've thought about that," she responded. "You've probably got them encased in some special box because of their antiquity."<br><br>"No," I said, "that's not the problem. Joseph gave the plates back to Moroni, and he buried them or took them someplace else. Anyway, we don't have them."<br><br>Long pause. "I hate this part," she said, and slam went the phone.<br><br>She had yet to read the Kirtland section where we had angels on the roof of the temple in the middle of the day.<br><br>Tell the story of the Restoration without angels? No. Tell the story of Joseph without the tutoring of Moroni? Without Peter, James, and John? Not possible. We have been called to do our part, whether it is taking lined paper for writing or standing firm about the story of the Restoration. Where you will stand depends in great measure on your testimony of Joseph Smith.<br><br>At the death of his father, Joseph Smith said, "He was the first person who received my testimony after I had seen the angel, and exhorted me to be faithful and diligent to the message I had received" (<i>HC</i> 4:190).<br><br>Each of us has a part. Hyrum, his older brother, who received his own witness of Joseph and the work, said, "Joseph has the spirit and power of all the prophets" (<i>HC</i> 6:346).<br><br>Brigham Young's testimony of the Prophet is stirring: "I feel like shouting hallelujah, all the time, when I think that I ever knew Joseph Smith, the Prophet" (<i>JD</i> 3:51).<br><br>Where are your hallelujahs? Are they reserved for your GRE score or your next statistics quiz? For dreams of a job with a car allowance? For simply a car? Those things are important; I am not discounting doing the best we can do in our preparation for this life and a career. But those efforts are not why we are here, and they will not carry us where we want to go.<br><br>Joseph knew the struggles of making a living, the heartache of burying children, the weight of his ministry, and the tensions created by sharing and living what to his enemies was simply unbelievable. His influence with the Saints was extraordinary. The persecution they shouldered, the journeys they endured, the sacrifices they made, the fervor they manifested in support of what Joseph called "the kingdom of God on earth" (<i>Teachings,</i> 39) is without equal in latter-day religious history. Are we part of that legacy? Have we picked up the cause of Christ from them? Are we moving it forward? Will we find ourselves standing by Joseph?<br><br>Joseph taught, <i>"When the Lord commands, do it"</i> (<i>HC</i> 2:170; emphasis in original). Joseph Smith understood and exemplified that if we do what the Lord asks, "the cause of Christ" will move forward. Whether it's in the form of lined paper for writing, building a temple, or being that temple the Lord expects us to be, we each have a part. Yours is clear in the heavens. May it be clear in your hearts. Make next year the time for you to gain your own personal witness of Joseph Smith and live closer to the gospel he championed.<br><br>I bear my witness that Joseph Smith was and is a prophet of God. Gaining that testimony has changed my life. I would have stood to honor him as his body was brought back to Nauvoo. Where do you stand? Do you love the cause of Christ, and will you stand firm, no matter what difficulty you face, "for the word's sake" (D&amp;amp;C 6:18)? The word is the gospel. The Savior's gospel is the only way home to our Father in Heaven. I know that Jesus Christ lives, that my Redeemer lives, and that this is His work and His Church. And the glory be to the Father. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Heidi S.

<h1>of the Sacred - D. Todd Christofferson - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I have titled these remarks "A Sense of the Sacred," by which I mean an appreciation and reverence for sacred things. Speaking of society in general, I am afraid that many of my generation have been remiss in transmitting to your generation a feeling for sacred things and an understanding of how to respect them.<br><br>To the extent possible, I hope to counteract some of the bad examples that are much in evidence around you. I hope to help you refine your ability to discern what is sacred and to respond with reverence for all that is holy.<br><br>The importance of having a sense of the sacred is simply this--if one does not appreciate holy things, he will lose them. Absent a feeling of reverence, he will grow increasingly casual in attitude and lax in conduct. He will drift from the moorings that his covenants with God could provide. His feeling of accountability to God will diminish and then be forgotten. Thereafter, he will care only about his own comfort and satisfying his uncontrolled appetites. Finally, he will come to despise sacred things, even God, and then he will despise himself.<br><br>On the other hand, with a sense of the sacred, one grows in understanding and truth. The Holy Spirit becomes his frequent and then constant companion. More and more he will stand in holy places and be entrusted with holy things. Just the opposite of cynicism and despair, his end is eternal life.<br><br>Paradoxically, much of what I want to convey cannot really be passed from one person to another. It must grow from within. But if I can help you think about some things in a contemplative way, then the Spirit may work in you so that you will not need me or anyone else to tell you what is sacred or how to respond--you will feel it for yourself. It will be part of your nature; indeed, much of it already is.<br><br>Sometimes in seeking to understand a concept, it helps to consider its opposite. The contrast makes it clear. So as we try to better understand what it means to have an appreciation of and reverence for sacred things, consider with me some examples of both a sense of the sacred and its absence.<br><h2><b>1. Prophets and Scripture</b></h2><br>Consider first the matter of prophets and scripture. One thing we see around us, and sometimes even in ourselves, is a tendency to treat lightly the messengers of God and their messages. This is not new. Since Adam's time many have ignored and even attacked those the Lord has sent in His name.<br><br>Jesus described this in a parable: "There was a certain householder, which planted a vineyard, and hedged it round about ..., and built a tower, and let it out to husbandmen, and went into a far country."<br><br>You understand the analogy: the Lord created for us a vineyard--this earth--and we are His lessees or stewards in a mortal sphere removed from His presence.<br><br>"And when the time of the fruit drew near, he sent his servants to the husbandmen, that they might receive the fruits of it."<br><br>In other words, God sends His prophets and other messengers to teach us and to receive an accounting of our stewardship.<br><br><i>And the husbandmen took his servants, and beat one, and killed another, and stoned another.</i><br><br>Again, he sent other servants more than the first: and they did unto them likewise.<br><br>But last of all he sent unto them his son, saying, They will reverence my son.<br><br>But when the husbandmen saw the son, they said among themselves, This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and let us seize on his inheritance. [Matthew 21:33–38]<br><br>It was the ultimate sacrilege that Jesus Christ, the very Son of God, was rejected and even put to death. And it continues. In many parts of the world today we see a growing rejection of the Son of God. His divinity is questioned. His gospel is deemed irrelevant. In day-to-day life, His teachings are ignored. Those who legitimately speak in His name find little respect in secular society.<br><br>If we ignore the Lord and His servants, we may just as well be atheists--the end result is practically the same. It is what Mormon described as typical after extended periods of peace and prosperity: "Then is the time that they do harden their hearts, and do forget the Lord their God, and do trample under their feet the Holy One" (Helaman 12:2). And so we should ask ourselves, do <i>we</i> reverence the Holy One and those He has sent?<br><br>Some years before he was called as an Apostle himself, Elder Robert D. Hales recounted an experience that demonstrated his father's sense of that holy calling. Elder Hales said:<br><br><i>Some years ago Father, then over eighty years of age, was expecting a visit from a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles on a snowy winter day. Father, an artist, had painted a picture of the home of the Apostle. Rather than have the painting delivered to him, this sweet Apostle wanted to go personally to pick the painting up and thank my father for it. Knowing that Father would be concerned that everything was in readiness for the forthcoming visit, I dropped by his home. Because of the depth of the snow, snowplows had caused a snowbank in front of the walkway to the front door. Father had shoveled the walks and then labored to remove the snowbank. He returned to the house exhausted and in pain. When I arrived, he was experiencing heart pain from overexertion and stressful anxiety. My first concern was to warn him of his unwise physical efforts. Didn't he know what the result of his labor would be?</i><br><br>"Robert," he said through interrupted short breaths, "do you realize an Apostle of the Lord Jesus Christ is coming to my home? The walks must be clean. He should not have to come through a snowdrift." He raised his hand, saying, "Oh, Robert, don't ever forget or take for granted the privilege it is to know and to serve with Apostles of the Lord." [In <i>CR,</i> April 1992, 89; or "Gratitude for the Goodness of God," <i>Ensign,</i> May 1992, 64]<br><br>I think it is more than coincidence that such a father would be blessed to have a son serve as an Apostle.<br><br>You might ask yourself, "Do I see the calling of the prophets and apostles as sacred? Do I treat their counsel seriously, or is it a light thing with me?" President Gordon B. Hinckley, for instance, has counseled us to pursue education and vocational training; to avoid pornography as a plague; to respect women; to eliminate consumer debt; to be grateful, smart, clean, true, humble, and prayerful; and to do our best, our very best.<br><br>Do your actions show that you want to know and do what he teaches? Do you actively study his words and the statements of the Brethren? Is this something you hunger and thirst for? If so, you have a sense of the sacredness of the calling of prophets as the witnesses and messengers of the Son of God.<br><br>A significant aspect of the prophetic office through the generations has been to record history and the word of God. The scriptures are sacred. When Alma turned the plates of Nephi and other records over to Helaman, he cautioned:<br><br><i>Remember, my son, that God has entrusted you with these things, which are sacred,</i> which he has kept sacred. ...<br><br><i>... See that ye</i> take care of these sacred things, <i>yea, see that ye look to God and live.</i> [Alma 37:14, 47; emphasis added]<br><br>We hold in our hands a considerable volume of scripture. The records stretch back to the early patriarchs and forward to our own lifetimes. I suppose this is more scripture than has ever been had by a people in history, and certainly it is more widely available than ever scripture was in the past. I am sure that if you or I held in our hands the original scrolls that Moses wrote upon or the very metal plates that Mormon had inscribed, we would feel a deep sense of reverence and awe and would treat those objects with great care. And so we should, because they are sacred objects, made so in part by the labor and sacrifice of the holy prophets who so painstakingly prepared them.<br><br>But the greatest value of such scrolls or plates is not in the objects themselves but in the words they contain. They are sacred because they are the words of God, and while we may not hold the original documents, we do hold the words. Therefore, what we have is holy--holy writ.<br><br>Having been granted possession of the recorded words of God, we should ask ourselves if we are respecting the sacred nature of this record. Some have violated the sacredness of the scriptures by ridiculing or denying their validity. That, of course, is a very serious matter.<br><br>But for most of us, who readily acknowledge the truthfulness of the standard works, if we are ever guilty of disrespecting the sacred nature of scriptures, it is by neglect. The risk we must guard against day to day is the tendency to treat lightly, or even ignore, the sacred word. Speaking to the elders in 1832, the Lord said, reprovingly:<br><br><i>And your minds in times past have been darkened because of unbelief, and because</i> you have treated lightly the things you have received--<br><br><i>Which vanity and unbelief have brought the whole church under condemnation. ...</i><br><br>And they shall remain under this condemnation until they repent and remember the new covenant, even the Book of Mormon and the former commandments which I have given them, not only to say, but to do according to that which I have written. [D&amp;amp;C 84:54–55, 57; emphasis added]<br><br>A sense of the sacred includes an appreciation--even a love--of the scriptures. A sense of the sacred leads one to feast upon the words of Christ (see 2 Nephi 31:20; 32:3), which in turn deepens one's reverence for His words.<br><h2><b>2. The Body--a Temple of God</b></h2><br>I now turn to another example of our theme--the sacred nature of our physical bodies. As God and Christ are deserving of our reverence, so Their works are deserving of our respect and reverence. That of course includes the marvelous creation that is this earth. And yet as wonderful as this earth is, it is not the greatest of God's creations. Greater still is this marvelous physical body. It is in the very likeness of the person of God. It is essential to our earthly experience and key to our everlasting glory.<br><br>It has been my blessing to be present at the moment of the birth of each of our five children. In each instance I felt that it was a sacred experience. Clearly something divine and miraculous was taking place. I can hear my wife saying, "Easy for you to say. You weren't the one in pain." Certainly there is plenty of what we might call "real-world experience" associated with birth. To all mothers everywhere I readily admit that I didn't share your pain, and I don't pretend to understand.<br><br>But, speaking seriously, does not a woman's suffering in the creation of a physical body add to the holiness of that creation and of the woman herself? Her sacrifice further sanctifies something already holy.<br><br>Some have mistakenly supposed that, with respect to their body, they answer to no one. We are specifically told, however, that we remain accountable to God.<br><br><i>Know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your own?</i><br><br>For ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God's. [1 Corinthians 6:19–20]<br><br>"If any man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, which temple ye are" (1 Corinthians 3:17). "I beseech you therefore ..., by the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service" (Romans 12:1).<br><br>How are we to preserve the sanctity of this most important and sacred of God's creations? At a minimum, we would not in any way defile our bodies. To be specific, if we possess a sense of the sacred, we would not deface our body as with tattoos and piercings. Some wonder at the fact that the President of the Church has taken notice of this matter. They are puzzled at the directness and specificity of his counsel on this subject. He has stated:<br><br><i>A tattoo is graffiti on the temple of the body.</i><br><br>Likewise the piercing of the body for multiple rings in the ears, in the nose, even in the tongue. Can they possibly think that is beautiful? It is a passing fancy, but its effects can be permanent. ... The First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve have declared that we discourage tattoos and also "the piercing of the body for other than medical purposes." We do not, however, take any position "on the minimal piercing of the ears by women for one pair of earrings"--one pair. [Gordon B. Hinckley, in <i>CR,</i> October 2000, 70–71; or "Great Shall Be the Peace of Thy Children," <i>Ensign,</i> November 2000, 52]<br><br>Why would the prophet of God talk about things so seemingly insignificant? Because they are not insignificant. Defiling or defacing God's creation, His temple, makes a mock of that which is sacred. This can be perceived as insignificant only to one who has lost a sense of the sacred. Don't do it.<br><br>Immodest dress also tarnishes the sacredness of the human body. Many rationalizations have been put forth to justify immodest fashion and pornography. Some vigorously assert that no law can be adopted to prevent such expression and then argue that it can't be wrong because there is no law against it.<br><br>Another tired rationalization was recently dusted off and used to justify Olympic athletes posing nude for pornographic magazines. One editor stated, "These women ... have phenomenal bodies and this is an opportunity to show these bodies off" (in Steve McKee, "An Olympic Pose Isn't What It Used to Be," <i>Wall Street Journal,</i> 18 August 2004, A8). What he was really saying, of course, was, "I think I deserve to make some money off these phenomenal bodies."<br><br>Whatever the rationalizations, you will often find that the real motivation underlying immodesty is someone's desire to profit from titillation, someone's lust for money. The body is a temple of God, and pornography and revealing clothes are evidence that moneychangers are again desecrating the temple.<br><br>We could speak of the Word of Wisdom and a number of other things, but of all that could be cited as defiling the body, the most harmful, the most destructive, the most distressing act of irreverence is sexual immorality--and its cousin, sexual abuse.<br><br>One cannot imagine a more fundamental defiling of God's creation than to profane its most sacred use. You simply must not do anything of the kind. Don't even skirt around the edges. "Flee fornication. ... He that committeth fornication sinneth against his own body" (1 Corinthians 6:18). "Flee also youthful lusts" (2 Timothy 2:22). "Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to you" (James 4:8). "Resist the devil, and he will flee from you" (James 4:7). Keep your body holy as a living offering to God (see Romans 12:1).<br><h2><b>3. Sacred Places and Occasions</b></h2><br>Let's now consider for a moment the matter of sacred places and events. Speaking through the prophet Ezekiel, the Lord criticized Israel's priests for failing to teach respect for the sacred nature of certain activities and places:<br><br><i>Her priests have violated my law, and have profaned mine holy things: they have put no difference between the holy and profane, neither have they shewed difference between the unclean and the clean, and have hid their eyes from my sabbaths, and I am profaned among them.</i> [Ezekiel 22:26]<br><br>Much of what the Lord was talking about had to do with the temple. There is also reference to the Sabbath. We are used to thinking of our temples and meetinghouses as dedicated to the Lord, as sacred space. On each temple building are found, as a sober reminder, the words <i>Holiness to the Lord--the House of the Lord.</i> A sense of the sacred should lead us to act and speak with reverence in and around these buildings. It would lead us to dress a certain way when we are there.<br><br>We spoke of immodest dress as dishonoring the body, God's most sacred creation. I speak now of immodest, casual, or slovenly dress and grooming that in particular times and places mocks the sacredness of what is taking place or of the place itself.<br><br>Let me give you an example. A while back a young woman from another state came to live with some of her relatives in the Salt Lake City area for a few weeks. On her first Sunday she came to church dressed in a simple, nice blouse and knee-length skirt set off with a light, button-up sweater. She wore hose and dress shoes, and her hair was combed simply but with care. Her overall appearance created an impression of youthful grace.<br><br>Unfortunately, she immediately felt out of place. It seemed like all the other young women her age or near her age were dressed in casual skirts, some rather distant from the knee; tight T-shirt–like tops that barely met the top of their skirts at the waist (some bare instead of barely); no socks or stockings; and clunky sneakers or flip-flops.<br><br>One would have hoped that seeing the new girl, the other girls would have realized how inappropriate their manner of dress was for a chapel and for the Sabbath day and immediately changed for the better. Sad to say, however, they did not, and it was the visitor who, in order to fit in, adopted the fashion (if you can call it that) of her host ward.<br><br>It is troubling to see this growing trend that is not limited to young women but extends to older women, to men, and to young men as well. Years ago my ward in Tennessee used a high school for church services on Sundays while our chapel, which had been damaged by a tornado, was being repaired. A congregation of another faith used the same high school for their worship services while their new chapel was being constructed.<br><br>I was shocked to see what the people of this other congregation wore to church. There was not a suit or tie among the men. They appeared to have come from or to be on their way to the golf course. It was hard to spot a woman wearing a dress or anything other than very casual pants or even shorts. Had I not known that they were coming to the school for church meetings, I would have assumed that there was some kind of sporting event taking place.<br><br>The dress of our ward members compared very favorably to this bad example, but I am beginning to think that we are no longer quite so different as more and more we seem to slide toward that lower standard. We used to use the phrase "Sunday best." People understood that to mean the nicest clothes they had. The specific clothing would vary according to different cultures and economic circumstances, but it would be their best.<br><br>It is an affront to God to come into His house, especially on His holy day, not groomed and dressed in the most careful and modest manner that our circumstances permit. Where a poor member from the hills of Peru must ford a river to get to church, the Lord surely will not be offended by the stain of muddy water on his white shirt.<br><br>But how can God not be pained at the sight of one who, with all the clothes he needs and more and with easy access to the chapel, nevertheless appears in church in rumpled cargo pants and a T-shirt? Ironically, it has been my experience as I travel around the world that members of the Church with the least means somehow find a way to arrive at Sabbath meetings neatly dressed in clean, nice clothes, the best they have, while those who have more than enough are the ones who may appear in casual, even slovenly clothing.<br><br>Some say dress and hair don't matter--it's what's inside that counts. I believe that truly it is what's inside a person that counts, but that's what worries me. Casual dress at holy places and events is a message about what is inside a person. It may be pride or rebellion or something else, but at a minimum it says, "I don't get it. I don't understand the difference between the sacred and the profane." In that condition they are easily drawn away from the Lord. They do not appreciate the value of what they have. I worry about them. Unless they can gain some understanding and capture some feeling for sacred things, they are at risk of eventually losing all that matters most. You are Saints of the great latter-day dispensation--look the part.<br><br>These principles apply as well to activities and events that are themselves sacred or are related to things that deserve reverence--priesthood ordinances, for example: baptisms, confirmations, ordinations, administration of the sacrament of the Lord's Supper, blessings of the sick, and so forth. The Doctrine and Covenants tells us that in the ordinances of the priesthood "the power of godliness is manifest" (D&amp;amp;C 84:20).<br><br>Alma says that<br><br><i>these ordinances were given ... that thereby the people might look forward on the Son of God, it being a type of his order, or it being his order, and this that they might look forward to him for a remission of their sins, that they might enter into the rest of the Lord.</i> [Alma 13:16]<br><br>I appreciate both those who perform these ordinances and those who witness or receive them when they show respect for the priesthood and the sacred nature of what is occurring.<br><br>I appreciate priests, teachers, and deacons who wear dress shirts and ties to officiate in the administration of the sacrament.<br><br>I appreciate men who put on a shirt and tie, when the circumstances permit, to bless the sick. I appreciate those who attend the ordination of a man to a priesthood office who dress in their Sunday best no matter what day or where the ordination takes place. They are all demonstrating an appreciation and respect for God and for the event. They are demonstrating a sense of the sacred.<br><br>Just as it is sacred when a life comes into being, so it is a sacred time when mortal life comes to an end. And I believe the same is true with respect to the most important act that can occur in life--marriage, especially eternal marriage. For this reason it is disconcerting to see how people are becoming careless, even irreverent and disrespectful, in speech, dress, and conduct when they participate in events related to death and marriage.<br><br>Some funeral services become occasions for lightmindedness and inappropriate humor. Personal remembrances, quite appropriate in moderation, can occupy an hour or two while the Atonement and Resurrection of the Lord and His plan of salvation receive only a passing mention, if any.<br><br>Occasionally at weddings and often at wedding receptions, people arrive in very casual clothing. It is as if they cannot be bothered to clean up from their work or recreation of that day. By their dress they are saying that the marriage they have been invited to honor is of little significance.<br><br>Recently I read a note from a man who was urging his companions to wear a coat and tie when they appeared together at a public event honoring their organization and what it had accomplished. Their service was civic, not religious in nature, and we would not term it sacred, but he understood the principle that some things deserve respect and that our manner of dress is a part of that expression. He said he was going to dress more formally "not because I'm important, but because this occasion is so important." His comment states an important truth. It is really not about us. Acting and dressing in a way to honor sacred events and places is about God.<br><h2><b>4. Speech</b></h2><br>Turning to another issue, there are matters of speech that have to do with a sense of the sacred. That we are responsible for what we say is clear from the Lord's statement "that every idle word that men shall speak, they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment" (Matthew 12:36). King Benjamin warns us to watch our thoughts and our words (see Mosiah 4:30), and Alma declares that without repentance, when we are judged, "our words will condemn us, yea ...; we shall not be found spotless" (Alma 12:14).<br><br>You know by your own experience that the world is growing more profane, more coarse in speech, but we cannot suffer ourselves to fall into that pattern. Cursing and coarse language mock God and Christ and Their creations. We must never be guilty of mocking the Savior, as happened at His Crucifixion.<br><br><i>And they that passed by railed on him, wagging their heads, and saying, Ah, thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest it in three days,</i><br><br>Save thyself, and come down from the cross.<br><br>Likewise also the chief priests mocking said among themselves with the scribes, He saved others; himself he cannot save.<br><br>Let Christ the King of Israel descend now from the cross, that we may see and believe. And they that were crucified with him reviled him. [Mark 15:29–32]<br><br>The condemnation of the sons of perdition is that they have "crucified [Christ] unto themselves and put him to an open shame" (D&amp;amp;C 76:35). We cannot risk anything of the kind in our speech. We cannot afford to speak His name or in His name lightly or carelessly.<br><br>In the Doctrine and Covenants we read this instruction and warning:<br><br><i>Behold, I am Alpha and Omega, even Jesus Christ.</i><br><br>Wherefore, let all men beware how they take my name in their lips--<br><br>For behold, verily I say, that many there be who are under this condemnation, who use the name of the Lord, and use it in vain, having not authority. ...<br><br>Remember that that which cometh from above is sacred, and must be spoken with care, and by constraint of the Spirit; ... and ye receive the Spirit through prayer; wherefore, without this there remaineth condemnation. [D&amp;amp;C 63:60–62, 64]<br><br>Although we have authority to use the name of Jesus Christ, we must do it carefully. His name and "that which cometh from above is sacred, and must be spoken with care, and by constraint of the Spirit." We should remember this when we are called upon to speak in church or when we bear testimony.<br><br>We know that in these situations we are expected to close "in the name of Jesus Christ," meaning that what we have said, we say in His name. Therefore, we must take special care what we say and how we say it. There is no room for silliness or foolish speech. Above all, we must seek the Spirit through prayer so that we speak by constraint of the Spirit and avoid condemnation.<br><br>I have noted that President Gordon B. Hinckley often ends his talks "in the <i>sacred</i> name of Jesus Christ." I am not suggesting that you should do the same; I don't believe that is what he intends or that it would be appropriate for us routinely to do so. Rather, I am calling your attention to the fact that the prophet senses deeply the responsibility of speaking in the name of the Lord, and it is sacred to him. He uses and speaks in that name reverently, and that is the example we should follow.<br><h2><b>5. Godly Fear</b></h2><br>My final example could go under the heading "godly fear." There are many places in the scriptures that counsel mankind to fear God. In our day we generally interpret the word <i>fear</i> as "respect" or "reverence" or "love"; that is, the fear of God means the love of God or respect for Him and His law. That may often be a correct reading, but I wonder if sometimes <i>fear</i> doesn't really mean <i>fear,</i> as when the prophets speak of fearing to offend God by breaking His commandments.<br><br>Consider, for example, this proverb: "And by the fear of the Lord men depart from evil" (Proverbs 16:6). Job was described as a perfect and upright man, "one that feared God, and eschewed evil" (Job 1:1). A good example of this attitude would be Joseph in Egypt. When Potiphar's wife attempted to seduce him, Joseph responded, "How then can I do this great wickedness, and sin against God?" (Genesis 39:9). He was afraid to sin against God. Many today would regard Joseph's reaction as na�ve. They would laugh at his lack of sophistication, being themselves unafraid to sin against God.<br><br>Joseph Smith was once corrected for not showing sufficient concern for God's desires. The Lord said to him: "You should not have feared man more than God. Although men set at naught the counsels of God, and despise his words--Yet you should have been faithful" (D&amp;amp;C 3:7–8).<br><br>I submit that fear of the Lord, or what Paul calls "godly fear" (Hebrews 12:28), should be part of our reverence for Him. We should so love and reverence Him that we fear doing anything wrong in His sight, whatever may be the opinions of or pressure from others. Moroni urges us, "Begin as in times of old, and come unto the Lord with all your heart, and work out your own salvation with fear and trembling before him" (Mormon 9:27).<br><br>Because the world around us generally ignores God, it is easy for us at times to forget that our responsibility to know and do His will is constant. Most do not realize, or do not believe, that in a future day each of us must account to the Lord for his or her life: thoughts, words, and actions. Working out our own salvation with fear and trembling means striving in the decisions and activities of life day by day to prepare what will be a good accounting.<br><br>Having been blessed to receive what we have received, we can advance spiritually as no other people, but we are also at greater risk than any others. We cannot commit the sins they do without coming under a greater condemnation, for if we sin, we sin against a greater light. We cannot trifle with the sacred things committed to our care and be considered innocent as those who know not God.<br><br>God is feeling after us to see if we will prove faithful, and if we have the integrity and sensitivity to honor sacred things, we will receive even more. But if not, our blessings will turn to our condemnation. The right attitude or pattern is that stated by the Lord in the Doctrine and Covenants:<br><br><i>Wherefore he that prayeth, whose spirit is contrite, the same is accepted of me if he obey mine ordinances.</i><br><br>He that speaketh, whose spirit is contrite, whose language is meek and edifieth, the same is of God if he obey mine ordinances.<br><br>And again, he that trembleth under my power shall be made strong, and shall bring forth fruits of praise and wisdom, according to the revelations and truths which I have given you. [D&amp;amp;C 52:15–17]<br><br>Accept the fatherly plea of Alma to Corianton:<br><br><i>O my son, I desire that ye should deny the justice of God no more</i> [by supposing that there is not or should not be any punishment of the sinner]. <i>Do not endeavor to excuse yourself in the least point because of your sins, by denying the justice of God; but do ... let the justice of God, and his mercy, and his long-suffering have full sway in your heart; and let it bring you down to the dust in humility.</i> [Alma 42:30]<br><h2><b>A Caution</b></h2><br>I end with a word of caution to you. With a deepening reverence for sacred things, your understanding grows. The scriptures speak of it as a light that grows "brighter and brighter until the perfect day" (D&amp;amp;C 50:24). That process is also described as progressing from grace to grace. The Savior Himself progressed in that way until He received a fulness, and you may follow in His footsteps (see D&amp;amp;C 93:12–20).<br><br>That is where a sense of the sacred will lead you. Always remember, however, as holiness grows within and you are entrusted with greater knowledge and understanding that you must treat these things with care. We read earlier the scripture affirming that that which comes from above is sacred and must be spoken with care and by constraint of the Spirit. The Lord also commanded, rather bluntly, that we must not cast pearls before swine or give that which is holy to dogs (see 3 Nephi 14:6; D&amp;amp;C 41:6), meaning sacred things should not be disclosed or discussed with those who are not prepared to appreciate their value and who may even attack rather than appreciate them.<br><br>Be wise with what the Lord gives you. It is a trust. You would not, for example, indiscriminately share the content of your patriarchal blessing.<br><br>President Boyd K. Packer once counseled:<br><br><i>I have come to believe also that it is not wise to continually talk of unusual spiritual experiences. They are to be guarded with care and shared only when the Spirit itself prompts us to use them to the blessing of others.</i><br><br>I am ever mindful of Alma's words:<br><br>"It is given unto many to know the mysteries of God; nevertheless they are laid under a strict command that they shall not impart only according to the portion of his word which he doth grant unto the children of men, according to the heed and diligence which they give unto him. (Alma 12:9.)"<br><br>I heard President [Marion G.] <i>Romney once counsel mission presidents and their wives in Geneva. "I do not tell all I know. I have never told my wife all I know, for I found out that if I talked too lightly of sacred things, thereafter the Lord would not trust me."</i><br><br>We are, I believe, to keep these things and ponder them in our hearts, as Luke said Mary did of the supernal events that surrounded the birth of Jesus. (See Luke 2:19.) [<i>"That All May Be Edified"</i> (Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1982), 337]<br><br>All things sacred and holy are to be revealed and brought together in this last and most wonderful dispensation. With the Restoration of the gospel, the Church, and the priesthood of Jesus Christ, we hold an almost incomprehensible store of sacred things in our hands. It is almost too great a blessing that we have been born now, at a time and in places where the monumental blessings that past prophets have dreamed of and longed for would come into our lives. We cannot neglect or let them slip away.<br><br>Rather than drifting into carelessness, may your life be one of increasing exactness in obedience. I hope you will think and feel and dress and act in ways that show reverence and respect for sacred things, sacred places, sacred occasions.<br><br>It is my prayer that a sense of the sacred will distill upon your soul as the dews from heaven. May it draw you close to Jesus Christ, who died, who was resurrected, who lives, who is your Redeemer. May He make you holy as He is holy, that you may sit down in His kingdom "to go no more out" (Alma 7:25). In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>D.

<h1>ll It Lead? - Dallin H. Oaks - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
My dear brothers and sisters--students, teachers, and friends--I am glad to be here today. I love BYU and its people. Provo is the city of my birth. Many of the best years of my life have been spent on this campus--15 years, counting my two years at B.Y. High School on what was then the lower campus. I graduated from BYU 50 years ago this last June. It is obvious why it always thrills me to return to this campus.<br><br>Today I will speak about some lessons of life, hoping to help each of us--especially young people--with some choices we all make along the road of life.<br><br>A good news/bad news story introduces my subject. A pilot on the intercom gave his passengers this in-flight message: "I have good news and bad news. The good news is that we're making good time. The bad news is that we've had an equipment failure, and we're not sure we're headed in the right direction."<br><br>The direction in which we are headed is critically important, especially at the beginning of our journey. I have a friend who concluded his career as a pilot flying long routes across the Pacific for a major airline. He told me that an error of only two degrees in the course set on the 4,500-mile, direct-line flight from Chicago to Hilo, Hawaii, would cause the plane to miss that island by more than 145 miles to the south. If it were not a clear day, the pilot could not even see the island, and there would be nothing but ocean until you got to Australia. But of course you wouldn't get to Australia, because you wouldn't have that much fuel. Small errors in direction can cause large tragedies in destination.<br><br>All of us--and especially young people--need to be very careful about the paths we choose and the directions in which we set our lives. What seem to be only small deviations in direction or small detours from the straight and narrow path can result in huge differences in position down the road of life.<br><br>In the general priesthood meeting last month, I told about a friend of many years who told me that her husband, always a "good kid" in high school, took a few drinks he thought would help him forget some problems. Before he knew what was happening, he was addicted. Now he is not able to support his family, and he is ineffective at almost everything he tries to do. Alcohol governs his life, and he cannot seem to break free of its grip. The way to avoid being addicted is to avoid even the first step--totally refraining from all addictive substances and practices.<br><br>Potentially destructive deviations often seem so small that some find it easy to justify "just this once." When that temptation arises--as it will--I urge you to ask yourself, "Where will it lead?" I have chosen that question as the title of my message today. I will give some illustrations that teach the value of asking that question. I will also share some personal experiences that illustrate the long-term importance of some seemingly small differences in present choices.<br><br>Here is a hypothetical. You are home with your children. A person you don't want to talk to is calling on the phone or coming to the door. You are tempted to have the children tell them you are not home. "Where will it lead?" If you do this, you are showing your children that you will lie to gain an advantage, and you are teaching them how to do the same. You are weakening their faith that they can trust you to tell the truth. You are also casting doubt on the validity of the commandment not to lie and on the prophets who taught that commandment. You are even diminishing faith in the existence of the God whose commandment it is. Where will this lead? It will set in motion a succession of consequences that can be severely destructive of efforts to achieve eternal blessings.<br><br>In our last general conference, Bishop H. David Burton reminded us that in raising children and providing for their needs and desires, more is not always better. Parents who overindulge their children with material goods and privileges run the risk of not teaching them "important values like hard work, delayed gratification, honesty, and compassion." Where will this lead? It will deprive children of important opportunities for learning and growth. "Children devoid of responsibilities risk never learning that . . . life has meaning beyond their own happiness," Bishop Burton said. He then concluded that parents need to help their children build "the qualities that come from waiting, sharing, saving, working hard, and making do with what we have" ("More Holiness Give Me," <i>Ensign,</i> November 2004, 98, 100).<br><br>The wrong course is also set with another kind of parental indulgence. Some parents seem to have the attitude that their children can do no wrong. They defend them against any criticism, correction, or painful experience from anyone outside the family circle. A low grade in school or a correction from a leader calls forth a storm of public or private criticism from a parent who will defend a child at all costs. Where will this lead? It will undercut a child's respect for authority--any authority--and it will diminish the respect necessary for the student to learn from the teacher. Parents who consider where such actions will lead will support authority and back up their child's teachers in all but the most exceptional circumstances.<br><br>There are positive examples of the same principle. I recall a story told by Elder Harold B. Lee in a devotional address here at BYU 52 years ago last month. (Incidentally, I was a student at BYU that year--1952.) His story has had a significant impact on me for several reasons. I quote Elder Lee:<br><br><i>I was around ten or eleven years of age. I was with my father out on a farm away from our home, trying to spend the day busying myself until my father was ready to go home. Over the fence from our place were some tumbledown sheds that would attract a curious boy, and I was adventurous. I started to climb through the fence, and I heard a voice as clearly as you are hearing mine, calling me by name and saying, "Don't go over there!" I turned to look at my father to see if he were talking to me, but he was way up at the other end of the field. There was no person in sight. I realized then, as a child, that there were persons beyond my sight, for I had definitely heard a voice. Since then, when I hear or read stories of the Prophet Joseph Smith, I too have known what it means to hear a voice, because I've had the experience.</i> [In Harold B. Lee, <i>Stand Ye in Holy Places</i> (Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1975), 139]<br><br>Consider some of the effects of that experience. First, it taught the reality of revelation to a young boy who was to become a prophet. Second, it may have protected young Harold from some hidden danger in those old sheds. That was the way I interpreted the story for many years, and perhaps that is true. We will never know. But perhaps the warning he heard was not to protect him from danger. Perhaps it was to test his willingness to be obedient to heavenly guidance. Surely he passed the test, and where did that lead? It kept the channel of revelation open for further guidance, and it was a formative experience in the life of one of our greatest teachers. Following an impression may seem a small thing now, but where it leads can be immensely important.<br><br>Following an impression saved my life in the mountains about 10 miles from here. I had been hunting deer, just this time of year about 25 years ago. In the late afternoon I shot a large buck. I cleaned the animal and secured the carcass where it would be preserved until I returned to carry it out with helpers the next day. By this time it was dark, I was alone, and I was still high in the mountains several miles from the nearest road.<br><br>Though I had never been on this particular mountainside, I was not lost. I knew the general location, and I knew that all I had to do was keep walking down and eventually this would lead me to a familiar road. The problem was the pitch darkness of the moonless night.<br><br>I chose a gully and started to feel my way down through the brush and deadfall. It was slow going, so I was relieved when the gully flattened out to a sandy bottom beneath my feet. I picked up my pace for about 10 steps and suddenly had a strong impression to stop. I did. Reaching down, I took a rock and tossed it out into the darkness ahead of me. I heard no sound for a few seconds, and then there was a clatter on the rocks a long distance away. I knew immediately that I was standing on the lip of a sheer drop-off.<br><br>I retraced my steps and eventually got down the mountain by another gully. I phoned my worried family close to midnight, just before they called for a search party. The next day I revisited that spot in daylight and saw my tracks, which stopped just two or three feet from a drop-off of at least 50 feet. I was glad I had heard and heeded a warning. Where did that lead? It saved my life.<br><br>Now I invite you to think about some seemingly small decisions you are making in your life that would benefit from your asking "Where will it lead?"<br><br>As an example of things to avoid, consider the terrible consequences of partaking of anything that can be addictive. This includes not only tobacco and the alcohol that enslaved my friend's husband but also the avalanche of pornographic material that assaults our senses on the Internet and in the popular entertainment, including movies and videos. Where does sampling this garbage lead? Church leaders and professionals alike affirm that it leads to the destruction of earthly and eternal family relationships--and sometimes even to prison sentences for abusive behavior. Get mixed up with this garbage and it will lead you to the landfill--the dumping ground of temporal dreams and eternal destinies.<br><br>Here is something else to avoid, a suggestion aimed especially at those of us who are married. When disagreements occur--as they will--and you are tempted to run away from your spouse for a short or longer time, ask yourself, "Where will it lead?" An angry departure is the first step toward something you don't want to pursue. So retrace your steps and heal the wounds before they become infected and lead to serious injuries or worse.<br><br>As an example of things we encourage and where they will lead, consider the daily scripture study we have been taught to incorporate into our lives. Where does that lead? How about twice-daily personal prayers and a kneeling family prayer? There is enormous spiritual and temporal protection in each of these practices because they are essential to the companionship of the Holy Ghost, who guides us and strengthens us spiritually. I can assure you that faithful observance of these guidelines will lead us closer to the Lord, and their omission will lead us away from Him.<br><br>The same is true of holding weekly family home evenings. These are vital for the children some of you now have and most of you will have in time to come. Such basic endeavors may seem small things now, but they sow the seeds that will bring a good harvest in the future.<br><br>This reminds me of a verse composed by Douglas MacArthur when he was superintendent of West Point almost a century ago. MacArthur, a great believer in the importance of athletic competition in preparing future military officers for their professional duties, authored these words and ordered them carved on the stone portals of the Military Academy's athletic facility:<br><br><i>Upon the fields of friendly strife</i><br><br><i>Are sown the seeds</i><br><br><i>That, upon other fields, on other days</i><br><br><i>Will bear the fruits of victory.</i><br><br>[Quoted in William Manchester, <i>American Caesar</i> (Boston: Little, Brown, 1978), 123]<br><br>After hearing that verse, some of you are probably thinking that MacArthur was a better general than he was a poet. Yes, but his point is sound. The same qualities of integrity, training, preparation, obedience, and reliability that produce victory in friendly athletic competition will see us on to victory and success when the stakes are larger.<br><br>To cite another example, how about the effects of failure to conform to the BYU Code of Honor and the BYU Dress and Grooming Standards after promising to observe them? It is not a small thing to break a promise, deliberately <i>or</i> carelessly. And where will it lead? It will drag down the appearance and standards and reputation of the Church's university; it will encourage others to do likewise; and it will weaken the offender's own moral fiber needed for the future, larger challenges he or she will face.<br><br>We often hear about the choice between good and evil. For example, most students will have to choose sometime between plagiarism or cheating to get a higher grade or relying on honest personal efforts to get what we deserve from our own preparation and qualifications.<br><br>Other choices are not between good and evil. The most familiar choices we face are between two goods, and here, too, it is desirable to ask where it will lead. We make many such choices in what we will do on the Sabbath, which television programs we will watch, which job offer to accept, what to read, and--on a very broad front--how to spend our time. All of these will profit from thoughtful and habitual measurement against the standard of "Where will it lead?"<br><br>Sometimes the choice is not between two different actions but between action and inaction. Should I speak up or remain silent? Should I allow my loved one to pursue a course I know to be injurious and let them learn by experience or should I intervene to save him or her from that experience? Again, it is useful to ask ourselves, "Where will it lead?"<br><br>Here I recall an event described by a man I met at a stake conference in the Midwest more than a decade ago. The setting was a beautiful campus in central Illinois. My informant, a participant in a summer workshop, saw a crowd of young students seated on the grass in a large semicircle about 20 feet from one of the large hardwood trees that are so common and so beautiful there. They were watching something at the base of the tree. He turned aside from his walk to see what it was.<br><br>There was a handsome tree squirrel with a large, bushy tail playing around the base of the tree--now on the ground, now up and down and around the trunk. But why would that beautiful but familiar sight attract a crowd of students?<br><br>Stretched out prone on the grass nearby was an Irish setter. He was the object of the students' interest, and, though he pretended otherwise, the squirrel was the object of his. Each time the squirrel was momentarily out of sight circling the tree or looking in another direction, the setter would quickly creep forward a few inches and then resume his apparent indifferent posture. Each minute or two he crept closer to the squirrel, and the squirrel apparently did not notice. This was the scene that held the students' interest. They were silent and immobile, attention riveted on the drama--the probable outcome of which was becoming increasingly obvious.<br><br>Finally the setter was close enough to bound at the squirrel and catch it in his mouth. A gasp of horror arose, and the crowd of students surged forward and wrested the beautiful little animal away from the hound, but it was too late. The squirrel was dead.<br><br>Anyone in that crowd of students could have warned the squirrel at any time by waving their arms or crying out, but none had done so. They just watched while the inevitable consequence got closer and closer. No one asked "Where will this lead?" and no one wished to interfere. When the predicable outcome occurred, they rushed to the defense, but it was too late. Tearful and regretful expressions were all they could offer.<br><br>That true story is a parable of sorts. It has a lesson for things we see in our own lives, in the lives of those around us, and in the events occurring in our cities, states, and nations. In all these areas we can see threats creeping up on things we love, and we cannot afford to be indifferent or quiet. We must be ever vigilant to ask "Where will it lead?" and to sound appropriate warnings or join appropriate preventive efforts while there is still time. Often we cannot prevent the outcome, but we can remove ourselves from the crowd who, by failing to try to intervene, has complicity in the outcome.<br><br>Four other subjects have occurred to me as I have pondered the application of asking "Where will it lead?" All of these concern public policy rather than private morality. However, each is a subject where our private choices and influence can contribute to the public good. Each is important to the public environment in which we live.<br><br>First, I am concerned about the current overemphasis on rights and underemphasis on responsibilities. Where will this lead in our public life? No society is so strong that it can support continued increases in citizen rights while neglecting to foster comparable increases in citizen responsibilities or obligations. Yet our legal system continues to recognize new rights even as we increasingly ignore old responsibilities. For example, so-called no-fault divorces--which give either spouse the right to dissolve a marriage at will--have obscured the vital importance of responsibilities in marriage. Similarly, I believe it is a delusion to think that we help children by defining and enforcing their rights. We do more for children by trying to reinforce the responsibilities of parents--natural and adoptive--even when those responsibilities are not legally enforceable.<br><br>The same principles apply in public life. We cannot raise our public well-being by adding to our inventory of individual rights. Civic responsibilities like honesty, self-reliance, participation in the democratic process, and devotion to the common good are essential to the governance and preservation of our country. Currently we are increasing rights and weakening responsibilities, and it is leading our nation down the road toward moral and civic bankruptcy. If we are to raise our general welfare, we must strengthen our sense of individual responsibility for the welfare of others and the good of society at large. (See Dallin H. Oaks, "Rights and Responsibilities," <i>Mercer Law Review,</i> 36 [1984–85], no. 1 [fall 1984]: 427–42.)<br><br>Second is the matter of diminished readership of newspapers and books. The circulation and readership of daily newspapers in the United States is declining significantly, even while our population is increasing. Specifically, the per capita circulation of newspapers in the U.S. in the last 30 years has declined from 300 to 190 per 1,000 population. To cite another measure, in the four years ended in 2002 the percent of those ages 25 to 34 who have read a newspaper during the past week (either in hand or on the Internet) fell by almost 10 percentage points--from more than 86 percent in 1988 to less than 77 percent by 2002 (U.S. Census Bureau, <i>Statistical Abstract of the United States: 1989</i> [109th ed.], table no. 901; and <i>Statistical Abstract of the United States: 2003</i> [123rd ed.], table no. 1127). The proportion of adults who read books has also declined significantly in recent years (see National Endowment for the Arts, <i>Reading at Risk: A Survey of Literary Reading in America,</i> Research Division Report #46, June 2004, Washington, D.C. [www.nea.gov/pub/ReadingAtRisk.pdf]; and Christina McCarroll, "New on the Endangered Species List: The Bookworm," <i>Christian Science Monitor,</i> 12 July 2004, 1–3).<br><br>Why are these trends of concern? More and more people are not reading the news of the world around them or about the important issues of the day. They apparently rely on what others tell them or on the sound bites of television news, where even the most significant subjects rarely get more than 60 seconds. Where will this lead? It is leading us to a less concerned, less thoughtful, and less informed citizenry, and that results in less responsive and less responsible government.<br><br>A third concern is with what is being taught or not being taught in the schools that shapes the thinking and values of those who will be our future leaders. I refer to public schools, private schools, and ministerial schools. I fear that some of the values being taught or not being taught to the young people who will be speaking for us from the public and religious pulpits of our nation in a few years are significantly different from the values that have shaped this nation and its people. I have the same fear about what is being taught by TV programs, which command so much of our youth's time.<br><br>After the recent election I read that one in five voters in nationwide exit polls said that moral issues were the most important consideration in casting their votes. Many of us vote on the basis of our concerns with the position of our public officials on moral issues, but what are we doing to register similar concerns with the values of some of those who are teaching our future leaders? Failure to give attention to this concern will lead us away from civic virtue, civic responsibility, and overall prosperity.<br><br>My fourth concern is with the destruction of trust in public figures and public officials. This is fresh on our minds after the recent ugliness of many election campaigns, but it is also a familiar feature of current television programming. So much of public discourse and media coverage and entertainment seems to consist of content that will destroy trust in those persons and offices that should function as moral guides for young and old in our society. Many of the messages of some recent candidates seem intended to discredit the character of another candidate rather than to promote a serious discussion of the important issues on which the electorate should register their choices. Similarly, in so-called entertainment shows we often see the authority figure portrayed as scheming, dishonest, and unworthy of trust.<br><br>Discredit authority figures--whether public officials, teachers, ministers, or others--and where will it lead? It will encourage doubts about the laws and rules and principles they administer, and it will lead to skepticism about or withdrawal from the ties that bind us together as a society, a family, or a private organization. I pray that this will not be so, and I pray for a return to public discourse that is less divisive and more supportive and respectful of authority figures and the values that have built our nation.<br><br>Where will it lead? I've suggested this as a valuable question against which we can measure many personal and private decisions. It is also a way of bearing testimony. Where does faith in the Lord Jesus Christ lead? Where does the gospel lead? I quote from the Doctrine and Covenants the word of the Lord to His people in this dispensation:<br><br><i>Seek to bring forth and establish my Zion. Keep my commandments in all things.</i><br><br><i>And, if you keep my commandments and endure to the end you shall have eternal life, which gift is the greatest of all the gifts of God.</i> [D&amp;amp;C 14:6–7]<br><br>I testify of Jesus Christ who is our Savior. I testify of the truth of the gospel of Jesus Christ, which will lead us to eternal life. I testify that we are led by a prophet. This is the Lord's church and His gospel in which we can place trust that it will lead us to eternal life. And I say this in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Dallin H.

<h1>&#039;s Goods - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Brothers and sisters, I am grateful for this opportunity to speak to you today. When I learned I would be speaking and told my daughter Amelia she might be asked to pray, she said, "If I am, I hope I say the opening prayer instead of the closing prayer."<br><br>When I asked why, my wife said, "That's so she can ask Heavenly Father to really, really, really bless you."<br><br>To that Amelia said, "No, I just don't want to be under the burden of having to listen."<br><br>Now that Amelia has prayed, I would appreciate it if you would watch her carefully to make sure she at least stays awake.<br><br>At the outset I gratefully acknowledge that what Amelia will hear today has been improved by comments from friends and family who have read earlier versions of my talk. Despite those improvements I invite all of you to continue to pray in your hearts for me--and for you--that we may communicate through the Spirit and be edified together. That way I will give a better talk than I have on paper, and you will hear a better talk than I give.<br><br>I want to start by bearing testimony that God lives, that Jesus Christ is His literal Son, and that Joseph Smith is the prophet of this dispensation, the dispensation of the fullness of times. I also bear witness that we are led by a prophet today, Gordon B. Hinckley. These are things I am grateful to know. Having these truths in mind is important for my topic today and, for that matter, for all topics we discuss at BYU.<br><br>As you heard, I teach corporate finance in the Marriott School. There is in finance a well-known problem called the principal-agent conflict. The conflict arises when managers of a firm and owners have different incentives. When that happens, managers may make decisions that benefit themselves at the expense of owners. To minimize this problem, owners attempt, often unsuccessfully, to devise compensation schemes that align the interests of managers with those of the owners.<br><br>This problem is presented in a gospel setting in chapter 25 of Matthew in the so-called parable of the talents. You recall that before departing on a journey into a far country, a man called his servants together and gave a number of talents to each one according to his ability. After a long absence the man returned and settled his accounts, rewarding each servant according to how he had used the talents he had received.<br><br>An important key to understanding this parable is in the first line. It reads, with my emphasis and interpolation, as follows: "For the kingdom of heaven [not an earthly kingdom, but the kingdom of heaven] is as a man [the Lord] travelling into a far country, who called his own servants [not the servants of another household, but his own servants, servants who had agreed to abide by the rules of his kingdom], and delivered unto them his goods [not their own goods and not the goods of another master, but the goods of the Lord of the kingdom of heaven]" (Matthew 25:14; emphasis added). With this interpretation and emphasis, the first line of this parable clearly indicates that the parable applies directly to us as Latter-day Saints. As members of the Lord's Church, or earthly kingdom, we aspire to become members of His heavenly kingdom. He has given us His goods to enable us to make that transition. How we deal with those goods will determine how successful we become.<br><br>For that reason I want to speak today about the importance of using the Lord's goods wisely. Later in the parable those goods are called talents, which we often associate with money or with aptitude or ability. However, for my purposes, I prefer the phrase "the Lord's goods" because it implies accountability on our part for the way we use what really belongs to the Lord.<br><br>I will talk specifically about money and service, but I acknowledge that there are many other good illustrations of what I have to say. In fact, I strongly believe that the goods the Lord gave His servants in the parable were spiritual gifts, gifts to help His servants develop attributes of deity. However, we can observe much about a person's feelings for spiritual gifts by his or her approach toward money and service. Therefore, I use these seemingly temporal gifts as illustrations of a more general theme.<br><br>A few years ago I was in an endowment session at the Provo Temple when the thought occurred to me that I should offer my students a different experience on their final exam. Specifically, I thought to give them a choice of finals. One alternative was for them to take the regular final, dealing with issues we had discussed that semester. The test would be a comprehensive, take-home, open-book, open-note, but closed-neighbor experience. Students from earlier semesters had taken from 4 to 12 hours to complete this final, and I anticipated that these students would require a similar amount of time. The final would account for 50 percent of the total grade and, thus, could have a major impact on each student's formal reward for his or her efforts in the class.<br><br>The alternative final would allow students to keep the grades they had earned to that point in the semester that came from individual scores on weekly quizzes and from the score on a formal case analysis each group had submitted. To keep their current grades, students had to spend four hours serving someone they wouldn't otherwise have been able to serve, and they had to spend two hours reading the scriptures and other Church literature to learn what the Lord has said about the accumulation and disposition of wealth. The students also had to write a report on their service and reading and submit it to me electronically. Including the time to write up the reports, I estimate that most of 126 students who took the alternative final spent between seven and eight hours on it. One student spent 20 hours on the service portion alone because, in his words, the service became "addictive."<br><br>As for me, I spent more time reading these finals than I would have the regular final. At times, what I read brought tears to my eyes. On a regular final, that would not be a good sign. For this final, however, my tears were tears of gratitude.<br><br>I will refer later to some of what my students had to say, but first I want to do what I asked them to do: namely, to examine what the scriptures say about the accumulation and disposition of wealth. I begin by referring to the scripture in 1 Corinthians 10:24, which reads, "Let no man seek his own, but every man another's wealth." Of particular interest in this scripture is the footnote by the word wealth, which tells us that in the Joseph Smith Translation the Prophet changed the word wealth to the word good. Thus the scripture should read, "Let not man seek therefore his own, but every man another's good" (JST, 1 Corinthians 10:24). The idea that each of us should be concerned about the welfare of others and that only by so doing can we truly find wealth is fundamental to an understanding of the gospel of Jesus Christ.<br><br>The idea suggests that in the parable of the talents, or the parable of the Lord's goods, part of our responsibility is to enlarge not only our own portion of those goods but also the portion enjoyed by others. This idea is consistent with the statement in the parable that the servant who did not increase his talent failed to place it with "the exchangers" (Matthew 25:27). It is also consistent with the statement in the Doctrine and Covenants: "To some is given one [spiritual gift], and to some . . . another, that all may be profited thereby" (D&amp;amp;C 46:12).<br><br>This principle holds not only in sharing spiritual gifts but also in caring for each other temporally. In section 104 of the Doctrine and Covenants, verses 15 through 17, the Lord stated:<br><br>And it is my purpose to provide for my saints, for all things are mine.<br><br>But it must needs be done in mine own way; and behold this is the way that I, the Lord, have decreed to provide for my saints, that the poor shall be exalted, in that the rich are made low.<br><br>For the earth is full, and there is enough and to spare; yea, I prepared all things, and have given unto the children of men to be agents unto themselves.<br><br>The reason the Lord's way to provide for His Saints is to exalt the poor by making the rich low is that it bears record of Him. In our premortal existence the Father's plan called for a Savior. It called for someone who, though He be the Son of God, would "go forth, suffering pains and afflictions and temptations of every kind" and would "take upon him the pains and the sicknesses of his people" and "their infirmities" and even "death." Why? So that "he may loose the bands of death" and "that his bowels may be filled with mercy [and] that he may know according to the flesh how to succor his people according to their infirmities" (Alma 7:11–12).<br><br>It was to this invitation to descend below all things that Christ voluntarily responded, "Here am I, send me" (Abraham 3:27). Because of that response, the Lord, the richest of all earth's inhabitants, came to earth and did descend below all things that we, the poor, might be exalted through His sacrifice and our obedience to His commandments. His way of saving us temporally is a type or shadow or witness of the way He saves us spiritually. It is His way. He has no other.<br><br>When we sacrifice to provide for each other in the Lord's way, we show gratitude for His sacrifice, and we bear record of it. Whether it be through fast offerings, the Perpetual Education Fund, humanitarian services, or any other worthy means, we do it in the "similitude of the sacrifice of the Only Begotten of the Father," just as Adam did when he offered the firstlings of his flock (Moses 5:7). "All things [both spiritual and temporal] are . . . made to bear record of [the Savior]" (Moses 6:63). All things, including His plan to provide for His Saints temporally, are spiritual unto Him (see D&amp;amp;C 29:34).<br><br>When we participate in His plan, we are standing in His stead. He is teaching us how to save souls. He is giving us one of His goods. He is teaching us to become "saviors," because we are doing for others what they cannot do for themselves, just like He did for us what we cannot do for ourselves. As His gift was voluntary, so must ours be if it is to have the sanctifying effect it is intended to have. That is why He has made us "agents" unto ourselves.<br><br>Of course, not everyone is equally able to make such offerings, but the offerings we make may frequently be determined more by our attitude than by our ability. To illustrate, I'll read what one of my students had to say about his parents:<br><br>My family has never been rich. But I believe my dad and mom have helped more people financially than I could count four times over on all the appendages of my body. I know that in the scriptures as well as in other doctrinal sources, it speaks of giving when you have nothing to give. I can say honestly that my wife and I have nothing to give. But when we give, we receive back tenfold. I deeply subscribe to the thought that if you cannot give when you have little, you will not be likely to give when you have everything.<br><br>I heard another witness of this student's experience some years ago at a dinner I attended at which the Marriott School honored a man now famous for his philanthropy: Jon Huntsman. Though Jon Huntsman's wealth and philanthropic gifts are now legend, the deepest impression I took from that evening came from a story his wife told about a gift he gave when he had very little to give. In the early days of their marriage, Brother and Sister Huntsman had a meager income. Sister Huntsman was in charge of their books and could account for all their expenditures except $50 each month. When she approached her husband about it, he told her not to worry. She remained unaware of how the money was being spent until several months later when she heard a needy mother stand in fast and testimony meeting and thank an anonymous donor who had given her $50 each month. After Sister Huntsman told this story, Jon Huntsman acknowledged that it was true and said the same thing my student said: "If you cannot give when you have little, you will not be likely to give when you have everything."<br><br>Not everyone who gives generously becomes wealthy. My student's family did not. Yet, in my student's words, they "have helped more people financially than [my student] could count four times over on all the appendages of [his] body." I am convinced the Lord gratefully accepts gifts of whatever size so long as we give them with the right attitude.<br><br>Perhaps some truly do not have the ability to help others financially. In those cases, King Benjamin instructed us to say in our hearts: "I give not because I have not, but if I had I would give" (Mosiah 4:24). That way we avoid "covet[ing] that which [we] have not received" (Mosiah 4:25). Moreover, sometimes what people need is not our money but our time or our service. President Marion G. Romney stated in general conference:<br><br>Service is not something we endure on this earth so we can earn the right to live in the celestial kingdom. Service is the very fiber of which an exalted life in the celestial kingdom is made. [Marion G. Romney, "The Celestial Nature of Self-Reliance," Ensign, November 1982, 93; see also Ensign, June 1984, 6]<br><br>One of my students wrote of her service to 93-year-old Alma Nielson:<br><br>Alma lives alone, is 93 years old, and is nearly . . . blind. His wife died just one year ago, and his son, his nearest relative, is 65 years old and lives in Salt Lake. . . . A month ago I started taking a tape recorder with me [on my daily] visits with Alma and recording the stories he told me, without him knowing. I had hoped to transcribe the tapes in time to present them to him in book form for Christmas, with copies for his grandchildren. As the semester drew to a close, I realized that the time required to prepare the history before Christmas was much greater than the time I had available, since I work in addition to going to school. This final provided a way not only for me to complete the work but to solicit the help of my group members in making the book look good and flow well. . . . [We] took the book over to Alma yesterday and read it to him. He cried. He is very excited to be able to pass these stories on to his grandchildren.<br><br>Another student wrote of her service in these terms:<br><br>For my service I spent the day sewing a baby dress. My sewing machine rarely comes off the shelf during the school year, so I was grateful to have time to do this. I'm going to take the dress home and have my mom give it to someone who can use it. This project is meaningful to me because of a little girl I used to babysit. Her mother had a life full of poor decisions, so my family kept the baby about half of the time so that she would be safe. After a couple of years the baby was taken from her mother and put in foster care, so we never got to see her after that. I think about her a lot and wonder about all the things she went without because of her situation. I used to sew dresses for her, but now that she is no longer part of my life, I like to sew for other children who are also in need.<br><br>Whether we are making family albums for the Alma Nielsons of the world or sewing dresses for needy babies, the Lord accepts our offerings as if they were given to Him, for "when [we] are in the service of [our] fellow beings [we] are only in the service of [our] God" (Mosiah 2:17). For Jesus said, "Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my [children], ye have done it unto me" (Matthew 25:40).<br><br>We have talked of the difficulty of giving willingly when we have little. If we are not careful, we may find it even more difficult to give when we have much. Brigham Young said:<br><br>The worst fear that I have about this people is that they will get rich in this country, forget God and His people, wax fat, and kick themselves out of the Church and go to hell. This people will stand mobbing, robbing, poverty, and all manner of persecution, and be true. But my greater fear . . . is that they cannot stand wealth. [Life of a Pioneer: Being the Autobiography of James S. Brown (Salt Lake City: George Q. Cannon and Sons, 1900; New York: AMS Press, 1971), 122–23; also cited by Preston Nibley in Brigham Young: The Man and His Work (Salt Lake City: Deseret News Press, 1936), 128; see also Bryant S. Hinckley, The Faith of Our Pioneer Fathers (Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1956), 13]<br><br>Brigham Young also said, "I like to see men get rich by their industry, prudence, management and economy, and then devote it to the building up of the kingdom of God upon the earth" (JD 11:115).<br><br>These statements indicate that Brigham Young was not opposed to wealth, only to its misuse. One of my students illustrated the dichotomies in Brigham Young's statements by contrasting the examples of his two grandfathers. He wrote:<br><br>I have been blessed with two contrasting examples to help me know the meaning of [seeking first the kingdom of God]. Both of my grandfathers can be considered successful businessmen. Both of them are members of the Church; however, one has been much more diligent in striving to first seek the kingdom than the other. This grandpa . . . is abundantly more blessed materially than my other grandpa. In addition, he has been richly blessed with a large, loving family, and all of them have testimonies of the gospel and are raising his grandchildren with this same testimony. He is much happier and much more enjoyable to be around than my other grandpa who is worried about looks and things of the world.<br><br>Perhaps my favorite quote from the final came from a student who originally viewed the alternative as an easy way to retain his A. But as he got into the assignment, the Spirit took over. In the two hours he spent reading the scriptures, he took four pages of notes, more, he said, than he had ever taken in a single session with the scriptures. The things he learned related directly to his patriarchal blessing. He began seeing what the Lord required of him as a steward over his earthly blessings. After relating these personal feelings, he shared this insight:<br><br>Money is one of God's tools to help us become like Him. [As] with many of God's tools, Satan manipulates money's use and tries to bring us down. . . . Money is the power of this world. The priesthood is the power of heaven. [When] we use money the way God intends for us to use it, then He will also show us how He intends for us to use the priesthood.<br><br>I have pondered this statement many times. It is stimulating to me. The scriptures teach that "the rights of the priesthood are inseparably connected with the powers of heaven." Those powers, we are told, "cannot be controlled nor handled only upon the principles of righteousness," which requires, among other things, that our "bowels . . . be full of charity towards all men, and to the household of faith" (D&amp;amp;C 121:36, 45). As that occurs and as we "garnish [our] thoughts unceasingly" with virtue, our "confidence wax[es] strong in the presence of God; and the doctrine of the priesthood [distils upon our souls] as the dews from heaven" (D&amp;amp;C 121:45; emphasis added).<br><br>The words bowels and filled occur in the same verse only five times in scripture. Each of those verses refers to the Savior, whose bowels are filled with "mercy" or "compassion" toward us. Verse 45 of section 121 of the Doctrine and Covenants, to which I just referred, is the only verse in scripture in which the words bowels and full appear together. That verse informs us that a prerequisite to having the doctrine of the priesthood "distil upon [our] soul" is that our "bowels . . . be full of charity." Are these similarities between the Savior's compassion or mercy and our charity coincidental? I think not. The Lord is instructing us that if we want to understand His priesthood we must develop His attributes, one of which--perhaps the most important of which--is charity, "the pure love of Christ" (Moroni 7:47).<br><br>Mormon tells us that we should "pray unto the Father with all the energy of heart, that [we] may be filled with this love . . . ; that [we] may become the sons [and daughters] of God; that when [Christ] shall appear we shall be like him [and] be purified even as he is pure" (Moroni 7:48). When these things happen, there will be no agency conflict. The talents or goods we return to the Savior when He comes will be returned to us because they will be who we have become, and we will have become pure and charitable like Him.<br><br>In the spirit of Mormon's prayer that we be filled with the love of Christ, I offer this prayer in the form of a poem that I composed while I was thinking about my subject today. The poem is entitled "A Servant's Prayer."<br><br>A Servant's Prayer<br>Dear Lord, give me two eyes to see<br>The needs of those surrounding me.<br>Let thy eyes my poor sight improve<br>To see some broken heart to soothe.<br><br>Dear Lord, give me two listening ears<br>Attuned to cries so faint, yet dear,<br>Ascending to thy throne divine--<br>Let my ears be attuned like thine.<br><br>Dear Lord, give me a generous heart<br>That seeing, hearing, I impart<br>To those in need, who stand alone,<br>Who mercy seek before thy throne.<br><br>For I, like them, a beggar am<br>In need of grace, a fallen man.<br>Thy power alone can us restore<br>To yonder realms we knew before.<br><br>But oft on earth thy power is shown<br>As fruits of seeds in silence sown<br>By those who see and hear and do<br>The service thou hast led them to.<br><br>Brothers and sisters, we are all servants. We have received talents that are indeed the Lord's goods. Those goods should help us develop His attributes. At this university, in particular, we should strive to become like the Savior, to have His eyes, His ears, and His pure heart in seeking "every man another's good" (JST, 1 Corinthians 10:24). May we do so is my prayer in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><em>J.

<h1>Wonderful Flood of Light&quot; - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
My dear brothers and sisters, this is truly a wonderful experience to join with you in this devotional assembly. I compliment each one of you for taking time out of your busy schedules to attend. In addition to the remarkable students, faculty, and staff of Brigham Young University, I would like to acknowledge the presence of my family, our friends, and those of you who are listening or watching this devotional from afar.<br><br>The topic I have chosen to address today is what latter-day apostles and prophets have described as "a wonderful flood of light,"<sup>1</sup> an apt description of what we have come to know as the restored gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ. I would like to begin by sharing with you a story of a woman living on the seacoast of Ireland at the turn of the last century. This woman was quite wealthy but also very frugal. Her neighbors were surprised when she was among the first in her area to have electricity installed in her home. Several weeks after having the power installed, a man from the electric company visited her to see how things were working. She assured him that everything was working well.<br><br>"I'm wondering if you can explain something to me," he said. "Your meter shows scarcely any usage. Are you using your power?"<br><br>"Certainly," she answered. "Each evening when the sun sets, I turn on my lights just long enough to light my candles; then I turn them off."<sup>2</sup><br><br>Not only did reading this story bring a smile to my face, but, as a good story often does, it also helped me to articulate and ponder the following question: "To what degree am I being true to the abundance of light and knowledge made available to me through the gospel of Jesus Christ?" Specifically I ask myself, "Am I continually walking by the 'flood of light' made available through the restoration of the gospel by the Prophet Joseph Smith, or is the path on which I am walking lighted in 'some other way'" (D&amp;amp;C 50:19)?<br><br>The prophet Mormon taught us that the light of Christ "is given to every man, that he may know good from evil" (Moroni 7:16). For those who are faithful to this lesser light, a greater light is then made available through the ministry of the Holy Ghost. In the Doctrine and Covenants we read that "a man may receive the Holy Ghost, and it may descend upon him and not tarry with him" (D&amp;amp;C 130:23). After baptism and during confirmation, we are then entitled to receive "the gift of the Holy Ghost" (D&amp;amp;C 33:15; Acts 2:38) as our "constant companion" (D&amp;amp;C 121:46). The Prophet Joseph Smith taught that we increase in knowledge "in proportion to the heed and diligence given to the light communicated from heaven."<sup>3</sup><br><br>If you're like me, there are times you feel that your life is on track and you are being true to the light God has given you, but at other times you may feel as if you are, as described in the Doctrine and Covenants, "walking in darkness at noon-day" (D&amp;amp;C 95:6). For me, the difference between the times of light, the periods of darkness, and those cloudy days when I am somewhere in between is the degree to which I am open to and act upon the influence of the Holy Ghost. President Brigham Young once taught:<br><br><i>There is no doubt, if a person lives according to the revelations given to God's people, he may have the Spirit of the Lord to signify to him His will, and to guide and to direct him in the discharge of his duties, in his temporal as well as his spiritual exercises. I am satisfied, however, that in this respect,</i> we live far beneath our privileges.<sup>4</sup><br><br>Elder M. Russell Ballard of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles once shared a story from his personal experience that illustrates President Young's observation. Several years after Elder Ballard had returned from serving as a mission president, one of his former missionaries came to see him in his office at Church headquarters.<br><br>"President," this missionary said, "I think I'm losing my testimony."<br><br>Elder Ballard was surprised because this missionary had been one of his most faithful elders.<br><br>The young man continued, "For the first time, I have read some anti-Mormon literature [and] I have some questions, and nobody will answer them for me."<br><br>Though the questions were what Elder Ballard described as "the standard anti-Church issues," he explained to the young man that he would like some time to collect the appropriate materials to ensure that he could provide some meaningful answers. The elder agreed, and they set an appointment to meet again in 10 days.<br><br>As the former missionary left the office, Elder Ballard stopped him and said, "Elder, you've asked me several questions here today. ... Now I have one for you."<br><br>Elder Ballard then asked, "How long has it been since you read from the Book of Mormon?"<br><br>The missionary admitted that it had been a long time.<br><br>"All right," Elder Ballard responded. "You have given me my assignment. It's only fair that I give you yours. I want you to promise me that you will read in the Book of Mormon for at least one hour every day between now and our next appointment."<br><br>The missionary reluctantly agreed. Elder Ballard's own words describe what happened next:<br><br><i>Ten days later he returned to my office, and I was ready. I pulled out my papers to start answering his questions. But he stopped me.</i><br><br><i>"President," he said, "that isn't going to be necessary." Then he explained: "I know that the Book of Mormon is true. I know Joseph Smith is a prophet of God."</i><br><br><i>"Well, that's great," I said, "but you're going to get answers to your questions anyway. I worked a long time on this, so you just sit there and listen."</i><br><br><i>I answered all of those questions and then asked, "Elder, what have you learned from this?"</i><br><br><i>And he said, "Give the Lord equal time."</i><sup>5</sup><br><br>Not only does this story serve as an important reminder to give the Lord "equal time," it also illustrates the importance of <i>consistency </i>in being "nourished by the good word of God" (Moroni 6:4), especially the doctrines of the Restoration. Brother Robert J. Matthews, former dean of Religious Education at BYU and more recently the president of the Mount Timpanogos Utah Temple, once stated:<br><br><i>President Heber C. Kimball said that we cannot survive on "borrowed light" </i>[Orson F. Whitney,<i> Life of Heber C. Kimball</i> (Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1967), 450].<i> That is, we cannot borrow testimony from someone else. It also means that we cannot continually borrow,</i> even from ourselves from an earlier time. ... <i>If we drift we may not realize that faith was becoming thin within us, and perhaps we have only the memory of a testimony and not a live, current, dynamic testimony.</i><sup>6</sup><br><br>Elder Ballard's experience also illustrates the Lord's warning in the Doctrine and Covenants:<br><br><i>And your minds in times past have been darkened because of unbelief, and because you have treated lightly the things you have received--</i><br><br><i>Which vanity and unbelief have brought the whole church under condemnation....</i><br><br><i>And they shall remain under this condemnation until they repent and remember the new covenant, even the Book of Mormon and the former commandments which I have given them,</i> not only to say, but to do <i>according to that which I have written.</i> [D&amp;amp;C 84:54–55, 57; emphasis added]<br><br>The good news is that much of the darkness that clouds our minds and troubles our lives may be removed by taking seriously rather than "treat[ing] lightly" (D&amp;amp;C 84:54) the doctrines of the Restoration.<br><br>During these next few minutes I will present three doctrinal teachings that are unique to Latter-day Saint theology and practice. As I discuss these doctrines, please write down any impressions you have about how you might more effectively live by the increased light made available through these teachings. The first doctrine I wish to address is the doctrine of the eternal family.<br><h2><b>The Doctrine of the Eternal Family</b></h2><br>Not long after we were sustained as members of the Sunday School general presidency this past April conference, President Roger Merrill and I were privileged to meet with a senior member of the Quorum of the Twelve regarding our new responsibilities. The third member of the new presidency, Brother William Oswald, was unable to join with us because he was still serving as president of the Russia Vladivostok Mission. Soon after we entered the office of this beloved apostle, he invited me to tell him about myself. Feeling overwhelmed but also sensing his kindness and support, I shared a 30-second "abridged version" of my life story. He urged me to tell him more, which I did.<br><br>After sharing more of my story and discussing various aspects of what I had said, this member of the Twelve looked me directly in the eye and said, "Brother Judd, thank you for sharing your story, but you have missed something."<br><br>I responded by saying, "I'm sorry. Please help me understand what I have missed."<br><br>He simply said, "You tell me."<br><br>I soon realized that although I had mentioned my family, they hadn't been the focus of what I had shared. He then asked me to tell him more about my family, including my ancestors, and afterward he provided counsel to Brother Merrill and myself that in all we did in our new callings and in our personal lives, we should always keep our families and the families of the Church a top priority. That is a lesson I will never forget.<br><br>Most of us know and understand the uniquely Latter-day Saint doctrine that "family relationships [may] be perpetuated beyond the grave,"<sup>7</sup> but do our lives truly reflect our belief in this divine doctrine? Although we must give serious attention to the Savior's caution that "he that loveth father or mother ... son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me" (Matthew 10:37; see also JST, Luke 14:26) and also understand that placing family before God can be a form of idolatry, we must also realize that family relationships are more than just a means to an end. They are an end in themselves--a celestial end with an eternal destiny.<br><br>Are we so busy pursuing career interests, church responsibilities, and personal recreation that we are neglecting our families? If we are to take the doctrine of eternal families seriously, each of us must continually ask ourselves if we are giving our family members "equal time." Let the names and faces of your family pass through your mind: Are there those among them who need more of you? Mother, father, husband or wife, son, daughter, brother, or sister? If you are a young person of marriageable age and maturity, are you doing your part to find your eternal companion, or are you just "hanging out" on a personal plateau, giving your best efforts to school and to work? No matter who we are or what our particular circumstances might be, the following counsel from Elder Richard G. Scott of the Quorum of the Twelve is a good reminder of the importance of putting first things first:<br><br><i>Are there so many fascinating, exciting things to do or so many challenges pressing down upon you that it is hard to keep focused on that which is essential? When things of the world crowd in, all too often the wrong things take highest priority. Then it is easy to forget the fundamental purpose of life. Satan has a powerful tool to use against good people. It is distraction. He would have good people fill life with "good things" so there is no room for the essential ones. Have you unconsciously been caught in that trap?</i><sup>8</sup><br><br>Several years ago, while doing research and writing an article about the relationship of religious affiliation and mental health, I observed an interesting dynamic. Among the many individuals and families I interviewed, including Latter-day Saints, Seventh-day Adventists, Jehovah's Witnesses, and members of the Bahia and Hari Krishna faiths, I was pleased to note that many of the Latter-day Saints I interviewed and tested were among those with the most favorable scores. Sadly, however, other LDS members were among those who had the poorest showing.<sup>9</sup> The scores from the LDS sample appeared to be more polarized than the test results from the members of the other faiths. Although we know that rain falls "on the just and on the unjust" (Matthew 5:45) and serious problems come to faithful individuals and families as well as the less faithful, my observations and the data I collected confirmed the Lord's statement in the Doctrine and Covenants: "For of him unto whom much is given much is required; and he who sins against the greater light shall receive the greater condemnation" (D&amp;amp;C 82:3; see verses 1–10).<br><br>The good news is that the opposite is also true. The scriptures clearly teach that when individuals and families are true to the greater light--especially when life is hard--increased blessings eventually follow. The Lord stated in the Doctrine and Covenants: "That which is of God is light; and he that receiveth light, and continueth in God, receiveth more light; and that light groweth brighter and brighter until the perfect day" (D&amp;amp;C 50:24).<br><h2><b>The Doctrines of the Fall and the Atonement</b></h2><br>Although time doesn't permit a detailed discussion, I would like to briefly discuss the Latter-day Saint doctrines of the Fall of Adam and Eve and the Atonement of Jesus Christ. These two doctrines along with the doctrine of the Creation constitute what Elder Russell M. Nelson described as the "three preeminent pillars of God's plan."<sup>10</sup> Not only do we as Latter-day Saints accept the Creation, the Fall, and the Atonement of Christ as literal, historical events, we also believe they have great doctrinal significance and personal relevance.<br><br>During my tenure as a bishop and stake president, I regularly met with individuals and couples for whom these doctrines of the Creation, Fall, and Atonement were more than theological principles. They were actually accurate descriptions of the various stages of their lives and relationships.<br><br>Most of the engaged couples with whom I met were in the "Creation" stage of their relationships, for in a metaphorical sense, most were living a Garden of Eden–like existence. For them the grass was perpetually green, the water was constantly clear, and the sky was always blue. For the most part, these couples were only partially aware of the challenges that lay ahead.<br><br>Other individuals and families with whom I met were experiencing the "Fall," for they had left the Garden of Eden long ago and were struggling in the "dark and dreary waste" (1 Nephi 8:7) of conflict, disappointment, and despair.<br><br>The desire of my heart as their priesthood leader was to help them feel the love of their Heavenly Father, invite them to establish the Savior as the foundation of their lives, and assist them in identifying and being true to the teachings of our prophets and the promptings of the Holy Ghost. Over the years I have come to deeply appreciate the following counsel of President Howard W. Hunter:<br><br><i>Please remember this one thing. If our lives and our faith are centered upon Jesus Christ and his restored gospel, nothing can ever go permanently wrong. On the other hand, if our lives are not centered on the Savior and his teachings, no other success can ever be permanently right.</i><sup>11</sup><br><br>Every individual and family--faithful to the gospel or not--experiences challenges and trials of many kinds. Many people naïvely believe, however, that if they are living as they should, they will never face any serious problems. Consider the scriptural account of the Book of Mormon prophet Lehi and his wife Sariah. Did this righteous couple ever face any serious problems? As a couple, did Lehi and Sariah ever have any differences of opinion? If you're not sure, read chapter 5 of 1 Nephi. Did the prophet Lehi ever murmur because of his afflictions? Consider 1 Nephi 16. Did Lehi and Sariah ever have any problems with their children? Grandchildren? Please read the Book of Mormon. My dear friends, it is not a coincidence that this wonderful book of scripture, the Book of Mormon, begins with the story of a family dealing with the consequences of the Fall and the other challenges of life. Their story is our story.<br><br>No other religion of which I am aware teaches that the Fall of Adam and Eve and the opposition that made the Fall possible were essential parts of God's plan for the salvation of His children. The prophet Lehi taught that "it must needs be, that there is an opposition in <i>all</i> things" (2 Nephi 2:11; emphasis added), which includes every aspect of our lives: family, church, mission, romance, school, and so forth. Lehi continued, "And to bring about his [God's] eternal purposes in the end of man ... , it must needs be that there was an opposition; even the forbidden fruit in opposition to the tree of life; the one being sweet and the other bitter" (2 Nephi 2:15).<br><br>This very day many of us are learning that it is the stress of final exams (or giving a devotional talk) that gives a certain sweetness to the promise of the holiday that follows.<br><br>Many people believe that if Adam and Eve had not partaken of the forbidden fruit, their posterity, including you and me, would be living in the Garden of Eden happily ever after. The Book of Mormon clearly teaches otherwise. From 2 Nephi we read:<br><br><i>If Adam had not transgressed he would not have fallen, but he would have remained in the garden of Eden....</i><br><br><i>And</i> [Adam and Eve] <i>would have had no children; wherefore they would have remained in a state of innocence, having no joy, for they knew no misery; doing no good, for they knew no sin.</i> [2 Nephi 2:22–23]<br><br>Lehi further revealed that "Adam fell that men might be; and men are, that they might have joy" (2 Nephi 2:25). As Latter-day Saints we accept the doctrine of what has come to be known in theological circles as "the fortunate fall" (<i>felix culpa</i>). Although many theologians and philosophers struggle to answer why God allows evil and adversity to exist, the doctrine of the Fall as revealed in the scriptures of the Restoration and in the teachings of latter-day prophets offers profound insights concerning this difficult subject. Elder Orson F. Whitney once stated:<br><br><i>No pain that we suffer, no trial that we experience is wasted. It ministers to our education, to the development of such qualities as patience, faith, fortitude and humility. All that we suffer and all that we endure, especially when we endure it patiently, builds up our characters, purifies our hearts, expands our souls, and makes us more tender and charitable, more worthy to be called the children of God ... and it is through sorrow and suffering, toil and tribulation, that we gain the education that we come here to acquire and which will make us more like our Father and Mother in heaven.</i><sup>12</sup><br><br>In addition to gaining insight as to why God allows us to experience the troubles and trials we do, the doctrines of the Restoration also help us more clearly understand the need we have for a Savior.<br><br>Several years ago Elder Bruce C. Hafen, formerly of BYU and now a member of the First Quorum of Seventy, drew my attention to an article discussing the similarities and differences between Latter-day Saints and other Christians with respect to their beliefs in Christ. See if you agree with the following assessment of Latter-day Saint belief written by the religion editor of <i>Newsweek</i> magazine:<br><br><i>According to Mormon tradition, not only did Adam's fall make procreation possible, it also established the conditions for human freedom and moral choice. Unlike orthodox Christians, Mormons believe that men are born free of sin and earn their way to godhood by the proper exercise of free will, rather than through the grace of Jesus Christ. Thus Jesus' suffering and death in the Mormon view were brotherly acts of compassion, but they do not atone for the sins of others. For this reason, Mormons do not include the cross in their iconography nor do they place much emphasis on Easter.</i><sup>13</sup><br><br>When challenged by Latter-day Saint readers that he had misrepresented the doctrine of the Church, the <i>Newsweek</i> writer defended his article by explaining that he had carefully studied the official teachings of the Church, but what he had written was intended to represent the beliefs of the typical Latter-day Saint and not necessarily the official doctrine of the Church. In other words, he was saying that the general Church membership did not believe in the <i>necessity</i> of Christ's grace but in the<i> sufficiency </i>of their own good works.<br><br>We don't know how the <i>Newsweek</i> editor selected his sample of Latter-day Saints to interview, but we do know that their apparent answers to the editor's questions were not accurate reflections of the core doctrine of the Restoration. The prophet Lehi taught: "Wherefore, how great the importance to make these things known unto the inhabitants of the earth, that they may know that there is <i>no flesh that can dwell in the presence of God, save it be through the merits, and mercy, and grace of the Holy Messiah" </i>(2 Nephi 2:8; emphasis added).<br><br>I regret that as a full-time missionary I allowed my dislike for what some have defined as "cheap grace"<sup>14</sup> to influence me to overemphasize the importance of good works. I permitted those who insisted that one could be forgiven without repentance and that making and keeping covenants wasn't important to cloud my understanding of what the prophet Alma described as the "one thing which is of more importance than they all" (Alma 7:7): the saving and enabling power made possible through the Atonement of the Lord Jesus Christ.<br><br>Perhaps one of the reasons some have distorted the doctrine of grace and others have misunderstood the importance of good works is found in the following statement from C. S. Lewis:<br><br><i>He</i> [the devil] <i>always sends errors into the world in pairs--pairs of opposites. And he always encourages us to spend a lot of time thinking which is the worse. You see why, of course? He relies on your extra dislike of the one error to draw you gradually into the opposite one.</i><sup>15</sup><br><br>In a well-known verse the prophet Nephi stated: <i>"It is by grace that we are saved, after all we can do"</i> (2 Nephi 25:23; emphasis added). Although many have attempted to define what Nephi meant by his phrase "all we can do," Anti-Nephi-Lehi, the Book of Mormon king, answered the question well:<br><br><i>And now behold, my brethren, since it has been</i> all that we could do, <i>(as we were the most lost of all mankind)</i> to repent <i>of all our sins ... and to get God to take them away from our hearts, for it was</i> all we could do <i>to repent sufficiently before God that he would take away our stain.</i> [Alma 24:11; emphasis added]<br><br>Repentance is the key that fully invokes the enabling power of the Atonement of Jesus Christ. Having faith in Christ, repenting of our sins, being baptized, receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost, and faithfully enduring to the end establishes the foundation upon which additional covenants and ordinances may be revealed and received. The prophet Nephi taught, "If ye will enter in by the way, and receive the Holy Ghost, it will show unto you all things what ye should do" (2 Nephi 32:5).<br><br>In conclusion, I would like to leave you with an illustration that I hope will summarize what I have attempted to share with you today. It was 17 years ago this month that I graduated from Brigham Young University with a doctorate in counseling psychology. I value the many things I learned in my philosophical and clinical training, and I'm grateful for the experiences I had with fellow students, faculty, staff, and others, but the one academic experience I treasure the most occurred during the very last hour of my graduate school experience.<br><br>In my particular discipline we were required to conduct original research in an area of our choice, formally write up the study in a doctoral dissertation, and then defend our work before an examination committee. The results of this exam determined whether we would pass or fail. I looked forward to defending my dissertation. I had worked hard and had been greatly blessed by studying my particular topic. I had also received tremendous help from the professors on my committee and felt confidant that I could adequately defend my work.<br><br>The first 15 minutes of the examination went quite smoothly. The questions were straightforward, and I felt I answered them well. I began to feel the excitement of having achieved a goal I had been working toward for several years. The next set of questions were more difficult, as we began to discuss some of the debatable parts of my work. I still felt fairly confidant in my answers. Even though I realized that I would probably need to make some revisions, I felt I would pass. I wasn't prepared for what happened next. One of the professors on the examination committee voiced his feelings that he wasn't happy with the overall scope of my study. He didn't know if he could give me a passing vote. After several more attempts to defend my work, I realized that this professor would not be convinced--and what he was saying appeared to be influencing the others. I began to lose hope.<br><br>At that critical moment, another member of my committee, Professor Richard N. Williams, asked the examination committee if he could make a few comments. For the next several minutes Professor Williams defended my work and he defended me. The spirit in the room changed dramatically. Differences were reconciled, a vote was taken, and I passed the examination and graduated--fulfilling the dream of a lifetime.<br><br>I hope each of you at some time in your life can have someone stand up for you, plead your cause, and rescue you as Professor Williams did. This experience helped me understand in a very meaningful way what is meant in scripture when the Savior is referred to as our "advocate with the Father" (D&amp;amp;C 110:4; JST, 1 John 2:1). There is, however, a major difference in the means by which the Savior is our Advocate and what Professor Williams did to assist me. Please look for this vital difference as I read from section 45 of the Doctrine and Covenants:<br><br><i>Listen to him who is the advocate with the Father, who is pleading your cause before him--</i><br><br><i>Saying: Father, behold the sufferings and death of him who did no sin, in whom thou wast well pleased; behold the blood of thy Son which was shed, the blood of him whom thou gavest that thyself might be glorified;</i><br><br><i>Wherefore, Father, spare these my brethren that believe on my name, that they may come unto me and have everlasting life.</i> [D&amp;amp;C 45:3–5]<br><br>Professor Williams defended me based on the integrity of <i>my</i> work and his belief in me; the Savior's advocacy is based on the efficacy of <i>His</i> atoning sacrifice and our willingness to believe in Him. This is what the prophet Lehi was teaching his son Jacob when he said, "I know that thou art redeemed, because of <i>the righteousness of thy Redeemer</i>" (2 Nephi 2:3; emphasis added). The scriptures plainly teach that salvation is much more about the Savior than it is about us. I testify, in the words of King Benjamin, that there is "no other name given nor any other way nor means whereby salvation can come unto the children of men, only in and through the name of Christ, the Lord" (Mosiah 3:17).<br><br>What a blessing it is to be living in a day when we are privileged to have such "a wonderful flood of light" by which we may live. I testify to you of the truthfulness of the restored gospel and that we are led by a living prophet of God--President Gordon B. Hinckley. I testify to you that Jesus Christ is our Advocate, He "is the light and the life of the world; ... a light that is endless, that can never be darkened" (Mosiah 16:9). I pray that each of us, especially during the Christmas season, will reflect upon how we can be true to the wondrous Light we have been blessed to receive. I leave you my testimony and my love in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Daniel K Judd was an associate professor of ancient scripture at BYU as well as first counselor in the Sunday School general presidency of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when this devotional address was given on 7 December 2004.</i><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>1.
