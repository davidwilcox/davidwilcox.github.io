<h1>5 Game Plan - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
President Oaks and my wonderful young friends of Brigham Young University, it's nice to be among friends. I'm grateful to my Heavenly Father for this assignment. I pray earnestly that we might be able to communicate well together as we meet here to discuss a common interest--our membership in this Church.<br><br>As we meet here at the beginning of another bright new year and contemplate the best possible utilization of the 360 days that remain, I rejoice with each of you that the spirit of Christmas is still fresh in our minds. With the stimulating thoughts of Christmas and the Savior, we can now establish goals that are more meaningful, objectives that are more worthwhile, and raise hopes for this year that can be framed truly and properly within the lofty and eternal concepts of peace on earth and good will toward men. As members of his church, you and I can do our planning for 1975 with faith and knowledge that God indeed lives, that life is eternal, and that all true joy and happiness will come most readily by conformity to gospel standards.<br><br>One critic recently observed that the Christmas theme of "peace on earth" is evidence that Christianity is not working, because there has been war and contention in these two thousand years since the advent of the Savior. There has not really been peace on earth. It has been made clear by studying the activities of man for some six thousand years that this temporal existence has always been a constant replay of man's inherent imperfections and continuing dramatization of man's never-ending conflict with his fellowmen, of differing cultures, and of opposing ideologies. The basic selfishness of man has been used as the most lethal of all weapons by the adversary in his attempt to thwart the work of the Master. Yes, man continues without that peace that we would all so like to achieve.<br><br>However, the prophets declare that God's ways are not man's ways (see Isaiah 55:8). The Prince of Peace spoke the truth when he said, "Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, give I unto you" (John 14:27). I have a firm testimony that the real "peace . . . which passeth all understanding" (Philippians 4:7) is a peace of mind that is possible to acquire even in this temporal setting of perpetual conflict and frustration. That peace offered by the Savior can even be found in foxholes at the battlefront. It is available in the face of adversity and heartbreak. It can be yours and mine to the same degree that we adopt a personal relationship with Deity or a personal testimony. This results in a life-style that is in harmony with the life of him who died that we might live. Not only may we live beyond the grave, but just as important, we may also live more abundantly here and now. We can have a peace of mind and an assurance that can be realized best by conformity with priesthood principles and by participation in the second great theme of Christianity--"good will toward men" (Luke 2:14). As we learn to love our neighbor as ourselves, we indeed become our brother's keeper.<br><h2><b>Keeping an Eternal Perspective</b></h2><br>May our plans, hopes, and dreams for 1975 be established on a foundation that has eternal perspective. While total perfection may likely elude most of us during the next twelve months, our game plan for the next year must surely call for an improvement, because you and I believe in eternal progression, which contemplates a constant striving for day-to-day improvement in our lives. Anything less than that is counter to Heavenly Father's divine plan. I can almost hear some of you saying at this very moment," It's all futile. Here I am only five days into 1975, and already I've goofed twice."<br><br>Young people, I want to assure you that you're not too far from par for the course. Just about everybody has had a bad start sometime or another. As I was watching the Rose Bowl game on television the other day, I had a flashback of something that happened on a high school football field not too far from that Rose Bowl many years ago when I was playing high school football. Speaking of getting off to a bad start, I think I hold the record. It was my first year of high school football. I'd been playing second string all through the practice games, and this was the first big league game. Six thousand cheering people were in the stands. As we were breaking after our halftime pep talk, the coach suddenly said, "Simpson, you start the second half." The old adrenaline came rushing, and I went charging out onto the field. This was my chance. Just about that time the coach said, "Oh, and by the way, I want you to kick off, Simpson." I determined right then and there that I was going to kick that ball farther than any football had ever been kicked in history. I really wanted to make a good showing on my first chance on the first string. Well, the referee waved his arm and blew his whistle. I could hear those six thousand people. I looked at that ball and came charging down the field. I felt everything tingling in my body; the excitement was so high. Well, you have probably already guessed it. I missed the ball. Six thousand people went wild. But that isn't the half of it. This was back in the days when the quarterback held the ball with his finger. I broke the quarterback's finger.<br><br>Now, if you think that you're off to a bad start, I just want to set your mind at ease and let you know that it could be worse. I also want you to know that I had a coach that had confidence because he left me in. I don't know why, but he did, and I played the rest of the game. If I weren't so modest, I might also tell you that I made all-league that year.<br><br>Young people, this is a bright new year. Even though five days have gone, I want you to know that your start can be a good start even if you've already made one or two mistakes. Let me tell you a few stories.<br><br>I know a woman who was very active in the Church and true to the faith as recently as eighteen months ago. Today's she's critical of her childhood teachings, and she chooses to live apart from her former circle of Church friends. Why? Because adversity struck without warning. She lost her balance; apparently her foundation of testimony was inadequate. She lost a loved one in a tragic accident, and her central thought today seems to be "If God really loved me, he would have prevented this terrible thing from happening."<br><br>I also know of a young man who served faithfully and well for two years in a great mission of the Church. Less than a year ago, however, someone he looked up to and trusted made a serious mistake which led to excommunication from the Church. The adversary had found a weakness through rationalization. The weakness turned into a major problem, and it wasn't long before this friend, a giant, had fallen. Today this young returned missionary, who saw his hero fall by the wayside, has allowed the incident to get to him. He has become indifferent. His twenty-five years of good teaching and his commitment to God have been nullified because someone he admired turned out to be something less than he had hoped. This young man was placing his trust in the hand of man. I want to declare to all of you that no man is infallible. For you and I to be firm in the Church, we must place our trust in God and not in the hand of man.<br><br>There is another man who served long and faithfully in a key leadership role in his stake, only to be lulled away through temptation. He didn't fall through the bottom but seemed to fall off the top. His spiritual pursuits carried him into the mysteries which made him doubt basic doctrines. The teachings of the gospel of Jesus Christ were too simple, and he refused to accept them as an important part of his new and sophisticated pattern of reasoning.<br><br>In the wake of the foregoing tragedies, there have been broken families and loss of dignity. None seemed to be the same person. As a matter of fact, they are not the same people. These brief accounts of some who have apparently lost their testimonies are perhaps extreme. In each case, however, there was that subtle beginning when the power of the adversary found an opening wedge--when that person began to justify his irregularity and to criticize priesthood leaders. It was the same old familiar pattern, bit by bit. At first the transgression was ever so slight; in most cases it was thought to be just temporary: "Tomorrow I'll start the swing back." So often tomorrow never comes, and Satan has won another victory.<br><h2><b>Self-Discipline--Key to Eternal Life</b></h2><br>Eternity always seems such a long way off. Just one day seems such an insignificant part of forever. Just one hour of self-gratification seems so trivial on the scale of here and hereafter. My message to you, my wonderful young friends, tonight, is this: Every day of 1975 is an important part of your eternal existence. The year 1975 will turn out best if your personal game plan for the next twelve months is sound, if your objectives are in harmony with truth, and if the execution of your 1975 game plan is carried out with a high degree of self-discipline. Without self-discipline, the daily crosswinds and less important demands of your time and attention will take over. Just one deviation, isolated and alone, seems so harmless, so insignificant. But please believe me when I say that each deviation paves the way for another and yet another.<br><br>Self-discipline, the key to eternal life, is doing something that needs to be done whether or not you find it convenient. Self-discipline is usually motivated by our convictions, our internal hopes, and our desires. I bear witness to you that there is no foundation as secure to Latter-day Saints as a personal testimony concerning this latter-day work. There is absolutely no motivation that can be as helpfully demanding as a knowledge that God lives, a restoration has taken place, and a living prophet directs the work. During 1975, adversity and heartbreak will come to many of you. Your expanding, vital, and living testimony of this Church should be the key to your self-discipline. Without self-discipline, the execution of your game plan will indeed be in jeopardy.<br><h2><b>Building a Champion</b></h2><br>Everybody likes a champion. Hero worship can be a good thing if we exercise a little care in picking the heroes worth following. Coach Edwards and the Cougar football squad are Western Athletic Conference champions. They are worth emulation. Without talking to Coach Edwards, I have a pretty good idea how that championship happened. Let me tell you about it. First of all, he found a group of young men who wanted to play football on a winning team. Second, the coaching staff and the team built confidence in one another. They became a team, each feeling that the team was more important than any single individual desire. Third, they worked hard for many months to learn their jobs. Fourth, they built a team spirit. Their confidence in each other led to enthusiasm. Fifth, in addition to their long-range objectives for a winning season they had a game plan for each weekend. Sometimes they had to make a whole new game plan for the second half, depending on how things went in the first half. During the first three or four games of the year, they had ten or twelve game plans. That's how we learn.<br><br>Now, by the same reasoning, I know how you, too, can have a winning season in 1975. First, get a team together that is eager for success. Find out if your heart, mind, eyes, ears, legs, arms, and hands all want to have a winning year. You've got a weak heart? It's going to be pretty tough. You have a doubting mind? It's going to be even tougher. If you have undisciplined eyes and hands that want to go in the wrong direction, you're not going to win many ball games.<br><br>Next, just like the Cougar football squad, you have to build confidence. Build confidence with your coaching staff. You all have a coaching staff. I'm talking about your parents, priesthood leaders, friends, instructors, and most of all, your Heavenly Father. Young people, communicate well with these people who are concerned for you and who love you. And especially don't forget a daily communication with your Heavenly Father. You check in. I'm just simple enough in my belief to have the firm conviction that all of you young people have an eternal destiny that is known by our Heavenly Father. I believe that you've been foreordained. Most of you, I'm sure, have patriarchal blessings that spell some of that out. I know that Heavenly Father knows you personally by name, and when you don't check in to him or when things are not going right in life, he's concerned. He doesn't come down and intercede, however, because that's contrary to the plan. But we need to do what we can to maintain that communication on a daily basis.<br><br>Third, you have to learn your jobs just as Coach Edwards and his team had to learn their jobs. The line coaches worked with tackles. The end coaches worked with ends, and the backfield coaches spend time at their end of the field teaching the backs. Learn what you need to know. Specialize in truth. That's really the only thing that you can count on forever. Gain facility. Be teachable. Search out new ideas, new thoughts. Ponder them in your heart and hold fast to that which is in harmony with the truth. If you find something that stands off just a little bit at an angle with priesthood principles, you'd better look at it again and either find out how you can straighten it up or else discard it. I think it's just as simple as that.<br><br>We talked about enthusiasm on the team next. Work up some spirit and enthusiasm. It's an essential part of all real success. It is founded in sincerity and has a rich, spiritual overtone.<br><br>I'm tempted to pause for a moment and tell you about the greatest example of enthusiasm I've ever seen. Some of you have heard me tell this story before, but I can't think of a better one. I went to my first district meeting as a new missionary in New Zealand many years ago when we spoke a lot of Maori in the mission. They started the meeting, and my companion nudged me and said, "You'll be interested to know that the next two hours are going to be on genealogy."<br><br>I thought to myself, "Two hours on genealogy in a language I can't understand. This is too much."<br><br>After they introduced the first speaker, my companion said, "Brother Heremaia is the first speaker," I shall never forget this great Maori as he stood up in his Polynesian way, with an overwhelming enthusiasm: "Tena koutou katoa!" He was bubbling over with this enthusiasm. I couldn't take my eyes off him. I couldn't understand what he was saying, but I had my eyes glued to him every second. I couldn't detach myself from that enthusiasm.<br><br>Then my companion said, "He's going to trace his genealogy from Father Adam down to the present day."<br><br>I thought to myself, "That's incredible. Nobody can do that." Without looking in the Old Testament, without looking in the Book of Mormon, without a piece of paper, in his true Maori tradition of memorizing genealogy, he started back with Father Adam. He sort of close his eyes and said: "Ko arama te tangata tuatahi. A, I marena iwa. A ka puta mai a mea, ko mea, ko mea. . . ." He started with Father Adam, who was married to Eve and their children were thus and thus and thus. And then he came down through the Old Testament. "Ko mea marena mea, I puta mai mea, ko mea, ko mea. . . ." Finally he got down to Jeremiah's time and jumped off with Lehi into the wilderness. Then he came down through the Book of Mormon: "Ko mea marena mea, I puta mai mea, ko mea, ko mea. . . ." All the time his enthusiasm was holding me right on the edge of my seat. He concluded with the only thing I could understand in my own language: "Ko Hirini T. Heremaia, Jr.--Ah, that's me."<br><br>That was to be the greatest example of enthusiasm I've ever seen. Brothers and sisters, enthusiasm is important as you follow through with what you have in mind for this great year of 1975.<br><br>The last point, as we compare ourselves with the football team, is that, whatever your objective for 1975, you will need to have dozens of intermediate monthly, weekly, and daily game plans. If you want a day of chaos, just start a day without a plan and then allow the whims and the fancies of the moment to direct your course. God's house is a house of order. If we're going to be members of this Church and if we're trying to qualify ourselves for the presence of the Lord, I suggest that our houses be houses of order and that we have some daily plans.<br><br>My high school football coach used to say, "The best defense is a good offense." I believe that. It's impossible for your adversary to place points on the scoreboard as long as you have the ball. If you have a plan and if you spend your day acting rather than reacting to situations that are placed in your path, I want to promise that you'll have a better year. You'll be more successful. You'll be more fruitful and you'll be happy.<br><br>I can almost hear you saying right now, "I'm human. I fumble once in a while. I throw an interception." Of course you do. And I've got news for you. You're not alone. Mistakes and misjudgments are a part of this mortal existence. Even the Lord knows that we're going to make some mistakes, but he is also very hopeful that we won't keep making the same mistakes over and over again. Making the same mistakes repeatedly doesn't sound like eternal progression to me. As members of this Church, you and I know something about the miracle of forgiveness, and we also know about and believe in a great principle called repentance. Without it, none of us would have a chance.<br><br>As we discussed a few minutes ago, there will likely be some unexpected obstacles along your path in 1975. Do you know when tragedy might strike? Do you know when a loved one might be taken from your immediate family circle? Do you know when a serious illness or an accident might occur? We don't know that. What would your reaction be if someone you trusted betrayed you? How well equipped are you to handle extreme discouragement or depression? Maybe a D popped up on your grade report when you were certain of at least a B. That happens here, too, I understand.<br><br>What will you do when you find that your faith has been seriously challenged? Just how able are you to resist temptation? What do you do when your body demands gratification that you know is wrong? People need added strength to meet unusual circumstances. True champions are usually those who have been able to survive more unexpected problems than the rest of the people. The blessings of heaven are in store for those of Heavenly Father's children who don't collapse when the game plan goes wrong. A prophet of God--even the Prophet Joseph--cried out from Liberty Jail, "Oh God, where art thou?" (D&amp;amp;C 121). His game plan had gone wrong. He had had the bottom drop out. "Oh God, where art thou?" can you hear even a prophet making this plea in desperation? And then, just as though Heavenly Father had tenderly taken up a little boy into his arms, he said, "My son, peace be unto thy soul; thine adversity and thine afflictions shall be but a small moment; And then, if thou endure it well, God shall exalt thee on high; thou shalt triumph over all thy foes" (D&amp;amp;C 121:7–8).<br><br>This promise is not reserved for prophets. This blessing and this promise can be just as much yours. Heavenly Father will not forsake you in your righteousness. Adversity will come. The important thing is, how do we face it? How do we overcome it? What do we do about it? What kind of a testimony or a foundation do we have that's going to help us to stay on top and not be submerged? The Lord, speaking in the Doctrine and Covenants, says this: "Therefore, they must needs be chastened and tried, even as Abraham. . . . For all those who will not endure chastening, but deny me, cannot be sanctified" (D&amp;amp;C 101:4–5).<br><br>My wonderful young friends, if you and I ever plan to live in the presence of the Lord someday, we need to be sanctified. We need to be subjected to the refiner's fire. I don't particularly think that Heavenly Father comes down and gives us adversity in our lives. I think just because you and I live here in mortality there's going to be enough adversity to go around. There are misjudgments and mistakes here in this mortal sphere, and sometimes even the innocent are hurt very badly. But the important things are how do we respond, how do we react, and what do we do about it. You know, the Doctrine and Covenants talks about our possibilities. It talks about principalities and powers, dominions and exaltation (see D&amp;amp;C 121:29). Have you ever thought about being involved in some of those things? It seems almost incredible. I think Heavenly Father is looking for thousands who can inherit all that he has and stand at his side and share in his dominion and exaltation. We stand here in mortality. If we're interested in eternal progression and exaltation in the celestial kingdom, we're talking about someplace up in the ceiling. No matter how you look at it, it's uphill all the way. It takes some effort, energy, and planning. You just don't get from here to there as the wind blows you. It must come through self-discipline to basic testimony and to all these things that we've alluded to here this evening.<br><h2><b>Planning for the New Year</b></h2><br>Now, young people let me suggest three things to include in your planning for 1975. First, I want you to be able to learn more about your Heavenly Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. We're told that "this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent" (John 17:3). If we are interested in sharing all that the Father has, we must know the Father and his son. I would like to suggest that your priesthood, Sunday School, and religion classes that you're taking here at BYU are not really adequate. You've got to do something on your own. Can you find just ten or fifteen minutes in your day for pondering, not just reading, one more chapter of the Book of Mormon or one more section of the Doctrine and Covenants? Can you do that, young people, in your game plan for 1975? Now, you have to find some quiet time, which isn't easy to find on this campus. Have you ever thought about five-thirty in the morning? It can be pretty quiet in your apartment at that time. You might have some time then to contemplate with the Lord another chapter in the Book of Mormon.<br><br>Second, in your game plane for 1975, pursue your studies with an eagerness to learn. To waste time and money is an insult to God. It's a betrayal to your parents and a great disservice to you as an individual. You're not on this campus to waste time and money. It is contrary to the plan of God.<br><br>The third point I would make with you might seem unimportant. However, after sitting at 47 East South Temple and talking to a lot of people for a lot of years in private counseling sessions, I want to admonish you with all the fervor of my heart and soul to get out of debt and stay out of debt. Young people, if you'll follow this great admonition of the prophets, you will learn one of the great lessons of mortality. You'd be surprised how many of the troubles start, especially in marital situations, when there is a misuse of family funds, when there has come a breakdown by people using poor judgment and spending money they do not have. Learn that lesson on the campus of Brigham Young University. As you stake out of debt, you'll be a better student. As you stay out of debt, you'll be a better companion to whomever you might be dating next Friday night. And if you'll stay out of debt, you'll be able to keep yourself more spiritually alert and to do that which you've come here to accomplish in a much better way.<br><br>I close with three quotes from the Savior: (1) "If ye are not one ye are not mine" (D&amp;amp;C 38:27); (2) "If you love me, keep my commandment" (John 14:15); and (3) "For without me ye can do nothing" (John 15:5).<br><br>Now, young people, if you're sharing the room with a few other students, and I'm sure most of you are, why don't you try to have some harmony and oneness in that setup? Why don't you go out of your way for your roommates? Why don't you go out of your way for your classmates or those that you share facilities with on this campus? "If ye are not one ye are not mine." Become one with your Church leaders. Become one with your faculty administration. Believe in this school just as you believe in the Lord, and life will be sweeter for you.<br><br>"If ye love me, keep my commandments." Be of service. Try to help somebody else along the way. Keep the Sabbath day holy. Observe the Word of Wisdom. Believe in the law of tithing. Even if you can't pay it right now, believe it. Promise the Lord that you're going to start paying as soon as you become a wage earner.<br><br>And that last admonition, "For without me ye can do nothing." Young people, may the Lord bless you and help you to arrange an appropriate personal game plan for 1975 that will improve your life, help you to become spiritually strong, and help you to become academically equipped to meet the world and make a contribution to this nation and to this world. That you may be able to do it all, to stay out of debt, and to do that which the prophets have given you to do is my humble prayer for each of you. I ask it humbly in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. amen.<br><br><i><i>Robert L.

<h1> for New Year’s Resolutions - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I hope that that very generous introduction of your great President didn't lay a foundation for a disappointment later on. As he was saying some of those very nice things, I thought of what President Kimball said the other night about a minister who was driving down the highway a little faster than he should have gone, and he was stopped by a traffic officer. The minister didn't want to be arrested, so he said, "Please officer, don't arrest me. I'm a poor preacher." The officer said, "Yes, I know. I've heard you."<br><br>The most important thing I think I'd like to say to you today is that I am very grateful to be here with you, and I'd like to congratulate all of you on being here. Somebody has said that a thing is sometimes not as important for itself alone as for what it stands for. The fact that you are all here at this great University associating with and under the direction of these great teachers and being inspired and directed by each other is a sign of some very important things that will come about in your life later on, in the great society in which you live, in the great country that you will serve, and in the Church to which you have pledged and will pledge your allegiance.<br><h2><b>The custom of celebrating holidays</b></h2><br>We have a very interesting custom among us of setting aside special days on which we think about special things. We set aside the second Sunday in May as Mother's Day, and on this day we let our minds reach up and try to understand the purposes for which this day was set apart. We set apart the third Sunday in June as Father's Day for the same reason.<br><br>Someone has said that the human mind has some of the qualities of the tendrils of a climbing vine; that is, it tends to attach itself and draw itself upward by what it is put in contact with. Then we have some other great days on which we think about other wonderful ideas. We have Memorial Day, Easter, Pioneer Day, and the Fourth of July. We set aside the fourth Thursday in November as Thanksgiving. On this day we try to build gratitude and appreciation into our lives. Cicero, the great Roman statesman, said that gratitude is the mother of virtues; that is, our virtues and our abilities and our attitudes have parents just the same as other things we do. As we recount our blessings, we increase them.<br><br>Then we set aside another whole period of the year, beginning at Thanksgiving and ending at the New Year, in which we commemorate and think about and learn from the greatest event that ever took place upon this earth--when the Son of God came here to establish his church and to tell us about the standards that ought to distinguish our lives. During this period we decorate our homes, set up Christmas trees, and listen to Christmas carols. We hear Christmas sermons, and we retell ourselves the great traditions of Christmas. We give gifts to each other, and we build up an attitude of gratefulness and appreciation and reverence and worship into our lives. I'm not going to talk to you about that. That's already past. But I'd like to talk to you about the important day that this Christmas season leads into. It seems to me very proper and natural that Christmas should follow Thanksgiving and that we lay a proper basis for Christmas during the Thanksgiving period. Then our Christmas is enhanced as a consequence.<br><h2><b>Importance of the New Year</b></h2><br>What I would like to talk to you about is the important period that we call the New Year. This is a time when we make New Year's resolutions. This is the time when we could make some determinations about the things that we have been thinking about during Christmas. Sometimes after some great event is over, we close our minds on it and forget about what we have done. That is, after Christmas, we repack our boxes of ornaments and tinsel. The Christmas themes are taken off the radio, and we go back to doing the things that we did before. Of course, when we do that, we miss one of the greatest values of Christmas. When we lay down the ideas that we have associated with during this high point of the year, we frequently have a corresponding recession in our lives. Someone has expressed the opposite of this idea in verse when he said:<br><br><i>When the song of the angels is heard no more</i><br><i>And the Bethlehem star is gone out of the sky</i><br><i>When the kings and the Wisemen have returned to their homes</i><br><i>And the shepherds are back in the fields with their flocks,</i><br><i>Then is the time when the real work of Christmas should be eagerly begun:</i><br><i>To spread the Christian message, to lift up the broken hearted;</i><br><i>To convert the unbelieving, to purify the national purpose,</i><br><i>To break the bonds of sin, and to exalt the purpose of all mankind.</i><br><i>The New Year is the time when we should establish in our heart</i><br><i>Those great ideals that were given us by the Son of God for the Christmas season.</i><br><br>The Christmas season loses much of its constructive purpose when we repack our tinsel and forget about it. This practice reminds us of one of the great experiences in world history. Some time ago, my wife and I read the story of Queen Victoria, who was just a teenager in 1837 when the crown of England was placed upon her head. For the next sixty-four years, until her death in 1901, she ruled this greatest nation that there had ever been in the history of the world.<br><br>In 1897, the Great Jubilee was conducted for this famous Christian queen. The officers of their far-spread country, the crowned heads of all of the courts of Europe, and the great ambassadors and the island princes from their faraway locations were invited to come to London for the great celebration of this Diamond Jubilee.<br><br>In preparation for this celebration, the<i>London Times</i>asked Rudyard Kipling to write a Jubilee poem; you remember that the result was his famous "Recessional." A recessional is something that has to do with a recession. It is letting down or a worsening that sometimes takes place after the main event has passed. Sometimes the orchestra plays a recessional in the theater as the audience is leaving, or sometimes a recessional is played in the church as the choir and clergy are leaving the chancel and going to the robing room. Sometimes we have a recessional in our lives or our businesses. And in his great poem, Mr. Kipling prays that England could avoid a recessional in its high standards of life and power. In his poem he said:<br><br><i>God of our fathers, known of old--</i><br><i>Lord of our far-flung battle-line--</i><br><i>Beneath whose awful hand we hold</i><br><i>Dominion over palm and pine--</i><br><i>Lord God of Hosts, be with us yet</i><br><i>Lest we forget--lest we forget!</i><br><br><i>The tumult and the shouting dies--</i><br><i>The captains and the kings depart--</i><br><i>Still stands Thine ancient Sacrifice,</i><br><i>An humble and a contrite heart.</i><br><i>Lord God of Hosts, be with us yet,</i><br><i>Lest we forget--lest we forget!</i><br><br><i>Far-called our navies melt away--</i><br><i>On dune and headland sinks the fire--</i><br><i>Lo, all our pomp of yesterday</i><br><i>Is one with Nineveh and Tyre!</i><br><i>Judge of the Nations, spare us yet,</i><br><i>Lest we forget--lest we forget!</i><br><br><i>If drunk with sight of power, we loose</i><br><i>Wild tongues that have not Thee in awe--</i><br><i>Such boasting as the Gentiles use</i><br><i>Or lesser breeds without the Law--</i><br><i>Lord God of Hosts, be with us yet,</i><br><i>Lest we forget--lest we forget!</i><br><br><i>For heathen heart that puts her trust</i><br><i>In reeking tube and iron shard--</i><br><i>All valiant dust that builds on dust,</i><br><i>And guarding calls not Thee to guard--</i><br><i>For frantic boast and foolish word,</i><br><i>Thy mercy on Thy People, Lord!</i><br><br>In trying to warn the people against a recession, Mr. Kipling went back and relived this period of recession among some of the ancient nations. He knew what happened when people forgot about God and brought on a moral recession of national scope.<br><br>During Queen Victoria's long reign and the period when England became the great nation that ruled over one-quarter of all the earth's surface, Britain's navies controlled the seven seas and her great commerce dominated the trade in the entire world. The sun never set upon the British Empire. When Victoria was asked what the secret of British greatness was, she would always put her hand on the Bible and say, "England is the land of the Book. England lives by the principles of the gospel that have come down to us in this great biblical record." This reverence of the things of God is what, in my opinion, more than anything else, controls the success of our lives.<br><h2><b>Looking backward and forward in time</b></h2><br>We come now to this very important period of January, this time of a new beginning. We remember the interesting fact that January was named after Janus, the old Roman god of doors and beginnings. Janus had one interesting peculiarity; he had two faces. With one face he looked back into the past year to discover his own mistakes and his own successes. Then through the other face he looked up into the future to make plans for a new year and to put these great ideals into operation that had been formed during the past year.<br><br>I suppose this is also what Charles Dickens had in mind in his story "A Christmas Carol." This story is probably the most famous nonscriptural Christmas story that we have. Each year we see it a half a dozen times. In the story, the Spirit of Christmas takes Scrooge back into his past and lets him relive his early experiences before he had gained those problems that eventually caused him trouble. After he had sufficiently learned the lessons of the past, the Spirit of Christmas took him up into the future, where Christmases were yet to be and where things were still subject to change, and let him see some of the things that may take place if he did not do the right thing. Then Scrooge begged the Spirit of Christmas to let him change some of the conditions of his life, and after these changes had been made and he was brought back into the present, he said, "I am not the man I was."<br><br>This is also the philosophy, I suppose, that H.G. Wells considered when he wrote his famous story<i>The Time Machine.</i>You remember there was a machine that Mr. Wells could get into and push the lever, and he would go back into his own past or back into the past history of the world as far back as he would like to go. And because he was an historian, he liked to go back and verify, by his own personal presence, the Battle of Hastings and other events which he was interested in. When he had finished his explorations into the past, he would push the lever the other way and go up into the future and prelive what was to come. He could go where time had not yet taken place and arrange for those things that he would like to occur in his own life.<br><br>Now, God has a time-traveling ability, some of which he has given to the prophets as well as to us. We remember that Abraham was permitted to go back and relive the preexistence. He said, "Now the Lord has shown unto me, Abraham, the intelligences that were organized before the world was; and that among all these there were many of the noble and great ones" (Abraham 3:22). The Lord also put John the Revelator into a time machine and sent him up into the future to prelive the final judgement.<br><br>We have been given that same ability in our dreams and imaginations. In President McKay's great book<i>Gospel Ideals,</i>he had a paragraph in which he said, "Last night I dreamed about my mother." Then he said, "I would like to dream about my mother more often." That is, in his dream he went back and relived those important events that took place at his mother's knee when he learned the lessons of life that brought him to his ultimate high place. President McKay didn't learn how to be the President of the Church when he was ninety or seventy or sixty. He learned those lessons when he was five and ten and fifteen. And then in his dream he went back and relived that important experience so that he could reabsorb the original good. When he had awakened the next morning, even though now his mother had been gone for many years, it was as though he had actually had that experience with his mother during the nighttime.<br><h2><b>Preliving the important events of our lives</b></h2><br>But no one needs to be asleep in order to dream, and with equal benefit we can go back and relive our marriage vows. We can relive and revitalize the covenants which we made at the waters of baptism when we promised God that we would be faithful. We can go back and relive all of those sources in the past from which we may regain strength and ambition, and we can remake our decisions about them. Or we may push the lever in the other direction and prelive the future.<br><br>I have a relative who, when she reads a novel, always reads the last chapter first. She wants to know before she begins where she's going to be when she gets through. That is a pretty good idea for life.<br><br>We can also prelive our marriage vows and determine in advance the kind of people we would like to be when that great occasion arrives. This is much better than being faced with the pressures of the moment when the occasion arises so that we clean ourselves up temporarily to get married. That is, in order to attain the goal for which we are not prepared, we get on buddy-buddy terms with the bishop, and we get a recommend. However, after the goal has been accomplished, we sometimes drop back into our past mediocrity because we are not prepared to carry through. Sometimes we even go to college or we go on missions or we do some other great thing, but because we lack the necessary buildup to give us the follow-through and determination, it doesn't do us the good that was intended.<br><br>The other day I heard a story that I think ought to be in the Bible. A young mother was called upon to talk about some of the things that had happened in her life to prepare her for the responsibilities of her future home. She brought with her to the stand her husband and six children. She then told about a time before she was married when she attended the commencement exercises at her graduation, and the speaker talked to the students about the fact that they were now through with their schoolwork and were facing the great opportunities of the future. He pointed out some of the questions that would need to be decided. Some of the students would seek employment, and hopefully all of them would be married. He talked about this idea of looking up into the future and making some definite commitments to those values that would soon become a part of their lives.<br><br>Because this prospective mother was impressed with the speaker, and because she had thought of these things on her own power, she realized that someplace there was a man who would eventually become her husband. In her mind she wondered what he was like and she was curious about the kind of husband he would prove to be. Because she understood the antemortal life, she knew that her children were also in actual being in the spirit world. Her mother had had six children, and she had grown up with the idea that that would be an acceptable size for her family. She knew that they now walked by sight and that they would be conscious of the fact that she was preparing to be their mother.<br><br>She knew that her children would be very concerned about her and they would want to come into this life through her instrumentality under the best circumstances and not the worst. So after thinking about it, she decided to sit down and write them a letter. They would not be born for a number of years, but she was looking ahead to what would ultimately take place and she wrote them to make a kind of progress report of their future mother.<br><br>She told them about this commencement service that she had attended and that she had finished her schoolwork and that she had graduated with high honors and was pleased about that. In her letter she said to them, "I have never done anything in my life up to this point that I think would make you ashamed to recognize me as your mother, and I will promise you right now, as I go out to look for your father, that I will never accept anyone for that office who would not be the kind of man who could make us a good living and maintain a high standard of life and take us through the temple on his own power and have the kind of family unit that the Lord would like us to have."<br><br>Later on, when she met her husband and he asked her to marry him, she explained to him that she had made some commitments to some other people. She talked about these family members whose mother she was to be. This man was delighted that she had such extraordinary vision and would look out for the welfare of those children who were also going to be his.<br><br>They were married in the temple under the finest circumstances, and they were happy. As she finished her talk, she read extracts from some of these letters that she had written to her antemortal children many years before. Then she asked her husband and her children to stand up and she introduced them to the audience. And her program would make a good New Year's resolution for many fine people.<br><br>But for all of us, this month of January is a month when we look up into the new year and also plan for more effective lives. We can prelive our marriages. We can prelive our deaths. Suppose we think occasionally of the kind of people we would like to be on that very special future occasion of our marriage, when we stand up in the house of the Lord that has been dedicated for his sacred purposes and take some very special person by the right hand and promise her or him that throughout our lifetimes we will be faithful. We will be true to those great trusts of life that have been given us as we have come into mortality.<br><h2><b>Living according to the Bible</b></h2><br>There are many places where we do not want to have any recessionals. It is very important that the Lord should be with us yet, lest we forget the promises we have made to him. Since the days of Queen Victoria, the great British nation, ruling much of the area from the palms in the south to the pines in the north, has lost much of its territory. And many of the people have lost much of their traditional faith where they lived by the Book. But only as long as England lived by the Book did she continue to be the world's greatest nation. It is interesting to us that even yet England and her offshoot nations are the only nations that have made this great idea of democracy and free enterprise work on a large scale over a long period of time. But the center of religious gravity has now passed to the United States, and America now has become the land of the Book.<br><br>If you read in the Book of Mormon the vision that was given to the prophet Nephi, you will see that he was permitted to see us and our time and what we did here as this great nation was being established upon the Western Hemisphere. The angel pointed out to Nephi that these people carried with them a book as they went forth in this great accomplishment. The angel said, "Knowest thou the meaning of the book?" Nephi said, "I know not." Then the angel explained to him that this book was the great Bible record that was carried by these people as they came to our shores (see 1 Nephi 13:21–23).<br><br>As the "land of the Book," we sell more Bibles in the United States than in all the rest of the world put together. We do more toward trying to help other people. This is the place where the gospel of Jesus Christ has been restored. This is the center of education. This is the center of invention. This is the place that the Lord looks to for the gospel to go out all over the earth. This is the reason for which you are at this great University: to prepare yourselves to serve the Church, and to serve your family, and to serve this great nation, and to serve God and to serve your own interests. Every one of us was permitted to come to this earth with the hope that we might qualify for the celestial kingdom. If we are only interested in the terrestrial or the telestial kingdoms, it is not necessary to be baptized. It isn't necessary to come to Brigham Young University if you are only interested in the telestial kingdom. You can get into the telestial kingdom without any education. If you are only interested in the telestial kingdom, it is not necessary to be married in the temple, because if you qualify only for the telestial kingdom you won't have your families anyway.<br><br>One of the greatest ideas there is in the world for us is that we should be the "land of the Book." Our lives should be lives patterned after and following the great commandments and directions that are given us in the Holy Bible and in the other volumes of scripture that have been given to assist us. This ability to prelive the future includes the opportunity to prelive our eternal lives. I don't know just what it would be like if we sometime discovered that we had become telestial people. I do know that it would be something less fine, less glorious, less satisfactory, and we would be less happy. It would be as far below the celestial as the twinkle of a tiny star is below the blaze of the noonday sun.<br><h2><b>Planning for our last hours</b></h2><br>Somebody said that the most important event in life is death. That is the graduation day. Death is our only possible entrance into immortality. The last hour of life is the key hour. That is the hour that judges all of the other hours. Nobody can judge anybody's life until his last hour. That is, you couldn't write the life story of Jesus of Nazareth or of Judas Iscariot without knowing about what each did in has last hour. But suppose you go forward today and prelive your last hour and find out what kind of a person you would like to be at that time.<br><br>I would like to tell you the story of two men who lived with a recession in their last hour. The first of these is the old legendary story of Faust. You may remember that Dr. John Faust died in Wittenberg, Germany, in the year 1540. Twenty-four years before his death, Faust had made a deal wherein he sold his soul to Satan. He said to Satan, "If you will assist me for twenty-four years, punishing my enemies and aiding my friends, at the end of that time, I will forever deliver up my soul." Now that was a great idea because twenty-four years was a long time. It seemed to Faust that it would never exhaust itself. Twenty-four years was longer than Faust had lived in his entire lifetime up to that point. But what difference did it make anyway what happened after twenty-four years? There is an optical illusion in our perspective that sometimes gets us into difficulties because it makes everything close by seem large and impressive and everything in the distance seem small and of little importance.<br><br>This is the problem that got Esau into trouble. You remember Esau came home one night and said, "Jacob, if you will give me your mess of pottage, I will assign over to you my birthright." Now, to one who had just had a good dinner, that would not seem like a very intelligent trade. But Esau was hungry. I suppose he thought, "What difference does it make what happens in ten years? What good is my birthright when I am hungry right now?" I don't even know what a "mess" of pottage is. It doesn't sound very appetizing to me, but Esau traded off everything he had to get it (see Genesis 25:29–34). We make that same mistake every day. Every day each one of us in some way trades off some future birthright for some present pottage.<br><br>Faust also made this great mistake. But Satan, with more perfect perception, said, "I will wait on Faustus while he lives, and he shall buy my service with his soul." Then the twenty-four years began and Faust had every experience of good and bad. But almost before he was aware, it was said to Faust, as it must be said to every one of us, "Thine hour is come." He had never made any attempt to prelive the future or make any New Year's resolutions about it, and now that it had actually arrived, he realized for the first time how badly he had cheated himself. And then he wished that the bargain could be set aside. But that wasn't possible. Then he prayed and he said, "Oh, God, if thou canst have no mercy on my soul, at least grant some end to my incessant pain. Let Faustus live in hell a thousand years or even a hundred thousand, but as last be saved." But he knew that, according to his own bargain, even this could never be. Then he sat and watched the clock tick off the seconds. Finally, just before the hour struck, the last words of Faust before he died were "Faustus is gone to hell."<br><br>If Faust had lived his last hour first and tried to understand what kind of a person he would like to be then and what kind of record he would like to have, then he would never have made those serious mistakes that brought him to that unpleasant place.<br><br>The other story is Shakespeare's story of the great Cardinal Wolsey in the play<i>Henry VIII.</i>You may remember that the Cardinal was a very wealthy man. He had great power. He had made and unmade kings and kingdoms, but along the way, thinking as most of us do that the end would never find him out, he had done evil, and in his last hour he found himself discovered, discredited, and discarded. His property had been confiscated by the state, his robes had been withdrawn by the church, and in the humble place where he went to die, he said substantially this:<br><br><i>The last hour of my long and weary life has come upon me. I have done not well and may God have mercy on my soul. Farewell, a long farewell to all my greatness. This is the state of man. Today he puts forth the tender leaves of hope, tomorrow blossoms and bears his blushing honors thick upon him. The third day comes the frost, the killing frost, and then he falls as I do, never to hope again. I have ventured many summers in a sea of glory far beyond my depth. I have sounded all the depths and shoals of honor. But I have missed the way. My high blown pride at last broke under me and left me weary and old in service to the mercy of the rude stream.</i><br><br>Then he said to his servant, the only one who had not forsaken him:<br><br><i>Oh, Cromwell, Cromwell, I charge thee, fling away ambition. By that sin the angels fell. Corruption wins not more than honesty. Be just and fear not, let all the ends thou aimest at be thy country's, thy God's and truth's. Then if thou diest, thou diest a blessed martyr.</i><br><br>Then he said:<br><br><i>Oh, Cromwell, Cromwell, had I but served my God with half the zeal I served my king, he would not in mine age have left me naked to mine enemies.</i><br><br>If the great cardinal had prelived his life, if he had done some thinking and some determining about the kind of person that he would like to be, not just on a temporary basis, but throughout his life, then he would never have come to this disastrous place which was his end.<br><br>So on this occasion, I'd like to remind you again of this period of the New Year, when we must not forget the lessons that we have learned in the previous year. We should not forget the month of January with the authority Janus had of doors and beginnings. This is the one time each year when we look back into the past and then start over with new beginnings on a clean sheet. This past year we may have been plunged into several kinds of recessions which have made it a little more impressive that we should let no recessions get a hold in our lives.<br><br>We pray to God that no recession will ever take place in the significance of Easter or Memorial Day or Mother's Day or Father's Day or that first day or each week which is our Heavenly Father's day. And as we commemorate Thanksgiving and that tremendously important period of Christmas, we ought not to cause a recession by packing up our tinsel and our ornaments and forgetting the significance for which these periods were set apart. Father, we ought to pass into the New Year as one of the greatest of all great days where we form convictions and make decisions that will govern all of our future lives.<br><br>May the Lord bless you, my young brothers and sisters, as you continue this thrilling experience that you are having at this great University. I don't know of anyplace in the world that is a better place for you to be than here where you can partake of the Spirit of the Lord and the spirit of this great faculty led by this wonderful University President.<br><br>May God help each one of us to be successful, I humbly pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Sterling W.

<h1> in Tough Times: What Shall We Do Then? - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Thank you, President Oaks, for your gracious introduction.<br><br>I am very pleased to meet with you wonderful students of Brigham Young University today and to express a few thoughts that I hope will be helpful.<br><br>As I have had the opportunity of meeting with a number of you over the past few weeks, I am impressed with your concern, even a grave concern, for those things that come into your lives over which you have no control. When tragedy, sorrow, setback, disappointment, humiliation, wealth, unusual success, acclaim, and recognition come into our lives, what shall we do then? How do we cope with the unexpected? How do we do our best to meet those challenges and situations? Often we say, "I wonder what I would do should that problem come into my life as it has into the life of my friend." How do we develop attitudes of strength that will see us through life's unexpected challenges?<br><br>At the time of John the Baptist and our Savior Jesus Christ, there were also those then who had grave concern about the personal uncertainties of their lives and their futures and what conduct would be acceptable to the Savior and the great forerunner John the Baptist. From Luke I share:<br><br><i>And the people asked him, saying, What shall we do then?. . .</i><br><br><i>Then came also publicans to be baptized, and said unto him, Master, what shall we do? . . .</i><br><br><i>And the soldiers likewise demanded of him, saying, And what shall we do?</i>[Luke 3:10, 12, 14]<br><br>It is my firm conviction that, when joy, sorrow, success, temporary failure, victory, hurt, misunderstanding, and loss come into our lives, what we do with them is the key to the future. What we do with what happens to us is more important than what happens to us. The direction in which we are moving is more important than place or situation. We may have stumbled or been grievously hurt, but we have not fallen if we are willing to get back up.<br><br>In preparation for my remarks today, I have asked some of you to help me. Some have written and shared questions and concerns. Many are on hand. All are greatly appreciated and worthy. Time today will permit me the opportunity of taking up only a few. Hopefully, from those selected, one problem may relate to you today, tomorrow, or in the future and give you strength. I would like to discuss them in keeping with the question from Luke 3:10 previously mentioned--"What shall we do then?"--and share with you examples of worthy people who have known what to do, with God's help, when the unexpected has struck.<br><h2><b>Overcoming uncontrollable events</b></h2><br>The first question: "Sometimes happenings in life are cruel. You prepare, doing everything in your power to ready yourselves for tests and important events, and then the uncontrollable strikes, stripping you of your potential. What shall we do then?"<br><br>In responding to this question, I want to use one more question given to me. Here it is: "After much preparation and prayer for our first football bowl game, why did the Lord allow our first-string quarterback to receive injuries early in the contest and reduce our chances of victory as millions of viewers looked on? It could have been such a great missionary tool."<br><br>Perhaps the best way to answer that question is to review the facts. It's the first quarter, with BYU leading six to nothing. Sheide injures his shoulder. What shall we do then? Do we quit? No, we rally around a less experienced quarterback. We dig in. We play harder. We give it our all. We press for victory. We're seen by millions on television, and we are proud of that public exposure. The determined men representing the school then knew what to do and, thank the Lord, they did it. It was a good missionary tool. I saw maturity; I saw character; I saw quality on that football field. I commend Coach Edwards and his associates for knowing what to do and for "hanging in there tough." (I am pleased to note that Coach Edwards was selected as the Utah Sportsman of the Year yesterday for his record and for his image.)<br><h2><b>Understanding tragic deaths</b></h2><br>The second question: "Recently we have been shocked at the tragic deaths of full-time missionaries. What shall we do, as family members and friends, in relationship to our Heavenly Father when this is allowed to strike us?"<br><br>Some of you from Honolulu knew Tony Sanchez. Others, like President Golden K. Driggs, who is in attendance today, knew him in the Louisiana Shreveport Mission. I never knew Tony Sanchez as a missionary. I only knew him as a hospital patient in the St. Francis Hospital in Honolulu, where his stake president took me to see him following a serious injury on a tricky bar or recreation bar while serving in the mission field. He had fallen and broken his back. Now he was resting motionless in the hospital. What could we say to give him comfort and hope? As we walked into his room, we met his mother standing at his side. Tony was completely immobile, unable to talk. I think the only thing he was able to move at that time was his eyeballs. While I was wondering what I should say to Tony and to his mother, his mother spoke first and said, "Elder Ashton, I have always wanted to be a nurse, and I have never had the opportunity. Now I am a nurse to my injured son." Later she said, "Elder Ashton, I hope we will be blessed with the privilege of sending our other son into the mission field. Just because we have had this tragedy is no reason why our other son should be deprived, is it?" I understand, following the death of Tony in that hospital a few days later, that the mother, the father, and the entire family have their desire. Tony's brother James is in the Language Training Mission on campus today, preparing himself to go to South America on a mission. It was interesting when someone said, "Could I help with funds for James's mission?"<br><br>The family said, "No. We have a little money left over from Tony's insurance, and that is going toward his brother's mission." This is a tremendous example of courage and character in action. What shall we do then? The Sanchez family knew well what to do and did it.<br><h2><b>Dealing with challenges in marriage</b></h2><br>The third question: "I am about to marry. My husband-to-be and I want nothing more than continuing happiness throughout our marriage. We know that unforeseen challenges and even disappointments may come. If tragedy strikes our marriage, what shall we do then?"<br><br>Last month Sister Zina Card Brown, wife of Elder Hugh B. Brown of the Council of the Twelve, passed away. At the time, they had been married sixty-six years. Let me share Elder Brown's thoughts expressed just a few weeks before her passing:<br><br><i>Eight years ago my sweetheart, Zina, suffered a massive stroke that took her speech and left her paralyzed. The doctors said she probably would not survive the week. As our children surrounded her bed, I pled with the Lord to spare her life. Then I spoke to her, though she was unconscious. I reminded her that through the years of our married courtship we had planned and hoped to take the final trip together. I told her I wanted what was best for her and our Father's will, but life would seem so empty without her presence. I think the Lord in his mercy permitted Zina her choice--she could travel on into immortality and rest, or remain to bless us with her exhibition of quiet faith, patience, and fortitude. Characteristically, she chose to do what she knew would give me greatest comfort, unmindful of her own tribulation. Hers is truly a Christ-like love. Our entire family has been blessed and benefited by her unselfish sacrifice in our behalf. Noble characters do not alone bear trouble; they use it.</i><br><h2><b>Helping inactive Church members</b></h2><br>The fourth question: "Some of our closest friends are not totally committed to the Church. The fellows don't honor their priesthood, and the girls are only conveniently active. We like them for what they are. We don't want to strain our choice relationships. Talk seems to do no good at all. What shall we do then?"<br><br>In answer to this question, shortly before Christmas we had the opportunity of going to the hospital at the request of a mother whose fifty-five-year-old son was seriously ill. As we met with them and tried to give them comfort, the fifty-five-year-old patient's nephew was in the hospital room as well. The afflicted one's wife said, "Elder Ashton, would it be possible for you to give my husband a blessing?" I nodded approval and looked in the direction of the thirty-year-old nephew and said, "Are you an elder?"<br><br>He said, "Yes, I am an elder, but don't ask me to put my hands on his head. I am not worthy to participate in a blessing with you."<br><br>As he backed away, I said, "Roland, how would you like to try to be worthy for ten minutes? Couldn't you be worthy for a few minutes while you help me give this needed blessing?"<br><br>He nodded his head and said, "I think I can be worthy for a few minutes."<br><br>While he was walking close to the side of the bed, I said, "If you can do it for ten minutes, you can do it for thirty minutes."<br><br>He said, "Yes."<br><br>I said, "If you can do it for thirty minutes, you can do it for a day, can't you?" About then I felt he figured we had better get on with the blessing or he would be committed. We gave his uncle a blessing, and when it was over he said, "Thank you for letting me share this blessing with you. No one has ever put it up to me like this before. I will try to be worthy."<br><br>I leave you that story in answer to this question. Perhaps, my friends, the best way to help some of our associates who are not quite as active as they should be is to involve them. I don't know of anything that would be more important and have more impact upon an inactive person than to have you call and say, "Would you help me to administer to my wife, my roommate, or my friend?" Give him an opportunity to make shaping up a process.<br><h2><b>Coping with terminal illness</b></h2><br>The fifth question: "Terminal illnesses like cancer seem to be striking with more frequency among our age group. We fast, pray, and try to help families so afflicted but feel so helpless. What shall we do then?"<br><br>I would like to share a mother's comment as she was tending a twenty-nine-year-old daughter, Christine Jacobsen Cannon, buried Saturday. The mother said, "We thank our Heavenly Father we have had her for all of 1974. We count each day a bonus. How close we have become during her critical illness. We are filling every hour with the most we can." I had the opportunity of seeing faith, courage, character, and fight in one so sorely afflicted with this terminal disease. I thank her for what she did for me in exhibiting the answer to "what shall we do then?"<br><h2><b>Preventing arrogance</b></h2><br>The sixth question: "I have been somewhat successful in school with grades, popularity, leadership recognition, and other things. I am proud and pleased with these developments, but I am concerned about becoming self-sufficient and even arrogant. When I feel the dangers of these possibilities, what shall I do then?"<br><br>I am reminded of what President Spencer W. Kimball said at the dedication of the Washington Temple:<br><br><i>Bless all people, our Father, that they may prosper, but not more than their faith can stand. . . . Our Father, in blessing Thy people with prosperity, we pray that they may not be surfeited with flocks and herds and acres and barns and wealth which could bring them to worship these false gods.</i><br><br>Taking freedom with President Kimball's admonition, may I, for our purpose today, say, "Oh God, do not bless us with more stocks, bonds, properties, automobiles, or credit cards than our faith can stand or more than our parents can bear." A worthy prayer, fellow students: "Dear God, in all the days ahead, please bless me with what I need and can stand, not with what I want."<br><br>I am thinking of Johnny Miller, a former BYU student and probably the greatest golfer in the world today. What is it they are calling him today--"twenty-five under Miller"? The greatest challenge he has today is how to handle, how to meet, and how to cope with success. I pray the Lord will help this wonderful young man. He said his next goal is to shoot in the fifties. I want him to know I am a little ahead of him. I am going to shoot in the forties. Coaches Carl Tucker and Floyd Miller of the BYU staff have indicated I might make that in the spring. If I do, I am going back and play the<i>back</i>nine!<br><br>"Bless us, O God, that we may not have more success than we can stand." I know some say, "I would like to have that challenge"; but, believe me, it is real and difficult. Knowing how to cope with what happens to us, good or bad, is a continuing challenge.<br><h2><b>Avoiding self-pity</b></h2><br>The seventh question: "With each passing day I miss my mother more. She was taken from us in death when I was ten. I know it is not wise, but on occasion I allow myself pity and poor-performance excuses for this loss in my life. When I get in these moods, what shall I do then?"<br><br>A friend of mine lost his mother when he was eleven. He almost died at thirteen with typhoid fever. Then smallpox almost took him later on in his teens. Later cancerous throat conditions and an operation took away his voice. Bell's palsy of the face muscles followed this affliction. Heart deterioration made heart surgery necessary at age seventy-seven. Do you know who my friend is? President Spencer W. Kimball. I bear witness today that one of the reasons he is a prophet is because, with God's help, under every condition he has known what to do.<br><br>As we go through the rest of the days of our lives, now is the time for decision making. What am I going to do about it? What are you going to do about it? When tomorrow comes with challenges, opportunities, successes, joys, or disappointments, we must be ready to perform effectively when what shall we do then becomes now.<br><br>We are all different. God in his wisdom has so created us. Only we can determine what we will do with what happens to us. What we do with what happens to us is more important than what happens to us. Certainly with God's help we can do what is right.<br><br>What shall we do then? Let us resolve to so live that the Lord can say to us, as he did to the Prophet Joseph Smith in some of his darkest, most trying hours: "My son, peace be unto thy soul; thine adversity and thine afflictions shall be but a small moment; And then, if thou endure it well, God shall exalt thee on high; thou shalt triumph" (D&amp;amp;C 121:7–8).<br><br>God lives. He is our Father. He knows us. He stands ready to help us. He has placed us here in life to see what we will do under all conditions and situations. It is a time of trial, tribulation, and testing. Often we would prefer to have "this cup pass" rather than go through the consequences. We must never lose sight of the fact that often success, popularity, and fame are more difficult to live with than uneventful calm or even tragedy. "Though he were a Son, yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered" (Hebrews 5:8) or the things he experienced.<br><br>We came into this life for experience, and that's all we can take out of it. Thank God we have the right to decide personally and individually what we shall do then. The future does belong to those who know what to do with it. Look forward to the unknown with optimism and confidence. Look to tomorrow with happy expectancy, realizing that with God's help you can do all things. You and your Heavenly Father can make right decisions together, and with his companionship, I promise you success.<br><br>I leave you my witness that Jesus is the Christ. God is our Father. Spencer W. Kimball is a prophet of God. If you would know what to do in the days ahead, follow the counsel and leadership of the prophet of God. I again bear witness to you that we have no need to fear. The only thing we have to fear is what we are going to do with what comes, not what comes.<br><br>May our Heavenly Father help you to go forward with a firm resolve that you are bigger than anything that can happen to you. With God's help, you can be victorious. Resolve now that you will make proper decisions and carry them out to the benefit of yourself and those who depend upon you, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Marvin J.

<h1>Commandments of a Peculiar People - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Thank you, President Oaks. I am honored and delighted to have this opportunity to meet and worship with the student body and faculty of Brigham Young University on this occasion. I have pondered and prayed much to learn what the Lord wants me to say to the youth of Zion, to the young and rising generation of the Church. My prayer has been and is, "O God, manifest unto thy servant what thou wouldst have said to those who are a choice and a peculiar treasure unto thee above all the peoples of the earth." In response, there has come into my heart the desire to consider our unique and peculiar status as members of the only true and living church upon the face of the whole earth. If I may now be guided by the Spirit, I shall take up the doctrine that we are a peculiar people; show wherein that peculiarity lies; tell how it may be obtained and perfected; and draw some conclusions as to what is expected of us because of our unique status.<br><h2><b>We Are a Peculiar People</b></h2><br>There is an old saying, "All the world is queer save me and thee, and sometimes I think even thee is a little queer." This is used jocularly of those who set themselves apart from mankind and who profess to be or seemingly are different from other people. We do not place ourselves in this category. We are not freaks, but normal, wholesome people who enjoy life. We work and play, engage in sports, mingle with other people, go to parties, and enjoy festive occasions. But we are, nonetheless, peculiar in the eyes of worldly people. We are a breed set apart. We are different from the world because we do not ape the practices and follow the fashions of worldly and carnal people. We glory in the things which set us apart by ourselves, and we hope and pray that we may maintain and increase the differences. Of the true saints, with whom we are numbered, Peter said: "But ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people." Having so announced, he told what is expected of them: "That ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light" (1 Peter 2:9).<br><br>Query: "How shall we show forth the praises of him who called us out of darkness into his marvelous light?" This is equivalent to asking "How do we worship the Lord?"<br><br>Answer: It is more than in song or sermon; perfect worship is emulation. Perfect praise is to do the things he would have us do. It is to keep the commandments of God.<br><br>To true saints, and we are they, Paul wrote:<br><br><i>For the grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men,</i><br><br><i>Teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts,</i>we should live soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present world;<br><br><i>Looking for that blessed hope</i>[the hope of eternal life],<i>and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Savior Jesus Christ;</i><br><br><i>Who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works.</i>[Titus 2:11–14; emphasis added]<br><br>Query: "How does the Lord purify unto himself a peculiar people?"<br><br>Answer: He does it when that people forsake ungodliness and worldly lusts, when they live "soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present world." He does it when that people take counsel from him and keep his commandments.<br><br>To his chosen Israel, of whom we are a part, the Lord said: "If ye will obey my voice indeed, and keep my covenant, then ye shall be a peculiar treasure unto me above all people: for all the earth is mine: And ye shall be unto me a kingdom of priests, and an holy nation" (Exodus 19:5–6). Note the terms of the Lord's offer: "Obey my voice; keep my covenant." This covenant is the fulness of his everlasting gospel. It is the new and everlasting covenant in which we promise to forsake the world and in which he promises us an inheritance with him in his Father's kingdom. All those who keep the covenant, who live by gospel standards, receive this promise: "For thou art an holy people unto the Lord thy God, and the Lord hath chosen thee to be a peculiar people unto himself, above all the nations that are upon the earth" (Deuteronomy 14:2). And I say to you, "You are that people--'an holy people,' a chosen and favored people, a people set apart, 'a peculiar people.'"<br><h2><b>The Family of the Lord</b></h2><br>Now, with those principles before us, may I speak of the special family relationship enjoyed by those who so live that they become a peculiar people. Of them it is written: "Ye are the sons of the living God" (Hosea 1:10). That is, those who gain the high status of a peculiar people are adopted into the family of the Lord Jehovah. They become his sons and his daughters and have him as their father. Our best recitation of the doctrine here involved is found in these words of King Benjamin:<br><br><i>And now, because of the covenant which ye have made</i>[in the waters of baptism],<i>ye shall be called the children of Christ, his sons and his daughters; for behold, this day he hath spiritually begotten you; for ye say that your hearts are changed through faith on his name; therefore, ye are born of him and have become his sons and his daughters.</i>[Mosiah 5:7]<br><br>This is a special family relationship reserved for the faithful. It is over, above, and in addition to the fact that all men are the spirit children of the Eternal Father.<br><br>King Benjamin continues:<br><br><i>And under this head ye are made free, and there is no other head whereby ye can be made free. There is no other name given whereby salvation cometh; therefore, I would that ye should take upon you the name of Christ, all you that have entered into the covenant with God that ye should be obedient unto the end of your lives.</i><br><br><i>And it shall come to pass that whosever doeth this shall be found at the right hand of God, for he shall know the name by which he is called; for he shall be called by the name of Christ.</i>[Mosiah 5:8–9]<br><br>This is a glorious and wondrous doctrine. We are the sons and daughters of the living God, the children of the great Jehovah, the adopted offspring of the Lord Jesus Christ. We bear the name of Christ. We are members of his family. He is our father. Now, how do we gain such a personal relationship with him who has bought us with his blood? He says:<br><br><i>But to as many as received me gave I power to become my sons; and even so will I give unto as many as will receive me, power to become my sons.</i><br><br><i>And verily, verily, I say unto you, he that receiveth my gospel receiveth me; and he that receiveth not my gospel receiveth not me.</i><br><br><i>And this is my gospel--repentance and baptism by water, and then cometh the baptism of fire and the Holy Ghost, even the Comforter, which showeth all things, and teacheth the peaceable things of the kingdom.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 39:4–6]<br><br>When we partake of the sacrament, we renew the covenants made in the waters of baptism. We agree again to take upon ourselves the name of the Son and to keep his commandments so we shall always have his Spirit to be with us.<br><br>Baptism and the sacrament are the ordinances which open the door so that as a people, peculiar and set apart from the world, we have power to become sons and daughters of God. Obeying and conforming, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, living soberly and righteously and godly in this present world--such a way of life is the course whereby the power is exercised and the desired eventuality obtained.<br><br>In my father's family we had a saying, "Remember who you are and act accordingly." I adopted this same motto for my family. My wife tells me that her father did precisely the same thing. Our family motto meant to us, "First, you are a McConkie; you have been taught the truth; you know what is expected of you at all times; you are to live by the standards of the family and avoid anything that would stain the family name. Second, you are a Christian; Jehovah is your shepherd; the Lord Jesus is your father; you are to live by gospel standards and not do anything which would bring disrepute upon him whose name you bear; you are to keep his commandments."<br><br>Now, in the light of the principle that we are a peculiar people who have become the sons and daughters of him who is our Lord, may I suggest some specific things that will help us overcome the world and make the doctrines here involved live in us. I shall do this by presenting what we may term the ten commandments of a peculiar people. First the commandments and then a brief commentary about them.<br><h2><b>Be Virtuous</b></h2><br>The first commandment:<i>Thou shalt be morally clean and conform to every standard of virtue and chastity.</i><br><br>The commentary: People who live after the manner of the world are immoral and unclean--so much so that we sometimes wonder whether there are any moral standards left among men. People speak of a new morality, which is, in fact, immorality under a new name. We are confronted on every hand--on radio, on television, in the movies, and in the so-called literature that is available--with a recitation of standards that are contrary to gospel principles. They are inherent in the course that the world pursues.<br><br>But the true Saints still adhere to the divine decree, "Thou shalt not commit adultery" (Exodus 20:14). We still believe "that whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart" (Matthew 5:28). Our proclamation still is "thou shalt love thy wife with all thy heart, and shalt cleave unto her and none else. And he that looketh upon a woman to lust after her shall deny the faith, and shall not have the spirit" (D&amp;amp;C 42:22–23). Immorality is the crying evil of our day. It ranks next to murder in the category of personal sins. We must shun it, avoid it, flee from it. It destroys men spiritually in this life and sends them to an endless hell in the life to come. The word of the Lord given to the world through us still is "For I, the Lord God, delight in the chastity of women. And whoredoms are an abomination before me; thus saith the Lord of Hosts" (Jacob 2:28).<br><h2><b>Bridle Your Passions</b></h2><br>The second commandment:<i>Thou shalt bridle thy passions and abstain from all manner of lasciviousness.</i><br><br>The commentary: We are here in mortality to be tried and tested; we are on probation. The great test is whether we overcome the lusts of the flesh, flee from that which is lewd, and live by gospel standards. We are to overcome the world. If we get involved in necking and petting, if we go to pornographic movies, if we read trashy and vulgar books or magazines, if we tell or enjoy vulgar stories, if we profane and are unclean in thought or word, we are living after the manner of the world. Then there is nothing peculiar about us. We are as the generality of mankind. We are outside the family circle. We lose our status as the sons and daughters of our Lord. Oh that it might be said of us, as it was of them of old:<br><br><i>There was no contention in the land, because of the love of God which did dwell in the hearts of the people.</i><br><br><i>And there were no envyings, nor strifes, nor tumults, nor whoredoms, nor lyings, nor murders, nor any manner of lasciviousness; and surely there could not be a happier people among all the people who had been created by the hand of God.</i>[4 Nephi 15–16]<br><br>What an accolade that is! Surely there could not be a "happier people among all the people who had been crated by the hand of God." True happiness is found only in righteous conduct. No one can live after the manner of the world and be truly happy. "Wickedness never was happiness" (Alma 41:10).<br><h2><b>Be Modest</b></h2><br>The third commandment:<i>Thou shalt be modest in dress and appearance.</i><br><br>Commentary: It may come as a surprise to some people to learn that modesty in dress and grooming is related to salvation. I left the Missionary Executive Committee meeting this morning to come here, and the last item approved was a document to go to mission presidents, stake presidents, and bishops instructing each to counsel all returned missionaries to conform to the dress and grooming standards that had prevailed in their missions.<br><br>The Bible has a great deal to say about covering our nakedness, about costly and ornate apparel, about excessive use of jewelry, about garish and worldly costumes, and yes, about hair styles. Women are told to avoid "plaiting" the hair and not to wear "broided hair." I suggest you figure out what those things mean in the context where they were used by Peter and Paul. The Holy Book approves long hair for women and short hair for men: "Doth not even nature itself teach you," Paul says, "that, if a man have long hair, it is a shame unto him?" (1 Corinthians 11:14). I noted in the church section of the<i>Deseret News</i>that within the month President Spencer W. Kimball, speaking before a similar group, quoted that sentence from Paul with the same application that we're making here.<br><br>Conformity to dress and grooming standards is one of the tests the Lord imposes upon us to see if we will take counsel and to see if we can stand up against the pressures of the world. There is, of course, an underlying reason for all the counsels and commands relayed from the Lord by the Brethren to the Saints. Immodesty, for instance, leads toward immorality. Long hair and grubby grooming open the door to rebellion against the established order and to associations which lead away from the Church. Surely those who are so adorned are not living soberly, righteously, and godly in this present world. But even if we are not sufficiently in tune to recognize the valid reasons behind the dress and grooming standards, we are still expected to abide by them. We might well hark back to the counsel given Adam to offer sacrifices. He, not knowing the underlying reasons, did so in order to conform to the counsel that the Lord gave. And in due course the angel from heaven explained what was involved.<br><h2><b>Be Honest</b></h2><br>The fourth commandment:<i>Thou shalt be honest and manifest integrity in all thy doings.</i><br><br>The commentary: The devil whispers to men, "Lie a little; there is no harm in a little dishonesty; a little stealing won't matter; everybody cheats on an exam and you have to in order to get by; don't search out the true owner of lost property; learn to get along in the world by living the way worldly people live." We are living in a day when evil is on the increase. Shoplifting, crime, and dishonest practices prevail in increasing measure throughout the world. In my judgment this will continue until the day of the coming of the Son of Man when the wicked will be destroyed, the earth will be regenerated, and we will have a new way of life. I think also that in the midst of these worldly circumstances the Church itself, at least the faithful portion of it, is being perfected. We are living by higher standards, and we are preparing ourselves to be that people who will be ready for the Lord when he comes again. As to these matters, the Lord our God has never rescinded that which is written: "Thou shalt not steal" (Exodus 20:15). No amendment has ever been appended to the decree "Wo unto the liar, for he shall be thrust down to hell" (2 Nephi 9:34). The honor code is still in force. Neither a dishonest man nor a man lacking in integrity can be saved in the kingdom of God.<br><h2><b>Pay Your Offerings</b></h2><br>The fifth commandment:<i>Thou shalt pay thy tithes and offerings unto the Lord.</i><br><br>The commentary: Tithes and offerings divide the faithful from the unfaithful. All men will give an accounting before the judgment bar for the manner in which they used the moneys and properties that came into their hands while in mortality. "The love of money is the root of all evil" (1 Timothy 6:10). And that includes the inordinate attachment to money that is legally and properly your own. The Lord said to Martin Harris, "And again, I command thee that thou shalt not covet thine own property, but impart it freely to the printing of the Book of Mormon" (D&amp;amp;C 19:26). Speaking of making our money and property available for building up the kingdom, Paul says, "He which soweth sparingly shall reap also sparingly; and he which soweth bountifully shall reap also bountifully. Every man according as he purposeth in his heart, so let him give; not grudgingly or of necessity: for God loveth a cheerful giver" (2 Corinthians 9:6–7). Well might we remember the revelation which says, "For he that is tithed shall not be burned at his coming" (D&amp;amp;C 64:23). Some people say tithing is pretty good fire insurance.<br><h2><b>Keep the Sabbath</b></h2><br>The sixth commandment:<i>Thou shalt go to sacrament meeting and keep the Sabbath day holy.</i><br><br>The commentary: We live in an age when almost the whole world is rushing about madly in search of pleasure. Nearly everyone sets the weekend apart for recreational purposes, and this means for Sabbath violation. The generality of mankind fish, play golf, go to movies, or otherwise (as they suppose) seek surcease from the toil of the week. There are churches which conduct their worship services on Friday evening or Saturday morning to free their adherents for recreational pursuits on the Lord's day. The law of the Lord, given anew in our day, counsels us:<br><br><i>That thou mayest more fully keep thyself unspotted from the world, thou shalt go to the house of prayer and offer up thy sacraments upon my holy day;</i><br><br><i>For verily this is a day appointed unto you to rest from your labors, and to pay thy devotions unto the Most High.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 59:9–10]<br><h2><b>Keep the Word of Wisdom</b></h2><br>The seventh commandment:<i>Thou shalt keep the Word of Wisdom.</i><br><br>The commentary: We have received from the Lord a law of health which, if kept, will assure us not only of physical well-being, but also of great outpourings of spiritual enlightenment. This law is divided into affirmative counsel, telling us what we may properly eat, and negative counsel, which forbids the use of certain things which are injurious to the body. While the great hosts of men--of people in the world--reel and stagger through life in an alcoholic stupor; while they immerse themselves in the stinking fumes of tobacco; while they drown themselves in gallons of semipoisonous tea and coffee; while they inhale the smoke of marijuana or otherwise afflict themselves with mind-destroying drugs; the Saints of the Most High, in all their peculiarity, avoid these things for the plague that they are.<br><br>Theirs is this promise:<br><br><i>And all saints who remember to keep and do these sayings, walking in obedience to the commandments, shall receive health in their navel and marrow to their bones;</i><br><br><i>And shall find wisdom and great treasures of knowledge, even hidden treasures;</i><br><br><i>And shall run and not be weary, and shall walk and not faint.</i><br><br><i>And I, the Lord, give unto them a promise, that the destroying angel shall pass by them, as the children of Israel, and not slay them.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 89:18–21]<br><br>Now note what was involved: First, "walking in obedience to the commandments," for the World of Wisdom is more than a law of health; and second, those keeping it "shall find wisdom and great treasures of knowledge, even hidden treasures." These hidden treasures include such things as a testimony of the truth and divinity of the work, personal revelation to guide us in all our affairs and to provide us with the constant companionship of the Holy Spirit. And the eternal decree is that the Spirit will not dwell in an unclean tabernacle.<br><h2><b>Believe True Doctrines</b></h2><br>The eighth commandment:<i>Thou shalt believe true doctrines and reject the false educational theories of the world.</i><br><br>The commentary: We are saved or damned by what we believe. If we believe in the Lord Jesus Christ and the saving truths of his everlasting gospel, we have a hope of eternal life. If our beliefs embrace the philosophies of men and the vagaries of the world, they may lead to destruction. Nearly the whole educational world goes blithely along, espousing the false theories of organic evolution, which rule out the fall of man and the atonement of Christ. Men worship at the shrine of intellectuality without ever realizing that religion is a thing of the Spirit and that "the things of God knoweth no man, but the Spirit of God" (1 Corinthians 1:11). Our schools teach some principles of socialism, of communism, of so-called women's liberation, of curtailing population growth and the like--much of which runs counter to revealed gospel truths.<br><br>How grateful we should be for the revealed knowledge we have of the eternal saving truths of the gospel. We know the verities that must be comprehended, understood, and applied to our lives to give us joy and peace in this life and eternal life in the world to come. These things pertain to the nature and kind of being that God is and to the great plan of salvation which he ordained to enable his spirit children to advance and progress and become like him. The fact that Adam fell, bringing temporal and spiritual death into the world, and the fact that God sent his Only Begotten Son into the world to ransom men from the effects of the temporal and spiritual death brought upon all mankind through the fall of Adam--these are eternal verities. Other eternal verities are these--that God has spoken in our day; that the fulness of his everlasting gospel has been restored; that the church and kingdom of God has been set up on earth anew; that it administers the gospel by the power of the holy priesthood; and that there are had among us the gifts, signs, miracles, and all the wonders, blessings, and graces that were ever had in any day when the Lord had a people on earth.<br><h2><b>Serve Your Fellowmen</b></h2><br>The ninth commandment:<i>Thou shalt serve thy fellowmen and sacrifice for the building up of the kingdom.</i><br><br>The commentary: Service and sacrifice are essential to salvation. Jesus said, "I am among you as he that serveth" (Luke 22:27). King Benjamin said, "When ye are in the service of your fellow beings ye are only in the service of your God" (Mosiah 2:17). Joseph Smith taught that "a religion that does not require the sacrifice of all things never has power sufficient to produce the faith necessary to lead unto life and salvation."<br><h2><b>Pray</b></h2><br>The tenth commandment:<i>Thou shalt pour out thy soul to the Lord in mighty prayer.</i><br><br>The commentary: We are a praying people --not giving lip service only, not reciting mere words, not repeating memorized phrases--but praying with all the energy and power we possess, praying until the heavens open and the Lord rains down righteousness upon us. No one can pray with perfect faith unless he keeps the commandments. An immoral man can never generate the faith to raise the dead. A person who does not keep the Word of Wisdom will be hindered in healing the sick, and so on right down to the dress and grooming standards.<br><h2><b>God's Kingdom on Earth</b></h2><br>Such, I suggest, are the ten commandments of a peculiar people. If we live by the principles set forth in them we shall have peace in this life and be inheriters of eternal life in the world to come. If any of us now fall short in any degree, the door is open for repentance. The Lord's arm is not shortened that he will not hear, but he invites all men to come to him and partake of his goodness and grace.<br><br>There is an organization in his kingdom whereby we can receive the counsel and direction that we need. All of us have power to set our lives in order to the full so that we do "live soberly, godly, and righteously" in this present world and thereby gain the promised peace and the promised hope of an eternal reward in what we're talking about.<br><br>"What are these which are arrayed in white robes? And whence came they?" The inspired answer is "These are they which came out of great tribulation, and have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb" (Revelation 7:13–14). No one ever said or claimed that life was intended to be easy. The Lord deliberately has left us in a situation where the world is all around us and where we have to make the choices. If we choose to follow him and take the counsel that is given, we reap the blessings. And if we choose otherwise, we follow the course that the world follows and the destruction promised to them will be heaped upon us also. "To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne, even as I also overcame, and am set down with my father in his throne" (Revelation 3:21). "He that overcometh shall inherit all things; and I will be his god, and he shall be my son" (Revelation 21:7).<br><br>What a glorious and wondrous thing it is to be a member of the church and kingdom of God on earth, to have the revelations of heaven, and to know what is meant by the prophetic utterances and the counsels written by prophets and apostles. We are so blessed. This Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is God's kingdom on earth. It is led by the spirit of inspiration. If we follow the counsel and direction that we receive, then these principles about which we have talked will live in our lives. They will live because they are true and because the Lord wants to operate by these standards. Out of that kind of a course we shall get the joy and the peace "that passeth all understanding" while we are here in mortality, and we'll have a guaranteed inheritance of glory, honor, immortality, and exaltation in the realms ahead. Of this I testify and for these things I pray for all of us, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Bruce R.

<h1>iever and Keep the Faith - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
My brothers and sisters, I am overwhelmed by this large audience this evening. It is a real privilege for me to be with you. I didn't realize so many would be present, but the Brethren who have preceded me here have always come back with a glorious account of the visit and the tremendous numbers who attend these fireside gatherings.<br><br>I wish to discuss a few miscellaneous things with you. But to get myself settled, I'd like to say that I'm very proud of the Church. We are all contributing to its growth and progress. The membership is increasing. The Church is progressing well. It is getting stronger, and it is prospering. Otherwise the many buildings that have been erected, new temples constructed, and many two-ward and stake buildings could not have come into being.<br><br>I remember in the Maricopa Arizona Stake the stake president at one time was looking forward to the day when the Maricopa Stake would pay $100,000 in tithing. There are about thirteen stakes that cover the same area at the present time, and I think each of those stakes is contributing over a million dollars annually to the tithing of the Church. The Church is not only prospering here, but it is also prospering in faraway places. I will have an opportunity near the end of this month to attend an area conference in Sao Paulo, Brazil, and then the following week in Buenos Aires, Argentina. This is bringing the Church closer to our people in these foreign places, and they are beginning to realize that we are not just a Utah church or a United States church, but we are worldwide in our operation. So, again I say the Church is increasing in numbers, it is progressing, it is prospering, it is growing stronger. We are better known and better received by the peoples of the world than we have ever been.<br><h2><b>Lengthen Your Stride</b></h2><br>When the Church was 120 years old, the membership at that time was approximately 1,100,000. Today it is between 3,400,000 and 3,500,000. In 1950 there were 180 stakes in the Church. Today there are approximately 680. I know many more have been approved for organization but have not been organized yet. At that time we had about 42 missions; we now have 113 missions. There have been six or seven more approved since the first of the year that are unorganized at this time. Then we had about 2,000 missionaries in the field; today we have approximately 18,500. So you see the Church is growing, and it is prospering. I feel you students (I presume that most of you are students of the University) have contributed, not in funds perhaps, but certainly in time pursuing the missionary cause of the Church.<br><br>President McKay during his Presidency said all members of the Church were missionaries. We are trying to get that spirit into the missionary movement of the Church. We are not only pushing--"lengthening our stride," as President Kimball called it--the full-time missionary effort, but we are also putting great reemphasis upon stake missions. We feel that if sufficient stake missionaries are called, they can increase considerably the growing membership, because wards have all the programs, activities, and buildings necessary to invite their investigators and friends to.<br><br>I think you are contributing in another way: by your conduct, your maintenance of the BYU code of honor, meeting the standards of good dressing and grooming. And surely your conduct, both on and off campus, is being observed by many. It is adding greatly to the prestige of the Church and to the school itself. As the school becomes more prestigious, then the Church is benefited and greatly blessed. I think we should all fully support this "lengthening our stride" movement under the leadership of President Kimball. And certainly your help is necessary to carry out his wishes. I am sure the Lord has inspired him in this great missionary program, and to "lengthen our stride" refers to many other activities we have in the Church.<br><br>Another thing that is helping us much is the temples that are being constructed. There are others approved but not yet announced. The counsel Joseph F. Smith gave that we should do things for the convenience of the people is coming to pass with this building program and in the missionary work, bringing many into the Church from foreign lands.<br><br>One of the missions in Mexico, with ninety-five missionaries, this past year baptized over six-thousand converts. Over one thousand of those were baptized in one month. The great problem there is developing priesthood leadership fast enough to take care of this great conversion number. We must develop the priesthood of the Church. We must activate the inactive priesthood bearers. There are many inactive men who would make tremendous leaders, tremendous teachers, if we could just harness them and bring them into the fold of activity.<br><h2><b>Seek First the Kingdom of God</b></h2><br>Theodore Roosevelt once said that every man should join some worthwhile institution and then do all in his power to set forward the aims and the objectives of that institution. That suggestion is very good. We have a great requirement as members of the Church. The Lord put it in this way: "Seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you" (Matthew 6:33). I do keenly feel that the first obligation we as members of the Church have is to build and strengthen the kingdom of God. We don't need to seek it, because we have it, but we do have the responsibility of preparing ourselves to give our first allegiance to the Church.<br><br>I know there are men who are forming organizations for the purpose of bringing peace to a war-torn world--a world of nations that seemingly cannot get along well together--but I don't think any man can introduce a peace program that will settle the differences of mankind. There is only one plan of peace, in my judgment, and that is the gospel plan. So I feel, by owing our first allegiance to the Church, we should do all we can to promote the work of the Church and see that the gospel gets to every nation, kindred, tongue, and people. The Lord has said that when that is accomplished the end will come.<br><br>I know some organizations are good for men who do not have the gospel and the priesthood as we have in the Church. Perhaps it is a good outlet for them and one that they should take advantage of. But in the Church we priesthood bearers should do all that we can to promote the gospel. If we want peace in the earth, then the people of the world must be introduced to the gospel. How else can they be introduced to the gospel unless we take it to them? I am sure that this is what President Kimball has in mind.<br><br>I want you to know, brothers and sisters, that President Kimball is a very choice individual. (I don't say that because he comes from Arizona; he<i>is</i>a tremendous individual.) He is an inspired servant of God. During the time he has been in office, he has brought into focus many areas that need full attention, and his phrase "to lengthen our stride" is very meaningful. It does not apply to only one phase of the Church program but applies in many different areas. He is giving progressive leadership. I don't know how he accomplishes the work he does. He is a very hard worker; he puts in many hours. I doubt that he gets much sleep. Even though he has had open-heart surgery, he has overcome that problem. He is just as alert and active and nimble as a man can possibly be. I know for a surety that if we follow his teachings, if we follow his example, we will never go wrong. He is one man in the Church that can say, as the Savior once said, "Come follow me, and do the things ye have seen me do." I have that confidence in President Kimball. I am sure we can follow him with safety, and we need to support him fully. If the people of the Church are united, it is because they support the President of the Church. I don't think for a moment President Kimball would ask you to do something that he himself wouldn't do. He is that kind of an individual.<br><h2><b>Keep the Commandments</b></h2><br>The work of the kingdom calls for preparation and participation in the Church programs. We should all remember that we are children of God and that we are living here on earth in a probationary state. We are here to prove ourselves, to see whether we are entitled to the mansions that our Heavenly Father has prepared for the faithful of this people. The Lord has given us our free agency; he is not compelling us to keep the commandments. But I am sure that for our best good we should keep the commandments and the laws he has given. It is like the Word of Wisdom: the Lord didn't give it by way of commandment, but he did give it to us by way of revelation. Being our God, the Eternal Father of our spirits, knowing the things that are best for us, he surely wouldn't give us a revelation unless it was for our good. So whether it is a commandment or not, it seems to me that we should be obedient in the observance of that revelation or any revelation which he has given. In enjoying our free agency, we should always choose the right. I know, having free agency, we can also choose the wrong. We can stumble into pitfalls Satan is laying for us. He would be very happy if he could persuade us to follow him instead of following the Christ.<br><br>The Lord has built into each and every one of us a power by which we can overcome any evil or every temptation that may come into our lives. For he has said: "The power is in [you], wherein [you] are agents unto [yourselves]" (D&amp;amp;C 58:28). I am sure if we use that power right we can walk uprightly before the Lord and gain his favor and blessings which we so much need in this very difficult time in which we live. We ought to weigh everything carefully and prayerfully and be sure we choose the right and not the wrong. After all, the good example of our people will strengthen the image of the Church more than all our teachings put together. This is true on this campus. Your example in this Church institution is now known the world over and will add great strength, not only to the University, but also to the Church.<br><h2><b>Study the Scriptures</b></h2><br>We need to comprehend life and its purpose. We need to study the scriptures, maybe more completely and thoroughly than we now are. It is our duty to learn the laws and commandments the Lord has given for the blessing and the salvation and exaltation of his children here upon the earth. We are here to receive a mortal body. A spirit child of God will come and inhabit that body. We should keep it clean because, after we pass on and our body is placed in the grave, sometime in the future it will be resurrected and each spirit will come back and claim its own body. We should make up our minds what kind of a body we want our spirit to inhabit, what kind of a body we want to maintain so that the spirit may dwell and progress and receive the inspiration of the Almighty.<br><br>To get a clear picture and a clear understanding of what is expected of us, we should study the four standard works of the Church. We should also study the writings of the prophets, including those of the Prophet Joseph Smith, down to the present time. We must abide by the teachings, not only of the dead prophets, but also of the living prophets. It seems that some people are more anxious to follow those who have passed on than to recognize the living prophet among us. We don't want to say anything against the prophets who lived before our prophet of today, because they have all been tremendous spiritual leaders. President Kimball is our present leader, and he is the one we should follow.<br><br>I believe that sometimes we are thinking too much about this mortal life in which we live, and we are overlooking that future eternal life. Our mortal existence is very brief when we compare it to the eternal life that lies before us. So we ought to picture ourselves, if we can, in that eternal, celestial sphere, according to the pattern of life that we are now living. I wonder if we would be happy with that picture. Would it be desirable? Would it accomplish for us the things that the Lord has prepared for the faithful of his children? It is something for all of us to think about. Along with it I would like to say to you young people, keep your lives sweet and clean before the Lord.<br><br>Someday you are going to pair off and marry and establish homes of your own. I presume if you came from good homes you would like to pattern your home after the one you came from. When children come to bless your home, will you have a real Latter-day Saint home prepared for them, where the gospel is taught, where the gospel is lived, where there is love and harmony between parents? Wouldn't it be wonderful if each one of you when you do reach parenthood, could use the examples of your own lives in the teaching of your children? That is something to think about. I am sure, if you are not inhibited by transgressions or violation of the moral law in any way, you would not hesitate talking to your children about these intimate matters they are concerned about. Perhaps you may not feel free to express yourself, but you would want to answer their questions and give them the counsel and advice which they so much need. I am sure that most of you will establish homes of this kind, and I would hope that you can use the example of your own lives in the teaching of your children. The task won't be too difficult if you have kept yourselves clean. The Lord wants us to be honest. He wants us to be upright. He wants us to be humble and prayerful. He is the source of our strength when we need help. We should turn to him in prayer for that help.<br><h2><b>Prepare to Meet Temptation</b></h2><br>I wonder, brothers and sisters, if you have made up your minds as to how you want to live. Have you made up your minds how you will react to temptation, should it come into your lives? The day in which we live is full of temptations, and I wonder if you have resolved yourselves to stake on the Lord's side and follow the counsel and instruction that he has given and that has been passed on to you by the prophets and the servants of his church.<br><br>I remember a fast and testimony meeting that I attended in my ward--I occasionally have opportunity to do so. On this particular day a young man arose to bear his testimony. He said, "When I was younger, I often thought how I would react if temptation should come into my life. Would I yield to the temptation, or would I have the strength and the power to resist it? I thought and prayed about it. I made up my mind, if temptation should come into my life, that I would resist that temptation. Ultimately temptation did come into my life, and I thank God to this day that I had prepared myself against that temptation and it wasn't difficult for me to resist."<br><br>I don't think, brothers and sisters, that we can afford to wait until temptation does come into our lives. Before that time we should make up our minds how we are going to react to that temptation. If we haven't made up our minds, when temptation does come, it will be too late in many cases. We have to determine how we are going to live our lives. We must always remember that we are chosen children of God. Wouldn't it be a shame to forsake our God and to follow after Satan's evil temptations? I am sure Satan dresses temptations up in enticements that are very attractive, very alluring, but if we know the mind and will of the Lord on these matters that concern us, we will have the power to resist that temptation.<br><br>There is another thing that bothers me that quite often happens: people are recommended for positions or privileges in the Church who are not worthy for those privileges. Any man who holds the priesthood and is in a leadership position exceeds his authority when he grants an unworthy person a privilege in the Church he is not entitled to, like going to the temple, for example. I am sure there is some deceit. And if a person by deceit gains a recommend with the approval of the bishop and the stake president and enjoys that privilege, I don't think he gets the blessing. The Holy Spirit of promise would<i>never</i>seal an unworthy person's blessings. So remember that all these very choice privileges we have in the Church are based upon our worthiness. We get the blessings if we are worthy; it turns to our condemnation if we are not worthy. I'm sure all of us would like to feel good and worthy when these privileges are granted to us.<br><h2><b>Receive the Blessings of Mortality</b></h2><br>I'd like to read what one girl had to say regarding the moral standards of the Church. She said:<br><br><i>The moral standards of the world differ greatly from those of the Church. . . . Being in an environment where there is a majority of Church members doesn't keep Satan from tempting us. Wherever we are, we are subject to his temptations. He wants us to be immodest and immoral. He wants us to defile our holy temples. I know when you have a deep love for someone it may be hard to control your emotions,... but if you stop to realize how much you will be hurting yourself and the people you love the most, especially Heavenly Father, you may receive the strength to say no....</i><br><br><i>Heavenly Father loves each one of us so much that I imagine he must cry when he sees his sons and daughters throwing away something so precious--their purity and virtue--for a fleeting moment of [weakness and supposed] pleasure.... One of my goals is to have a temple marriage. As I kneel at the altar with my chosen mate, I want him to know that I have kept myself pure and clean for him only, and I want to be able to know that he has done the same for me.</i><br><br><i>In this world, where immodesty and immorality are so abundant, isn't that a most beautiful scene--two people in love, so pure and virtuous before their Heavenly Father, kneeling at the altar of his holy temple?</i><br><br>I remember some years ago getting a letter from a young woman who was awaiting the return of her missionary fiancé in order that they could be married. She outlined in her letter all the things she was doing to prepare herself worthily for that glorious experience. She went to the temple for her endowments before he returned from his mission, and she had the privilege of witnessing some sealings of children to their parents. What a beautiful thing she said it was. She had a great desire that her marriage would be in one of the sacred temples of our God.<br><br>I'd like to read you one other letter. This letter is from a missionary who was excommunicated in the mission field because of immorality. The letter is addressed to President McKay. At that time I was responsible for handling the excommunication and disfellowshipment cases, and the letter was referred to me. I removed his name from it. This is one of the finest letters on repentance, the seeking of forgiveness, and the desire to return to the Church that I have ever read. I would like to share it with you. The young man told about being excommunicated because of immorality, and he said:<br><br><i>The spirit worked upon me while I was in the mission field, and I was sorry for my sins and sickened by them. I read a great deal in the Book of Mormon, seeking somewhat to justify not going to the mission president and confessing. I read about Alma and Corianton and tried to convince myself that since I had repented (I thought) I would not need to confess to anyone but God. I did pray a great deal for many weeks. After everyone else had gone to bed, I would remain up reading and praying. Finally, one night a voice from within me said, "You know what you must do, so do it."</i><br><br><i>A few days after that we had a conference of the missionaries in the area, and I confessed to the mission president. I knew I would be excommunicated, but I had no choice if I was ever to obtain forgiveness.</i><br><br><i>After I had confessed, even knowing I would be excommunicated, I felt an extremely sweet peace in my soul. . . . I thank God to this day that he gave me the courage to do it.</i><br><br><i>My family was extremely kind and understanding, as was the bishop when I went to see him. The bishop told me he thought it would be a good idea for me to get up in priesthood meeting in the ward and ask for their forgiveness, which I did. It was extremely difficult and caused me much sorrow, but I'm thankful I did it. Then, the bishop told me I should go out and greet and shake hands with the people as they came to Sunday School; I'm thankful I did that also, for it made things easier for me and them. They all fully forgave me and accepted me back. Their true Christianity helped me to have strength to go to church all the time, at least to the meetings I could go to.</i><br><br><i>As of late, my desire for baptism has increased, and I desire it and the other blessings attendant to righteousness more than any other thing.</i><br><br><i>I went home a short while back, and the bishop told me he had been to Salt Lake and had gotten a list of things I had to do before I could be baptized. This made me desire forgiveness more than ever....</i><br><br><i>Since this weekend was fast Sunday, I started fasting Friday after supper, and Saturday I went into the mountains and spent about five hours by myself thinking and praying, and I read a little from the Book of Mormon. While praying aloud to my Father, I tasted the most bitter sorrow that I have tasted to date. I had a slight taste of what it really is to suffer godly sorrow for sin. I left my complete dependence on the Father and the Son for salvation, and I pleaded that I would be forgiven for my sins and for being such a great cause of suffering to the Lord, Jesus Christ. I understood ever so vaguely that Christ did take upon himself my sins and he suffered untold sorrow for me. I begged for forgiveness and for release from the deadening, prisonlike effects of sin and to know that I was forgiven.</i><br><br><i>I felt impressed that I should write the letters that I must write and request baptism and that I would receive forgiveness if I continued to be humble, fast, and pray. I think I will have to suffer sorrow like I did yesterday many times again before all the evil effects of sin will be lifted out of me and I will feel that freedom that my spirit craves for.</i><br><br><i>Sometimes I feel it reaching out for the more spiritual that is in life, but because of the body being prisoner to sin and its effect, it cannot reach what it and I desire.</i><br><br><i>President McKay, I ask in all humility, realizing that the responsibilities of membership are great, that I might be accepted back into the Church and back onto the path I departed from. I know God lives, that his Son Jesus Christ really did take upon himself our sins, and that he lives today. I know the Church was restored through the beloved Prophet Joseph Smith and that all the keys remain today and that you are a prophet, seer, and revelator and hold the keys of the kingdom. Please permit me to enter the waters of baptism and receive again the Holy Ghost. President McKay, I know this is only one step, but I desire with all my heart to be baptized again, and I will continue and do all that is necessary to gain that goal if it be God's will. I submit this letter and request to you and ask to be forgiven of my sins. May God bless you and give you health to continue your work and his work....</i><br><br><i>I think also I should tell you that I observe the Word of Wisdom, and I have been sending tithing to my mother. She pays it to the bishop in my father's name. I have felt that the money was the Lord's and I could not steal it.</i><br><br>I have one other thing to say in closing. I would like to quote a statement by President McKay which I think is choice. This was given to members of the Twelve in the upper room of the temple. He spoke of making God the center of our lives, and he said:<br><br><i>When God becomes the center of our lives we lose self, we covenant to forget self. How perfectly our Lord and Savior sets the example. He did not seek to perpetuate his physical life, but he sought to develop the spirit, living for others with God as the center, and thus he saved his life, perpetuated it eternally--the only perfect man who ever walked the earth, the one who broke the bonds of death and brought eternal life. If our young people would not think of themselves in the hour of temptation but just forget self and think of mother and of father, of the good name of the family, and just lose themselves a moment for somebody else, they would have the power to resist temptation. If we could just make God the center of our lives when dealing with his children, we would have sufficient strength to overcome our weaknesses. When God becomes the center of our lives we become conscious of a new goal in life--spiritual attainment.</i><br><br>Moroni said, "If ye have not faith in him [Christ] then ye are not fit to be numbered among the people of his church" (Moroni 7:39). I hope all of us are fit to be numbered among the people of his church. I would like to paraphrase that quote: "If ye have not faith in Christ and his doctrine and teachings, then ye are not fit to be numbered among the people of his church." Brothers and sisters, this Church is true. We owe it our allegiance. We should keep the commandments of our Lord. We should walk uprightly before him. We should do all things that would support the work of his kingdom upon this earth. That, of course, means supporting President Spencer W. Kimball in his high and holy calling. May God be with you. May he bless you with wisdom, with judgment, with right choices, and may you always desire to serve, to bless people, and to remember that the great purpose of the Church and its leadership is to save and bless people. When we lose that understanding, we have lost the spirit of our work. God bless you I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. amen.<br><br><i>Delbert L.

<h1>ay Saint Women in Today&#039;s Changing World - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
It is always a great pleasure and a strengthening experience for me to speak to a group of Brigham Young University students. I enjoyed the chorus this morning, and I also appreciated being referred to as a young woman. I was called the other day by the National Council of Women and asked if I would accept an appointment as a delegate to an international meeting in Paris. I thought, "Before I accept this, I should refer it to one of the members of the First Presidency." So I called President Tanner and said, "I have an invitation to serve as a delegate, and I don't think I should accept it because and because and because--." I had a number of very good reasons, I thought.<br><br>He listened attentively, and then he said to me, "You know, I should think you'd take advantage of your opportunities while you're still young."<br><br>I'm particularly honored this morning to be invited by the chairman of the Women's Week program committee to speak at this devotional assembly. Since this is Women's Week, it seems appropriate that I address myself, in the main, to the role of the Latter-day Saint woman in today's changing world. I'm sensitive to the fact that this group consists of men as well as women. In the governing structure of the Church, men play an important role in relation to the women's activities as they relate to the work of the Church. At early meetings of the Relief Society in Nauvoo, the Prophet Joseph Smith clearly defined this relationship. At the founding meeting, a presidency consisting of three women--a president, a first counselor, and a second counselor--was appointed to preside over the organization. Later in the meeting the Prophet Joseph said, "Let this presidency serve as a Constitution--all their decisions be considered law, and acted upon as such. If any officers are wanted to carry out the design of the institution, let them be appointed and set apart. ... The minutes of your meetings will be precedent for you to act upon--your Constitution and law" ("A Centenary of Relief Society," p. 15). Nonetheless, at the third meeting of the society the Prophet gave this enduring directive: "You will receive instructions through the order of the Priesthood which God has established, through the medium of those appointed to lead, guide, and direct the affairs of the Church in this last dispensation" ("A Centenary of Relief Society," p. 16).<br><br>Because of these mandates it seems imperative that not only the women but also the brethren of the priesthood should be knowledgeable regarding the role of women. The brethren will want to be familiar with the problems confronting women so that through an understanding of these and the duties and the responsibilities of the sisters they will be in a position to counsel and direct them in harmony with the design of the Lord. The advancement of the work of the Church is a joint responsibility of the men and the women of the Church, each working in his assigned sphere. The deeper understanding each has of the role of the other, the greater the total success of the work of the Church is bound to be. Understanding is built primarily upon knowledge. Therefore, it does not seem inappropriate for me to speak about woman's role in today's changing world to this group, consisting as it does of men and women.<br><h2><b>National Gains of Women</b></h2><br>With the advent of this new year, 1975, our nation found itself and still finds itself struggling with many unusual and difficult circumstances. It was of interest to me to listen to a radio broadcast during which outstanding news broadcasters discussed what they considered to be the most significant news events of 1974 affecting the nation. Their conclusions, as I recall, were as follows: "inflation and the recession, the energy crisis, the resignation of the president of the United States, the Watergate trials, the pardon of the president, the growing wealth and power of the oil-producing nations, and the world food shortages."<br><br>In my opinion the broadcasters bypassed one happening more significant, perhaps, in its long-range impact on home, community, and national life than any of those mentioned. I refer to the advancement made by women in their efforts toward emancipation from what they regarded as existing restraints that encumbered their full development and usefulness. Women have been active in working toward specific goals in relation to this for years, but 1974 was different. It was a year of intensified effort in a vast scope of diversifies areas, and gains were pronounced. As an example of one gain, I cite those made in the field of political life. A record number of experienced, qualified, dedicated women ran for public office, and many won. The National Women's Political Caucus issued the following figures: 18 women representatives were elected to Congress, an unprecedented number; 599 women were elected to state legislature; one woman was elected governor of one of our sovereign states; another woman was elected a lieutenant governor. "All across the country," declares the Women's Caucus, "it was a banner year for women."<br><br>In some areas, however, gains were made which, in the opinion of some persons, raise questions as to the effect upon national life. While we rejoice in the correction of injustices, we must not lose sight of the need for sober evaluation of action that brings about change in the status of women--change which breaks with the traditional, time-tested patterns of life that have proved good and have contributed to the happiness and the well-being of families and of nations. We must not lose sight of the basic natures of women and their divinely ordained roles in life. James Kilpatrick, a prominent columnist, has pointed out that "we look to the Judeo-Christian ethic." He declares that we live by a body of rules or laws drawn from generations past; that they cannot be treated as if they do not exist. People care about these things because they have found them to be good and satisfying ("The Case Against the ERA,"<i>Nation's Business</i>, January 1975, pp. 9–10).<br><h2><b>Current Trends in Relation to Traditional Values</b></h2><br>There are some present viewpoints and trends that give concern because they seem to run counter to traditional values. The Latter-day Saint woman finds herself in an ideal position to evaluate changes in the status of women and to intelligently and properly appraise trends and viewpoints because she has at her command unfailing measuring rods. These infallible calculators, if you will, are the divinely inspired guidelines in the revealed truths as set forth by the scriptures and in the words of our modern prophets. Yet some of us fail to use these unerring measuring rods because we are not sufficiently familiar with them. We do not know them. We may have failed to take advantage of the opportunities to learn them, to understand their full meaning, and to apply them in our individual and collective lives. Or we may be like Saul, the son of Kish, who loved the Lord and would do his will, but he lacked the courage to go against popular opinion.<br><br>In the Bible we are told, "Now there was a man of Benjamin, whose name was Kish. ... And he had a son, whose name was Saul, a choice young man, and a goodly: and there was not among the children of Israel a goodlier person than he: from his shoulders and upward he was higher than any of the people. And the asses of Kish, Saul's father, were lost" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/1-sam/9.1-3?lang=eng#1">Samuel 9:1–3</a>). Saul was sent to find the animals, but he could not. He and his servant then went to inquire of God through God's servant Samuel, who was a prophet. (At that time he was called a seer, according to the scriptural account.) Samuel had been forewarned of Saul's coming and the Lord had revealed to Samuel that it was his will that Saul should reign over his people as their captain. Samuel showed unto Saul the works of God. Then he took a vial of oil and anointed Saul to be captain over his inheritance. He then counseled him as to the will of the Lord and how to proceed (see <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/1-sam/10?lang=eng">1 Samuel 10</a>).<br><br>The people, however, were not happy with this. They wanted a king, and Saul yielded to the will of the people. Then Samuel, learning of Saul's decision, went unto Saul, a Benjamite, and said:<br><br><i>Thou hast done foolishly: thou hast not kept the commandments of the Lord thy God, which he commanded thee: for now would the Lord have established thy kingdom upon Israel for ever.</i><br><br><i>But now thy kingdom shall not continue: the Lord hast sought him a man after his own heart, and the Lord hath commanded him to be captain over this people.</i>[<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/1-sam/13.13-14?lang=eng#p12">1 Samuel 13:13–14</a>]<br><br><i>And Saul said unto Samuel, I have sinned: for I have transgressed the commandment of the Lord, and thy words: because I feared the people, and obeyed their voice.</i>[<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/1-sam/15.24?lang=eng#p23">1 Samuel 15:24</a>]<br><br>Too many of us today fear the voice of the people. Counseling on the desirability of representative government, King Mosiah made this significant statement: "It is common for the lesser part of the people to desire that which is not right" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/29.26?lang=eng#p25">Mosiah 29:26</a>). Now, having this warning from a great Book of Mormon prophet, Latter-day Saints would do well to be particularly careful to weigh the voices of the people in the light of the teachings of our modern-day prophets. Even though the voices may be few, they are usually loud and convincing.<br><br>Possessing revealed truth and the words of the prophets as they relate to the responsibility of the Latter-day Saint woman and her role in life, we have an unwavering duty to uphold these teachings in our speech and actions, and to direct our lives in harmony with them. But I ask, "Do we have any further responsibility? Do we have a responsibility to share these teachings with those who may not have the light of truth?" In Matthew, our duty is made clear on this point. We read, "Ye are the light of the world. A city that is set on an hill cannot be hid. Neither do men light a candle and put it under a bushel, but on a candlestick; and it giveth light unto all that are in the house. Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify you father which is in heaven" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/matt/5.14-16?lang=eng#p13">Matthew 5:14–16</a>).<br><h2><b>Relief Society Prophecy Fulfilled</b></h2><br>I am reminded of an address given to Relief Society women by President George Albert Smith in the October 1945 general conference. This was the first conference he addressed as President of the Church and the first conference I conducted as president of Relief Society. For several years we had been denied conferences due to the restrictions of war. The women gathered to that Relief Society conference with eager and receptive spirits to hear the message of their new Prophet-President. The Spirit of the Lord rested mightily upon President Smith, and the spirit of prophecy prevailed as he spoke of the future of the women of the Church. He made very clear the responsibilities we had to all womankind. An excerpt from his address is worthy of reading at this time. Said President Smith:<br><br><i>I feel that I am standing on sacred ground, for in this pulpit have appeared some of the great men and women of the world, those who were anxious to do what the Lord would have them do. Here they bore testimony of the divine mission of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.</i><br><br><i>You are more blessed than any other women in all the world. You were the first women to have the franchise; the first women to have a voice in the work of a church. It was God who gave it to you, and it came as a result of revelation to a Prophet of the Lord. Since that time think what benefits the women of this world have enjoyed. Not only you who belong to the Church have enjoyed the blessings of equality, but when the Prophet Joseph Smith turned the key for the emancipation of womankind, it was turned for all the women of the world, and from generation to generation the number of women who can enjoy the blessings of religious liberty and civil liberty has been increasing.</i><br><br><i>Do you realize that you have opened this Tabernacle to the first general conference we have had in years? ... Now the sky is the limit, and I am not so sure that by the time we have two or three more general conferences here we may have visitors from Australia, New Zealand, Africa, China, Japan, and elsewhere. They may leave their homes in airplanes and in about twenty-four hours be right here. It is marvelous what the Lord has given to us in this age.</i>["Address to the Members of Relief Society," 4October 1945,<i>Relief Society Magazine</i>32 (1945): 716, 717, 719]<br><br>I was deeply moved by the remarks of that great President, and following the session I thanked him and poured forth the feelings of my heart. I inquired, "Would any of this take place during my administration?" Then I asked, "When and how will our message be carried to the women of the world?" While his reply is not recorded in the conference proceedings, it is recorded in my little notebook where I've kept notes of the various general conferences, and it is also recorded in my mind and in my heart.<br><br>The prophet replied, "It could easily happen during your administration. The message of Mormon women will reach the women of the world when there is a special need for it. You don't need to worry about how," said he. "The Lord will see to that."<br><br>By way of showing prophecy fulfilled, a few years after President Smith's address my counselors and I noted a rather large number of women in attendance at our conference from overseas and foreign-language countries. We decided to hold a special meeting for them following the regular session of our two-day conference. We asked for a verbal roll call that morning. Each sister was to give her name, the country from which she came, and her method of transportation. Most of them had come by plane. Every country mentioned by President Smith in his 1945 address was represented except China. I noted that there was a woman there from Taiwan. I commented on this, adding that we did have a sister from Taiwan even though we did not have one from China. The sister from Taiwan then quietly arose and in perfect English said, "China is my homeland." Prophecy was fulfilled.<br><h2><b>Importance of Relief Society Today</b></h2><br>Today the message of Mormon women is being carried to the world in a number of ways--through the great missionary program of the Church, through Relief Society's affiliation with the National and International Councils of Women, through radio, television, the press, and other means of communication. I assure you that the message of Mormon women is needed by women of the world today. Countless women are troubled as to the course they should pursue. Many are confused by new philosophies and new points of view. Relief Society holds a position of respect and influence among organized women of the world. While they may not always agree with our position on issues which to us are important, we are usually given ample opportunity to express ourselves, and our influence is felt. Often our position prevails.<br><br>The names of over 900,000 women are now on the Relief Society roles. These include young women, many of them college women. Also, there are middle-aged women and those who are experienced and who have grown old in dedication to the work. It is our duty as Mormon women, regardless of our age or circumstances, to stand united and firm in support of Church teachings. It was not a coincidence or a whim when Relief Societies were established on this campus and on other college campuses. Nor was it a coincidence when President Harold B. Lee brought the young adult women and the special interest women under the auspices of Relief Society. It was the will of the Lord. It was in fulfillment of prophecy by an earlier Prophet-President, Joseph F. Smith. These are his prophetic words recorded in his book<i>Gospel Doctrine:</i><br><br><i>I will speak of the Relief Society as one great organization in the Church, organized by the Prophet Joseph Smith, whose duty it is to look after the interests of all women of Zion and of all the women who may come under their supervision and care, irrespective of religion, color, or condition. I expect to see the day when this organization will be one of the most perfect, most efficient and effective organizations for good in the Church but that day will be when we shall have women who are not only imbued with the spirit of the gospel of Jesus Christ, and with the testimony of Christ in their hearts, but also with youth, vigor and intelligence to enable them to discharge the great duties and responsibilities that rest upon them. . . . We want the young women, the intelligent women, women of faith, of courage and of purity to be associated with the Relief Societies in the various stakes and wards of Zion. We want them to take hold of this work with vigor, with intelligence and unitedly, for the building up of Zion and the instruction of women in their duties--domestic duties, public duties, and every duty that may devolve upon them.</i>[<i>Gospel Doctrine</i>, 3rd ed. (Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1919), p. 484]<br><br>Choice young Latter-day Saint women are augmenting the strength of Relief Society today because they are needed. The times demand their training, their leadership skills, their testimonies--coupled with the strength of the sisters long experienced in the work. Latter-day Saint women are concerned for the solidarity of the home and the eternal well-being of the family. They know good homes are the cornerstone of a good society and happy citizenry. Any change that adversely affects the home and the family is to be deplored. The Latter-day Saint doctrine of the eternity of the family unit was frequently referred to by the late Elder Stephen L Richards as "the most sublime of all theological doctrines."<br><br>The gospel teaches women how to behave toward their husbands, and it teaches men to esteem womanhood and to honor and respect their wives. The Church places no restrictions on a woman's going into the marketplace and into community service on a paid or a volunteer basis, if she so desires, when her home and family circumstances allow her to do so without impairment to them. Women are encouraged to develop their full potential as women, and the Church affords abundant opportunity for them to do so. Well-directed compassionate service, which is according to the nature of women, is but the law of brotherhood in action. It is Latter-day Saint doctrine. These are a few of the measuring rods whereby you young women here today may evaluate change and determine your actions in life. The 900,000 women constituting the Relief Society membership can be a power for helping women the world over properly to evaluate change. Guided by Church teachings, they can help themselves to move forward along proper lines in the development of their talents and skills and in their service to mankind. The Church can enable women of the world to determine what should receive priorities in their lives. Latter-day Saint women have at their command the firm and infallible guidelines that lead toward the full development and total usefulness of womankind. The power for good inherent in our 900,000 women guided by the inspiration of priesthood leadership is incalculable. For Latter-day Saint women, the teachings of the Church are eternal security. May we never lose sight of them I sincerely pray in the name of Jesus Christ. amen.<br><br><i>Belle S.

<h1>e Interested in the Long Hereafter Than in the Brief Present - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Brothers and sisters, I really feel honored this morning at having been invited to occupy this place, but I feel very humble. I greet all of you students, officers, teachers, wonderful missionaries, and visitors in our midst. We are proud of you and of this great institution, which is one of the important arms of this great Church--The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.<br><br>Now, when you were deciding that you wanted to come here to school (and I suppose I am to talk to the students this morning), you, no doubt, studied the catalog issued by the school and found that there are hundreds of subjects in there, so you had to decide which subjects you wanted. After you decided, then you had to work at it, because it wouldn't do you any good if it just stayed in the catalog.<br><h2><b>The Value of Education</b></h2><br>There is a story told about a young man who enrolled at Oberlin College. When the president showed him what he would have to study, he said, "Isn't there a shorter course?"<br><br>The president said, "Oh, yes. It just depends on what you want to make of yourself. When the Lord starts out to make an oak tree he takes a hundred years for it, but if he wants to make a squash, he does it in six months." Now, I don't suppose any of you want to be squashes.<br><br>There was an educator down in Atlanta, Georgia, while I was president of the mission down there. He has talked in the Tabernacle in Salt Lake at educational meetings, and I heard him relate this little story. He said that when he was a boy his father told him it was time for him to decide what he wanted to be in life and what he wanted to make of himself. So he studied the situation and he thought it would be wonderful to be a minister because he thought of the minister in his community and how the people loved him and how much good he did. So he thought he'd like to be a minister. Then he thought of being a doctor, how doctors relieve pain and distress and perform operations and increase the life span of people. And he thought it would be wonderful to be a doctor. Then he thought of being an architect and how wonderful it would be to plan buildings and to know that as they rise to the sky they were the result and product of his own brain. So he thought it would be wonderful to be an architect. Then he thought of being a writer and how writers sway the thoughts of men and of their great influence in the world. So he thought it would be wonderful to be a writer. Then he thought of the beautiful ears of corn that his daddy raised on the farm, and how wonderful it would be to be able to make the earth produce like that. So he thought it would be wonderful to be a farmer. And then, being a prayerful man, he got down on his knees and something seemed to say to him, "Why not be a teacher? Your students will preach your sermons for you; your students will perform your operations for you; your students will build your buildings for you; your students will write your books for you; and your students will raise your corn." So he decided that he would be a teacher.<br><br>Some years ago, my wife gave me a copy of one of Wiggins's books, called<i>The Marks of an Educated Man.</i>She knew that I needed it, and she gave it to me for a birthday present. So I read it. There was a little story in there that intrigued me. It told about a college professor from an agricultural college who went into a farming community to try to induce the boys from the farm to attend the college. In that particular locality, there was a farmer, John, who knew all about farming, and he boo-hooed the idea. He said, "Imagine--going to college to learn how to farm. If you want to learn how to farm, get out on the farm." But his son had the idea that he would like to go to college and sold his mother on the idea, so you know what happened. Well, when the boy came back from college, the father said, "Now you take half of the farm, and I'll take the other half, and we'll see who knows how to farm--the man from the farm or the man from the college."<br><br>One morning Father came in and said, "Ma, what are those boxes up in Son's window?"<br><br>"Oh," she said, "he's just testing his seed."<br><br>"Hmmm, a man who doesn't know seed when he sees it has no business on a farm." When the crop was gathered in, the father had sixty bushels to the acre, and the boy had ninety bushels to the acre. (I didn't think there was any place they raised that much, but I found it up in Idaho.) The next morning after the count was taken, Father came down the steps all dressed in his best bib and tucker, carrying his little traveling bag. Ma said, "Where are you going, Pa?"<br><br>He said, "I'm going to college."<br><h2><b>The Advantage of Attending BYU</b></h2><br>Now, you decided that a college education could enrich your lives, could help you to appreciate the finer things in life--literature, art, music, and the lives of great men and women--so it is worth something to spend your time in college. But there are some fringe benefits, too, that I don't know whether all of you young folks here at Brigham Young University appreciate; that is, so many of the students from all over this world have found their life's companions here at school. In fact, I understand that President Wilkinson found his wife here, President Oaks found his wife here, and I don't know how many more of the faculty have found their companions here. I travel all over the world, and I stay in the homes of stake presidents. You would be surprised how many of them have met their companions here at this institution. It is worth a lot to this Church to know that our young people meet where they have common interests, thoughts, and beliefs so that they can build happy homes.<br><br>I was up in Bountiful last Saturday and Sunday to my conference. In the Sunday morning session they had asked a former stake president (who presided over a stake outside of Utah) to offer the opening prayer. I visited with him and said, "Do you remember when I attended a meeting that you were at when Brigham Young University was trying to promote itself in the various sections of the Church and you told the people in that meeting that you had sent eight children to Brigham Young University and all eight of them had found their companions there?"<br><br>"I remember that," he said. "It's nine now, instead of eight; we had one more to come." Well, those are the fringe benefits you get from attending this college.<br><h2><b>The Catalog of Scriptures</b></h2><br>Now, I have another little thought to go with that. You study the catalog and decide what you want to make of yourselves. There's another catalog, issued by our Father in heaven, called the holy scriptures. It is important that we study that catalog to know what we want to make of ourselves for the long journey. I like this little statement by Cicero: "I am more interested in the long hereafter than in the brief present." I like that thinking: "I am more interested in the long hereafter than in the brief present." I think each one of you should be more interested in the long hereafter, and that's one reason why you are here at this church institution.<br><br>Jesus said, "Search the scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life: and they are they which testify of me" (John 6:39). And without our knowledge of him as the creator of the heavens and the earth and of his great atoning sacrifice, we would not be able to accomplish the measure of our creation here upon this earth. Then he said, "And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent" (John 17:3). That's what we find listed in the Lord's catalog, the holy scriptures. Jesus said, "For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?" (Mark 8:36–37). It is something to think of giving the whole world, isn't it? Jesus called the gospel "the pearl of great price." He said, "A merchantman, seeking goodly pearls: who when he had found one pearl of great price, went and sold all that he had, and bought it" (Matthew 13:45–46). That is what a testimony, a witness, and an understanding of what the Lord's catalog, his holy scriptures, would do for us. They would become the most important things in our lives.<br><br>Jesus said, "Seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness and all these things shall be added unto you" (Matthew 6:33). I believe that with all my heart, and I believe that lives and homes that are built upon that principle will never fail.<br><br>Jesus said:<br><br><i>Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal:</i><br><br><i>But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor steal:</i><br><br><i>For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.</i>[Matthew 6:19–21]<br><br>And so these are some of the things that we read in the Lord's catalog to live by.<br><br>A writer by the name of Munger said, "Measure not life by the hopes and enjoyments of this world, but by the preparation it makes for another--looking forward to what you shall be, rather than backward to what you have been."<br><br>We're told in the Lord's catalog of scriptures that when this earth was created, the Lord pointed out the new matter and said:<br><br><i>We will go down . . . and we will make an earth whereon these may dwell;</i><br><br><i>And we will prove them herewith, to see if they will do all things whatsoever the Lord their God shall command them;</i><br><br><i>And they who keep their first estate shall be added upon, . . . and they who keep their second estate shall have glory added upon their heads for ever and ever.</i>[Abraham 3:24–26]<br><br>Now, that's just a little longer than three or four years at college, isn't it?<br><br>The Savior said, "I, the Lord, am bound when ye do what I say; but when ye do not what I say, ye have no promise" (D&amp;amp;C 82:10). That's why we need to know what's recorded in his catalog, or in his holy scriptures.<br><br>Following the day of Pentecost, Peter preached to those who had put Christ to death. He had such power as he proclaimed the life of the Master and his great atoning sacrifice that we are told they were pricked in their hearts and cried out, "Men and brethren, what shall we do?" Then Peter said unto them:<br><br><i>Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.</i><br><br><i>For the promise is unto you, and to your children, and to all that are afar off, even as many as the Lord our God shall call.</i>[Acts 2:38–39]<br><br>That promise has never been rescinded. It's there in his catalog. All we have to do is abide it, and then we're entitled to the gift of the Spirit. As he said, "The promise is unto all." Jesus also said, "It is expedient for you that I go away: for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you; but if I depart, I will send him unto you" (John 16:7). "He shall take from the Father and from me and reveal it unto you. All things," he said, "we could know by the power of the Holy Ghost, and we can know the truth of all things by that power of the Holy Ghost" (see Moroni 10:5).<br><h2><b>Sow to the Spirit</b></h2><br>Paul said, "Be not deceived; God is not mocked; for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap. For he that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption; but he that soweth to the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting" (Galatians 6:7–8). In my position in the Church, I've found some who sowed to the flesh. They come in with their troubles and, I tell you, then I wished I had the power to touch the hearts of every boy and girl in the world to enable them to have enough courage to sow only to the Spirit.<br><br>Some years ago I was asked to talk in the state penitentiary. We had a pretty good crowd there; there was nowhere else for them to go. And because of that meeting there was quite a group that came up to visit with me. One was a grandson of one of the Presidents of the Church, one was the grandson of one of the Presiding bishops (not related to me), one had been a ward clerk, one had been a district president in the mission field, and they were there because they had sowed to the flesh. I tell you, my heart went out to them under those conditions. When I was there, I was invited to return again to talk to the Alcoholics Anonymous group. (I made sure I got a round-trip ticket so I could get out once I got in there.) When I came I said, "I'd like to hear from you men. How do you feel? What can you tell me?"<br><br>And the man in charge of that group stood up and he said, "I thank God for the privilege of being in this institution." Can you imagine? That's what you get when you sow to the flesh. He thanked God for the privilege of being in that state penitentiary. He said, "Before I came here, I was no good to my family, I was no good to my country, I was no good to my church. I was just no good, period. Now, I have hopes that when I get out of here I'll be worth something to somebody." That's what it means to sow to the Spirit.<br><h2><b>Missionary Work</b></h2><br>One of the great promises of the Lord is in connection with missionary work. (We have some young men here preparing to go into the mission field.) Personally, I wouldn't want to raise a boy and then not have him go on a mission. I feel this way for his good and because we owe it to the world to share the wonderful truths of the gospel. Nephi of old saw our day. He saw the coming forth of the Book of Mormon. He saw the establishment of the Lord's latter-day kingdom. He saw the Saints of God gathered upon the face of the whole earth and the power of God resting upon them in great glory. Then he said:<br><br><i>Blessed are they who shall seek to bring forth my Zion at that day, for they shall have the gift and the power of the Holy Ghost; and if they endure unto the end they shall be lifted up at the last day, and shall be saved in the everlasting kingdom of the Lamb.</i>[1 Nephi 13:37]<br><br>"How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that bringeth good tidings" (Mosiah 15:18). What a promise! How could this work fill the whole earth except for the great missionary program of the Church?<br><br>I was interested in a little story that Brother Benson told us the other day. He was back East attending a convention, and he attended a banquet where he sat next to a minister. The minister turned to him and said, "Mr. Benson, I'd like to talk to you after the banquet." They went to the other end of the banquet hall, and the minister said, "There are two things in your church we would like to copy."<br><br>Brother Benson said, "What are they?"<br><br>He said, "The first is your missionary program. You send your missionaries all over the world, they pay their way to their field of labor, they maintain themselves while they're there, and then, out of the church funds, you pay their fare home if they've been good missionaries. Now, we have a missionary fund in our church, and we offer to pay their way to their mission field, maintain them while they're there and pay their way back, but we can't get anybody to go."<br><br>I talk to the missionaries in the mission home every Tuesday afternoon. We always have between two and three hundred there. As I see those fine-looking men, I say to myself, "Talk about the miracles of ancient days! This is a miracle every day." I see them coming from all over the Church. Nobody but God the Eternal Father can put into their hearts the willingness to serve as they have, and we have over eighteen thousand missionaries in the mission field today. Now President Kimball is asking us to lengthen our stride. He thinks we ought to have double that many, and I think we will in just a very short time because of this call that comes to us from the Lord. You know we sing, "We thank thee, O God, for a prophet to guide us in these latter days." President Grant used to say about that, "Some of the Saints would like to put a P.S. on it: provided the prophet doesn't ask us to do something we don't want to do."<br><br>In the early days of the Church, when the brethren joined the Church they would inquire of the Lord what thing they could do that would be most pleasing unto him. The answer would come back that they were to thrust in their sickles and reap because the harvest was white, all ready to be garnered (see D&amp;amp;C 4:4). Then he adds:<br><br><i>If it be so that you should labor all your days . . . and bring save it be one soul unto me, how great shall be your joy with him in the kingdom of my Father!</i><br><br><i>And now, if your joy will be great with one soul that you have brought unto me . . . how great will be your joy if you should bring many souls unto me!</i>[D&amp;amp;C 18:15–16]<br><br>Now, I went on my first mission (I have been on four missions) seventy years ago this coming April, and I count the families that I've been instrumental in bringing into this Church. I wouldn't sell them out of the Church for all the money in this world. Talk about the fact that their joy shall be great in the kingdom of my father: by the dozens and the hundreds today, these converts and their children almost worship me because of what I brought to them.<br><br>I remember one little story that President Grant used to tell that I'd like to tell you in closing. He told about a Scandinavian couple who came over in the early days of the Church. They hadn't been taught much about the gospel, so all they knew was that it was true. The bishop went to this family and taught them the law of tithing. The man paid his tithing. Then the bishop went and taught them about fast offerings. He paid his fast offerings. Then the bishop went to him later to get a donation to help build the meetinghouse. He thought that ought to come out of the tithing, but before the bishop got through with him he paid his donations for the meetinghouse. Then the bishop went to him to get his son to go on a mission, and he said, "That is the straw that breaks the camel's back. We can't spare him. He's our only child."<br><br>Then the bishop countered, "Brother, who do you love in this world more than anyone else, outside of your immediate family?"<br><br>And he thought a few minutes. Then he said, "I guess I love that young Mormon missionary who came up to the land of the Midnight Sun and taught me the gospel of Jesus Christ."<br><br>Then the bishop countered, "Brother, how would you like somebody to love your boy just like you love that boy?"<br><br>He said, "Bishop, you win again. Take him."<br><br>Now, God bless you all. Make the best of your lives. Remember--no matter what you get out of this school, and I thank the Lord for the religious training you're getting here--you want to make sure that you prepare for that long journey. To do that, you're going to learn what's in the Lord's catalog, his holy scriptures. With all my heart I pray God to bless you all, and I leave you my blessing in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. amen.<br><br><i>LeGrand Richards was a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when this devotional address was given at Brigham Young University on 25 February 1975.</i><br><br><i>© Intellectual Reserve, Inc.

<h1>l Self Reliance - Boyd K. Packer - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Thank you for that beautiful music. Someone said, "This is the luxury of beautiful music. We love it for what it makes us forget, but most of all we love it for what it makes us remember." That beautiful rendition has reminded me of Him whose servants we are and whose children we are, and it has given me some sustaining influence on this Sabbath evening.<br><br>I think I should alert you to the fact that the talk I have prepared is not really very interesting. That, I must claim, is not because I have not spent time in preparing it, for I have--a good deal more than usual. I want very much to be informative, and if you find that the talk is not interesting, and you may, be patient with the thought that in this case I would rather teach a few of you than entertain all of you.<br><br>For a long time I have had a subject on my mind that I have wanted to discuss with the young adults of the Church. I have set it aside time after time because it is very difficult to explain. Although the subject is very commonplace, I have never heard anyone else talk about it.<br><br>Before I'm through, perhaps some of you may be like the student who attended a lecture and then wrote:<br><br><i>I don't like the teacher. The subject's too deep.</i><br><br><i>I'd cut this class, but I need the sleep.</i><br><br>Now, if you find yourself in that situation, and you may, be my guest. But no snoring please. We'll try to awaken you somewhere near the end.<br><h2><b>Material Self-Reliance and Church Welfare</b></h2><br>There's a principle of education known as transfer, and I should like to make use of it by talking about a familiar program of the Church and then transferring the fundamental principle of it to anther part of our lives. First, let me review for you some of the basic principles of the Church welfare program. Church welfare, however, is not the subject of my sermon. I'm only going to use it to illustrate a point.<br><br>The Church was two years old when the Lord revealed that "the idler shall not have place in the church, except he repent and mend his ways" (D&amp;amp;C 75:29). President Marion G. Romney in our last conference explained this principle with his characteristic simple directness: "The obligation to sustain one's self was divinely imposed upon the human race at its beginning. 'In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground.' (Genesis 3:19)."<br><br>The welfare handbook instructs, "[We must] earnestly teach and urge members to be self-sustaining to the fullest extent of their power. No Latter-day Saint will . . . voluntarily shift from himself the burden of his own support. So long as he can, under the inspiration of the Almighty and with his own labors, he will supply himself with the necessities of life" (1952, p. 2).<br><br>We have succeeded fairly well in establishing in the minds of Latter-day Saints that they should take care of their own material needs and then contribute to the welfare of those that cannot provide the necessities of life. If a member is unable to sustain himself, then he is to call upon his own family, and then upon the Church, in that order, and not upon the government at all.<br><br>We have counseled bishops and stake presidents to be very careful to avoid abuses in the welfare program. When people are<i>able</i>but are<i>unwilling</i>to take care of themselves, we are responsible to employ the dictum of the Lord, that the idler shall not eat the bread of the laborer. The simple rule has been, to the fullest extent possible, to take care of one's self. This couplet of truth has been something of a model: "Eat it up, wear it out, make it do, or do without."<br><br>It's not an unkind or an unfeeling bishop who requires a member of the Church to work to the fullest extent he can for what he receives from Church welfare. It is not a quick handout system merely for the asking. It requires a careful inventory of all personal resources, all of which must be committed before anything is added from the outside. There should not be the slightest embarrassment on the part of any member of the Church to be assisted by the Church welfare program--provided, that is, that he has contributed all that he can contribute. Every personal resource of his own must be called upon first.<br><br>Some of you are struggling to get through school and you're suffering from some financial pressure, perhaps even some deprivation for a season while you're preparing so that you can be self-sustaining all the rest of your lives. If you're in need, it is quite in order for you to turn<i>first</i>to your family, and then to the Church.<br><br>Because of the probability that some may join the Church for the material security they think they will find here, missionaries are counseled not to emphasize the Church welfare program in their proselyting. I met an investigator once in New Hampshire who was joining the Church for just that reason. He told me how impressed he was with the welfare program and how much he wanted that security. I told him, "Yes, by all means, if you know about the welfare program, join the Church for that reason. We need all of the help we can get, and you shall be called upon continually to contribute to the welfare of others." His enthusiasm for baptism faded immediately.<br><br>When the Church welfare program was first announced in 1936, the First Presidency made this statement:<br><br><i>Our primary purpose was to set up, insofar as possible, a system under which the curse of idleness would be done away with, the evils of the dole abolished, and independence, industry, thrift, and self-respect be once more established amongst our people</i>. The aim of the Church is to help people to help themselves.<i>Work is to be reenthroned as a ruling principle in the lives of our Church membership.</i>[<i>Conference Report,</i>October 1936, p. 3; emphasis added]<br><br>President Romney has emphasized, "to care for people on any other basis is to do them more harm than good. The purpose of Church welfare is not to relieve a Church member from taking care of himself" (Welfare Services Meeting, 5 October 1974).<br><br>I accept the principles of the welfare program. I endorse them. In too many places, in too many ways, we're getting away from them. The principle of self-reliance is fundamental to ahappy life.<br><h2><b>Spiritual Self-Reliance and Counseling</b></h2><br>Now to the point. The substance of what I want to say here tonight to you students of Brigham Young University is this: That same principle, self-reliance, has application in emotional and spiritual things.<br><br>I have become very anxious over the amount of counseling that we seem to need in the Church, and the network of counseling services that we keep building up without once emphasizing the principle of self-reliance as it is understood in the welfare program. There are too many in the Church who seem to be totally dependent, emotionally and spiritually, upon others. They subsist on some kind of emotional welfare. They are unwilling to sustain themselves. They become so dependent that they endlessly need to be shored up, lifted up, endlessly need encouragement, and they contribute little of their own.<br><br>I have been concerned that we may be on the verge of doing to ourselves emotionally (and therefore spiritually) what we have been working so hard for generations to avoid materially. If we lose our emotional and spiritual self-reliance, we can be weakened quite as much, perhaps even more, than when we become dependent materially. On the one hand, we counsel bishops to avoid abuses in the Church welfare program. On the other hand, we seem to dole out counsel and advice without the slightest thought that the member should solve the problem himself or turn to his family. Only when those resources are inadequate should we turn to the Church.<br><br>We recognize at once that it would be folly to develop welfare production projects to totally sustain all of the members of the Church in every material need. We ought likewise to be very thoughtful before we develop a vast network of counseling programs with all of the bishops and branch presidents and everyone else, doling out counsel in an effort to totally sustain our members in every emotional need.<br><br>If we are not careful, we can lose power of individual revelation. The Lord said to Oliver Cowdery, and it has meaning for all of us:<br><br><i>Behold, you have not understood; you have supposed that I would give it unto you, when you took no thought save it was to ask me.</i><br><br><i>But, behold, I say unto you, that you must study it out in your mind; then you must ask me if it be right, and if it is right I will cause that your bosom shall burn within you; therefore, you shall feel that it is right.</i><br><br><i>But if it be not right you shall have no such feelings, but you shall have a stupor of thought that shall cause you to forget the thing that is wrong.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 9:7–9]<br><br>Do you realize that here at Brigham Young University we have 10 stakes and 120 branches. We have 30 members of stake presidencies, 360 branch presidents and counselors, approximately 150 high councilors, all to counsel. That should be more than enough. That is, provided that principles of self-reliance, self-respect, industry, and thrift were applied to that part of our lives. In addition, here at the University we have in the college advisement centers and in the personal development center and in the psychology clinic and specializing in marriage and family counsel, the equivalent of fifty full-time personnel. Then, in addition, there are over eleven hundred faculty members all of whom are advisers and counselors in some measure.<br><br>Now I fear that all of them, both in the stakes and in the University, may be doling out counsel and advice without first requiring you to call on every personal resource and every family resource before seeking a solution of your problems from the Church.<br><br>You may say, "Well, my parents are not here." I simply respond that your University admission presupposes that you can write. Should it be an emergency, there is the telephone.<br><br>Some may say that "my parents are not members of the Church." I say, "Well, that may be, but they are your parents. We expect you to turn to them in times of financial reverses. The same principle has great merit in times of emotional and spiritual stress."<br><br>I had one student come to my office. I knew him personally. He had a very difficult problem He was trying to decide should he or should he not marry. I asked him, "You've come for counsel?"<br><br>"Yes, indeed," he said.<br><br>"Are you going to follow it when I give it to you?" I asked. That was a surprise to him.<br><br>Finally he consented--"Yes."<br><br>I happened to know his father--a patriarch in the Church, as wonderful a man as there is. I said, "This is my counsel. Go home this weekend. Talk to your father, get him in a bedroom or some private place, tell him your dilemma, ask him for his counsel, and do what he tells you to do. That is my counsel."<br><br>I think an emotional dole system can be as dangerous as a material dole system, and we can become so dependent that we stand around waiting for the Church to do everything for us.<br><h2><b>The Church Military Relations Program</b></h2><br>A few years ago I received a telephone call from a bishop whose son had been inducted into the military service and was at an army basic-training center. The father said, "he's been there for three weeks, and he hasn't been to church yet." Then he described his son as being an active Latter-day Saint, faithful in his duties. He had received his Duty to God award and was typical of the fine young men of the Church. "He's never missed a church meeting before," his father said. "Isn't there something you can do to help?" The boy had telephoned and said that no one had come yet to invite him to go to church.<br><br>I made an investigation of the circumstances. Can you picture the following: In the barracks a few feet from his bunk was a bulletin board. On it was an 8 1/2-by-11 bulletin with a picture of the Salt Lake Temple on it and a listing of the meeting times at the base chapel. He'd been to an orientation for all new inductees, conducted by one of the base chaplains. While in this case it was not a Latter-day Saint chaplain, there was a Latter-day Saint chaplain at that installation. This fact had been noted in the lecture, incidentally. He had been told that if he wanted to know about church services to talk to the sergeant on duty, or he could contact any chaplain's office and that information would readily be given to him.<br><br>He, however, had been told before he left home that the Church had a wonderful program to help young men in military service. He was assured that the Church was doing everything to take care of our men and that we would find them and look after them and bring the full Church program to them. He had, therefore, laid back on his bunk, propped up his feet, put his head on the pillow, and waited for the Church to do everything for him. He waited three weeks and was disappointed enough that he called his father, the bishop, to say that the Church had failed him.<br><br>Now, this was not malicious. It was just that he had been brought up with the idea that the whole effort and duty of the Church was to look after him. (He had missed the very point that the whole effort of the Church is to give him the opportunity to serve someone else.) Surely, since he was away from home and in a strange place and needing attention more than he had ever needed it in his life, all of that help, he was sure, would be forthcoming immediately without any effort on his part. He had been weakened by a dole system and was now in mortal spiritual jeopardy because he would not act for himself.<br><br>That experience had a great effect on me, and when we reorganized the military relations program, it was entirely changed in is emphasis from what it had been before over the years.<br><br>This change can be illustrated by one thing. The old program urged the ward or the quorum to subscribe to the Church magazine for every man entering the military service. It was the duty of the bishop to see that the subscription was renewed during the time of his enlistment.<br><br>Now we have changed all of that. Now we counsel the young man to subscribe to the magazine himself and to pay for it out of his own money. He ordinarily has money to spend on less useful things, and he should learn to take care of himself at the very beginning. If he cannot, for one reason or another, then his family should support it. If they cannot, or if in some cases they will not, then and only then would it be the responsibility of the ward or the quorum to step in and see that this important Church publication is sent to him.<br><br>We found that our men would not bother to file change-of-address cards for the magazines, if the subscription had been doled out to them. They had done nothing to earn them, and they didn't appreciate them. On one occasion we had a communication from the commanding general at Fort Ord, asking us to please cease and desist from sending subscriptions of Church magazines to men in basic training. They were there for only a few weeks and then they moved on. He advised, "We literally have a roomful of what now must be termed 'junk mail.' Under military regulations we cannot forward it and therefore must destroy it."<br><br>It is interesting to see what has happened in that military relations program. It used to be that every week there would be many letters, "My boy is somewhere. Pleased won't you get all of the Church working to find him?" We have put the shoe on the other foot. He is finding himself now. He's more self-reliant.<br><h2><b>Dangers of Modern Counseling Procedures</b></h2><br>In virtually every ward or branch there are chronic cases of individuals who endlessly seek counsel but never follow the counsel that is given. That, some may assume, is not serious. I think it's very serious! Like the common cold, it drains more strength out of humanity than any other disease. We seem to be developing an epidemic of "counselitis" that drains spiritual strength from the Church. Spiritual self-reliance is the sustaining power of the Church. If we rob you of that, how can you get the revelation that there is a prophet of God? How can you get answers to prayer? How can you<i>know</i>? If we move so quickly to answer all your questions and provide so many ways to solve all of your problems, we may end up weakening you, not strengthening you.<br><br>Now, I say here that I know quite well that some counselors are apt to say, "My counseling does not rob one of his self-reliance because I use the nondirective counseling approach. I am scrupulously careful not to take a position. I merely reflect back comments and feelings of the individual so that he will make the decision totally himself. I do my counsel by nondirection and never make a value judgment."<br><br>While I have respect for that procedure of counseling as a method, I think that if that's all they do, nondirection, very often that's precisely what we get from the counseling--no direction. When counselors schedule interminable sessions to say as little as possible while the student is struggling to try to decide if something's right or wrong, and the counselor already knows, that's a waste of time. So is the fussing around trying to determine whether it is right for you under the circumstances or wrong for you under the circumstances, when anyone with any moral sense would know that if a course is wrong it's wrong for<i>anybody</i>and it's wrong for<i>everybody.</i><br><br>In the Church, the directive pattern of counseling is at least as respectable and decent and desirable and needed as the nondirective approach to counseling. Unfortunately, we see very little of it anymore. How sweet and refreshing for a branch president or bishop or a counselor to say clearly to a student, "This course is right and this course is wrong. Now, you go make the decision." The student ought to know what is right and what is wrong by the quickest method possible, and that may be very directive. There is a crying need for counselors who will say pointedly and plainly, "This is wrong. It's evil. It's bad. It will bring you unhappiness. This course is right. It's good it's desirable. It will bring you happiness." Then the agency comes when the individual determines for himself whether or not he will follow the right course.<br><br>In the world this preoccupation with counseling has led to a number of experiments from which we are not entirely free in the Church. There are those counselors who want to delve deeper into the lives of subjects than is emotionally or spiritually healthy. I think I should explain here that, when I use the word<i>counselor</i>, I'm not just talking about professional counselors. I'm talking about<i>all</i>of us who are responsible for counseling. There are those who want to draw out and analyze and take apart and dissect. While a certain amount of catharsis is healthy and essential, overmuch of it can be degenerating. It is seldom as easy to put something back together as it is to take it apart.<br><br>There have been developed several procedures for group therapy. They are promoted under a number of titles: sensitivity training, self-actualization, training groups or T-groups, simulation, transactional analysis, encounter groups, marathon counseling sessions. Some even function under such titles as value clarification, one or two even under the title of character education, and so on. Although they differ in some respects, none of them is exactly alike; one or more of the following elements is apparent in all of them: They recognize no ultimate source for truth. All values are thus established by the individuals or group. There is no reference to God. They encourage a free and full expression, something of a confession, before the group of every intimate and personal feeling and experience. They encourage an openness, a touching, and a closeness among the members of the group, and they attempt to resolve problems simply by finding a comfortable interaction. Above all, they avoid any feeling of guilt.<br><br>There are major emotional and spiritual dangers involved in such procedures, and members of the Church would do well to be very cautious, perhaps even to leave them alone.<br><br>There is a question at times whether or not the sessions are for the good of the counselee, or for the curiosity and amusement of the counselor. Young people, you should know that when you're dealing with things of the mind and of the spirit, it's so easy to cause the very thing you're trying to prevent.<br><br>I remember years ago on the island of Kauai seeing a little sign in a photographer's shop that said:<br><br><i>If there is beauty, we will take it.</i><br><br><i>If there is none, we will make it.</i><br><br>I fear that some of us, in our overmuch counseling in the Church, seem to be saying:<br><br><i>If there are problems, we'll abate them.</i><br><br><i>If there are none, we'll create them.</i><br><br>That, incidentally, is my first poem. Now, I know it isn't Carol Lynn Pearson, but it has a thought to it.<br><br>I want to emphasize this point: I am fully aware that there are times when deep-seated emotional problems will respond to the procedures we have been talking about. They can have therapeutic value. There is, however, no justification to employ them in the absence of deep-seated emotional problems. There is no more justification for doing that then there is justification for a medical doctor to perform unnecessary surgery. When someone is just experimenting or riding the crest of the wave of a new counseling theory, I would no more encourage you to submit to brain surgery under the hands of a nurse or an intern or a ward attendant.<br><br>I think you've probably heard the account of the parents who are leaving their children untended for a few hours. They had gone out the door. Then the mother opened the door again and said, "Now children, while we're gone, whatever you do, don't take the stool and go into the pantry and climb up and reach up on the second shelf and move the cracker box and reach back and get that sack of beans and put one up your nose, will you?"<br><br>I say again, it's very easy when you're dealing with things of the mind and the spirit to cause the very thing you're trying so desperately to prevent. When you go for counseling, remember this from the Book of Mormon:<br><br><i>Cursed is he that putteth his trust in man, or maketh flesh his arm, or shall hearken unto the precepts of men, save their precepts shall be given by the power of the Holy Ghost</i>. [2 Nephi 28:31]<br><br>The Lord also gave this warning:<br><br><i>O the vainness, and the frailties, and the foolishness of men! When they are learned they think they are wise, and they hearken not unto the counsel of God, for they set it aside, supposing they know of themselves, wherefore their wisdom is foolishness and it profiteth them not. And they shall perish.</i><br><br><i>But to be learned is good if they hearken unto the counsels of God.</i>[2 Nephi 9:28–29]<br><h2><b>Guidelines for Emotional and Spiritual Independence</b></h2><br>Now, if you are willing to agree that the basic principles underlying the Church welfare program have application in your emotional and spiritual life--specifically, that independence, industry, thrift, self-reliance, and self-respect should be developed; that work be enthroned as a ruling principle in your life; that the evils of an emotional or spiritual dole should be avoided; and that the aim of the Church is to help the members to help themselves--then I have some principles and some suggestions for you.<br><br>We mentioned earlier that there should not be the slightest embarrassment for any member of the Church to receive welfare assistance, provided he has exhausted his own personal resources first and those available in his family. Likewise, there should not be the slightest embarrassment on the part of any member of the Church who needs counsel to receive that counsel. At times it may be crucial that you seek and that you accept counsel.<br><br>When you are discouraged and feel that you cannot solve a problem on your own, you may be right, but at least you are obligated to try. Every personal resource available to you should be committed before you take another step, and you have powerful resources. The Book of Mormon declares this once, which is often overlooked:<br><br><i>For the Spirit is the same, yesterday, today, and forever. And the way is prepared from the fall of man, and salvation is free.</i><br><br>And men are instructed sufficiently that they know good from evil. [2 Nephi 2:4–5; emphasis added]<br><br>It is critically important that you understand that you already know right from wrong, that you're innately, inherently, and intuitively good. When you say, "I can't! I can't solve my problems!" I want to thunder out, "Don't you realize who you are? Haven't you learned yet that you are a son or a daughter of Almighty God? Do you know that there are powerful resources inherited from Him that you can call upon to give you steadiness and courage and great power?"<br><br>Most of you have been taught the gospel all your lives. All of you know the difference between good and evil, between right and wrong. Isn't it time then that you decide that you're going to do right? In so doing you're making a choice. Not just<i>a</i>choice, but you're making<i>the</i>choice. Once you've decided that, with no fingers crossed, no counterfeiting, no reservations or hesitancy, the rest will all fall into place.<br><br>Most people who come for counsel to the stake presidents, branch presidents, bishops, and others, and to us as General Authorities, don't come because they are confused and they are not able to see the difference between right and wrong. They come because they're tempted to do something that deep down they know is wrong, and they want that decision ratified.<br><br>When you have a problem, work it out in your own mind first. Ponder on it and analyze it and meditate on it. Pray about it. I've come to learn that major decisions can't be forced. You must look ahead and have vision. What was it the prophet said in the Old Testament? "Where there is no vision, the people perish" (Proverbs 29:18).<br><br>Ponder on things a little each day, and don't always be in the crisis of making major decisions on the spur of the moment. If you're looking ahead in life, you can see major problems coming down the road toward you from some considerable distance. By the time you meet one another, you are able at the very beginning to take charge of that conversation. Once in a while a major decision will jump out at you from the side of the road and startle the wits out of you, but not very often. If you've already decided that you're going to do what is right and let all of the consequences follow, even those encounters won't hurt you.<br><br>I have learned that the best time to wrestle with major problems is early in the morning. Your mind is fresh and alert. The blackboard of your mind has been erased by a good night's rest. The accumulated distractions of the day are not in your way. Your body has been rested also. That's the time to think something through very carefully and to receive personal revelation.<br><br>I've heard President Harold B. Lee begin many a statement about matters involving revelation with an expression something like this: "In the early hours of the morning, while I was pondering upon the subject," and so on. He made it a practice to work on the problems that required revelation in the fresh, alert hours of the early morning.<br><br>The Lord knew something when He directed in the Doctrine and Covenants, "Cease to sleep longer than is needful; retire to thy bed early, that ye may not be weary; arise early, that your bodies and your minds may be invigorated" (D&amp;amp;C 88:124).<br><br>I have a friend who bought a business. A short time later he suffered catastrophic reverses. There just didn't seem to be any way out for him, and finally it got so bad that he couldn't sleep. So, for a period of time he followed the practice of getting up about three o'clock in the morning and going to the office. There, with a paper and pen, he would ponder and pray and write down every idea that came to him as a possible solution or a contribution to the solution of his problem. It wasn't long before he had several possible directions that he could go, and it was not much longer than that until he had chosen the best of them. But he had earned an extra bonus. His notes showed, after going over them, that he had discovered many hidden resources that he had never noticed before. He came away more independent and successful than ever he would have been if he hadn't suffered those reverses.<br><br>There's a lesson in that. A year or two later he was called to preside over a mission in one of the foreign lands. His business was so independent and well set up that when he came back he didn't return to it. He just has someone else managing it, and he's able to give virtually all of his time now to the blessing of others.<br><br>I counsel our children to do their critical studying in the early hours of the morning when they're fresh and alert, rather than to fight the physical weariness and mental exhaustion at night. I've learned that the dictum "Early to bed, early to rise" is powerful. When under pressure--for instance, when I was preparing this talk--you wouldn't find me burning the midnight oil. Much rather I'd be early to bed and getting up in the wee hours of the morning, when I could be close to Him who guides this work.<br><br>Now, about revelation. We have all been taught that revelation is available to each of us individually. The question I'm most often asked about revelation is "How do I know when I have received it? I've prayed about it and fasted over this problem and prayed about it and prayed about it, and I still don't quite know what to do. How can I really tell whether I'm being inspired so I won't make a mistake?<br><br>First, do you go to the Lord with a problem and ask Him to make your decision for you? Or do you work and meditate and pray and then make a decision yourself? Measure the problem against what you know to be right and wrong, and then make the decision. Then, ask Him if the decision is right or if it is wrong. Remember what He said to Oliver Cowdery about working it out in your mind.<br><br>Listen to this sentence if you don't hear anything else: If we foolishly ask our bishop or branch president or the Lord to make a decision for us, there's precious little self-reliance in that. Think what it costs every time you have somebody else make a decision for you.<br><br>I think I should mention one other thing, and I hope this won't be misunderstood. We often find young people who will decide for themselves. Suppose, if you will, that a couple had money available to buy a house. Suppose they had prayed endlessly over whether they should built an Early American style, a ranch style, modern-style architecture, or even a Mediterranean style. Has it ever occurred to you that perhaps the Lord just plain doesn't care? Let them build what they want to build. It's their choice. In many things we can do just what we want.<br><br>Now there<i>are</i>some things He cares about very much. If you're going to build that house, then be honest and pay for the material that goes into it and do a decent job of building it. When you move into it, live righteously in it. Those are the things that count.<br><br>On occasions I've had to counsel people that the Lord would probably quite willingly approve the thing they intend to do even when they want to. It's strange when they come and almost feel guilty about doing something because they want to, even when it's righteous. The Lord is very generous with the freedom He gives us. The more we learn to follow the right, the more we are spiritually self-reliant, the more our freedom and our independence are affirmed. "If ye continue in my word," He said, "then are ye my disciples indeed; And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free" (John 8:31–32).<br><br>There is great meaning in these words from Carol Lynn Pearson, entitled, "The Lesson":<br><br><i>Yes, my fretting</i><br><br><i>Frowning child,</i><br><i>I could cross</i><br><i>The room to you</i><br><i>More easily.</i><br><i>But I've already</i><br><i>Learned to walk,</i><br><i>So I make you</i><br><i>Come to me.</i><br><br><i>Let go now--</i><br><i>There!</i><br><i>You see?</i><br><br><i>Oh, remember</i><br><i>This simple lesson,</i><br><i>Child,</i><br><i>And when</i><br><i>In later years</i><br><i>You cry out</i><br><i>With tight fists</i><br><i>And tears</i><br><i>"Oh help me,</i><br><i>God--please."--</i><br><i>Just listen</i><br><i>And you'll hear</i><br><i>A silent voice:</i><br><br><i>"I would, child,</i><br><i>I would</i><br><i>But it's you,</i><br><i>Not I,</i><br><i>Who needs to try</i><br><i>Godhood."</i><br><br>Laman and Lemuel complained to Nephi, "Behold, we cannot understand the words which our father hath spoken."<br><br>"Have ye inquired of the Lord?" Nephi asked them.<br><br>And think of this answer. They said to him, "We have not; for the Lord maketh no such thing known to us."<br><br>"How is it," he answered, "that ye do not keep the commandments of the Lord? How is it that ye will perish, because of the hardness of your hearts? Do ye not remember the things which the Lord said?--If ye will not harden your hearts, and ask me in faith, believing that ye shall receive, with diligence in keeping my commandments, surely these things shall be made known unto you" (see 1 Nephi 15:7–11).<br><br>In conclusion, if we lose the spirit and power of individual revelation, we have lost much in this Church. You have great and powerful resources. You, through prayer, can solve your problems without endlessly going to those who are trying so hard to help others.<br><br>Now, if you start receiving revelations for anyone else's jurisdiction, you know immediately you're out of order, that they come from the wrong source.<br><br>If you become so dependent and insecure that prayer and the answer to prayer are such that you are hesitant to rely on them, then you are weak.<br><br>If we follow a course where, on one hand, we would carefully scrutinize an order for welfare products and yet, on the other hand, dole out counsel and advice without sending you to your own storehouse of knowledge and inspiration, then we have done you a disservice.<br><br>This Church relies on individual testimony. Each must earn his own testimony. It is then that you can stand and say, as I can say, that I know that God lives, the He is our Father, that we have a child-parent relationship with Him. I know that He is close, that we can go to Him and appeal, and then, if we will be obedient and listen and use every resource, we will have an answer to our prayers.<br><br>This is His church. God lives. Jesus is the Christ. We have a prophet presiding over this Church. Every one of us and every other soul on this earth can know that. I bear witness of that. I know that He lives and affirm this witness to you in the name of Jesus Christ. amen.<br><br><i><i>Boyd K.

<h1>ry Work, Valiance, Obedience, Forgiveness, Testimony - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I appreciate this opportunity to join with you this morning. I have enjoyed thoroughly the music and the prayer that have been offered.<br><br>My purpose in coming to you today is to offer you some insights into four of five different subjects that obviously I can't cover thoroughly, but I'd like to discuss with you on a brief basis. First is missionary work. Next is the concept of being valiant; then come obedience and forgiveness and finally testimony.<br><h2><b>Do Missionary Work</b></h2><br>May I just make a comment or two on missionary work. I received a letter recently from a missionary who came to see me a year or so ago with his girl friend. He had a desire to get married rather than go on a mission, and we discussed it. As usual, I didn't tell him what to do, but we discussed the ramifications and the urgings of the prophet and some of the scriptural connotations.<br><br>This letter was sent to me from this young man from the mission field. He went on his mission, and his fiancée is here someplace today, at least on this campus. I don't know if she's here. He ended his letter by saying, "We'll be back to see you when I get home." He was very complimentary in the opportunity for service they both had, having taken this direction. May I just add that I would suggest to him--if for any reason he has a chance to read these remarks--that he not make the great mistake that many missionaries make: that is, don't send your companion to see your girl if your companion gets home before you.<br><br>The Doctrine and Covenants states:<br><br><i>And again, I say unto you, I give you a commandment, that every man, both elder, priest, teacher, and also member, go to with his might, with the labor of his hands, to prepare and accomplish the things which I have commanded.</i><br><br><i>And let your preaching be the warning voice, every man to his neighbor, in mildness and meekness.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 38:40–41]<br><br>If we want a directive, if we want a baseline for what the Lord expects of us, I think this scripture gives it to us: "Every man, both elder, priest, teacher, and also member, ... let your preaching be the warning voice, every man to his neighbor, in mildness and meekness." This is the scriptural basis for every member a missionary, and it outlines exactly what the Lord expects of us as members of his church.<br><br>This is the kingdom of God. And if it is the kingdom of God, then every soul on the face of this earth has a right to the opportunity to receive it, because every soul on the face of this earth is the son or the daughter of God. If that is to happen, it must happen by our own participation. It must happen by our own activity as far as touching the lives of the people around us. We must not be ashamed; we must step forward and be strong and outgoing in letting people know who we are and what this Church represents.<br><br>This scripture also has a meaning, as do other scriptures, relative to the group of young men who joined us in one portion of this building today, who are in the Language Training Mission and who are called as full-time missionaries; that is the responsibility of a young man who is able to go and perform missionary service in the church of Jesus Christ on a full-time basis. This has great significance in connection with his obligation to his priesthood and his obligation to his own baptismal covenant. A young lady isn't under that same obligation. Many go and they are welcome. But for a young lady it is more of an optional thing. For a young man, as the prophets have told us, missionary work is a priesthood responsibility. If you hold the priesthood, then you have some obligation to the people of the world to teach the gospel and to prepare yourself for full-time missionary service.<br><br>I had a man about my age come in to see me a few days ago. He told me a story about a 1947 Chevrolet. It was a little after the Second World War. He was a young elder, I guess, or priest--I'm not sure which. Anyway, he and his friend were called in to see the bishop one night after sacrament meeting, and they both knew what was coming up. The bishop said to the first young man, "We'd like you to prepare to go on a mission."<br><br>The young man replied, "All right, I'll do it."<br><br>And then the man who came in to see me was next. He went in and the bishop said, "We'd like you to prepare to go on a mission."<br><br>And he said, "Bishop, I can't do it because I am paying for a 1947 Chevrolet." He said that at that time of his life, this was the most important thing to him. He said, "I just don't see how I can do it." Well, one thing led to another, and he never did go. He came in to tell me how throughout his life he had regretted that decision so much that every time he sees a 1947 Chevrolet (and that is occasionally nowadays) he gets a sort of unhappy feeling in his heart. He relates it to something that he had an opportunity to do but didn't do.<br><br>There is a 1947 Chevrolet in each of our lives. There is some material thing that sooner or later will stand between what the Lord expects of us and what we know we should do. Then we have to make a decision, and may the Lord bless us that we may make a proper decision when our 1947 Chevrolet confronts us.<br><h2><b>Be Valiant</b></h2><br>Next comes the concept of being valiant.<br><br><i>And again, we saw the terrestrial world, and behold and lo, these are they who are of the terrestrial, whose glory differs from that of the church of the Firstborn who have received the fulness of the Father, even as that of the moon differs from the sun in the firmament.</i><br><br><i>Behold, these are they who died without law;</i><br><br><i>And also they who are the spirits of men kept in prison, whom the Son visited, and preached the gospel unto them, that they might be judged according to men in the flesh;</i><br><br><i>Who received not the testimony of Jesus in the flesh, but afterwards received it.</i><br><br><i>These are they who are honorable men of the earth, who were blinded by the craftiness of men . ...</i><br><br><i>These are they</i>who are not valiant<i>in the testimony of Jesus; wherefore, they obtain not the crown over the kingdom of our God</i>. [D&amp;amp;C 76:71–75, 79; emphasis added]<br><br>I assume that this statement has reference to members of the Church, because it is talking about not being valiant in the testimony of Jesus Christ.<br><br>I looked up the word<i>valiant</i>in the dictionary and this is what it told me: "Stout-hearted, intrepid in danger, courageous, boldly brave, performed with valor or bravery, heroic, strong, meritorious, or excellence of its kind, fine, very good, brave." The synonyms are<i>heroic</i>,<i>brave</i>,<i>courageous</i>, and<i>steadfast</i>. I like that word--<i>steadfast</i>,<i>intrepid</i>. The opposite of<i>valiant</i>is<i>fainthearted</i>and<i>cowardly</i>. "These are they who are not valiant in the testimony of Jesus. Wherefore, they obtain not the crown over the kingdom of God."<br><br>I think being valiant is measured in two ways. I think it is measured in the gospel of Jesus Christ in our individual lives when no one else is around. How valiant we are depends on how well we do when no one is looking at us or when we are among people who don't know who we are. I think that is a good definition of being valiant. I think being valiant, in connection with the first point, can also be associated with our willingness to share the gospel of Jesus Christ and its truthfulness. Occasionally we find ourselves in the position where we are just a little too embarrassed to let people know who we really are, and I am wondering if that is being valiant. I'm sure that the Lord gives us opportunities to repent, but he has called on us to be valiant in our testimony of the gospel of Jesus Christ in order for us to be heirs to the inheritance in the celestial kingdom.<br><br>A story in point about valiance: Zion's Camp. Let me read you a page from Church history:<br><br><i>Kirtland, February 14, 1835--This day a meeting was called of those who journeyed last season to Zion</i>[that is, Zion's Camp]<i>for the purpose of laying the foundation of the redemption, together with as many other of the brethren and sisters as were disposed to attend.</i><br><br><i>President Joseph Smith, Jr., presiding, read the fifteenth chapter of John, and said: Let us endeavor to solemnize our minds that we may receive a blessing, by calling on the Lord. After an appropriate and affecting prayer, the brethren who went to Zion</i>[in Zion's Camp]<i>were requested to take their seats together in a part of the house by themselves.</i><br><br><i>President Smith then stated that the meeting had been called, because God had commanded it; and it was made known to him by vision and by the Holy Spirit. He then gave a relation of some of the circumstances attending us while journeying to Zion--our trials, sufferings; and said God had not designed all this for nothing, but He had it in remembrance yet; and it was the will of God that those who went to Zion, with the determination to lay down their lives, if necessary, should be ordained to the ministry, and go forth to prune the vineyard for the last time, or the coming of the Lord, which was nigh. ...</i><br><br><i>The President also said many things; such as the weak things, even the smallest and weakest among us, shall be powerful and mighty, and great things shall be accomplished by you from this hour; and you shall begin to feel the whisperings of the Spirit of God; and the work of God shall begin to break forth from this time; and you shall be endowed with power from on high.</i>[<i>Documentary History of the Church,</i>2:181–82]<br><br>Remember Zion's Camp? Remember the history? Remember how the Saints went up to free the land in Jackson County from which they had been driven off by mobs? Do you remember how there was no redress from the government? Remember how they marched all the way up there and didn't fight? Do you remember how some of them got rebellious against the Prophet Joseph and others? Remember how cholera struck the camp and some people were struck down, as it were, in a moment? And then after all this, they disbanded the camp and sent everybody home. Oh, what a great opportunity to say, "Joseph really missed it this time. What a waste of time! We certainly didn't get anything accomplished. I wonder whether Joseph Smith knows what he is talking about."<br><br>Elder Joseph Young, in his history of the organization of the seventies, says this about the meeting about which we just read:<br><br><i>The following sentiment was delivered by the Prophet Joseph Smith in an address to the Elders assembled in Kirtland soon after the Seventies were organized: "Brethren, some of you are angry with me, because you did not fight in Missouri; but let me tell you, God did not want you to fight. He could not organize His kingdom with twelve men to open the Gospel door to the nations of the earth, and with seventy men under their direction to follow in their tracks, unless He took them from a body of men who had offered their lives, and who had made as great a sacrifice as did Abraham. Now the Lord has got His Twelve and His Seventy, and there will be other quorums of Seventies called, who will make the sacrifice, and those who have not made their sacrifices and their offerings now, will make them hereafter."</i>[<i>Documentary History of the Church,</i>2:182]<br><br>The interesting thing about Zion's Camp is that nobody knew when they were going through it why they were going through it until the Lord told them later. Do you know that in everyone's life comes a Zion's Camp? Many times in the quiet and stillness of a personal relationship or while you are by yourself, and without realizing it, you are proving yourself to the Lord. Without realizing it, you are demonstrating whether you're valiant in your testimony. May each one of us be able to meet our Zion's Camp and understand that a Lord who knows all and understands what we are going through both in public and in private will bless us for the good that we accomplish and for the right decisions that we make. So much on the principle of being valiant.<br><h2><b>Be Obedient</b></h2><br>The next principle is obedience.<br><br><i>And it came to pass that he</i>[Christ]<i>stretched forth his hand and spake unto the people, saying:</i><br><br><i>Behold, I am Jesus Christ, whom the prophets testified shall come into the world.</i><br><br><i>And behold, I am the light and the life of the world; and I have drunk out of that bitter cup which the Father hath given me, and have glorified the Father in taking upon me the sins of the world, in the which I have suffered the will of the Father in all things from the beginning.</i>[3 Nephi 11:9–11]<br><br>The Savior goes on to point out that he strictly and unalterably and without hesitation did just exactly what his Father told him to do. He wrought the Atonement, he established salvation, he became the Savior of the world, and he provided the way for us because he was 100 percent obedient. And then he says in other places, "Go thou and do likewise. I was obedient so you could be saved. Now you be obedient, so that the principles of the gospel of Jesus Christ and repentance can be applicable in your life."<br><br>The strict principle of obedience was established first of all by Jesus the Christ as a pattern by which we should live. Now, this is the hard kind of obedience. I was in the army a few years ago; that is the easy kind of obedience. They say, "Soldier, don't you want to do that?"<br><br>And you say, "Yes, sir," because the alternative is, or was, an Article 15 (I don't know what they call it now). That is the easy kind of obedience because the penalties are so severe that you are happy to do what they want you to do.<br><br>Now, the hard kind of obedience is obedience with free agency. That is where you learn the principle, you know it is from God, you take a youthful, rebellious spirit (many times in youth comes a little bit of the rebellious in all of us), and you begin to mold that spirit and you begin to teach yourself the principle of self-discipline so that you can do what the Lord God has asked you to do. If you are valiant in this, if you are loyal, if you are faithful, the promise is that the Holy Ghost will help you. But you have to wrestle with yourself and you have to begin to put yourself in harmony with that which God has called upon you to do.<br><br>Jesus Christ was strictly obedient to his Father, and we, too, need to be strictly obedient if we are to inherit the crown and if we are to follow the Savior. How can we follow or how can we be obedient to a Savior whom we have not yet seen if we can't be obedient to his servants whom we can see?<br><br>Finally, obedience is not seeing how close you can come to the line. I have a three-year-old boy at home who, among others, keeps us humble. He is a very active young man. He is constantly testing us. He says, "Can I do this?"<br><br>And we say, "No, that is not good for you. You shouldn't do that."<br><br>He says, "If I can't get that close to the line, can I get this close to the line?" He edges a little closer. Then he says, "Well, if this is still all right, how would it be if I stand here?" And finally he says, "Well, my toenails are on the line. Is that too close?" Sooner or later he's in trouble. The policies that are established are for us to follow through the principle of obedience. The principle of obedience is not to find out how close we can get to the line. You're in trouble if you violate the principle of obedience, because doing so is taking you in the wrong direction. Jesus the Christ established strict obedience to his Father so that we could be saved, and now he has asked us to go and do likewise and to develop obedience with free agency so that we might inherit that which he has offered to us. So much for obedience.<br><h2><b>Be Forgiving</b></h2><br>Next is forgiveness.<br><br><i>And behold, it is written, an eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth;</i><br><br><i>But I say unto you, that ye shall not resist evil, but whosoever shall smite thee on the right cheek, turn to him the other also;</i><br><br><i>And if any man will sue thee at the law and take away thy coat, let him have thy cloak also;</i><br><br><i>And whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile, go with him twain.</i><br><br><i>Give to him that asketh thee and from him that would borrow of thee turn thou not away.</i><br><br><i>And behold it is written also, that thou shalt love thy neighbor and hate thine enemy;</i><br><br><i>But behold I say unto you, love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them who despitefully use you and persecute you . ...</i><br><br><i>Therefore I would that ye should be perfect, even as I,</i>[notice this line again<i>], or your Father who is in heaven in perfect.</i>[3 Nephi 12:38–44, 48]<br><br>One of the great principles of Christianity in the gospel of Jesus Christ is the ability to forgive. If in your life you have not yet been misjudged, or you have not yet been accused of something you haven't done, just hang on for a while because it will happen. You can count on it. It is part of the trials that no one gets out of this life without experiencing. Now, if you understand that, then you will realize that this is part of the test. How you face that test will determine whether you learn what it is that the Lord wants you to learn and whether you have a forgiving heart. You are going to be misjudged, and people are going to accuse you of something that you haven't done. If that begins to make you black inside, if you begin to think of how you can get even, if you begin to say to yourself, "Well, just wait! Just wait!" then you are back with the law of Moses, and the gospel of Jesus Christ has been trampled underfoot. For anybody can love someone who loves him, but it takes the Christian to love the person who persecutes him, but it takes the Christian to love the person who persecutes him or is unkind to him. May the Lord bless us to be Christians in our ability to forgive and forget.<br><br>We have two great examples of forgiveness: One is Jesus Christ on the cross--"Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do" (Luke 23:34). The other is Joseph Smith, crossing the river to go to his doom--"For I have a conscience void of offense toward all men." After what they went through, if they can show us the way, certainly we can forgive in our hearts and forget. So much for forgiveness.<br><h2><b>Gain a Testimony</b></h2><br>Finally, testimony.<br><br><i>Believe in God; believe that he is, and that he created all things, both in heaven and in earth; believe that he has all wisdom, and all power, both in heaven and in earth; believe that man doth not comprehend all the things which the Lord can comprehend.</i><br><br><i>And again, believe that ye must repent of your sins and forsake them, and humble yourselves before God; and ask in sincerity of heart that he would forgive you;</i>and now, if you believe all these things see that ye do them. [Mosiah 4:9–10; emphasis added]<br><br>I heard a Chinese proverb once that went something like this: The person who hears truth is not the equal of the person who understands truth, and the person who understands truth is not the equal of the person who loves truth. So it is with a testimony. Some people hear the words; some people understand. We're told even the devils believe, but it hasn't made any difference in their lives. Then there are those who love the truth, and when that happens their life changes. When that happens, they live the principles of the gospel of Jesus Christ even when they're on a desert island all by themselves, because they love the truth and they are committed to that principle of testimony so much that it has changed their lives.<br><br>Testimony is knowing that God lives and following him. Testimony is knowing that Jesus is the Christ and following him. Testimony is knowing that Joseph Smith was a true prophet and living the teachings he brought forth. Testimony is knowing that Spencer W. Kimball is a prophet of God and following his example. Testimony is knowing the Church is true and supporting it. Testimony is knowing the Book of Mormon is the word of God and living its teachings.<br><br>He that hears is not the equal of the person who understands, and the person who understands is not the equal of the person who loves the truth. Can the eye say to the arm, "I have no need of thee"? Can a person say, "I know Joseph Smith was a prophet, yet I can't live by some of these other things"? Can the leg say to the hand, "I have no need of thee"? (see 1 Corinthians 12:14–27). Certainly not. May the Lord bless us that our witness and testimony can cause us to know and to love and to do, because certainly therein is pure testimony.<br><br>May the Lord bless us in missionary work, in valiance, obedience, forgiveness, and testimony. Perhaps in these brief insights there might be something here of some value. We certainly pray that that is the case.<br><br>I bear you my witness as to the truthfulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ. I know God lives. I know he lives. I know Jesus the Christ is our Savior and Redeemer. I know Joseph Smith was a true prophet. I know Spencer W. Kimball is a prophet of God today and that he speaks in the name of Christ the Lord. I know that this is the church of Jesus Christ. I know that the Book of Mormon is true. I bear you that witness and pray the Lord to bless us all as we strive to do the things that we know must be done in order to inherit his kingdom, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Loren C.

<h1> to Serve - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Good morning, my young brothers and sisters. It's a great honor and a privilege to greet you here this morning in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. It's because of him that we are here. Everything we do in this life that is really worthwhile comes through the Lord. This is the Lord's university. It's altogether fitting, I presume, that we should have seven or eight thousand, or however many may be here this morning, gather together at least once a week in a devotional, where we bear witness of what we know to be true: that Jesus is the Christ, that this is his university and that you are students in the Lord's university. Of course, great responsibility comes with being a student here. I'm sure this is an altogether unique experience; I don't think it exists anywhere else on earth. And so you are very, very special--special to the Lord. I hope you're special to yourselves as well because you have such a great, great responsibility--such a great work to perform.<br><h2><b>Follow Christ</b></h2><br>What does it mean to be a follower of Jesus Christ? I presume it means to do the things that he would do. If you follow someone, then you do as closely as you can the things that he does. He said that he came to do the will of his Father, and he could do only what he had seen his Father do before him (see John 6:38). He was a precise follower of his Father, and because he was, he became a great, great leader--a leader of us all. It is a fact that before you can be a great leader, you must be a great follower. If we could learn to follow the Lord, we would learn to serve our fellowmen. I presume that this is probably the most fitting motto that could have been composed to represent the purpose of Brigham Young University: "Enter to learn. Go forth to serve." It is important that you learn before you try to serve.<br><br>The Prophet Joseph Smith's brother had a great desire to preach the gospel. He wanted to go out and teach, but the Lord spoke to him, saying, "Seek not to declare my word, but first seek to obtain my word, and then shall your tongue be loosed; then, if you desire, you shall have my spirit and my word, yea, the power of God unto the convincing of men" (D&amp;amp;C 11:21). And that's the order of things with respect to the Lord: we have a basic responsibility to get it ourselves first, then give it to our families, and then take it to the world. This is the order that we must follow. And only if we follow this order will we be effective and successful in the great mission that we have in the world today.<br><br>Jesus Christ came to serve and to give his life as a ransom for many. He said, "I am among you as he that serveth." He came to give, not to take. This sets the pattern for our own conduct if we are to fill the measure of our creation and magnify our probation. This is the standard that has been erected if we would follow the Lord--service in the kingdom.<br><h2><b>Serve in the Mission Field</b></h2><br>I presume one of the greatest ways that we can render service is to serve as missionaries, bringing the light of the gospel into the lives of people who sit in darkness. The living prophet of God has made this so plain that we can't misunderstand it. "The question is frequently asked," said the prophet Spencer W. Kimball, "should every young man fill a mission? And the answer has been given by the Lord. It is 'Yes, every young man should fill a mission.'" He said that every young man should pay his tithing. Every young man should observe the Sabbath. Every young man should attend his meetings. Every young man should consecrate his marriage in the temple, properly train his children, and do many other mighty works. Of course he should. He does not always do it, but he should. "We realize," said the prophet, "that while all men definitely should, all men are not prepared to teach the gospel abroad." Far too many young men arrive at the missionary age quite unprepared to go on a mission, and, of course, they should not be sent. But they should all be prepared. Then, if they are prepared, they can go. We have to be in condition if we're going to serve the Lord. Condition comes through obedience; it doesn't come any other way. The prophet continued, "There are a few physically unfit to do missionary service. Paul also had a thorn in his side." That doesn't mean that you can't do it even if you have some physical impairment. There are far too many unfit emotionally, mentally, and morally because they have not kept their lives clean and in harmony with the spirit of missionary work. They should have been prepared--should! But since they have broken the laws, they may have to be deprived thereof, and there hangs one of the greatest challenges--to keep these young men worthy. Yes, we say, "every able, worthy man should shoulder the cross. They should be prepared, usually with saved funds for their missions and always with a happy heart for service" (Regional Representatives seminar, April 1974).<br><br>The Lord would be hard pressed to make that more plain, wouldn't he? I doubt if we could make that more plain to the understanding than that every young man should prepare to fulfill a mission. Of course, there's a great responsibility on branch presidents and bishops, too. In the recent conference in Sao Paulo, Brazil, President Kimball was speaking to the priesthood brethren and said, "A bishop that would let a young man arrive at missionary age, not having interviewed him and prepared him to go on a mission, is asleep at the switch, and he ought to take a switch and switch himself." That's pretty plain, too, isn't it?<br><br>Of course, missionary work prepares us for that which is to come, too. It's in the mission field that the Lord produces future bishops, stake presidents, mission presidents, Regional Representatives, and General Authorities of the Church. So this is one of the greatest opportunities for service that we'll know here upon this earth. Missionary work is a priesthood responsibility, and not primarily the young ladies' responsibility. They have a different responsibility, but many of them can serve. They have a responsibility to get married and raise a family, so we encourage them in this. Of course, if they arrive at the age of twenty-one and don't have a better offer, we might entertain an offer for them to serve, too. Of course, some young ladies plan from their early youth to fill missions and have prepared to receive such a call to service. These make great missionaries and superior wives and mothers because of their missionary experience, but missionary work is still basically a priesthood responsibility.<br><br>The Lord authorizes his servants to speak for him, and he credits them and their account as though all of the service were rendered to him personally. He says, recorded in Matthew:<br><br><i>Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world:</i><br><br><i>For I was an hungered and ye gave me meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me in:</i><br><br><i>Naked, and ye clothed me: I was sick, and ye visited me: I was in prison, and ye came unto me.</i><br><br><i>Then shall the righteous answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungered, and fed thee? or thirsty, and gave thee drink?</i><br><br><i>When saw we thee a stranger, and took thee in? or naked, and clothed thee?</i><br><br><i>Or when saw we thee sick, or in prison, and came unto thee?</i>[Matthew 25:34–39]<br><br>We never did that. You must have someone else in mind. "And the King shall answer and say unto them, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me" (Matthew 25:40). On the other hand, those who failed to do so unto their brothers are charged with not having done it unto the Lord, and they are judged on that basis.<br><br>The more acquainted we become with this Church, the more we understand that it is the Church of Jesus Christ because it is established primarily to bless the children of our Heavenly Father. The real purpose of this Church is to give us opportunities to grow and develop and to serve our fellowmen, for that's really the only way we can serve the Lord, anyway.<br><br>The Lord Jesus Christ runs this Church. It is the responsibility of the bishop and the stake president to live so closely to the Lord that they know whom the Lord has selected to fill certain positions of responsibility in the Church. They merely seek out these persons and issue the call in the name of the Lord. That's how calls come in the kingdom. Since we understand that, there are a few things we need to keep in mind about service in the kingdom--service to our fellowmen. King Benjamin's doctrine is still true that "when ye are in the service of your fellow beings ye are only in the service of your God" (Mosiah 2:17).<br><h2><b>Don't Seek Church Callings</b></h2><br>The first important criterion of service is, since the Lord makes the calls, you don't seek for a call in the kingdom of God. A man would be a little suspect with me if he wanted to be a bishop. I can't imagine why anyone would want that job, can you? One of the Brethren, speaking on that subject some time ago, made and interesting statement. He said, "Every time I see a bishop, I feel tired." Now, that's not a disparaging remark about a bishop, you understand. That remark just recognizes the great responsibility that a bishop has in this Church. He is the Lord's executive representative to the families of the Church.<br><br>The family is the basic unit of exaltation. There's nothing more important than a family to our Heavenly Father. He is a real family man. If you doubt that, just look around you. We all belong to him; we're his children. He believes in families, and so he has designed the greatest blessings that families can receive to be received through the family relationships in his family house. (We call that the temple of the Lord.) Really, it's the Lord's family house. The most important room in the temple is the sealing room. That's really just a family room. The only purpose of the sealing room is to create eternal families. The most important object in the temple is the altar of the temple, but that's just a family altar. The only purpose of an altar in the temple is to join a man and a woman, making them one--one family in the Lord.<br><br>The bishop has the responsibility of watching over the families of the Church. Sometimes he has to call them to repentance because he is the father of the flock. He's also a judge in Israel. Now, you wouldn't want someone that would actively politic for that kind of a job, would you? No. However, it doesn't hurt to be in condition to accept a call when it comes, but you don't seek for a call. You don't actively go out and pursue a job in this Church.<br><h2><b>Accept Church Callings When Given</b></h2><br>The second criterion of service is, since the Lord does make the call, you don't turn down a call when it comes. You're not turning down the bishop or the stake president; you're turning down the Lord. You can't afford that. No one can. So accept those calls as they come to you, knowing that you're called to succeed and not to fail. The kingdom is not going to fail. It has been established upon the earth for the last time. Like the stone the prophet Daniel saw that was cut out of the mountain without hands, it is not a man-made organization but was done by the Lord through a prophet. The stone rolled forth down the mountainside, gaining momentum as it went. It broke down all the other kingdoms, filled the whole earth, became a great mountain, and stood forever (see Daniel 2:45). The kingdom is a winner. Isn't it great to be part of a winner? Don't you love a winner? I do. I believe we came to win. Some say, "It matters not whether you win or lose but how you play the game."<i>Don't you believe it.</i>It makes a lot of difference whether you win or not. That may be all right for basketball, but it's not all right for the kingdom of God. You see, we came here to win. We didn't come to just play the game. If we stick with the Lord we will win. We're not going to fail. The Lord is not going to fail. The kingdom will succeed. It will win in the earth, but we have to be part of it if we're going to win with it. So we're called to be a winner in the kingdom of God.<br><br>Now, don't second-guess the Lord's anointed servants. Sometimes we get the idea that the bishop just doesn't recognize our ability or he wouldn't call us to such menial tasks. I had missionaries who wondered sometimes about my transfers. I might move them from Jacksonville, Florida, where there were 750,000 people (which they figured was commensurate with their ability) to the small town of Bristol, Florida, where there were less than 5,000. I got a letter from a missionary who got such a transfer one day. He said, "President, is this inspiration or desperation?"<br><br>I learned a verse that I think depicts the attitude that we must cultivate if we're going to accomplish the work the Lord has given us to do, for it's a mountainous task:<br><br><i>"Where shall I serve today?" I said,</i><br><i>And my love flowed warm and free.</i><br><i>Then he pointed me out a little spot and said,</i><br><i>"There, tend that for me."</i><br><br><i>I said, "Oh no, not that,</i><br><i>Why, no one would ever see--</i><br><i>No matter how well my work was done--</i><br><i>Not that little spot for me."</i><br><br><i>And the words he spoke, they were not stern,</i><br><i>He answered me tenderly,</i><br><i>"Little one, search that heart of thine,</i><br><i>Art thou serving them or me?</i><br><i>Nazareth was just a little spot</i><br><i>And so was Galilee."</i><br><br>You see, there are no small, small spots in the kingdom of God. There are no small jobs in the kingdom. To be called as a home teacher and be made responsible for the spiritual and physical well-being of a family, the basic unit of exaltation--could that be called a small job? I tell you, it isn't. And as you're called to serve the Lord, you're called to touch the lives of these people. As a matter of fact, they can feel the "touch of the Master's hand" through you because the Lord calls you to act for him. He gives you authority to act for him, and he stands behind what you do when you act under the influence of his Spirit just as though he had done it himself. There's a verse that illustrates this:<br><br><i>'Twas battered and scarred, and the auctioneer</i><br><i>Thought it scarcely worth his while</i><br><i>To waste such time on the old violin,</i><br><i>But held it up with a smile:</i><br><i>"What am I bidden, good folks?" he cried,</i><br><i>"Who'll start the bidding for me?</i><br><i>A dollar, a dollar," then "Two." "Only two?</i><br><i>Two dollars, and who'll make it three?</i><br><i>Three dollars, once; three dollars, twice;</i><br><i>Going for three--." But no.</i><br><i>From the room, far back, a gray-haired man</i><br><i>Came forward and picked up the bow;</i><br><i>Then, wiping the dust form the old violin,</i><br><i>And tightening the loose strings,</i><br><i>He played a melody pure and sweet</i><br><i>As sweet as a caroling angel sings.</i><br><br><i>The music ceased, and the auctioneer,</i><br><i>With a voice that was quiet and low,</i><br><i>Said, "What am I bid for the old violin?"</i><br><i>And he held it up with the bow.</i><br><i>"A thousand dollars, and who'll make it two?</i><br><i>Two thousand! And who'll make it three?</i><br><i>Three thousand once, three thousand, twice,</i><br><i>And going and gone!" said he.</i><br><i>The people cheered, but some of them cried,</i><br><i>"We do not quite understand</i><br><i>What changed its worth." Swift came the reply:</i><br><i>"The touch of a master's hand."</i><br><br><i>And many a man with life out of tune,</i><br><i>And battered and scarred with sin,</i><br><i>Is auctioned cheap to the thoughtless crowd,</i><br><i>Much like the old violin.</i><br><i>A "mess of pottage," a glass of wine;</i><br><i>A game--and he travels on.</i><br><i>He's "going" once, and "going" twice,</i><br><i>He's "going" and almost "gone."</i><br><i>But the Master comes, and the foolish crowd</i><br><i>Never can quite understand</i><br><i>The worth of a soul or the change that's wrought</i><br><i>By the touch of the Master's hand.</i><br>[Myra Brooks Welch, "The Touch of the Master's Hand"]<br><br>People can feel that touch through you because that's what you're called to do--to touch the lives of people. The Lord says he'll stand behind his servants. In the first section of the Doctrine and Covenants he says, "What I the Lord have spoken, I have spoken, and I excuse not myself; and though the heavens and the earth pass away, my word shall not pass away, but shall all be fulfilled, whether by mine own voice or by the voice of my servants, it is the same" (D&amp;amp;C 1:38). It is exactly the same. You can speak for the Lord and the Lord will stand behind you because it is his work. It doesn't belong to you, and it doesn't belong to me. This is the work of the Lord. Aren't we privileged to have a part in it? When you put your heart into it, the Lord accepts of your offering. So we don't turn down calls when they come, but we put our hearts into them knowing that we're called to succeed.<br><h2><b>Endure Difficulties of Service</b></h2><br>The third criterion of service in the kingdom, and I guess probably the most important, is that you don't quit when the going gets rough. You may rest assured that the going will get rough. It always does.<br><br><i>Stick to the task 'till it sticks to you,</i><br><i>Beginners are many but enders are few.</i><br><i>Honor, power, place and praise</i><br><i>Will come in time to the one who stays.</i><br><br><i>Stick to the task 'till it sticks to you,</i><br><i>Bend at it, sweat at it, and smile at it too.</i><br><i>For out of the bend, the sweat, and the smile,</i><br><i>Will come life's victory after awhile.</i><br><br>After a while, or always, victory comes when you stick to the task till it sticks to you.<br><br>Don't worry about criticism. If you're going to serve the Lord, you can expect to be criticized. You might as well expect it, because you'll get it anyway. But you can take heart when people criticize you. Just remember that nobody ever kicks a dead dog. Generally, you've got to be up and moving in order to be criticized, but anyway criticism can't hurt you. I like the quote on criticism that Brother George Romney used. (He was somewhat acquainted with criticism and still is.) I think he was quoting Teddy Roosevelt when he said:<br><br><i>It's not the critic that counts--not the man who points out where the strong man stumbles or where the doer of deeds could have done better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena--whose face is marred with dust and sweat and blood, who strives valiantly, who errs, and comes short again and again, who knows the greatest enthusiasms and the greatest devotions and thus spends himself in a worthy cause. And who, at the best, knows in the end the triumph of his accomplishment and who, at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly so that his place can never be with those cold and timid souls who know neither victory nor defeat.</i><br><br>Criticism cannot hurt you. Go on with the work the Lord has given you to do. As Paul says, "If the Lord be with us, who can be against us?" or what difference does it make who is against us? So, we need to bring to pass the work of the Lord regardless of whether it's popular or not. Now, we're very popular today. There's a brand new article in<i>National Geographic</i>that makes us look great. There's a new article in<i>Reader's Digest</i>. We look tremendous. It hasn't always been that way, and it won't always stay that way. So don't get too used to having everybody talk nicely about you. You stick with the Lord and everything will turn out right irrespective of what is said.<br><br>It's also important, with respect to serving the Lord, that you recognize the fact that once you are called there will be a day when you are released. You accept your release the same way you accepted your call. President J. Reuben Clark, Jr., speaking on this subject one time at a general conference, gave us the hallmark of the correct philosophy for service in the kingdom when he said, "In the work of the Lord it's not where you serve but how you serve. In the church and kingdom of God, one takes the position to which one is duly called, which position one neither seeks nor declines," and the release comes the same way.<br><h2><b>Love Your Fellowman</b></h2><br>You are called to serve--to build the kingdom of God on earth. But you'll have to do that through people, so you're going to have to be involved with people. You can't do it by acting like a hermit sitting in a cave someplace. You have to be out where the people are and you have to love these people, because if you don't love them they won't listen to you. But if you do love them, they will listen and let you serve them. You can't turn down love. You have to be awfully good if you're going to love people who not only don't love you, but don't even like you. But that's what is required of us. That's plainly states in Mosiah, which tells you how to becomes so good that you can love people whether you think they deserve it or not, and Mormon says that it's very simple. Speaking of King Benjamin, he says that he was a great teacher, and he was a just man who had established peace in the land of Zarahemla and who had taught the people to keep the commandments of God. Why? "That they might rejoice and be filled with love toward God and all men" (see Mosiah 2:1–4).<br><h2><b>Keep the Commandments</b></h2><br>So the secret of loving your fellowman is just keeping the commandments of God. Keep them precisely and, as you do, you will be filled with a love for your Heavenly Father and for your fellowman. You are really not qualified to serve unless you keep the commandments of God. I pray that you will keep the commandments and that you will seek opportunities to do more than is expected of you. The blessings are still in the second mile. It is vitally important that we go the second mile and love the people whom we're called to serve. With service in the kingdom, since it is the Lord's work, you don't have to worry about payment because the person--<br><i>Who does God's work will get God's pay,</i><br><i>No matter how long may seem the day,</i><br><i>No matter how weary be the way,</i><br><i>He does not pay as others pay</i><br><i>With silk and gold and raiments gay,</i><br><i>But his high wisdom knows a way</i><br><i>And this is sure, that come what may,</i><br><i>Who does God's work will get God's pay.</i><br>[Author unknown, "God's Pay"]<br><br>I bear you my witness, my young brothers and sisters, that that's the best pay you can get in this world. I leave you my testimony that I know that God, our Heavenly Father, lives. I am a witness before God that he does live and that he hears and answers prayers because he has heard and answered mine. I bear witness to you that Jesus is the Christ and that he lives. I know he lives. He has reestablished this, his true church, upon the earth in our own day and time through the great Prophet Joseph Smith. We have a living prophet of God on earth today. President Spencer W. Kimball is the Lord's living prophet, and he makes the decisions here upon earth in the Church and kingdom of God under the direction of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, whose Church this really is. I bear witness that you are a "chosen generation, a royal priesthood, a peculiar people" (see 1 Peter 2:9) who are going to go forth and carry out the motto of Brigham Young University, which<i>is</i>the Lord's university on earth: "Go forth to serve." May you put your hearts into it. I pray that you will and that you'll love it, in Jesus' name. amen.<br><br><i><i>Hartman Rector, Jr., was a member of the First Quorum of the Seventy of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when this devotional address was given at Brigham Young University on 25 March 1975.</i></i><br><br><i>© Intellectual Reserve, Inc.

<h1>al Experience with Christ: Tarry a Little Longer - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I'm delighted with this experience. When I got home tonight, my young son Lawrence said, "Dad, you know The Wizard of Oz is on at six o'clock, The Ten Commandments is on at eight o'clock, and The Greatest Story Ever Told is on Channel 5. You might not have anyone there." I'm grateful you're here. I told one of our great stake presidents here tonight that even more terrifying than speaking in general conference is to address the Church members of the ten stakes here in the Marriott Center.<br><br>&amp;nbsp;<br><br>Well, I'd like to ask you a question as I begin tonight. If you had the great privilege of preparing the message for tonight, what would you talk about? You see, Easter Day is rapidly drawing to a close--another Easter, one after another, through all the years--and again tonight, what would you talk about if this assignment were yours? I've thought about that a great deal for the past six weeks. And I've added note after note to a little file for the BYU ten-stake fireside. Then, as I prepared the talk, I finally threw most of those items out and started all over again. I feel impressed tonight that we must talk about the Savior, hopefully in a way that might be different and a new experience for you and help you to draw closer to him than you've ever been before in your life. This is all I would hope to achieve. I want nothing more than for you to have a spiritual experience tonight with the Savior.<br><h2><b>Adam's Pattern for Life</b></h2><br>May we lead off by talking about Adam. When Adam was driven out of the Garden of Eden, he built an altar and offered sacrifice.<br><br><i>And after many days an angel of the Lord appeared unto Adam, saying: Why dost thou offer sacrifices unto the Lord? And Adam said unto him: I know not, save the Lord commanded me.</i><br><br><i>And then the angel spake saying: This thing is a similitude of the sacrifice of the Only Begotten of the Father, which is full of grace and truth.</i><br><br><i>Wherefore, thou shalt do all that thou doest in the name of the Son, and thou shalt repent and call upon God in the name of the Son forevermore.</i>[Moses 5:6-8]<br><br>I'd like to draw your attention to the formula for living in that one statement: "Wherefore, thou shalt do all that thou doest in the name of the Son." Now what if every single man from Adam on down had patterned his life after that simple formula? What a change in life we'd have here tonight, and what a change in life we'd have across the whole earth. Imagine the benefit and the great blessing. Well, as life would have it, men aren't prone to do those things. But Adam had the formula given to him, lo these many years ago, by an angel of the Lord.<br><h2><b>Enoch's Love and Compassion</b></h2><br>I'm impressed with Enoch. I love to read in the book of Moses. I think, of all the sheer pleasure reading I do, the book of Moses probably impresses me about as much as anything. Enoch, you recall, beheld the heavens weep, and then he beheld God weeping. Then Enoch said:<br><br><i>And Enoch said unto the Lord: How is it that thou canst weep, seeing thou art holy, and from all eternity to all eternity?</i><br><br><i>And were it possible that man could number the particles of the earth, yea, millions of earths like this, it would not be a beginning to the number of thy creations; and thy curtains are stretched out still; and yet thou art there, and thy bosom is there; and also thou art just; thou art merciful and kind forever;</i><br><br><i>And thou hast taken Zion to thine own bosom, from all thy creations, from all eternity to all eternity; and naught but peace, justice, and truth is the habitation of thy throne; and mercy shall go before thy face and have no end; how is it thou canst weep?</i>[Moses 7:29–31]<br><br>Now I've thought about this scripture and about this Jesus. I've thought that if it were possible to number the particles of the earth, yea millions of earths like this, it would not be a beginning to the number of his creations. You think about that and think about going down on the beach and letting the sand run through your hand all day and only covering a small part of the beach. Think about this Jesus and the multitudes, yea the number, even the myriads of creations made by him. I don't believe we understand even in the smallest degree who this great being and soul is.<br><br>Then, of course, you recall why the Lord said he wept: "Behold these thy brethren; they are the workmanship of mine own hands" (Moses 7:32).<br><br>Then he talked about their wickedness. He then let Enoch have the privilege of seeing all the men who lived on this earth, who ever would live upon this earth, and Enoch wept, "and his heart swelled as wide as eternity" (Moses 7:32). You know, I've had that happen in my life. Not as Enoch did, of course but I've been in meetings and had my heart filled with love and compassion for every living soul on the face of the earth. It is just one of those great blessings that comes. It doesn't come very often, but when it comes I feel as if I couldn't harm, as I believe Joseph F. Smith said, the smallest insect.<br><h2><b>Moses' Humility</b></h2><br>Well, then, let's talk about Jesus in Moses' time. Moses beheld the Savior, and he was in his presence, and then the presence withdrew from him. Moses had the privilege, during that day, of seeing all the myriads of beings who had lived upon the earth, who then lived upon the earth, or who ever would live upon the earth. Then Moses made the great statement, "Now, for this cause I know that man is nothing, which thing I never had supposed" (Moses 1:10). Just think, there are four billion people upon the earth and approximately 3.4 million Latter-day Saints--one for every 1,100 people on the face of the earth. If just the Latter-day Saints knelt down and prayed to a kind and loving Heavenly Father, who with his discernment and his ability can comprehend every single prayer and answer them in his way, then of course we can begin to understand just a little more about his son and our great Savior, and who he is.<br><h2><b>The Faith of the Brother of Jared</b></h2><br>I am impressed as I read in Ether about how Jared, his brother, and their families gathered around the Tower of Babel. You recall the confusion of tongues. Jared asked his brother to kneel down and ask the Lord that their tongues might not be confused, and the blessing was granted to them and their families. Then you recall the great trek they made through the wilderness, and how they finally arrived on the shores of the great waters, and how they built barges. Then Jared told his brother to go back again before the Lord, which the brother of Jared did, and to ask, "how will we have air?" The barges, as you recall, were tight, and the Lord showed him how to have fresh air. Then the brother of Jared said, "I have prepared the vessels for my people, and behold there is no light in them. Behold, O Lord, wilt thou suffer that we shall cross this great water in darkness?" (Ether 2:22).<br><br>And the Lord talked about windows, saying "for behold, ye cannot have windows, for they will be dashed in pieces; ... for ye cannot cross this great deep save I prepare you against the waves of the sea, and the winds which have gone forth, and the floods which shall come" (Ether 2:24–25). So he left the problem with the brother of Jared.<br><br>The brother of Jared went up into the mountain and made sixteen stones, transparent as crystal or glass, and then he brought these molten stones down out of the mountain and laid them before the Lord. Once again he knelt down before the Lord and I guess in the greatest depth and understanding of prayer, he said things to the Lord in his weakness and lack of understanding. "Now behold, O Lord, and do not be angry with thy servant because of his weakness before thee. ... Therefore touch these stones, O Lord, with thy finger, and prepare them that they may shine forth in the darkness" (Ether 3:2, 4). And the Lord reached forth his finger and touched the stones one by one, and they became light. The brother of Jared beheld the finger of the Lord, and he fell to the earth. "And the Lord said unto him: Arise, why hast thou fallen? And he saith unto the Lord: "I saw the finger of the Lord ... I knew not that the Lord had flesh and blood" (Ether 3:7, 8).<br><br>And then the Lord said, "Sawest thou more than this?" (Ether 2:9).<br><br>And the brother of Jared said, "Nay; Lord, show thyself unto me" (Ether 2:10)<br><br>The Lord said, "Because thou knowest these things ye are redeemed from the fall; therefore ye are brought back into my presence" (Ether 2:13). And the Lord showed himself unto the brother of Jared in that hour, and the brother of Jared beheld the Lord and was redeemed from the fall. And the personage with whom he had that experience was Jesus Christ, the Son of God, who was prepared before the foundation of the earth. Now think about this great being, the God of the Old Testament, the God of the brother of Jared, who assisted in the building of the ship, who was there to reach forth his hand and touch each of the stones, who helped the brother of Jared with his great faith and caused the Jaredites to cross the great waters and to become a great and mighty people insomuch that they covered the entire land. We read of the feeling which the brother of Jared must have felt toward him, because the brother of Jared was might in writing, and his writings are mighty.<br><h2><b>Enos' Redemption</b></h2><br>Then let us look down to Enos, the son of a prophet. Jacob, his father, had beheld the Savior. "I have beheld my redeemer," he said. Then Enos, having had these words come into his heart as never before in his life, went out as a young man to hunt beasts in the forests. He wrote:<br><br><i>The words which I had often heard my father speak concerning eternal life, and the joy of the saints, sunk deep into my heart.</i><br><br><i>And my soul hungered; and I kneeled down before my Maker, and I cried unto him in mighty prayer and supplication for mine own soul; and all the day long did I cry unto him; yea, and when the night came did still raise my voice high that it reached the heavens.</i><br><br><i>And there came a voice unto me, saying: Enos, thy sins are forgiven thee, and thou shalt be blessed.</i><br><br><i>And I, Enos, knew that God could not lie; wherefore, my guilt was swept away.</i><br><br><i>And I said: Lord, how is it done?</i><br><br><i>And he said unto me: Because of thy faith in Christ, whom thou hast never before heard nor seen.</i>[Enos 3–8]<br><br>Now because of faith in Christ we can have our guilt swept away. That's an impressive thing. To think that transgression comes into the life of every man--to some in a great degree and to some in a lesser degree. I have had many great privileges, these past three years, of interviewing hundreds and hundreds of people--many prospective missionaries, many who were unworthy, many who sought repentance, some who had repented and some who had not repented. Some to whom I had to say, "No. You're not ready to go on a mission yet." And there were others that I could feel were at total peace with the Spirit and to whom I could say, "Yes. You may go." I have had opportunity to visit with men in high places in the Church who have transgressed and to counsel with them and feel the varying degrees of repentance.<br><br>When you think that each one in this congregation tonight has some great or lesser transgression, and that the Lord our god, even Jesus Christ, has the power to take sin from our hearts--what manner of man is he? What manner of being is this Jesus we worship?<br><h2><b>Alma's Conversion</b></h2><br>Then, of course, we have the great conversion of Alma. His father was a prophet and a just man who had a wayward son. I guess he prayed and fasted that his son might have a spiritual experience. The Lord heard the prayers of the elder Alma. Alma relates this story, about how he and the sons of Mosiah went about seeking to destroy the church of God, to his son Helaman:<br><br><i>Behold, God sent his holy angel to stop us by the way.</i><br><br><i>And behold he spake unto us, as it were the voice of thunder, and the whole earth did tremble beneath our feet; and we all fell to the earth, for the fear of the Lord came upon us.</i><br><br><i>But behold, the voice said unto me: Arise. And I arose and stood up, and beheld the angel.</i><br><br><i>And he said unto me: If thou wilt of thyself be destroyed, seek no more to destroy the church of God.</i><br><br><i>And it came to pass that I fell to the earth; and it was for the space of three days and three nights that I could not open my mouth, neither had I the use of my limbs....</i><br><br><i>But I was racked with eternal torment, for my soul was harrowed up to the great degree and racked with all my sins.</i><br><br><i>Yea, I did remember all my sins and iniquities, for which I was tormented with the pains of hell; yea, I saw that I had rebelled against my God, and that I had not kept his holy commandments.</i><br><br><i>Yea, and I had murdered many of his children, or rather led them away unto destruction; yea, and in fine so great had been my iniquities, that the very thought of coming into the presence of my God did rack my soul with inexpressible horror.</i><br><br><i>Oh, thought I, that I could be banished and become extinct both soul and body, that I might not be brought to stand in the presence of my God, to be judged of my deeds.</i><br><br><i>And now, for three days and three nights was I racked, even with the pains of a damned soul.</i><br><br><i>And it came to pass that as I was thus racked with torment, while I was harrowed up by the memory of my many sins, behold, I remembered also to have heard my father prophesy unto the people concerning the coming of one Jesus Christ, a Son of God, to atone for the sins of the world.</i><br><br><i>Now, as my mind caught hold upon this thought, I cried within my heart: O Jesus, thou Son of God have mercy on me, who am in the gall of bitterness, and am encircled about by the everlasting chains of death.</i><br><br><i>And now, behold, when I thought this, I could remember my pains no more; yea, I was harrowed up by the memory of my sins no more.</i><br><br><i>And oh, what joy, and what marvelous light I did behold; yea, my soul was filled with joy as exceeding as was my pain!</i><br><br><i>Yea, I say unto you, my son, that there could be nothing so exquisite and so bitter as were my pains. Yea, and again I say unto you, my son, that on the other hand, there can be nothing so exquisite and sweet as was my joy.</i><br><br><i>Yea, methought I saw, even as our father Lehi saw, God sitting upon his throne, surrounded with numberless concourses of angels, in the attitude of singing and praising their God; yea, and my soul did long to be there.</i>[Alma 36:6–10, 12–22]<br><br>Someone has said that nighttime demands from the overburdened soul the things which daylight denies. Many of you have sat through the long, dark hours of the night with a lonely, heavy heart, and you know how long a night can be. Think about suffering to the greatest degree for three days and three nights, and then remember one Jesus Christ. Catch hold of this thought, as Alma did when he cried within him. When he did that, the transgression was taken from his heart, his repentance was complete, and joy and light filled his soul.<br><br>Well, again, let's consider the maker and creator of all, who has such power over us that after three days and nights of torment our minds can be released of this terrible burden of sin. I think we must never forget that fact, for every one of us will use this power during our lifetime, to a great or lesser degree.<br><h2><b>The Lamanites' Conversion</b></h2><br>One of the greatest stories in the Book of Mormon, to me, one with which I thrill, is the story of Ammon and King Lamoni, who he converted, as they are on their way to free Ammon's brethren from prison. They meet Lamoni's father, the king over all of the Lamanites. I won't go through all of the details, but finally an arrangement is made whereby Ammon or his representative can teach Lamoni's father, and Aaron is selected. So Aaron meets with the king of all the Lamanites and teaches him all day long, from the beginning to the end, or at least through a great period of gospel history. And the scriptures say:<br><br><i>After Aaron had expounded these things unto him, the king said: What shall I do that I may have this eternal life of which thou hast spoken? Yea, what shall I do that I may be born of God, having this wicked spirit rooted out of my breast, and receive his Spirit, that I may not be cast off at the last day? Behold, said he, I will give up all that I possess, yea, I will forsake my kingdom, that I may receive this great joy.</i><br><br><i>But Aaron said unto him: If thou desirest this thing, if thou will bow down before God, yea, if thou wilt repent of all thy sins, and will bow down before God, and call on his name in faith, believing that ye shall receive, then shalt thou receive the hope which thou desirest.</i><br><br><i>And ... the king did bow down before the Lord, upon his knees; yea, even he did prostrate himself upon the earth, and cried mightily, saying:</i><br><br><i>O God, Aaron hath told me that there is a God; and if there is a god, and if thou art God, wilt thou make thyself known unto me, and I will give away all my sins to know thee, and that I may be raised from the dead, and be saved at the last day.</i>[Alma 22:15–18]<br><br>In the Church we are called upon to do many things, but this king said, "I'll give away my kingdom; I'll forsake all my sins." We have the gospel of Jesus Christ, and yet many of us hang onto our sins--however slight, however devious--some greater and some lesser. We read the kinds of material that we never should read. We think thoughts that a Latter-day Saint never ought to think. We see the kinds of movies that a Latter-day Saint never ought to see, and so these things come into our hearts, and yet we have the truth. If we could just gain the Spirit to the smallest degree that this great king had when he said, "Behold ... I will give up all that I possess, yea, I will forsake my kingdom, that I may receive this great joy." I think we ought to renew our effort in living the gospel. In the New Testament we read, "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life" (John 3:16). And then the verse that we hear President Romney quote so beautifully and then so powerfully relate to it: "And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent" (John 17:3). He said many people talk about knowing God, but do they<i>really</i>know him? Do they<i>really</i>know God?<br><br>Well, we have heard a lot today in different meetings, I am sure, about Easter and the many things that transpired at the garden tomb. I guess one of the most beautiful was when the ten apostles were gathered together, as recorded in Luke: "Jesus himself stood in the midst of them. ... But they were terrified and affrighted, and supposed that they had seen a spirit. And he said unto them, Why are ye troubled? and why do thoughts arise in your hearts? Behold my hands and my feet, that it is I myself: handle me, and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me have" (Luke 24:36-39). Here we see the great God of heaven coming back once again as the resurrected Savior of this world.<br><h2><b>Samuel's Prophecies Fulfilled</b></h2><br>Now I believe that one of the most thrilling stories of all is in the last part of the book of Helaman, when Samuel, the Lamanite prophet, climbs upon the high wall and talks about the signs that were going to take place at the time of Jesus' coming into the world, and the signs at the time of his crucifixion and death. He said, "There shall be one day and a night and a day, as if it were one day and there were no night; ... there shall be many signs and wonders in heaven ... signs of his coming" (Helaman 14:4, 6, 12).<br><br>Then he gave a great discourse and went on to say "But behold, ... in that day that he shall suffer death the sun shall be darkened and refuse to give his light unto you; and also the moon and the stars; and there shall be no light upon the face of this land, even from the time that he shall suffer death, for the space of three days, to the time that he shall rise again from the dead" (Helaman 14:20). He then told of terrible destructions that would take place. All of these things he prophesied, and many of the Nephites believed and sought Nephi and were baptized. Others tried to throw stones at him and shot arrows. But God, I am sure, withheld the arrows, for they could not touch him. Then Samuel, you remember, jumped down from the wall and retreated into his Lamanite country, and there he prophesied. And we hear no more about Samuel the Lamanite.<br><br>Nephi, the son of Helaman, had a son named Nephi. The elder Nephi turned the records, the brass plates, over to his son and went off and was heard of no more. His son now had charge. There was a day set aside by the unbelievers when, if the signs prophesied by Samuel the Lamanite did not take place, all the believers would be put to death. You will recall that Nephi knelt before the Lord and prayed all the day long and finally heard the words of the Savior: "Lift up your head and be of good cheer; for behold, the time is at hand, and on this night shall the sign be given, and on the morrow come I into the world, to show unto the world that I will fulfill all that which I have caused to be spoken by the mouth of my holy prophets" (3 Nephi 1:13). And the sign was given, and "the more part of the people did believe, and were converted unto the Lord" (3 Nephi 1:22).<br><br>It was only for a short period--as oftentimes we go through a troublous period, and then return to our rebellious ways and rationalize, as those people did--until many of them fell back into their evil ways. But the believers continued to look for the promised signs of the Savior's crucifixion. In the thirty-fourth year, on the first month and the fourth day, a great storm arose, as had never been seen before in the Land, a tempest beyond anything they had known. As this tempest rose, there were also whirlwinds and earthquakes which caused great destruction and covered many cities. People were buried, and many were burned, Solid masses of rock were in seams and fragments, and there become new high places and new low places. It is recorded in 3 Nephi 8 that sixteen cities were burned or buried in the depths of the sea. Then after this terrible destruction that lasted for about three hours, you recall that a darkness settled upon the land.<br><br>It was so dark that even the finest of kindling could not be lighted. No candle or torch could be lighted which would penetrate the darkness.<br><h2><b>The Savior's Appearance to the Nephites</b></h2><br>Then the words of Jesus Christ came out of the heavens declaring the extent of the destruction. He said, "Behold the city of Zarahemla have I caused to be burned, and the city of Moroni have I buried in the depths of the sea, and the city of Moronihah have I caused to be buried and in its place is a high mountain." He went on to list all the destructions that had taken place. Then he was quiet for a period of time, and the people were quiet. Then again the voice came back and declared many more things.<br><br>On the fourth morning the sun came up, and great changes had taken place across the land (see 3 Nephi 9). Approximately six weeks later, according to James E. Talmage's<i>Jesus the Christ</i>, the saints were gathered around the temple in the land which is called Bountiful. They talked about Jesus and the great change that had taken place in the land, and suddenly they heard a voice out of the heavens saying, "Behold my Beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased, in whom I have glorified my name--hear ye him" (3 Nephi 11:7).<br><br>As they looked from whence the voice came, they saw a man descending out of heaven in their midst, and they thought it was an angel. As he descended he said, "Behold, I am Jesus Christ, whom the prophets testified shall come into the world ... and I have drunk out of that bitter cup which the Father hath given me" (3 Nephi 11:10, 11). Then he commanded that every person there--about 2,500--come forth and feel the prints in his hands and in his side, so each would have an absolute witness and testimony that this was Jesus the Christ. Then they all fell at the feet of Jesus and worshiped him.<br><br>This next thing is thrilling to me. The Lord commanded that Nephi should come forth--2,500 people, and he selects one man to come forth. And Nephi came forth and bowed and kissed the feet of the Savior. And you will recall he then called others forth, and they were given power. And Jesus taught them many things. Let me refer to the fifth chapter of Matthew and the Sermon on the Mount. He taught these same things, only in a much fuller degree, to the Nephites, and he gives them in 3 Nephi, chapters 12 and 13.<br><br>And in chapter 15 he says, "And verily I say unto you, that ye are they of whom I said: Other sheep I have which are not of this fold: them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one fold, and one shepherd" (3 Nephi 15:21). He told them other things. And finally the compassionate, sweet, loving Jesus, whom I adore, said:<br><br><i>I perceive that ye are weak, that ye cannot understand all my words which I am commanded of the Father to speak unto you at this time.</i><br><br><i>Therefore, go ye unto your homes, and ponder upon the things which I have said, and ask of the Father, in my name, that ye may understand, and prepare your minds for the morrow, and I come unto you again.</i><br><br><i>But now I go unto the Father, and also to show myself unto the lost tribes of Israel, for they are not lost unto the Father, for he knoweth whither he hath taken them.</i><br><br><i>And it came to pass that when Jesus had thus spoken, he cast his eyes round about again on the multitude, and beheld they were in tears, and did look steadfastly upon him as if they would ask him to tarry a little longer with them.</i><br><br><i>And he said unto them: Behold, my bowels are filled with compassion towards you.</i><br><br><i>Have ye any that are sick among you? Bring them hither. Have ye any that are lame, or blind, or halt, or maimed, or leprous, or that are withered, or that are deaf, or that are afflicted in any manner? Bring them hither and I will heal them, for I have compassion upon you; my bowels are filled with mercy.</i><br><br><i>For I perceive that ye desire that I should show unto you what I have done unto your brethren at Jerusalem, for I see that your faith is sufficient that I should heal you.</i><br><br><i>And it came to pass that when he had thus spoken, all the multitude, with one accord, did go forth with their sick and their afflicted, and their lame, and with their blind, and with their dumb, and with all them that were afflicted in any manner; and he did heal them every one as they were brought forth unto him.</i><br><br><i>And they did all, both they who had been healed and they who were whole, bow down at his feet, and did worship him; and as many as could come for the multitude did kiss his feet, insomuch that they did bathe his feet with their tears.</i><br><br><i>And it came to pass that he commanded that their little children should be brought.</i><br><br><i>So they brought their little children and set them down upon the ground round about him, and Jesus stood in the midst; and the multitude gave way till they had all been brought unto him.</i><br><br><i>And it came to pass that when they had all been brought, and Jesus stood in the midst, he commanded the multitude that they should kneel down upon the ground....</i><br><br><i>And after this manner do they bear record: The eye hath never seen, neither hath the ear heard, before, so great and marvelous things as we saw and heard Jesus speak unto the Father;</i><br><br><i>And no tongue can speak, neither can there be written by any man, neither can the hearts of men conceive so great and marvelous things as we both saw and heard Jesus speak; and no one can conceive of the joy which filled our souls at the time we heard him pray for us unto the Father.</i><br><br><i>And it came to pass that when Jesus had made an end of praying unto the Father, he arose; but so great was the joy of the multitude that they were overcome.</i><br><br><i>And it came to pass that Jesus spake unto them, and bade them arise.</i><br><br><i>And they arose from the earth, and he said unto them: Blessed are ye because of your faith. And now behold, my joy is full.</i><br><br><i>And when he had said these words, he wept, and the multitude bare record of it, and he took their little children, one by one, and blessed them, and prayed unto the Father for them.</i><br><br><i>And when he had done this he wept again;</i><br><br><i>And he spake unto the multitude, and said unto them:</i><br><br><i>Behold your little ones.</i><br><br><i>And as they looked to behold they cast their eyes towards heaven, and they saw the heavens open, and they saw angels descending out of heaven as it were in the midst of fire; and they came down and encircled those little ones about with fire; and the angels did minister unto them.</i><br><br><i>And the multitude did see and hear and bear record; and they know that their record is true for they all of them did see and hear, every man for himself; and they were in number about two thousand and five hundred souls; and they did consist of men, women, and children.</i>[3 Nephi 17:2–13, 16–25]<br><h2><b>Joseph Smith's Revelation</b></h2><br>Finally, in this last day, the Prophet Joseph said:<br><br><i>However, it was nevertheless a fact that I had beheld a vision. I have thought since, that I felt much like Paul, when he made his defense before King Agrippa, and related the account of the vision he had when he saw a light, and heard a voice; but still there were but few who believed him; some said he was dishonest, others said he was mad; and he was ridiculed and reviled. But all this did not destroy the reality of his vision... all the persecution under heaven could not make it otherwise; and though they should persecute him unto death, yet he knew, and would know to his latest breath, that he had both seen a light and heard a voice....</i><br><br><i>So it was with me. I had actually seen a light, and in the midst of that light I saw two Personages, and they did in reality speak to me; ... and while they were persecuting me, reviling me, and speaking all manner of evil against me falsely for so saying, I was led to say in my heart: Why persecute me for telling the truth? I have actually seen a vision; and who am I that I can withstand God, or why does the world think to make me deny what I have actually seen? For I had seen a vision: I knew it, and I knew that God knew it, and I could not deny it, neither dared I do it; at least I knew that by so doing I would offend God, and come under condemnation.</i>[Joseph Smith 2:24, 25]<br><br>To me that is so thrilling. I was there. I knew the Prophet Joseph had those experiences. It isn't hard for me to believe, without one particle of doubt, that the Prophet Joseph Smith saw our Heavenly Father and his Son Jesus Christ, and that this great God referred Joseph Smith to Jesus Christ. "<i>This is My Beloved Son. Hear Him</i>!" (Joseph Smith 2:17). I would think, as President Kimball said, that if all we could tell the world was the Joseph Smith story, we could convert the world. We have so much to offer in this Church.<br><br>We have those in the Church who think if they only could understand more about the Adam-God theory--or they ask if Jesus Christ was married. You know, what a great thing it is if we understand what faith is. What is faith? How does it work? Do you have total faith? When we come to a full and total understanding of faith, then I think we ought to move on to repentance. When we understand that totally, then we should move through the principles. But I doubt we will ever really get through an understanding and complete knowledge of faith in a lifetime. I don't care how intellectual you are, or how long you study, I doubt you will ever come to an end of the study of faith, the first principle of the gospel. The gospel is so simple that a fool will not err therein, but it is so beautiful and so sophisticated that I believe the great intellectual can make a study of faith and never come to an end of understanding.<br><h2>Our Experience with the Savior</h2><br>I think, in our day, section 45 of the Doctrine and Covenants thrills me because it talks about the Redeemer. The Lord says:<br><br><i>Hearken, O ye people of my church, to whom the kingdom has been given; hearken ye and give ear to him who laid the foundation of the earth, who made the heavens and all the hosts thereof, and by whom all things were made which live, and move, and have a being.</i><br><br><i>And again I say, hearken unto my voice, lest death shall overtake you; in an hour when ye think not the summer shall be past, and the harvest ended, and your souls not saved.</i><br><br><i>Listen to him who is the advocate with the Father, who is pleading your cause before him.</i><br><br><i>Saying: Father, behold the sufferings and death of him who did no sin, in whom thou wast well pleased; behold the blood of thy Son which was shed, the blood of him whom thou gavest that thyself might be glorified;</i><br><br><i>Wherefore, Father, spare these my brethren that believe on my name, that they may come unto me and have everlasting life.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 45:1–5]<br><br>Would you think of anyone you'd rather have as an advocate than our beloved Savior?<br><br>Finally, in the most glorious testimony of all, Sidney Rigdon and Joseph Smith had this great experience open to them. They said:<br><br><i>And now, after the many testimonies which have been given of him, this is the testimony, last of all, which we give of him: That he lives!</i><br><br><i>For we saw him, even on the right hand of God; and we heard the voice bearing record that he is the Only Begotten of the Father--</i><br><br><i>That by him, and through him, and of him, the world are and were created, and the inhabitants thereof are begotten sons and daughters unto God.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 76:22–24]<br><br>I bear my solemn witness to you tonight that I know he is the Lord of Lords, the God of heaven and earth, the great "I AM"--God. I know that he is my Redeemer, Emmanuel. I know that he is the lover of my soul, the great Atoner, and I know that he is my beloved Savior.<br><br>I pray that each one of us might be nearer to him tonight, nearer and dearer to him than we've ever been, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Vaughn J. Featherstone was second counselor in the Presiding Bishopric of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when this fireside address was given at Brigham Young University on 30 March 1975.</i></i><br><br><i>© Intellectual Reserve, Inc.

Social anthropologists study people in those parts of the world that have not yet experienced the full consequence of the industrial revolution. These people still derive a large part of their living from the food they grow themselves, from the animals they herd, or from their hunting and gathering activities. They expect the place where they were born to be their permanent home, and they rely on the cooperation of kinsmen and neighbors (the two are often synonymous) to accomplish the necessary tasks and goals of their lives.<br><br>One might ask why a serious scholar should study these people. A number of answers can be given to this question, one of which is that one cannot look critically at his own society or even understand it until he has seen something that is very different. The novelist Somerset Maugham remarked that he only began to understand the English after he had traveled to other parts of the world (Mair, L.P., 1974:2).<br><br>For the anthropologist who spends several years with a nonindustrial people, living in close rapport with the basic conditions of human existence--an experience that has not been possible in the Western world for many generations--modern society takes on a new light. He comes to an appreciation of the institutions of his own society that is not possible otherwise. It is in this interest that I now want to examine certain aspects of kinship and religion in both nonindustrial and industrial societies.<br><h2><b>Kinship in Nonindustrial Societies</b></h2><br>It is a characteristic of nearly all nonindustrial tribal societies that their social orders are based on kinship. This means that the vital activities of life involve the cooperation of kinsmen. Sustenance is provided through a division of labor between the sexes, the young men of the group are its defense, the elders its law and government, and its ancestors are its gods and the custodians of the moral order among the living. Thus, all these vital activities are embedded, as it were, in a network of kinship relations.<br><br>The system of kinship terms used in such societies as these is wholly unlike our own and reflects the binding ties that are characteristic of this kind of social life. One calls not only his mother<i>mother</i>, but also the term is applied to all her sisters. Not only is one's father<i>father</i>, but his brothers also. Consistent with this usage, the children of all these "mothers" and "fathers" are called<i>brother</i>and<i>sister</i>. Society becomes the family write large.<br><br>Societies based on kinship usually seem very restrictive to people in the modern world; yet they have their advantages in the form of emotional and social security. For example, if when a child is born its mother does not lactate or if she should die, the child has a jural right to be nurtured and cared for by one of the other women he calls mother. This is the kinship society's version of an orphanage.<br><br>Several years ago a Navajo friend told me that, when he was a young boy, his grandmother took him to her and said, "My eyes have become your eyes, and my hands have become your hands." My friend said that what she meant by this was that since she had gotten old and was no longer capable of seeing and doing with eyes and hands what she had been wont to do, all would be well because the eyes and hands she had given him would now work for her. Think of the peace and security that must crown the heart of an old person in this arrangement.<br><br>Kinship means kindness. In fact, the German word for child--<i>kind</i>--and<i>kind</i>,<i>kindness</i>, and<i>kin</i>all have the same generic root. To be without kinsmen in nonindustrial societies is the equivalent of being a man without a country. A most effective punishment among the Cheyenne Indians was banishment. Such a sentence in many cases was equivalent to a consignment to death. Life was nearly impossible without the sustaining influence of kinsmen.<br><h2><b>Contracts in Industrial Societies</b></h2><br>What happens to such societies when the transformation from nonindustrial to industrial occurs? Sir Henry Maine, the eminent British jurisprudent, long ago noted that in the course of history there had been a shift from kinship to contract as the cooperative basis of society (Maine, 1861:172–74; 183–85). Social anthropologists have since observed that this shift is concomitant with the transformation from nonindustrial to industrial; that is, industrialism is associated with a type of society based not on kinship, but rather on contract.<br><br>As this change occurs, the vital activities of life are separated from their basis in kinship relations and are performed instead by business firms. Now, rather than cooperate as groups of kinsmen, individuals contract with business firms to perform a task for a money wage, which is used in turn to purchase subsistence contractually from other firms.<br><br>Contractual relations, whether of necessity or not, generally have been individualizing and isolating in their social impact. The interests of the contracting agents in each other are of an economic and legal nature rather than social or moral. They are goal oriented and of short duration. When the end for which the contract was entered into is achieved, the relationship is usually terminated. Such relations are outside the family and are unmodified by personal acquaintance.<br><br>The family in any society moves through a cycle of development. In industrial societies a new family is begun with each marriage. It expands as children are born to the union. With the maturation of the children, a dispersion process occurs with which we are all familiar. As sons and daughters acquire professional and technical competence and marry, they enter into their own contractual arrangements with firms and institutions, which may send them to different parts of the country or even of the world. Parents are thus often isolated, and children born to the new marriages are commonly raised with little or no contact with their kin.<br><br>As Jules Henry notes, the majority of people in industrial societies have little or no personal or social involvement in the organization for which they work (Henry, 1963:28–29). Work more often than not sunders rather than integrates important personal relationships. For this reason, work in industrial societies lacks human meaning. These impersonal circumstances necessitate that each individual build for himself his own social universe, and the great mobility of our population may require that this be done numerous times during one's lifetime (Henry, 1963:147–48). Kinship, on the other hand, is forever. The social universe based on kinship remains intact and provides a large measure of security to the individual, whereas a social universe based on contractual relations is often temporary and provisional. It fosters insecurity.<br><br>Reflect for a moment on the child entering school for the first time in a large urban or suburban area. He may never before have seen most of his classmates. If he is a sensitive child, he may be filled with anxieties. Sometimes these pupils are labeled hyperactives and present a problem in the classroom. Our technological genius has come to our rescue in this matter. I have what appear to be reliable statistics that indicate that in the city of Omaha, Nebraska, between 5 and 10 percent of the 62,000 school children are on behavior modification drugs (H. Lennard et al., 1972:31–32; 110–17). It is reported that this is only part of a national pattern for coping with hyperactive children. How is the nation to solve its drug problem when the individual's first encounter with drugs is medicated by his teacher?<br><br>Young people in junior high and high school, and to a lesser degree in college and the university, manifest the effects of our impersonal social structure. It has been noted that young girls especially, since their activities generally do not require as great a number of participants, often feel left out (Henry, 1963: chapters 6 and 7). Much of their behavior reflects fear and anxiety about isolation. They strive for popularity. This often takes the form of extremes of dress and makeup. Gossip among these young people is virulent and vicious as they vie with each other for position. If a girl can become popular, this seems to assure her of a stable social position. The schools oblige in the quest, and we have queens selected for as many occasions as can be imagined and cheerleaders by the score for every class. One wonders sometimes how there can be any energy left over for academic pursuits.<br><br>I have one more example of the isolating tendency of industrial societies. I alluded earlier to the fact that children when they mature and marry are often drawn into employment with firms at great distances from the home in which they grew up. This leaves the parents to grow old alone, an anxious and fearful thing for many older people to contemplate, especially when one of the pair dies. In contrast to the Navajo grandmother who lived out her later years in the kind security of relationships with her own offspring, old people in industrial societies are to an ever-increasing extent living out their last years in the contractual setting of a rest home.<br><br>One wonders also to what extend the drug problem and the high rates of crime, suicide, and alcoholism in industrial societies have a correlate in the impersonality and fragmentation of relationships. Could Malachi have had in mind these conditions when he said that, unless the heart of the fathers is turned to the children and the heart of the children to the fathers, the earth should be smitten with a curse (Malachi 4:5–6)?<br><br>I have reflected here more on the adverse aspects of this comparison of industrial and nonindustrial societies. And even with this adversity not many of us would exchange the personal freedom, the possibility of movement, the great variety of experience, and the flood of subsistence and luxury goods that industrial society provides for the more restricted life in the nonindustrial societies. Yet it is a sobering experience to see the high price we pay in human values for the way of life we cherish.<br><h2><b>The Secularization of Human Experience</b></h2><br>In the remaining minutes I want to explore a further transformation that, I feel, accompanies the shift from nonindustrial to industrial and from kinship to contract. This is a transformation from a condition in which life, the world, and the whole human experience are deemed to be sacred, to a circumstance in which life becomes desacralized, secularized, and profane.<br><br>In most nonindustrial societies, closely structured on a kinship foundation, the vital activities of life occur within sacred parameters. This does not mean that all tribal people are about to join Enoch in his city, but only that they believe that the earth was created by a god and that he was the giver of their law and social order. Many peoples feel that in very ancient times their forefathers dwelt in close proximity to God and that by some unwitting act they became separated from him. They attribute to this separation nearly all the ills that flesh is heir to, and they feel that peace, joy, and prosperity can only come when earth and heaven (human action and the ways of the divine) are brought back into proximity (see Lienhardt, 1961).<br><br>Victor Turner has observed that nearly all nonindustrial peoples have occasions or periods of timeless time in which they seek through some form of rite or ceremony to transcend the arbitrary man-made world of things and connect their institutions, relationships, and customary usages and laws to a transcendental realm (Turner, 1968:1–24). It is as though they felt that human actions were intrinsically meaningless and that they became meaningful only insofar as they unfolded according to a divine pattern.<br><br>In the words of Micea Eliade, the great professor of comparative religion at the University of Chicago, nonindustrial man wants to be other than he finds himself, and he undertakes to make himself over in accordance with ideal images that are revealed in myths and rituals. The sacred festivals so important in this connection reenact the whole cosmogony--that is, the creation of the earth, man, plants, and animals. They dramatize how it all came to be. To participate in these festivals is to become contemporary with the original creative event and to dwell for a period in the presence of the creator. The sacred dimensions of existence are thus recorded in ceremonial performance. The ceremonies are repeated again and again, and this repetition aids man in his endeavor to conform his life to the divine ideal. One learns how the gods created man, taught him appropriate social behavior and procedures for work, and provided him with sacred or divine models for all of the important activities of life. Houses, for example, are commonly constructed on a model of the universe. Canoes are built, fields are laid out, and crops are planted, harvested, and even consumed according to the work and order of the gods. In this manner there is established a cosmic identity and value for man and his actions (Eliade, 1954: 1–73; 1959: 20–213).<br><br>Godfrey and Monica Wilson (1945: 79–80) suggest that religion is a putative participation of man in reality. Though peoples may conceptualize reality differently, they seek always through some means to participate in their version of it. These means, by Wilson's definition, are their religions. The reality in which Western man seeks to participate has--from the Renaissance through the Enlightenment, from the Scientific and Industrial Revolutions to modern industrial society--become a progressively more materialistic "reality." The philosopher George Santayana observed that<br><br><i>No opposition could be more radical and complete than that between the Renaissance and the anti-worldly religion of the gospel. To say that Christianity survives, even if weakened or disestablished, is to say that the Renaissance and the Revolution are still incomplete--have not yet run their course.</i>[Santayana, 1957: 37–38]<br><br>Almost all of the prominent literary figures of eighteenth- and nineteenth-century Europe were concerned with this materialization and secularization of life, and T.S. Eliot is so far perhaps the most profound and articulate spokesman to write about this transformation in the twentieth century.<br><br>What social anthropologists have to add to the observations of the great men of literature is that secularization or the profanation of life is a product of a definable social experience--the product of a type of social structure. Just as the demise of kinship and the fragmentation of life have followed industrialization and the wide-scale use of the principle of contract, so secularization appears to attend the fragmentation.<br><br>Mary Douglas of the University of London feels that secularism in middle-class European and American communities is a predictable result of a process of socialization in which the child never internalizes well-defined social statuses and never experiences the need to defer to and respect consistent and well-defined authority (Douglas, 1970:33). Another way of putting this is that honoring father and mother may be a first and necessary step to a viable faith in God. It appears that the life of the spirit tends to flourish in a closely structured, well-ordered, and well-defined social milieu. Conversely, isolation and fragmentation in social life sound the death knell of the spirit.<br><br>This condition was summarized by Walter Lippman in 1929.<br><br>He wrote:<br><br><i>These are the prisoners who have been released. They ought to be happy. They ought to be serene and composed. They are free to make their own lives. There are no conventions, no taboos, no gods, priests, princes, fathers or revelations which they must accept. Yet the result is not as good as they thought it would be. The prison door is wide open. They stagger out into trackless space under a blinding sun.</i>[Lippman, 1929:7]<br><br>Thomas Mann (1942) wrote of Abraham that he feared lest he should fall away from the covenant and become lost in matter. The covenant for him was the connecting link with the divine order, the center that held all things together. It appears that industrial man has let go his hold on the center, choosing rather to make his own way. He lacks a foundation for involving himself in significant experience. In the words of T.S. Eliot, "These are the decent, Godless people, their only monument the asphalt road and a thousand lost golf balls" (Eliot, 1956:103).<br><br>For modern man there are no universal paradigms that centralize and order the human experience, that define for men generally their relationship to each other, to the earth, and to God. Therefore, we lack ties of sympathy and fellowship one to another. The closer we squeeze together in our cities and towns, the less we know each other and ourselves. We are lonely, lonely with the loneliness that comes from the need to discover for ourselves, without the aid of culture and society, the meaning of life.<br><br>Further, there is a death of common meanings among modern men. Even science, which has been the dominant dispensation of our times, has not succeeded in alleviating this circumstance. According to Max Planck, there is scarcely a scientific proposition that is not questioned by somebody (see Scott, 1960).<br><br>There has been a collapse of genuine certainty about almost everything in the human experience. One experience seems to be as important as another. When everything is of equal value, then basic value can be assigned to nothing. We can establish guilt, but in our individuated state and the individuated state of our judges, we find it difficult to allocate responsibility. Right and wrong have come to be decided in terms of the most efficient adjustment to the environment.<br><br>Having been taken out of their sacred context, the earth, man, and his body, with its capacities for involvement in creative processes, are no longer features of a divine order. It was, I believe, these conditions that led a sensitive soul like Friedrich Nietzsche to exclaim, "Where is my home? For it do I ask and seek, and have sought, but have not found it. O eternal everywhere, O eternal nowhere, O eternal in vain" (Nietzsche/Kaufmann, 1954:386).<br><br>In 1831 Joseph Smith received this characterization of our times from the Lord:<br><br><i>For they have strayed from mine ordinances, and have broken mine everlasting covenant;</i><br><br><i>They seek not the Lord to establish his righteousness, but every man walketh in his own way, and after the image of his own God, whose image is in the likeness of the world, and whose substance is that of an idol, which waxeth old and shall perish in Babylon, even Babylon the great, which shall fall.</i><br><br><i>Wherefore, I the Lord, knowing the calamity which should come upon the inhabitants of the earth, called upon my servant Joseph Smith, Jun., and spake unto him from heaven, and gave him commandments. . .</i><br><br><i>. . . that man should not counsel his fellow man, neither trust in the arm of flesh--</i><br><br><i>But that every man might speak in the name of God the Lord, even the Savior of the world;</i><br><br><i>That faith also might increase in the earth;</i><br><br><i>That mine everlasting covenant might be established;</i><br><br><i>That the fulness of my gospel might by proclaimed by the weak and the simple unto the ends of the world, and before kings and rulers.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 1: 15–17, 19–23]<br><br>The efficacy of the ordinances mentioned in this statement springs from the fact that they represent eternal realities--the order of heaven. It is in them that the knowledge and power of godliness are manifest to men on earth. They facilitate for man access to these realities and thereby provide divine and sacred paradigms around which man can pattern his life. In the temple there is scarcely a relationship for which a model is not provided--relationships with God, with the earth and its whole web of life, between husband and wife, between parents and children, between siblings, and among men generally. These models or patterns allow us to see the earth, ourselves, and our bodies, with their marvelous creative capacities, as part of a divine order of things transcending the arbitrariness and transcience of human arrangements. They allow man to become discretionary about his experiences and to mobilize his capacities with genuine conviction. They also facilitate a sense of community not available otherwise.<br><br>However, to make the ordinances viable in our own lives, we must start with reintegrating and extending our kinship ties. There is something sacred about kinship, as most social anthropologists who have studies its operation in the field are prepared to admit. Joseph Smith told us that it is the very foundation of the celestial order (see E. D. Parry, 1913: 30–32). It was no accident that genealogy should have been given such an important place in the Restoration. Yet we must learn that genealogy--kinship--is not restricted to a concern with the dead. The ancestors, always and everywhere, symbolize and hallow ideal relations among the living.<br><br><em>Merlin G.

<h1>uit of Truth - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Thank you, President Oaks. I am pleased to be here this morning, my brothers and sisters. I have great regard and respect for Brigham Young University. My two daughters were graduates of this great institution. Now, to look upon and be in the presence of this gathering this morning enlivens my soul. For to behold such gives me a feeling of stability of the present and a promise of the future because you have declared your position by enrolling in this institution after knowing what high standards are expected of you.<br><h2><b>Only Man Seeks Truth</b></h2><br>This University seems to have a motto, "The world is our campus," which gives the impression that its scope in the field of education is limitless and visionary. When we ponder that statement, we contemplate a spiritual thrust in a great big world. The term<i>big</i>, of course is only relative. Someone has observed and asked this thoughtful question: "If the galaxy is but a speck in the universe, and the sun but a speck in the galaxy, what then is the earth, and what is man?" we are crushed by our insignificance. I suppose of all God's creations, only man, with his high degree of intelligence, is capable of making that observation.<br><br>Man alone wonders what he is and what his place and purpose are on earth. He wonders how he fits into the scheme of things. He searches and researches but only goes so far, and then he arrives at the point of mystery and discovers that beyond that there lie other mysteries. I think of the words of John Milton in<i>Paradise Lost</i>:<br><br><i>To ask or search I blame thee not; for Heav'n</i><br><i>Is as the book of God before thee set,</i><br><i>Wherein to read his wondrous works, and learn</i><br><i>His seasons, hours, or days, or months, or years.</i><br><i>This to attain, whether Heav'n move or Earth,</i><br><i>Imports not, if thou reckon right: the rest</i><br><i>From Man or Angel the Great Architect,</i><br><i>Did wisely to conceal, and not divulge</i><br><i>His secrets, to be scann'd by them who ought</i><br><i>Rather admire: or if they list to try</i><br><i>Conjecture, he his fabric of the Heav'ns</i><br><i>Hath left to their disputes, perhaps to move</i><br><i>His laughter at their quaint opinions wide</i><br><i>Hereafter, when they come to model Heav'n</i><br><i>And calculate the stars.</i><br>[Book 8:66–80]<br><br>There seems to be an independence in the nature of man, as conveyed in this thought of Gottfried Emerson Lessing: "If the Lord held out to me in his right hand the whole truth, and in his left hand only the urge to seek truth, I would reach for his left hand." Perhaps that is as it should be if man in his urge to seek truth would not shut out God; for when he does, he stands alone. Man standing alone looks upon himself, and through his own research of his makeup, he has defined himself as an organized set of 100 trillion cells, each of which has an individual program integrated into a coordinated program of the whole. Or, as another has said, "I am a little world made cunningly of the elements."<br><br>But where does man's research go from there? He seems to analyze the physical nature very well, but he is lost as to his ultimate destiny. There is, of course, danger in such a course, researched wholly from a scientific or biological viewpoint. And I say danger advisedly, to the extent that the real purpose of man's creation and his identity as an external being is lost. I say this because I once heard a professor say to me that he had difficulty in maintaining his testimony because he knew too much, indicating that he had some conflict between his intellectual genius and his spiritual nature. Perhaps this is what J. Golden Kimball referred to when he said, "They are educated beyond their intelligence."<br><br>Fortunately, I know that that professor weathered the storm in his soul. He is now a patriarch and could not function in that office without a strong spiritual conviction. But we must always remember the possibility of being caught up so much in the academic to the point where it might obliterate the reality of God. We have a charge from our Heavenly Father, which is, "And as all have not faith, seek ye diligently and teach one another words of wisdom; yea, seek ye out of the best books words of wisdom; seek learning, even by study and also by faith" (D&amp;amp;C 88:118).<br><br>You can well understand why God inspired Brigham Young when Karl G. Maeser came to him and said, "I am about to leave for Provo, Brother Young, to start my work in the Academy. Have you any instructions to give me?"<br><br>The President looked ahead steadily for a few moments as though in deep thought and then said, "Brother Maeser, I want you to remember that you ought not to teach even the alphabet or the multiplication tables without the Spirit of God. That is all. God bless you."<br><br>Fortunately, that basic instruction has been maintained at all Church educational facilities. For to teach the whole world of knowledge and to cause one to lose the true meaning of life would defeat the whole purpose of our educational program.<br><h2><b>Temporal and Spiritual Truth Must Be Related</b></h2><br>In the urge of seeking truth we need to recognize that we must relate the temporal with the spiritual. Man can make his conjectures, he can make his calculations, he can form opinions about who he is and his origin, but he will never learn the truth of the matter until he recognizes his Creator. Moses received a significant lesson about the nature of man when he was introduced to a visionary experience as he was called of the Lord. The Lord spoke to him and said:<br><br><i>I have a work for thee, Moses, my son; and thou art in the similitude of mine Only Begotten; and mine Only Begotten is and shall be the Savior, for he is full of grace and truth; but there is no God beside me, and all things are present with me, for I know them all.</i><br><br><i>And now, behold, this one thing I show thee, Moses, my son; for thou art in the world. . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . Moses looked, and beheld the world upon which he was created; and Moses beheld the world and the ends thereof, and all the children of men which are, and which were created; of the same he greatly marveled and wondered. . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . Moses cast his eyes and beheld the earth, yea, even all of it; and there was not a particle of it which he did not behold, discerning it by the spirit of God.</i><br><br><i>And he beheld also the inhabitants thereof, and . . . their numbers were great, even numberless as the sand upon the sea shore. . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . Moses called upon God, saying: Tell me, I pray thee, why these things are so, and by what thou madest them?</i><br><br><i>. . . And the Lord God said unto Moses, For mine own purpose have I made these things. Here is wisdom and it remaineth in me.</i><br><br><i>And by the word of my power, have I created them, which is mine Only Begotten Son, who is full of grace and truth.</i><br><br><i>And worlds without number have I created. . . .</i><br><br><i>But only an account of this earth, and the inhabitants thereof, give I unto you.</i>[Moses 1:6–8, 27–28, 30–33, 35]<br><br>The Lord then followed by stating his purpose, which was, "For behold, this is my work and my glory--to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man" (Moses 1:39).<br><br>Moses, no doubt, was overwhelmed from this experience of witnessing the majesty of God and his creations. Moses saw God in all his glory and yet heard him say, "I have a work for thee, Moses, my son; and thou art in the similitude of mine Only Begotten" (Moses 1:6). Moses, knowing all this, said, "I know that man is nothing" (Moses 1:10). This statement would not have come from lack of self-esteem, for it was revealed to Moses that man was the center and purpose of all.<br><br>While man standing alone may get the feeling of insignificance by the magnitude of the physical aspects of his surroundings, he must never consider himself being crushed into a nobody. He is a creation of God, in the similitude of the Only Begotten. We need to read his words. We need to study the scriptures, for all scripture is given by inspiration of God and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness, that the man or woman of God may be perfect and thoroughly furnished unto all good works (see 2 Timothy 3:14–17). We need to hear the word of God. We need to learn to believe.<br><br>Someone has said the world is dying from want, not of good preaching, but of good hearing. I presume the author of that thought did not mean to discredit preaching, but rather to emphasize the need to listen to the ideas and instructions given that we might believe to the extent that such ideas would germinate within us and move us to proper action.<br><h2><b>Knowledge Must Be Followed by Obedience</b></h2><br>The apostle Paul said this:<br><br><i>For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.</i><br><br><i>How then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed? and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard? and how shall they hear without a preacher?</i><br><br><i>And how shall they preach, except they be sent? as it is written, How beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace, and bring glad tidings of good things!</i>[Romans 10:13–15]<br><br>But even after they have heard, they have not all obeyed the gospel. Isaiah said to the Lord, "Who hath believed our report?" (Isaiah 53:1). So then faith comes by hearing the word of God, but it must be followed by obedience.<br><br>As to preaching, I know of no people who receive better-quality preaching than that which is given to us by the prophets. This type of preaching is called for in Paul's epistle to Timothy:<br><br><i>Preach the word . . . exhort with all longsuffering and doctrine.</i><br><br><i>For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers, having itching ears;</i><br><br><i>And they shall turn away their ears from the truth, and shall be turned unto fables.</i>[2 Timothy 4:2–4]<br><br>There has been no change in the need of this instruction. We need the same instruction today because of the same conditions prevailing in the modern world. I would like to suggest that you read the messages of the prophets as given during the general conference of this current month. The soundness of the doctrine is unquestionable and, if followed by those who hear, will do much to stem the tide of dwindling in unbelief so apparent in the world. May we be reminded. The object of preaching is to constantly remind mankind of what they are constantly forgetting. Preaching is not to supply the defects of human intelligence, but to fortify the feebleness of human resolution and to recall mankind from the bypath where they turn and to bring them into that narrow path of salvation which all know but few tread.<br><br>Paul called attention to the need of preaching and, more importantly, to the result of believing. Belief is a key to salvation. We declare in the fourth Article of Faith: "We believe that the first principles of the gospel are: first, faith in the Lord Jesus Christ; second, repentance; third, baptism by immersion for the remission of sins; and fourth, laying on of hands for the gift of the Holy Ghost." I take the view that faith and belief are synonymous because in some foreign languages, one with which I am familiar, the two terms are used in only one form.<br><br>An event in the life of Jesus supports the power and importance of belief. This event happened sometime after the Savior had conferred the power upon his apostles:<br><br><i>And when they were come to the multitude, there came to him a certain man, kneeling down to him, and saying,</i><br><br><i>Lord, have mercy on my son: for he is lunatick, and sore vexed: for ofttimes he falleth into the fire, and oft into the water.</i><br><br><i>And I brought him to thy disciples, and they could not cure him.</i><br><br><i>Then Jesus answered and said, O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you? how long shall I suffer you? bring him hither to me.</i><br><br><i>And Jesus rebuked the devil; and he departed out of him: and the child was cured from that very hour.</i><br><br><i>Then came the disciples to Jesus apart, and said, Why could we not cast him out?</i><br><br><i>And Jesus said unto them, Because of your unbelief: for verily I say unto you, If ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye shall say unto this mountain, Remove hence to yonder place; and it shall remove; and nothing shall be impossible unto you.</i><br><br><i>Howbeit this kind goeth not out but by prayer and fasting.</i>[Matthew 17:14–21]<br><br>If we are hearing what the above scripture is telling us, it is unfolding to our minds the power, the confidence, and assurance that nothing that we desire in righteousness shall be impossible unto us if we are willing to pay the price and believe. Belief requires desire, an open heart, with an attitude of acceptance of truth. It requires prayer and fasting. It requires repentance. It requires a willing spirit. It also requires a purpose. Belief cannot be met by passively saying, "I believe," as some might be led to think. Belief requires a willing spirit. It also requires a purpose. As I have been taught and have studied the scriptures I have arrived at the following thoughts:<br><br>The spiritual entity of man is the eternal part of man's soul. It is the offspring of our eternal God but does not have the glorified body that God possesses. Man's spirit is subject to passing through stages in order to become as God the Father. Its first estate was in the preexistence. In this stage it was in the presence of God. It had its agency; it functioned and was subject to certain requirements for keeping or preserving its first estate. Its second stage was to join with a mortal body. I do not think it amiss to say that the conditions and place of entrance into mortality are commensurate with what each spirit had prepared itself for in the preexistence. During mortality the spirit has the opportunity to prepare itself to become an immortal, glorified personage. However, in its mortal stage it is not in God's presence, but it has access to him through the Spirit. The mortal body is made up of senses which generally are referred to as sight, hearing, smell, taste, and touch, each connected to bodily organs. These senses have a purpose necessary to the development of the soul, to prove to God the keeping of his commandments. When the senses are gratified in contradiction to the commandments, the soul becomes sensual, carnal, and devilish.<br><br>The achieving of the true purpose of mortality requires a cooperation between the spirit and the body. The spirit is the disciplinarian; therefore, the spirit needs to be the stronger of the two. If the spirit becomes weak, the urges of the senses take over and sin or violation results. The weak spirit, however, can become strong through a process called worship, or adhering to all the principles as set forth in the gospel. The stronger the spirit becomes, the better the discipline of the body. As the spirit becomes strong, it prepares the soul to maintain, or keep, the second estate so that it may receive its right place in immortality.<br><h2><b>True Believers Worship in Spirit and Truth</b></h2><br>Jesus, in his conversation with the woman of Samaria as he rested on Jacob's well, brought into their conversation the principle of worshiping the Father, dismissing the necessity of where one should worship, but injecting the truth: "True worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth: for the Father seeketh such to worship him. God is a spirit; and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth" (Jon 4:23–24). In this scripture Jesus defines God as a spirit. We believe that his spirit dwells in his celestial body of flesh and bones. We also know that it has been revealed to the Prophet Joseph Smith that man is a spirit which dwells in a mortal body and the two together constitute his soul.<br><br>The medium of communication is through the spirit of man with the Spirit of God. In hearing truth with a desire to know and receive the truth, the Spirit confirms our belief. It has been said that the spirit of man cannot be satisfied but with truth. There are occasions granted, for special reasons, to help mankind receive the truth when the spirit of special individuals leaves the mortal body, without causing death, to be in the presence of God.<br><br>Let us review the great spiritual event under such a circumstance which occurred in the life of Nephi. It happened after Lehi, Nephi's father, had had a vision of the tree of life, the river, and the rod of iron, and he spake the vision to his family. Nephi, having heard his words and no doubt touched by the Spirit, wrote:<br><br><i>After I had desired to know the things that my father had seen, and believing that the Lord was able to make them known unto me, as I sat pondering in mine heart I was caught away in the Spirit of the Lord, yea, into an exceeding high mountain, which I never had before seen, and upon which I never had before set my foot.</i><br><br><i>And the Spirit said unto me: Behold, what desirest thou?</i><br><br><i>And I said: I desire to behold the things which my father saw.</i><br><br><i>And the Spirit said unto me: Believest thou</i>[note the key question]<i>that thy father saw the tree of which he hath spoken?</i><br><br><i>And I said: Yea, thou knowest that I believe all the words of my father.</i><br><br><i>And when I had spoken these words, the Spirit cried with a loud voice, saying: Hosanna to the Lord, the most high God; for he is God over all the earth, yea, even above all. And blessed art thou, Nephi, because thou believest in the Son of the most high God; wherefore, thou shalt behold the things which thou hast desired.</i><br><br><i>And behold this thing shall be given unto thee for a sign, that after thou hast beheld the tree which bore the fruit which thy father tasted, thou shalt also behold a man descending out of heaven . . . and after ye have witnessed him ye shall bear record that it is the Son of God.</i>[1 Nephi 11:1–7]<br><br>Because of the belief of Nephi there was before him a series of events which may be considered as one of the great visions recorded in scripture. He said, "For I spake unto him as a man speaketh; for I beheld that he was in the form of a man; yet nevertheless I knew that it was the Spirit of the Lord; and he spake unto me as a man speaketh with another" (1 Nephi 11). The Spirit said unto him, "Look," and there came an array of visions giving full interpretation of Lehi's dream and the future events of the gospel--beginning with the vision of the virgin bearing a child, the Son of God, in her arms--and it went down through the stream of time, previewing the events, which were yet to be recorded in the scriptures, of Christ's ministry, his crucifixion and resurrection, the land of promise relating to Lehi's posterity, their righteousness for almost four generations, their unrighteousness, and their ultimate downfall. Then they went beyond, into the latter days, into the nations of the gentiles, America's history was foreshadowed, and Nephi saw the coming forth of the Book of Mormon and the Bible and the restoration of the true church. How great is the power of belief and how sweet the results thereof! Nephi recorded this event, and we have it in its pure form as he wrote his testimony. How important it is to us that while it is almost twenty-six hundred years after the occurrence thereof, we can rejoice with him, receive his testimony, gain an enlargement of our souls, and witness the truth through our own belief.<br><br>The same applies to all scriptures as we read them. Nephi learned early in life the importance of the principles of faith. It was his guide throughout his life. He never wavered for one moment in the things he was directed to do. We too should let this principle be a motivating factor in our lives. True, some may not come to believe as readily as others, but we can all believe and increase in faith.<br><br>To understand the principle, Alma gave some sound instruction. He said, speaking of the words he had spoken to his people:<br><br><i>Ye cannot know of their surety at first, unto perfection, any more than faith is a perfect knowledge.</i><br><br><i>But behold if ye will awake and arouse your faculties, even to the experiment upon my words, and exercise a particle of faith, yea, even if ye can no more than desire to believe, let this desire work in you, even until ye believe in a manner that ye can give place for a portion of my words.</i><br><br><i>Now, we will compare the word unto a seed. Now, if ye give place, that a seed may be planted in your heart, behold, if it be a true seed . . . it will begin to swell within your breasts; and when you feel these swelling motions, ye will begin to say within yourselves--It must needs be that this is a good seed, or that the word is good, for it beginneth to enlarge my soul; yea, it beginneth to enlighten my understanding.</i>[Alma 32:26–28]<br><br>Alma well understood the principle of motivating the individual to believe: Plant the seed, the idea, the thought within the individual, cause him to ponder and think, and germination begins to take place. As the seed grows within the soul, it causes one to act. It is an eternal truth.<br><h2><b>Studies and Research Should Be Enriched with the Spirit of God</b></h2><br>Now, my brothers and sisters, I have called a good deal of scripture to our attention this morning that it may bring to mind the great truths that are so basic to our lives. I often think of the troubles that many thinking people are worried about today with the tremendous scientific progress being made and the technical discoveries springing forth daily. Yet there is great concern about man's inability to cope with the ethical and moral problems. I hope there has been progress made since Benjamin Franklin wrote in a letter to Joseph Priestley the following:<br><br><i>The rapid progress that true science now makes, occasions my regretting that I was born too soon. It is impossible to imagine the heights to which man may be carried in a thousand years. The power of man over matter. We may perhaps learn to deprive large masses of their gravity and give them absolute levity for the sake of easy transportation. Agriculture may diminish its labor and double its produce. All disease may by sure means be prevented or cured, not excepting that of old age, and our lives lengthened at pleasure even beyond the antediluvian standard. Oh, that moral science were in so fair way of improvement that men would cease to be wolves to one another, and that human beings would at length learn what they improperly call humanity.</i><br><br>Benjamin Franklin would stand amazed at the scientific and technical advances that have occurred since his demise approximately two hundred years ago. Large masses are now moved by air transports with absolute levity. There are great strides in the field of health, and agricultural labor is diminished to a sense of ease, with mechanical equipment preparing the earth, planting, harvesting, and yielding a harvest many times greater than in Franklin's day.<br><br>I read only the other day that in 1790 hardly anybody died of cancer because most people died of something else, such as scarlet fever, diphtheria, tuberculosis, and other diseases. At that time the chance of living to the age of ten was one in five. How true that is I don't know. Today, however, about 99 or 100 percent of us live to age ten. As to the lengthening of our lives at pleasure beyond the antediluvian standards, I think God may have something to say about that. I do not believe our average longevity level has yet reached the scriptural three score and ten, but the moral struggle continues. I do not know of any comparison in that area, but it seems that statistics indicate a worsening situation. The only way that situation can be corrected is through augmenting the spiritual life. This does not mean to lessen the endeavors of science. Every time I board an aircraft, enter a shopping center, hospital, or my automobile, or see a computer work, I am grateful for science, which has made the present facilities possible. The pursuit of education in all fields is essential to our society.<br><br>Theodore Roosevelt, in giving his thoughts on the function of a great university, said:<br><br><i>A great university . . . has two special functions. The first is to produce a small number of men who in science and literature or in art will do productive work of the first class. The second is to send out into the world a very large number of men who could never achieve and who ought not to try to achieve such a position in the field of scholarship, but whose energies are to be felt in every other form of activity, and who should go out from our doors with a balanced development of body, of mind, and above all, of character, which shall fit them to do the work both honorable and efficient.</i><br><br>As I have thought about that statement, I have asked myself, "Where is a better place than here to qualify such men and women?" I am certain that those who have gone from these doors during the last century, in the great majority, have leavened the areas to which they have gone, not only by doing a work both honorable and efficient, but also with maintaining character and a great measure of spirituality. The world is beset with numerous problems to solve, and with the educational programs of our institution slanted towards God's purposes, we will help solve those problems. Whatever the problem is that needs attention, let our studies and research be enriched with the Spirit of God to lift the human family. Let us teach people the blessings of discipline by our own example in keeping the commandments of God. Let us be worthy stewards for the Lord, I humbly pray, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>John H.

<h1>ts on the Sands of Time - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
This is a wonderful audience. Brethren and sisters, it's a challenge and an honor to address this large body of young people. Students of Brigham Young University, I hope and pray that I may be able to say something that will strengthen your faith in the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ and your determination to draw nearer to the Lord and keep his commandments, that you may have joy and rejoicing in this life as well as eternal happiness in the life to come.<br><h2><b>Develop Your Spirit</b></h2><br>It's been a glorious experience for me to devote so many years of my life to secretarial service to the First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve. Now in the later years of my life it is wonderful to give another service in the Lord's kingdom--namely, visiting the stakes and missions of the Church, as well as giving attention to other duties that come to those of us who are called to serve as Assistants to the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. My service with the Brethren over the past fifty-three years has been a source of great education, not only in matters we normally speak of as ecclesiastical, but also in general matters pertaining to the various phases of work of the Church and life.<br><br>In my many years of reporting sermons delivered by the General Authorities, my mind has been filled with many expressions of truth that I wish I might always remember. I've written down many of these noble thoughts and endeavored to make them a part of my thinking also. President David O. McKay, for instance, was a great prophet of the Lord, as have been all of the Brethren who have been prophets in this dispensation. On one occasion, President McKay made special reference to the nature of man, that he is a dual being consisting of spirit and body. May I paraphrase some sentiments that he expressed on this subject. He said:<br><br><i>The whole lesson of mortal life is whether we devote our time and attention to the mortal body, the house in which we live, or to the development of the spirit that lives within. The development of the spirit is the purpose of life, and man is the only animal in the world who has the power of choice. He may choose whether he will go through life devoting his thought and attention to gratification of the flesh, or he may choose to subdue the physical being and develop the spirit.</i><br><br>The Savior said on one occasion, "consider the lilies of the field, how they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin: And yet I say unto you, that even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these" (Matthew 6:28–29). People say that is not practical, that one has to think of tomorrow, the future, and we are told that he who does not take care of his loved ones is worse than an infidel. We need to analyze this expression by the Lord in order to get a proper understanding of it. A lily bulb is planted in the earth. It obtains its sustenance from nature. In the due course of things the bulb bursts and a sprout comes from that bulb. If that were all that happened, if it remained covered in the earth, it would not fulfill the purpose of its existence or its creation. The real purpose of its existence is that it should sprout and grow, obtaining its sustenance from nature. It sends forth a little plant into the sunshine. It continues to draw its food from the earth, and behold, a beautiful blossom appears, thus performing the purpose of its existence. In further fulfilling the purpose of its existence, it perpetuates its own kind.<br><br>Man has his brains, his hands, his nerves, and he gains his sustenance from nature as does the flower. He produces a life from the earth and from his transactions in life. Whether he's a farmer, a merchant, a teacher, a doctor, a lawyer--whatever he may be--he gains his sustenance from the earth and has the right to choose whether he'll devote his abilities, all his efforts, to the gratification of his physical body or to the development of the soul. If he give the proper consideration and attention to matters pertaining to the soul, it develops and grows in perfection under the guidance, light, and inspiration of the Holy Ghost. If he chooses to devote himself to the physical things alone he has not accomplished the real purpose of his existence.<br><br>This brings to my mind an illustration contained in the scriptures. You'll remember a rich young ruler came to see the Savior and asked him what he should do to obtain eternal life. Brethren and sisters, that's what we're seeking for, isn't it? We want to obtain eternal life. The ruler was a fine young man, and the Lord said to him, "You know the commandments. Thou shalt not kill. Thou shalt not steal. Thou shalt not bear false witness."<br><br>"Oh," the ruler said, "all of these things I have done from my childhood up."<br><br>But the Savior said, "There is yet one thing that thou lackest. Sell all that thou hast and give to the poor and come follow me." And the young man went away sorrowing because he had much wealth (see Matthew 19:16–22). Now, the Lord doesn't always require that of us, does he? He doesn't require us to sell all that we have and give to the poor and come follow him. He does expect us, however, to be willing to give all that we have and follow him if that should be necessary. But as I see it, the reason he told the ruler to sell everything was to illustrate that his mind was set more on wealth and the things of this world than it was upon the things of eternal life. That is the principle we should have in mind.<br><br>President Grant said on one occasion:<br><br><i>Supplicating the Lord for guidance of his spirit places around us a safeguard, and if we earnestly and honestly seek the guidance and the Spirit of the Lord, I can assure you that we'll receive it. I am convinced that one of the greatest and one of the best things in all the world to keep a man faithful in the gospel is to supplicate God secretly in the name of the Son for guidance of his holy Spirit. But when a man stops supplicating God for his Spirit and direction, just so soon he starts to become a stranger to him and his works. We should all pray that God may never leave us alone without his Spirit and assist us in withstanding sin and temptation.</i><br><h2><b>Choose Friends Wisely</b></h2><br>Friends and friendship play a very important role in our lives. It is of the utmost importance that, particularly while one is young, he seek out the right kind of companions and associates. Environment is also of the utmost importance, whether it be in the matter of employment, recreational activities, or whatever it may be. Speaking of employment, I worked for Merchants Bank in Salt Lake City when I was a young man. This was in the days before Prohibition. There was the Heidelberg Saloon (there were saloons in those days) on Third South just east of the bank. And the saloon did its banking with the Merchants Bank. At the end of every month it was the policy that the employees would stay rather late in the evening and mail to the depositors statements of their personal accounts. On these occasions, the Heidelberg Saloon invited the employees of the bank to come to the saloon and have a drink without cost. I went with other employees to the saloon on such occasions, but I never partook of the alcoholic drinks. I usually asked for ginger ale. I recall on one occasion that the head paying-and-receiving teller of the bank, who was a Catholic, said to me, "Why do you come here if you're going to drink ginger ale? This is a saloon and you should do the same as the rest of us do." He was rather outspoken and antagonistic in his remarks. I said to him, calling him by name, "I am making no complaint about what you drink, and you have no right to complain about the drink that I take."<br><br>I have loved all of the Brethren of the General Authorities who I have known. It might be questionable wisdom to say that I have loved some more than others, but my close association with President J. Reuben Clark, Jr., certainly made him one of my favorites. In June 1958 President Clark related the following to me about his own life:<br><br><i>I do not remember where liquor was offered to me that I had any doubt in my mind as to what I should do. I could like champagne. I could be a good drinker, but there never came into my mind, "Ought you to drink or ought you not to drink?" I knew I ought not to drink, and I did not drink. The same is my experience with women. I never had to wonder whether it was right for me to commit myself with a woman. That was always with me. All of my conduct had to be based on that. To me the important thing is that my training has been such that I never was in a position that I did not know what I ought to do. I never had to argue about it with myself, and I think that was the strength. If I had had to stop and wonder if this was right or that was right, it would have been different</i>.<br><br>I realize that in one's youthful years one is more fearless than when adulthood adds its problems and worries. His or her youthful curiosity is inclined to tempt him or her to experiment or to make investigations into matters sometimes of a questionable nature.<br><br>One is fortunate if he has the strength to resist temptation and evil when he encounters them in their various phases. The poet has said:<br><br><i>Lives of great men all remind us, we can make our lives sublime</i><br><br><i>And, departing, leave behind us footprints in the sands of time.</i><br><br>[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, "A Psalm of Life"]<br><br>Young men of the Church hold the priesthood. And the priesthood is the power of leadership and should strengthen one in his determination to keep on the Lord's side of the line. In spite of our intentions, sometimes it is not possible to select our own environment so far as employment is concerned. But it is usually possible and desirable to choose one's own friends. I think it was Josh Billings who said, "Never judge a man by his relatives; they're crowded upon him. But judge him by the company he keeps, for he chooses his own."<br><h2><b>Bless and Help Others</b></h2><br>It was my experience in my early years to work with some whose traits of character were not commendable, but I'm grateful that the greater part of my life has been devoted to an association with great and good men, men whose footsteps in the sands of time are such as to influence others to seek to conduct themselves in a manner that would lead to light and truth. President Clark was one such person who I dearly loved. May I mention the traits of another person who I loved and who wielded a great influence upon my life when I was young, which influence made such an impression upon my mind that I'd like to adopt the virtues his life exemplified. President Heber J. Grant was a man who loved his fellowmen and devoted his life to blessing and helping others. Among other traits of character was his desire--it was almost a mania with him--to give good books, books that he enjoyed, not only to his friends, but to people generally with whom he came in contact. I'm sure that libraries of thousands of members of the Church and others contain copies of this literature with his inscription therein, which I feel sure has influenced their lives for good.<br><br>I've never know a more generous man than President Grant. Many a widow's mortgage has been paid out of his personal funds. I recall one incident that came to my attention. This was when he learned that one of his Brethren in the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles was struggling to make the monthly payments on the mortgage on his home. This brother mentioned in the Council one day that within a year he would be able to make the final payment. President asked me, inasmuch as I was his secretary and had charge of his accounts and books, to ascertain what amount was still owing on his dear brother's mortgage. This I did, and President Grant sent him a check for the amount necessary to take care of the balance. I recall that he lent to young men on different occasions the money necessary to meet their expenses in their study of medicine. He, of course, charged no interest for such loans, which were ultimately paid. At various times when I have met these men since the completion of their studies and their entrance into the field of medicine, they have wept with appreciation for the help thus extended to them, without which it would not have been possible for them to accomplish their ambitions.<br><br>In our friendly relationship humorous incidents sometimes occurred that indicated the human nature of this good man. (And all the Brethren have a good sense of humor.) On one occasion President Grant was dictating his journal, and he mentioned the fact that he had attended a Sunday afternoon meeting in the Tabernacle. It was customary at that time to hold public meetings in the Tabernacle in Salt Lake City every Sunday afternoon. And I reported those meetings. President Grant in his dictation mentioned the Brethren who had spoken at the Tabernacle service, but he overlooked one good brother who had participated, and I reminded him of that fact. He said, "Oh, I must have slept through his remarks." I said, "Well, we can insert in the journal that you very much enjoyed his sermon."<br><h2><b>Dare to Stand up to Giants</b></h2><br>There are others of the Brethren of the General Authorities with whose lives I've been intimately related. They also have left footprints upon the sands of time, which footprints I would like to walk in because of the influence they've had upon my life. I have always enjoyed the account given in the Old Testament regarding David and Goliath the Philistine. You'll recall that the giant mocked David as he came out to meet him with rocks and sling. And the Philistine cursed him in the name of his gods. David in answer said, "Thou comest to me with a sword, and with a spear, and with a shield: but I come to thee in the name of the Lord of hosts, the God of the armies of Israel, whom thou hast defiled." (1 Samuel 17:45). You know the outcome of that particular combat. The important part to me in the story is this: "I come to thee in the name of the Lord of hosts, the God of the armies of Israel."<br><br>You young men are going out to meet giants in the world. Some of you hold the priesthood, perhaps all of you. If you do not, you should make yourselves worthy of this blessing. By virtue of the priesthood you will meet the giants of temptation in the world in the name of the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel. These giants may be sin or creatures of sin. There are those who will endeavor to persuade you to become involved in the use of drugs and to live a useless and careless life. There are giants of evil, but if you have the priesthood of God conferred upon you, that is power, the greatest power in the world. You are leaders and the power is within you.<br><br>The world needs leaders today, men who will stand for the right in spite of everything, men who will honor this priesthood power that the Lord has given them. That which entices to do evil is of the devil; that which persuadeth to do good is of the Lord. If you are leaders--and you are if you will live up to the power that is within you--by virtue of the priesthood you will be leaders among your associates, not followers of those who would make weaklings of you. Be men and women with minds of your own, guided and inspired by the Holy Ghost. Dare to be morally clean when others seek the primrose path. Dare to say no when you are invited to drink or smoke or take into your system drugs or those things that will take from you the Spirit of the Lord and the power of the priesthood. You will then not have merely a form of godliness, but the true power of godliness by which you will bless yourself and mankind generally.<br><br>You young women do not have the priesthood, of course, but you have the power that comes through the gift of the Holy Ghost. You can distinguish between right and wrong, and if you will keep in contact with your Heavenly Father in prayer, there will be given to you inspiration--yes, even revelation to guide and direct your footsteps along the course that will bring joy and happiness to you, not only in this life but throughout all eternity. And when you marry, if you marry an elder of the Church, you will share in the blessings that he enjoys. Make certain that he is worthy of you.<br><h2><b>Do Not Compromise with Wickedness</b></h2><br>In the early days of the Church, when the pioneers first came to Salt Lake City, and even before that time for that matter, our people indulged in recreation and clean amusement as we do now. The Salt Lake Theater was built during the presidency of Brigham Young and dedicated on March 12, 1862. In the prayer of dedication Daniel H. Wells, one of the counselors in the First Presidency, said, among other things:<br><br><i>Accept our gratitude, our Father, for the privilege we now enjoy of assembling within these spacious walls for the purpose of consecrating and dedicating this building, which has been erected for a theatre wherein thy people may receive amusement and recreation. In the name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, and in the authority of the Holy and eternal Priesthood of Almighty God, we consecrate and dedicate this building with its surroundings above and below and upon each side thereof, unto Thee, our Father and our God. . . .</i><br><br><i>And wilt Thou, O Lord, preserve for ever this house pure and holy for the habitation of thy people; suffer no evil or wicked influences to predominate or prevail within these walls, neither disorder, drunkenness, debachery or licentiousness of any sort or kind, but rather than this, sooner than it should pass into the hands or control of the wicked or ungodly, let it utterly perish and crumble to atoms; let it be as though it had not been, an utter waste, each and every part returning unto its native element; but may order, virtue, cleanliness, sobriety and every excellence obtain and hold fast possession herein, and the righteous control and possess it, and holiness unto the Lord be forever inscribed therein.</i>[<i>Deseret News</i>, 12 March 1862, p. 290]<br><br>I have had the privilege on many occasions of witnessing performances in that temple of drama, music, and comedy, but there came a time when traveling companies brought to that playhouse shows that were vulgar, that were not pure, shows that did not manifest an influence such as President Wells prayed would prevail and predominate. President Grant loved the drama. He loved the stage. I think he personally was the principle owner of the stock in the old Salt Lake Theater. Accordingly, the theater was closed. It, the property on which it stood, were sold and the theater was torn down. The Church has always stood for clean amusement, moral cleanliness and those things which tend toward righteousness. We cannot compromise with wickedness.<br><br>The Brethren who have succeeded President Grant as Presidents of the Church have also made footprints on the sands of time and have helped to direct my course. The same can be said about their counselors, the Twelve, and the other General Authorities. May I just mention our President, Spencer W. Kimball. I have loved President Kimball since I first met him. He is a special spirit who the Lord knew before he came here and who he has prepared for the work he is now doing as President of the Church. He is the Lord's chosen servant at this time. He is a miracle man. I was recently reading his book<i>Faith Precedes the Miracle</i>, from which I quote the following:<br><br><i>There are a few things that came to my attention recently that strengthen me and in which you might be interested--particularly with reference to prophecy made by my father. This was made known to me only a week ago. In preface to his statements, I will read a line or two from his patriarchal blessing given to him by Patriarch John Smith back in 1898. He said to my father: "Andrew Kimball</i>[and I knew this man]<i>--thou shalt have the spirit of discernment to foretell future events and thy name shall be handed down with thy posterity in honorable remembrance from generation to generation." And then Brother Hatch, another patriarch, said</i>[talking to Brother Andrew Kimball]:<i>"for thou art a prophet and came upon earth in this dispensation to be a great leader."</i><br><br><i>Just the other day, Orville Allen came into the office to talk to me intimately and confidentially. After closing the door, he said, "Spencer, your father was a prophet. He made a prediction that has literally come to pass, and I want to tell you about it." He continued, "Your father talked with me at the corral, one evening. I had brought a load of pumpkins for his pigs. You were just a little boy and you were sitting there, milking the cows, and singing to them as you milked. Your father turned to me and said, 'Brother, that boy, Spencer, is an exceptional boy. He always tries to mind me, whatever I ask him to do. I have dedicated him to be one of the mouthpieces of the Lord--the Lord willing. You will see him some day as a great leader. I have dedicated him to the service of God, and he will become a mighty man in the Church.'"</i>[<i>Faith Precedes the Miracle</i>(Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Co., 1975), pp. xvi–xvii]<br><br>Further referring to President Kimball, to indicate the great spirit of this man, I remember in the same book he mentions his call to be an apostle and the feeling he had of unworthiness. Brother Spencer refers to the experience of Jacob wrestling all night with an angel for a blessing, and the same thing happened with Enos, who went out into the forest and prayed, as recorded in the Book of Mormon. Enos prayed all day long and into the night for the forgiveness of his sins. And the word of the Lord came to him that his sins had been forgiven. President Kimball said:<br><br><i>For eighty-five nights I've gone through that experience</i>[when he was called to be a member of the Twelve].<i>Eighty-five times the breaking of the day has found me on my knees praying to the Lord to help me and strengthen me and make me equal to this great responsibility that has come to me.</i>[<i>Faith Precedes the Miracle,</i>p. xv]<br><br>I repeat that it has been a great joy to be associated with these men of God, truly prophets of the Lord. Today President Kimball is our President, a prophet of the Lord. He lives as close to the Lord as any mortal man can do. And this Church is led by inspiration and revelation from heaven. I testify to you that these men have been and are prophet of the living God. This is the dispensation of the fulness of times. We have the responsibility of carrying the gospel message to the world so that every ear may hear the truth. This is in preparation for the time when the Savior will come to rule and reign upon the earth for a thousand years in peace and righteousness. President McKay said on one occasion:<br><br><i>One of the great comforts of this life is that we can go to him, the Lord, and receive his guidance in the only church which he recognizes. Some say it is arrogance to say he does not recognize other churches. He recognizes all good deeds, but there must be only one official avenue through which God's will is given to man.</i><br><br>May the Lord help us to conduct our lives in such a manner as to have his Spirit to be with us. I bear testimony that God lives, that Jesus is indeed the Christ, the Savior of mankind, that this is his church. The men who have stood at the head of this Church in this dispensation including President Spencer Kimball, who presides today, have been and are prophets of the living God, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Joseph Anderson was an Assistant to the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when this fireside address was given at Brigham Young University on 4 May 1975.</i></i><br><br><i>©Intellectual Reserve, Inc.

<br>
<br>
Thank you, President Oaks. One is honored to be asked to speak to a devotional assembly, especially when his journey has left most of his footprints in the sands of time. I appreciate the prayer that was offered by Brother Skousen, the son of Karl Skousen, an outstanding scholar and a wonderful man, and I pray that the Lord will respond to that prayer in this period that we have together. If you will join with me, if you will give me your faith and prayers, and if we can think together as if we were in a small classroom, this should prove to be a very worthwhile period for you. I want it to be a very profitable period for you. If Sister Edwards had not objected, I would have suggested that you take out your pencil and paper and make some notes as we progress so that we might think more carefully together.<br><br>As David, with his staff in one hand and sling in the other, came toward Goliath, he had complete confidence because he knew that the God of Israel was with him. Nevertheless, as he approached Goliath, he must have felt very humble. I assure you it's that humility I feel this morning, but with your faith and prayers and your interest and help I feel that we can have a very worthwhile period.<br><h2><b>Lehi's unusual compass</b></h2><br>You will recall that Alma, when he was ripe with age, called together his sons to give each of them his charge. To the faithful Helaman, to whom he entrusted the records and the sacred relics, he talked about the compass the Lord had prepared to guide Lehi and his people to the promised land:<br><br><i>And now, my son, I have somewhat to say concerning the thing which our fathers call a ball, a director--or our fathers called it Liahona, which is, being interpreted, a compass; and the Lord prepared it.</i><br><br><i>And behold, there cannot any man work after the manner of so curious a workmanship....</i><br><br><i>And it did work for them according to their faith in God; therefore, if they had faith to believe that God could cause that those spindles should point in the way they should go, behold, it was done....</i><br><br><i>Nevertheless ... they were slothful and forgot to exercise their faith and diligence and then those marvelous works ceased, and they did not progress in their journey.</i>[Alma 37:38–41]<br><br>As Alma told his sons then and as I speak to you today, "it is as easy to give heed to the word of Christ, which will point to you a straight course to eternal bliss, as it was for our fathers to give heed to this compass, which would point unto them a straight course to the promised land" (Alma 37:44).<br><h2><b>Making Your Personal Liahona</b></h2><br>Nearly twenty-five years ago in the Eyring Science Center, I helped Dallin H. Oaks, an outstanding young student, construct his personalized compass. Can there be a question as to where it led him? Now as a professor emeritus, I pray to be able to help you in the completion of your compass.<br><br>First, let me congratulate you for being students at BYU. I trust that you will catch fully the spirit of the Y. This is to seek excellence in things of the spirit and of men. This is to grow in understanding of the gospel and the trades and professions of the world. This is to become a whole person, one prepared to enjoy a celestial life.<br><br>The University is blessed with the leadership of the First Presidency and the Council of the Twelve. The University has been presided over by great Presidents in the past, and it has a great President today. When the right man with vision is in the right place at the right time, there is always outstanding accomplishment.<br><br>The faculty is unique among all university communities, and may I help you understand how unique this faculty is. Of the 1,076 regular full-time faculty members during the 1974 Fall Semester, 711, or 66 percent, have earned doctoral degrees. If you knew the price that most of these people paid to obtain those degrees, I am sure that you would capitalize each of the letters in the word<i>earned</i>. Those degrees were earned at many universities, representing most of the outstanding universities in America and many foreign universities. Hence, we see here a cosmopolitan mixing of the great wisdom and learning that can come from such universities. The majority of the faculty have filled full-time missions for the Church, are engaged as teachers and officers in stakes, wards, and branches, and almost a majority have served in the armed services. Oh, what a community of scholars to help you achieve excellence in the things of the spirit and of men!<br><br>Paralleling the challenge of men to match our mountains, is the challenge of students to match this institution. Can you do it, brothers and sisters? Do you have what it takes? Are you prepared to pay the price in personal, effective effort? To equal this challenge, your primary thrust must be to seek knowledge and skills with grades as only a by-product of your success.<br><br>The Lord in his great wisdom set the following as a goal: "For behold, this is my work and my glory-to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man" (Moses 1:39). We must not set a lower goal for ourselves. We must build our compass so that the arrow always points toward the goal of eternal life. The fact that you are here is evidence that through study and prayer and the influence of your parents and teachers, you have probably already set this goal. The next challenge comes in being able to use this compass as a constant guide.<br><h2><b>Being Sincere and Right</b></h2><br>As we start to reason together, may I remind you of an often-forgotten fact. There is not virtue in sincerity alone. The devil is terribly sincere. Virtue is in being both sincere and right. In about one hour we can travel from Provo to Salt Lake City if we go in a northerly direction. But how long would it take us to travel from Provo to Salt Lake City if we go in a southerly direction? What are the obstacles we'd have to overcome? What is the risk that we would never make it? And yet it could be done.<br><br>Many great mistakes of the past were made by people who were sincere, but they were not right. The Jewish leaders at the time of the Savior were sincere, but they were wrong. Those who put Jesus on the cross were probably sincere, but they were wrong. Paul as he persecuted the Saints was sincere, but he was wrong. Paul, after he had been converted and became a Christian, remained sincere, and then he was right. And Paul lives as a great apostle of old. At the time of the oppression of the Saints in Jackson County, Missouri, most of the persecutors were probably sincere, but they were wrong. And those who martyred the Prophet were probably sincere but wrong. Great and tragic can be the error of those who are sincere and think that that alone is virtue. Wise is the person who remembers that he must be both sincere and right.<br><h2><b>A Guide to Making Wise Choices</b></h2><br>In trying to perfect the skill in reading my compass, I find the teachings of Mormon as recorded by Moroni to be invaluable:<br><br><i>For behold, my brethren, it is given unto you to judge, that ye may know good from evil; and the way to judge is as plain, that ye may know with a perfect knowledge, as the daylight is from the dark night.</i><br><br><i>... wherefore, I show unto you the way to judge; for everything which inviteth to do good, and to persuade to believe in Christ, is sent forth by the power and gift of Christ; wherefore ye may know with a perfect knowledge it is of God.</i><br><br><i>But whatsoever thing persuadeth men to do evil, and believe not in Christ, and deny him, and serve not god, then ye may know with a perfect knowledge it is of the devil.</i>[Moroni 7:15–17]<br><br>I propose that you think of Moroni's advice when deciding questions ranging from "Is it a good movie to see?" all the way to "Shall I follow the counsel of the Brethren?" This guide should make it possible for you to read your compass. Remember the two conditions of the scripture: It must invite you to do good, and it must persuade you to believe in Christ. It must meet those two standards. If it meets those two standards, it is good. It is clear that many things we might do during the week are not proper to do on the Sabbath day. It is also obvious to us that there are many things that non-Latter-day Saints might appropriately do that we as members of the Church cannot do if we always hold to those two standards.<br><h2><b>Choosing Your Profession</b></h2><br>In working for your goal in life, I am mindful of the importance of proper selection of and preparation for your professional careers. With over one thousand full-time faculty members, I assume you can find advice favorable toward at least one thousand professional careers. And all of the advice might be good if adapted to the right person. You young ladies probably have a dual challenge. There is nothing more noble or potentially more rewarding than being prepared to be a full-time professional wife and mother. In addition, you probably seek a major having possibilities for desirable employment. Young men, you obviously have a different challenge. If you have not already served your mission, then you will want to do that. And then you need to prepare yourself not only for a career, but also for a professional career that will let you sustain a family.<br><br>In the Book of Mormon we find another guide that helps us to make this decision consistent with our eternal goals. Let me quote the words of the prophet Jacob:<br><br><i>But before ye seek for riches, seek ye for the kingdom of God.</i><br><br><i>And after ye have obtained a hope in Christ</i>[and I may add, after you have completed preparation for your profession]<i>ye shall obtain riches, if you seek them; and ye will seek them for the intent to do good--to clothe the naked, and to feed the hungry, and to liberate the captive, and administer relief to the sick and the afflicted.</i>[Jacob 2:18–19]<br><br>In other words, you seek riches for the purpose of rending service, of doing good. We are free to choose to do almost anything we want on the condition that we learn to do it well enough and perform the service in such a way that other people will be willing to pay a reasonable price for our service. Whatever the position you seek, the way to seek it is to prepare yourselves to render superior service with financial reward flowing as a result. This keeps the horse in front of the cart, the rider in the saddle, and the compass pointing in the right direction.<br><h2><b>Preserving Our Blessings</b></h2><br>The Book of Mormon records over and over a typical cycle. For me to mention it will bring it to your minds: prosperity, loss of spirituality, wickedness, poverty, humility, spirituality, and again prosperity. Success and prosperity are blessings, but we must break this cycle. In order to break it, I encourage you to look upon success and prosperity as your special temptations. As you climb the ladder of success, progressively strengthen your dedication to the Church and your family and thus preserve the qualities that justified the blessings. Remember it is easier to be humble when you are poor, but it can be more noble to be humble when you are prosperous--even rich. Paraphrasing the counsel given by the prophet Jacob and the teachings of the Savior, one could say, "Blessed are the rich who understand why they are rich, for they shall inherit the kingdom of heaven."<br><br>In this regard President Kimball pronounced a special prayer for each of us in his recent dedication of the Arizona Temple: "Our Father, in blessing Thy people with prosperity, we pray that they may not be surfeited with flocks and herds and acres and barns and wealth which would bring them to worship these false gods as have many people before them" (<i>Church News</i>, 19 April 1975).<br><br>We remember that Christ never criticized being rich, but only the love of riches, because he knew what would flow from this love for riches. Break the cycle related in the Book of Mormon by growing in your faith and dedication as you climb the ladder for success in life.<br><h2><b>Policy over Judgment</b></h2><br>In order to read accurately the eternal compass you must understand the logic and the strength of the policy demonstrated by Adam as related in the Book of Moses:<br><br><i>And he</i>[the Lord]<i>gave unto them</i>[Adam and Eve]<i>commandments, that they should worship the Lord their God, and should offer the firstlings of their flocks, for an offering unto the Lord. And Adam was obedient unto the commandments of the Lord.</i><br><br><i>And after many days an angel of the Lord appeared unto Adam, saying: Why dost thou offer sacrifices unto the Lord? And Adam said unto him: I know not, save the Lord commanded me.</i><br><br><i>And then the angel spake, saying: This thing is a similitude of the sacrifice of the Only Begotten of the Father, which is full of grace and truth.</i>[Moses 5:5–7]<br><br>Adam was obedient to counsel. As a matter of policy he obeyed, and then he was taught and came to an understanding. I counsel you to follow this example. As a matter of policy, be obedient to the counsel of the Brethren. Do not rely upon your judgment as to whether it is right or wrong, important or unimportant, and then only follow what you think is right or when you think it is important. When there are questions, and they are expected of a sensitive, alert mind, then challenge the counsel, not to prove if it is right or wrong, but challenge the counsel in order to come to an understanding as to why it is right. That was the strength of Adam. He was obedient; it was a matter of policy. From that obedience, there flowed understanding and wisdom. And there will flow to us understanding and wisdom if we obey as a matter of policy. But great is the risk, uncertain is the way, if we place ourselves in the roles of being judges as to whether it is right or wrong, important or unimportant.<br><h2><b>Be Wise in Money Management</b></h2><br>You will find that the compass is unreliable in an environment of unwise money management. I am sure that by now President Oaks may be concerned about whether or not I would discuss money management. But of course I will bring in money management. Success in living the gospel way of life is closely related to how wisely one handles personal finances. Its importance to successful family life was stressed by a statement of Elder Marvin J. Ashton at the welfare session of the April general conference: "The American Bar Association recently indicated that 89 percent of all divorces could be traced to quarrels and accusations over money" (<i>Church News,</i>12 April 1975).<br><br>Wise money management can increase the joy of living. It can facilitate the realization of desires and righteous goals. Whether one is rich or poor in the true meaning of the term is not primarily a matter of the level of income or total assets but is primarily the attitude toward money and its use. "Men are, that they might have joy" (2 Nephi 2:25) becomes more real and meaningful to those whose financial house is in order.<br><br>I am inclined to think, from experience, that the first thing that Satan likes to do to a young married couple is to get them into financial difficulty. Then he has a fertile field and a favorable environment to achieve his goal--which is to destroy your goal. I shall not discuss in this brief period the subject of budgeting. You must learn how to put first things first so that the more important are accomplished and the less important are omitted. Much good information is available on this subject for those who desire it. Probably most of you are already experts in varying degrees in the art of the wise handling of money, but I would like to present a few basic thoughts about managing money.<br><br>I am going to make you happy, brothers and sisters. You might be much better off than you think. Remember, time and money must be in short supply for you to be truly happy. A surplus of time, a period when there is nothing that you want to do--not even sleep--is boredom. Time is so precious when in short supply. This is equally true of money. Unsatisfied desires are essential for you to be happy. Choosing and selecting among things you desire very much is essential to happiness. Paying tithes and offerings when there are material things you desire very strongly brings the blessings and the joys the Lord promises from observance of the laws of consecration and of sacrifice. So if what you want is an abundance of happiness, you must recognize you are going to have a shortage of time and a shortage of money. You are going to find happiness in how wisely you use the time and in how wisely you use the money.<br><h2><b>Living Economically</b></h2><br>As we traveled on a BYU tour into the land of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, I was reminded of an Arabian proverb: "Eat and drink, but waste not by excess, for God loveth not wasters." On another trip, to beautiful Victoria, British Columbia, we read in the government building: "Without economy, none can be rich; with it, none can be poor." Is it not apparent that we should protect and use economically nature's resources? I recommend that you go one step further and adopt this as your policy: "I shall live economically not because I have to but because it is a good way of life." Living economically because you think you have to is not fun. Every time you look at a neighbor who enjoys something you wish you had, you feel miserable. But if you choose this way of life because it is a good way of life, you can live economically and be happy and count your blessings. The secret is in the point of view. It's magic, but it's real.<br><br>Think how the Savior lived. And think how he could have lived. He could have come like a king on a great throne with his wealth surpassing all the wealth of the world. This wasn't a good way of life for him. He chose to be most humble.<br><br>Brothers and sisters, seek a full understanding of the statement "Man shall not live by bread alone" (Matthew 4:4) because it will help you to find greater joy in the way of life that we have encouraged. Beyond minimum necessities, the most satisfying things in life cannot be bought with money: love, knowledge, understanding, joy of service, love of the beauties of nature. With these in abundance one can be rich. Without them one is poor regardless of the amount of income or total assets. I wondered some time ago what would happen if we called a student early in the morning and said, "Are you up? Have you looked at the east? Have you seen the beautiful fireworks in the sky?" Could it be that a student attends the Y without experiencing the thrilling excitement of seeing a beautiful sunrise? These are assets beyond ability to measure.<br><br>As I think of these assets that money can't buy, I must admit that my mind drifts to Sister Edwards, sitting behind me. Oh, I remember those great days when we were seniors during our last quarter at the BYU. We would go to a dance, and after the dance I would put my hand in my pocket and pull the change out. Together we would count, and maybe it would be twenty-five cents. We would ask together, "What can we do this evening with twenty-five cents that would give us the most fun?"<br><br>Then I remember when I became rich. Fortunately, I have enjoyed that blessing for a long period of time. I feel sorry for you who think you are poor.<br><br>When I came to BYU, my folks were like the folks of most of these faculty members who have earned their doctorate degrees. As I remember, my good mother and my stepfather sent me ten dollars a month for the first three months, and from then on as I was on my own. In the fall of 1924 my roommate and I could not find work, but we were able to borrow a round tub, the kind Grandma used to bathe in, from our landlord. On Saturdays we would go to the farms northeast of here and find people who would let us help harvest their crops. The farmers would let us fill our tub as compensation. The next week we would specialize in vegetables.<br><br>But during my last quarter at school I celebrated. I quit working. I quit driving the first yellow cab that was in Provo. I quit working at Hotel Roberts. I quit keeping the fires at the Merrill Hospital. All I did was go to school and I became very well acquainted with a young lady whose name was Catherine Eyring. Unfortunately I incurred some debts. When I graduated and went to New York to take over and conquer Manhattan, as the settlers did who bought it from the Indians, I had to have money. So I made a loan.<br><br>I paid that loan off during my first year. To get married, however, I was short of money and again borrowed. This is one purpose for which you can go into debt, and the Brethren will approve of it and the Lord will say, "Bless you." With three hundred dollars I was able to come west, meet Catherine, go to Idaho to be with my folks, come to the Salt Lake Temple to get married, go to Arizona and enjoy a reception with her folks, and then return back to New York with a thousand dollars. Catherine had taught school the year before and worked at Grand Canyon one summer. Since then we have been rich; that is, we have always had something in the savings account.<br><br>We started life together as king and queen. For one hundred dollars I was able to buy the second-hand furniture of a couple moving west. I married a girl who believed that tithing came ahead of food. I married a girl who had magic because, no matter what happened during the day or how I felt when I closed the day, every morning when I left home I started as an optimist. I remember many occasions when I received a telephone call at the office. All my wife had to say was "I love you." Oh, did I work. Now, I assure you that you cannot buy those things. They are more precious than gold, and you are rich when you have them in abundance.<br><h2><b>Preserving Our Basic Freedoms</b></h2><br>The compass is also unreliable in an environment of lack of freedom. We who live in America are blessed with a government that holds "these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness." We must work to preserve this environment. But faithful members of the Church live and prosper in many parts of the world with different forms of government. Remember, John the Baptist and the Prophet Joseph Smith were both, in a real sense, free men even in prison on the eve of death.<br><br>The real risk of loss of freedom for you and me is a personal matter. There is little risk, at least not at this time, that the government will pass a law making it illegal to attend church services or to live the Church standards. But we can easily lose these freedoms. Stop attending Church services, stop living Church standards, stop supporting the Church leaders, and these freedoms will be lost as truly as if by law. The only difference is whether we lose our freedoms voluntarily or involuntarily. In the final judgment, I presume the former is the more serious. Also, every time we break a Church standard or go against the counsel of the Brethren, we lose some freedom. Violating any sacred principles is a sin; he who does it is a sinner, and to that degree he loses his freedom. If one commits a sin and lives in fear of it becoming known, he has lost considerable freedom.<br><br>Thus, the freedom we seek to preserve is the freedom to do the Lord's will. If we fall heir to the pressures of worldly styles or social practices, if our faith lags, we lose this freedom. Our most basic freedom is no more secure than out testimonies and our willingness to keep the commandments of the Lord.<br><h2><b>Iron Rod of the Gospel</b></h2><br>The iron rod of the gospel is more precious than gold and more durable than Mount Timpanogos. We are living in the dispensation of the fulness of times. This means the Church will endure until the second coming of the Savior. This means that if we hold fast to the iron rod, we will be a member of an organization directed by men called by revelation, men directed by the Spirit of God and interested in our personal welfare. This means that if we keep faith in God, keep our covenants, and follow the counsel of the Brethren, we can look to the future with confidence. If the Brethren advise being involved in a food-storage program, avoiding installment credit, buying consumer's durable goods only with cash, working toward home ownership, then these things we must do.<br><br>Yes, each of us can have a personalized compass that will lead to a promised land of more abundant living in today's world and to eternal life. We need only conform our lives to a few sound, practical policies and remain faithful, nothing wavering. It is as easy as a suggestion once given to me by a student who was working on his compass: "Hitch your wagon to a star; hold your seat and there you are." I bear you my testimony, my brothers and sisters, that if we will do these things we will have a compass that will lead us through the journey of this life with an abundance of happiness and joy and will take us back to the presence of our Father in heaven. I say this in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>William F.

<h1>g to Think About - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I feel honored, indeed, to have this opportunity of addressing you this evening. I enjoyed that lovely rendition by the choir and wish to congratulate them. As we came in here this evening, I said to Sister Tanner, "It's such a beautiful day. Why would people come out to listen to me tonight?" I'd really like to have the answer. As I was invited to come down here, they asked me to come and speak to a ten-stake fireside. Before I got here, it was a twelve-stake fireside. That gives you a little idea of how the Church is growing.<br><br>I told in the general priesthood meeting of my experience in Caracas, Venezuela, last March. We had a meeting of the members and the investigators. I don't know how many were there. The mission president said there were five hundred, but they have a practice of exaggerating just a little. There might have been three of four hundred there, at least. As I got up to speak to them, I said, "I'd like to get a little better acquainted with this group. All those who were baptized in 1974 and 1975 please stand." Quite a group of them stood. Then I said, "Those who were baptized in 1973 stand," and another group stood. And I continued for 1972, 1971, and 1970. Then I said, "All those who have been in the Church over five years, please stand," and three stood. The president of the mission turned to me and said, "They don't belong here." And I asked, "Are you people visiting here or do you live here?" They said, "We're visitors."<br><br>You belong to a Church that is really going forward under the direction of the Lord through a prophet of God, and how fortunate we are to be members of that Church and kingdom. I'd like to see you members of the new BYU Eleventh and Twelfth stakes--mdash;I don't care how many there would be--mdash;stand just a minute so I can talk to you. You're pretty well scattered through the audience. Do you mind if I talk to you this evening? As I was trying to think of something to talk to you about I thought the safest thing for me to say is that my title is "Something to Think About." I humbly pray that I might say something that will be helpful to someone. I really feel great concern when I'm called to speak to a group like this, a very choice group, wherever it may be. You have a choice future because of your understanding of the gospel, and the world and the Church are going to be very well blessed because they have people like you who will be leading and conducting and directing the affairs, no only of the Church, but also of the communities in which you live.<br><h2><b>Follow Good Examples</b></h2><br>We have the restored gospel, which is the gospel in its fulness and which the world does not have. The world does not have the Book of Mormon, it doesn't have the Doctrine and Covenants, the Pearl of Great Price, or modern revelation, nor a prophet of god to direct any of them. And that's where we are blessed. BYU students are so fortunate to have the organizations that exist here upon this campus, where all of the activities of the branches are provided, where every one of you can take part. Most of you come from homes where the gospel is understood and taught and lived. What a great blessing that is! You also have regular stake conference. You have these firesides, ten-, now twelve-stake, firesides, where the General Authorities come to speak to you. No other place in the world do young people have these opportunities and experiences, and it makes me feel very humble as I stand before you tonight.<br><br>Then you also have the general conferences, which you may attend or listen to over the radio and television. Last conference we had over forty General Authorities bear testimony regarding the truthfulness of the gospel. And you know the kind of testimonies they bear.<br><br>I'd like to emphasize this point: that these are men of valor; they're men of faith. They're honest, honorable men in every way. They wouldn't be telling you any lies. They're not stupid; they're men who know what they are talking about. And if any of you do not have testimonies here tonight, I would suggest that you listen to and accept the testimonies of these General Authorities and others who bear testimonies throughout the Church.<br><br>If you had two people come in here tonight and tell you that something was taking place out here or something had taken place in South Africa, where I've just come from, you'd believe them. You'd say, I know it's true because these are honest men, and they wouldn't tell us anything but what is right. Now these forty-odd (I don't mean they're odd; I mean more than forty) people bore testimonies to us at that general conference, and they bear testimony wherever they go. We have these regular devotionals and firesides here at this campus, which is not common throughout the world. We have a prophet of God directing this Church, or at least the Lord Jesus Christ himself is directing this Church through a prophet of God. We also have modern revelations.<br><br>Now, I have prayed that I might deal with and help you to understand what the Church offers you, what your responsibilities are, the blessings that are in store for those who will accept those responsibilities and live according to the teachings of the gospel, and the effect that you will have on others. I realize that I'm not going to tell you anything new tonight. I am trying, however, to emphasize those things that are important in our lives.<br><br>Before going forward with my talk I should like to bring you greetings from President Kimball. He's been here. He goes wherever it's possible for him to go to speak to people throughout the Church. He sent his blessings tonight to you, knowing that I was going to be here. He loves you; he wants you to succeed; he wants you to be happy; he wants you to be the kind of people that the Lord will bless and be happy to have as members of his Church and kingdom here upon the earth.<br><br>As I bring you greetings from President Kimball, I was reminded when being introduced to you tonight, I've had the great privilege of being a counselor to four of the Presidents of the Church, four prophets of God. I've always known that the Presidents of the Church were prophets of God. Having had this privilege of associating with them, counseling with them, sitting at their feet, you might say, day after day, and seeing how the Lord works through them, I want to bear you my testimony that I know as I know I stand here that they are prophets of God and that the Lord works through them to direct his Church here upon the earth.<br><br>Speaking for the exemplary homes that most of you come from, I hope all of the homes from which you come are made up of God-fearing people, people who are honest and true and virtuous, people who want you to understand the gospel of Jesus Christ and who are seeking after righteousness. You do not have the conditions that many in the world have today. Let me just tell you a little story that I have told before, about a young couple killed in an automobile accident. As people came to the scene of that accident they saw a whiskey bottle half empty. When the father saw it he went into a rage and said, "I'll kill the man who gave these kids that whiskey." But when he went home that night he saw in his liquor cabinet a note from his daughter. It said, "Dad, I hope you don't mind our taking your whiskey tonight."<br><br>Now, you don't have those examples and those problems. You're so fortunate to come from homes where those conditions do not exist, and to attend a university where the gospel principles are taught and standards are upheld.<br><br>This statement from Dudley Swim has been oft repeated, but I'd like to read it again tonight:<br><br><i>As a somewhat disillusioned Presbyterian, I must say that I give thanks for the heartening example of the Mormon Church and the educational institutions which it maintains. A few million dollars given there, I have confidence, will fulfill the expectations of the donor: and, regrettably, I have almost equal confidence that any such gifts to the institutions which have yielded to the sophistry and immorality that have swept academia in recent years can only produce betrayal of the faith and expectations of a responsible donor.</i><br><h2><b>Be an Example</b></h2><br>Last week a new stake presidency was sustained in the Monterey Stake, and the new president of that stake came up with his wife to talk to the General Authority who had established that stake and introduced them to the stake members. The president of that stake said, "I met this young lady, my wife, at BYU. I was a nonmember of the Church. I don't know why I went to BYU, but I did. I met this girl and fell in love with her. As I told her that I'd fallen in love with her and would like to have her as my wife, she said, 'I'll marry you only in the temple.' I didn't understand what the temple was, but when she said that, I began to investigate, and as a result we were married in the temple. I am where I am today because she was prepared to take her individual stand and do that which is right. Regardless of our relationship otherwise, the only way she would be married was in the temple. So we were married in the temple. I know five other couples who can tell you the same kind of story, that they met LDS girls who were not prepared at any cost to give up the standards of their Church, and as a result they are holding stake offices here in this stake." Those are things, I think, my brothers and sisters, that we should keep in mind.<br><br>I have told this next story many times, and I want to tell it again tonight. There is a returned missionary who is attending the University of Utah, and he and his companion were called as stake missionaries because he liked his missionary work so much. They were teaching the gospel to a family, and after they'd given the second or third discussion, the father said, "I want nothing more to do with this. It's a lot of nonsense to say that God the Father and his Son Jesus Christ would appear to a boy. I want no more of it. I don't want you to come back at all."<br><br>But he had a daughter who was eighteen or nineteen years of age who believed what they were saying, and after a while she asked her father if she could be baptized. He said, "no, not until you've reached the age of maturity. If you still feel the same way, that's your responsibility."<br><br>She was going out with a young man and was telling him about the Church. That's not what he was taking her out for, and he said, "Listen, I don't want to hear any more about this Church. We've talked about it before, and I don't want to hear anything more. You may choose tonight between me and the Church." She shed some tears; she liked this young man and thought a lot of him. After they'd talked it over, she said, "I must choose the Church, because I know it's true."<br><br>Now, that takes a lot of fortitude, a lot of determination, but she did it. When she went home, she was very upset. Her father noticed she was and wanted to know what was wrong. After some persuasion she told him just exactly what had happened. He said, "If the Church means that much to you, you may be baptized." A few weeks later she was baptized, and not only her parents were there to see her baptized but also this boy who told her to choose between him and the Church. As a result, sometime later they were all three baptized, and these two young people are married and living happily together. What a sad thing it would have been had she said, "Well, I just must not give up this opportunity to be with you the rest of my life." They're happy. She took her stand, and she was blessed accordingly.<br><br>We have the gospel in its fulness, which the world does not understand. People in the world today cannot understand the gospel in its fulness because they do not have it. How fortunate we are to know, through the Book of Mormon and the Doctrine and Covenants and modern revelation, that we had a premortal existence, that we are actually spirit children of God. That passes over the heads of so many people. We've heard it so many times, but some of us have not accepted it--mdash;that we're literally spirit children of God. We have the spirit here and we have the mortal body here, and they're united; and when we leave this mortal existence, the spirit goes on. Later we are literally resurrected; the spirit and body are reunited. Now, that isn't taught and it isn't understood and it isn't accepted by many, many hundred of thousands of people throughout the world. But we are spirit children of God. As such our potential is unlimited, but as such we are expected to act as spirit children of God, as his own children, who we are, that we might live worthy of his blessings.<br><br>I'd like to tell you about a former Lutheran minister who was baptized into the Church. He said he had found a pearl of great price and was prepared to give up everything for it. He was well settled as a minister of the Lutheran Church. He had a good home, a good job, and was well-respected by everybody. But he said when he found<i>the</i>pearl of great price, though it took some time, he was prepared to sell all that he had and accept that pearl of great price. I quote from a talk he gave after his baptism:<br><br>"A year and a half ago, an LDS family asked me to teach two of their sons piano. One of them played tonight during the sacrament meeting. Last summer, an LDS family asked me to teach three of their children piano. In dealing with not only these young people, but their parents, their families, I dealt quite closely with them. I began to realize that there was something very special about the Mormon people, a people somehow set apart as far as I could tell. I didn't know what it was, but it was something that I began to want.<br><br>"What's in a decision? The Holy Ghost, let me tell you, really works with young people. I think that they were probably the most active in our conversion because those young people didn't do a super selling job--they were just themselves. They were simply fantastic. Those young people were thrilling to work with, and they still are. They did a tremendous job of evangelism.<br><br>"What's in a decision? Brothers and sisters, there's a world waiting outside for you and me. In Luke 10:2 we read, 'Therefore said he unto them, The harvest truly is great, but the labourers are few: pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest, that he would send forth labourers into his harvest.' Are we going to sit back and take things easy? Are we going to sit by and do nothing? Or are we going to decide to help that world out there waiting for you and for me to decide on the greatest decision of their lives? If you and I allow the Holy Ghost to work through us, the impossible will become possible. Frustration will become peace, and the seekers will become finders. It happened to our family, and I am thankful to almighty God. I am thankful to the many people who were his tools that it did happen.<br><br>"What's in a decision? It is the Holy Ghost working through you and through me. That's what's in a decision. I bear you my testimony tonight that this is the true Church. I believe it with all my heart. I bear you my testimony that we have living prophets today. They are revealing great truths from God to us this very day. I sincerely believe that Joseph Smith was a prophet. I thank God every day that we have the restored Church. I thank God every day that Jesus lives. I thank God that we have a wonderful Church filled with people, so that Jesus not only lives but he lives through these people. You and I have a great job to do, and I pray to our Heavenly Father that we will not let him down. The harvest is very ripe, and you can't wait too long. I bear you my testimony that all these things are true in the name of Jesus Christ, our Savior. Amen."<br><br>That was the talk given by a man who had heard of the Church a year and a half before and who had been a successful, well-respected minister in the Lutheran Church.<br><br>Wherever we go, if our eyes are open we find people who are very happy because of their experience with members of the Church and because the have joined the Church. I'd like to say to you tonight that the world, where the people understand, accepts the gospel of Jesus Christ as revealed to Joseph Smith in these latter days. And again how fortunate we are to have that gospel! Let us not take it for granted, but let us take it as a blueprint of life and thank the Lord every day for the gospel.<br><h2><b>Have Integrity</b></h2><br>The Lord said unto us, "I, the Lord, am bound when ye do what I say; but when ye do not what I say, ye have no promise" (D&amp;amp;C 82:10). There are those on the campus who ignore the rules and the regulations which they agreed to keep and who see how far they can go and get away with it. In fact, they themselves and some of their associates are hypocrites; they cannot be trusted. They're degrading themselves and are in danger of destruction. Some have even lied when interviewed for missions and temple recommends. I wonder what they hope to gain by living this way and lying about the way they are living.<br><br>A friend of mine a few years ago learned that his sixteen-year-old boy was smoking. One evening when this family had finished their meal and were sitting around the table, the father took out a package of cigarettes and started passing it around. He took one and said, "Let's have a little smoke tonight together as we visit."<br><br>And the first person he handed it to said, "Why, Dad, you know we don't smoke. I couldn't smoke." He passed it around getting about the same response from the others. But this sixteen-year-old boy said, "Dad, I wouldn't care for a cigarette."<br><br>The father said, "Why, go ahead and take one. If you're going to smoke, let us smoke together. Let us enjoy life together. Don't be disassociating yourself from the family. Come on. Let us have a smoke together." Of course they didn't smoke.<br><br>Brethren and sisters, let us put ourselves in the position always where we will do those things that we'd be glad to have our father and mother know we were doing. Never go around trying to hide the things that you're doing, being dishonest, being unreliable, being the kind of people that the Lord wouldn't choose and you wouldn't choose yourself for your associates. Be the kind of person that the Lord can look down on with thanksgiving and blessings. You know what the Lord said about hypocrites.<br><br>I don't understand why we do many of the things that we do. I'd like to read to you about keeping the Word of Wisdom. This is a statement, made by Victor B. Cline, which you were kind enough to give me, Brother Wilkinson.<br><br><i>That three million people would start smoking each year is rather amazing when you consider the almost total lack of rational reasons to commence such an activity in the first place and the great many reasons not to--mdash;such as its serious health hazards, cost of the habit, its addicting qualities, its contribution to bad breath, its offense to nonsmokers, its contamination and pollution of the ambient air with carbon monoxide, which can present a serious problem in enclosed spaces like restaurants, elevators, offices, stores, restrooms, theaters, public conveyances, etc. Also, consider that on every package of cigarettes purchased as well as in every cigarette advertisement there is an added determined message: "Warning: The Surgeon General has determined that cigarette smoking is dangerous to your health."</i><br><br><i>If one is a nonsmoker, not hooked, why would anybody in their right mind take up this habit, which almost every logical argument would suggest is self-destructive and inimical to the individual's self-interest?</i><br><br><i>I would suggest that the answer can be found, in part, in what I would term "persuasive communications," a powerful form of behavior manipulation, and control, honed to a fine art by commercial advertisers.</i><br><br>One who is behind those advertisers is Satan himself, who is determined to destroy us at all costs and will use every method possible to accomplish his ends. He has determined that he will destroy mankind and the work of the Lord.<br><br>Let me give you another example. Last time I talked here I gave you this example, but because a young woman came up to me after the talk and questioned me about it I want to repeat it tonight. A bishop in California called me just before general conference and said, "President Tanner, I have a young man here who is having real problems, and he would like to meet you because he thinks you can help him. He knows you are interested in young people and have had experience with them."<br><br>I said, "If you bring him over I'll be very happy to talk to him at conference time." He brought him over and he was dressed as a hippie--every sign: hair, clothes, and everything. I said, "What is your problem?"<br><br>He said, "I'll tell you. I'm a returned missionary. I filled a good mission, I believe. But when I came home something happened to cause me to get this rebellious feeling, and I went out determined that the Church wasn't going to tell me what to do. I was going to choose my own life and live as I felt I would like to live and be free. And I became associated with these hippies. Today I'm a slave. I'm a drug addict. I am guilty of a felony. I am one who is evading the law." We talked for some time. Then he said, "I have a wife and I have a child, and here I am in this condition. It isn't what I wanted, it isn't what I want, but I am in this situation." We talked it over, and at my suggestion he agreed that he would disassociate himself from the group, that he would clean himself up, and go back and turn himself over to the law.<br><br>Just a few weeks later, I received a letter from him. It started out this way, "Dear President Tanner, I'm writing from behind prison walls." Then he reviewed our conversation, and he said, "If your use of this letter would help anybody determine never to touch drugs or to associate with or become a part of any such group, please feel free to use it."<br><br>It was when I had finished telling that story the last time I was here that someone came up and said, "President Tanner, I can't understand your saying, 'Have nothing to do with those people.' I think the Lord wants us to help everyone we can."<br><br>I said, "I agree with you fully, but don't become a part of it. Live in the world, but don't be of the world. If an individual comes to you, be as helpful as you possibly can. If you have a friend who is having problems, talk to that friend and try to influence that friend for good. But don't become in any way associated with them in the things that they are doing."<br><br>We have those, too, who seem to think it's smart to do things which they know they should not do. We have some who want to have the praise of men or of their contemporaries rather than the praise of God and the praise of their stake presidents and bishops, and their University president and professors. They want to see how far they can go in immorality, and then some of them boast to their friends and their associates of their escapades. Now, brothers and sisters, that is the most foolish thing it is possible for you to do. Nothing can be gained. As I have said before, don't be a hypocrite. Don't be a coward. Have the courage and the strength to stand up and be counted and do those things which you know are right. The Lord will bless you, and those who ridicule you will love you and respect you and choose your association.<br><br>When I was in South America I met a young man who was a graduate of BYU. He had been born and raised in Argentina and was the one who interpreted for President Kimball all the time the prophet talked at the different sessions of the area conference. This young man set about to learn what he could of the gospel, and he became student body president of BYU. Then he went out to work for Gillette. Today he is the head of the Gillette Razor Corporation in the whole of South America. He had the courage, desire, and determination to do what was right, to be honest and honorable and upright in his dealings, worthy of the love and respect of those with whom he associated.<br><br>The eyes of the world are upon us, brothers and sisters. Some of you have heard of Johnny Miller. He and Billy Casper are the only golf champions that are ever known by their Church affiliation. Every time the newsmen write about him or every time they speak of him, they mention that Johnny Miller is a Mormon. I'm happy to say that everything they say about him is very complimentary. There was also a hijacker here not too long ago--I hate to mention this--but of all of the hijackers throughout the world, he's the only one of whom we know to which church he belongs. Isn't that interesting? You take the champion golfers--the only ones people know which church they belong to are those that belong to the Mormon Church. The hijackers are the same. I've talked to men in industry and found that they all know when a man is a Mormon because of our high standards, and they expect us to live the standards the way we profess to do.<br><br>There is another story which I have told many times. It means so much to me, and that's the reason I repeat it, even at the cost of being criticized by my wife. When I was in the government I was called to speak to a large group of oilmen in Dallas, Texas. While introducing me, Governor Gester of Texas said, "A government is fortunate to have a man like Mr. Tanner in the government." I looked over at him and said to myself, "What can I do for you, Mr. Governor?"<br><br>After I'd finished speaking, he stood up again and said, "As I introduced the Honorable Mr. Tanner, I said that the government was fortunate to have such a man in the government. I'll tell you why I said it. As I introduced him, I also said that he had been a bishop in the Mormon Church and was now president of the Edmonton Branch. I'd like to say to you men that any man who is worthy to be a bishop in that church needs no other introduction as far as I'm concerned." He wasn't complimenting me; he was complimenting those people that he knew who were bishops and held office in the Mormon Church. I thought at the time what a great thing it would be if all our people lived so as to merit that kind of introduction.<br><br>I'm glad to see this group of missionaries here at the Language Training Mission tonight--the only thing I envy them is their white shirts while I have to wear a coat. What a tremendous thing it would be for all the returned missionaries to live so that any one of them could go, if he were looking for employment, and say, "I'm an LDS returned missionary in good standing," and have an employer say, "That's all the character introduction I need." That could be true throughout the Church. If everybody would live his religion, it wouldn't be long until everybody would be prepared to say, "If he's a Mormon in good standing, that's all the character introduction I need." Why don't we do it? Why don't we live that way every day?<br><br>You young people now are helping to determine how the Church is recognized and acknowledged throughout the world. When we were in South Africa just a week or so ago, in every audience I asked all those who had been baptized as adults to stand, and in nearly every case the majority of them were baptized as adults, and they bore testimony of how happy they were that they heard the true gospel of Jesus Christ and were able to accept it and become members of his Church and kingdom here upon the earth, and how blessed they were in their families as a result of doing what they had done and living according to the teachings of the gospel.<br><h2><b>Live in the "Watchtower" of the Church</b></h2><br>Let us determine in our lives to try to live in the garret or the watchtower, not in the basement; to live as spirit children of God, not as animals; to keep ourselves morally clean, accepting the teachings of Jesus Christ. Let us stand ourselves up and ask these questions: What do I really want out of life? Do I want to be happy? And I want to assure you that there is no happiness in sin. Do I want to be successful? Do I want to be loved and accepted? Do I believe and accept the teachings of Jesus Christ as given in the restored church? Do I value my membership in the Church? And then ask yourselves, "What would I do if it were taken from me today?" It breaks my heart every time reports come in that someone has sinned morally and we find it necessary to take his membership in the Church from him.<br><br>Ask also: Would I choose myself as a leader, as one that I'd like to associate with in business, one I'd like to have for my doctor? Would the Lord choose me for<i>any</i>position? Am I preparing myself for acceptance and advancement in any field, in or out of the Church? Will I have earned my passport to eternal life? Am I one in whom everyone can have complete confidence?<br><br>The greatest punishment I ever had was when my father said to me one day, "My son, I thought I could depend on you." I had failed to do something he had advised me to do. I loved my dad, and I knew he loved me. For him to say, "I thought I could depend on you," just broke my heart. I determined right then that never again would my father have reason to say, "I thought I could depend on you." When I went to bed that night I prayed to the Lord that I could so live that he would never have reason to say, "There's a holder of the priesthood, a member of my Church, on whom I thought I could depend and can't."<br><br>Brother's and sisters, if you can't be depended upon by your associates, by your professors, by the President of the University, by those who are associating with you in any way, you are preparing yourselves for failure, not for success; not to enjoy the blessings of our Heavenly Father, but to be unhappy as you go forward in your work. Ask yourself if you are worthy of the blessings which the gospel offers.<br><br>Now these questions, my brothers and sisters, are questions that I feel we should ask ourselves regularly. Never be ashamed of the gospel of Christ. Live so that you can enjoy that sweet spirit of facing the world and facing anybody with the knowledge and understanding that you are living as you should. Again, I repeat, there is no happiness in sin. If you do what is right, the Lord will bless you accordingly. You'll be loved and respected, you'll be more successful, you'll be happier as you go through life, and at the same time you'll be preparing yourselves for exaltation and eternal life.<br><br>So answer the question again: "Am I honest, honorable, true, chaste--emphasize that word<i>chaste--</i>benevolent, and in every way dependable?" Now is the time to repent, if there are any of us who need repenting--I do every day. Some need it, it seems, more than others, or need to repent of more things than others do, but now is the time to repent. If any of you are doing things that you shouldn't be doing, go to the Lord and ask forgiveness, go to the ones presiding over you, ask forgiveness, and clear your life so that you might enjoy confidence. You who are not married, prepare yourselves to be the kind of parents you want your children to have, so that they can look up to you at all times.<br><br>I want you to know, my brothers and sisters, that I love you, that the President of the Church loves you, that all the General Authorities and those who are called to preside over you love you. Sometimes when they criticize you, sometimes when they preach to you and try to direct your activities, remember it's because they love you. They want you to be happy, they want you to succeed, and they want you to know that the Lord stands ready to answer your prayers.<br><br>Now, it's my privilege and pleasure to be with you tonight. If I have in any way assisted any of you to make up your minds to be the kind of people the Lord would like as his children I am very happy. I leave my blessing with you, and I humbly pray that the Spirit of the Lord will attend you, that you will have the courage and strength, desire and determination to be honest, honorable, true, chaste, benevolent, and strive to be worthy of eternal life, in the name of Jesus Christ. amen.<br><br><i><i>N.

<h1>nity: Repression or Liberation? - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
It is a great honor to be on this beautiful campus, which is new by the standards of universities throughout the world, on this special occasion. It is to your great credit that you seek each week to reexamine your spiritual values and their importance in your lives.<br><br>I have chosen to speak to you today on the subject of "Christianity--repression or liberation?"<br><br>For the past decade, students have been doing what they have been doing for centuries, examining and challenging their values. During the past ten years, it has been done, however, with greater fervor. Repression and liberation have been dominant themes, both religiously and politically. Many have felt that their campuses were too repressive and sought to take over the government of the university, even though they contributed very little to its building and maintenance costs. Some have misunderstood what liberation means. Henry Ward Beecher said, "There is no liberty to men whose passions are stronger than their religious beliefs: there is no liberty to men in whom ignorance predominates over knowledge. There is no liberty to men who know not how to govern themselves."<br><br>Saying essentially the same thing was Henry Brooks Adams, who said, "Absolute liberty is absence of restraint. Responsibility is restraint and therefore the ideally free individual is responsible to himself." Therefore, I wish to speak of repression and liberation in terms of the individual.<br><br>Too many, in the past few years, have been intent upon seeking and claiming rights, rather than respecting them. They have ignored the fact that with every right there is a duty. Mohandas Gandhi was quick to say, "I am a lover of my own liberty and so I would do nothing to restrict yours."<br><br>You young people at this University should all have frontiers, but to pursue those frontiers, you must exercise restraint. Liberation is, in the words of David Lloyd George, "not merely a privilege to be conferred. It is a habit to be acquired."<br><br>Harry Emerson Fosdick, speaking of your generation, said:<br><br><i>Many of them are brought up to think that goodness means repression. All through their maturing youth, they keep coming upon new powers, new passions, new ambitions, and they are told that these must be repressed. At first they docilely accept the negative idea. They try to be good by saying "no" to their surging life, and some day they grow so utterly weary of this same negative repressive goodness that they can tolerate it no longer and they start out to be free, wild and self-indulgent, only to find the road, not to freedom, but to slavery, with habits that bind them and diseases that curse them and blasted reputations that ruin them. Would not Jesus say to them, some such thing as this, "You have made a bad mistake. Goodness is not mainly repression. It is finding your real self and then having it set free. It is positively living for those things which alone are worth living for. It is expression. The effulgence of life into its full power and its abundant fruitage. I come that ye might have life and that ye might have it abundantly." That is real Christianity as it is the spirit of Jesus. Some Christians carry their religion on their backs. It is a packet of beliefs and practices they must bear. At times it grows heavy and they would be willing to lay it down, but that would mean a break with old traditions, so they shoulder it again. But real Christians do not carry their religion, their religion carries them. It is not weight, it is wings. It lifts them up. It sees them over hard places. It makes the universe seem friendly, life purposeful, hope real, sacrifice worthwhile. It sets them free from fear, futility, discouragement and sin--the great enslavers of men's souls. You can know a real Christian when you see him by his buoyancy</i>.<br><br>It was Alexis de Tocqueville who said, "Christianity is the companion of liberty and all its conflicts. The cradle of its infancy and the divine source of its claims."<br><br>Among those who are having difficulty finding their appropriate degree of liberation in the world are women. Eliza R. Snow, in 1872 made a timeless statement on this subject. She said:<br><br><i>The status of women is one of the questions of the day. Some are so conservative that they oppose every change until they are compelled to accept it. They refuse to concede that woman is entitled to the enjoyment of any rights, other than those which the whims, fancies or justice, as the case may be, of men, may choose to grant her. Others again not only recognize that woman's status should be improved, but are so radical in their extreme theories that they would set her in antagonism to man, assume for her a separate and opposing existence, and to show how entirely independent she should be, would make her adopt the more reprehensible phases of character which men present, and which should be shunned or improved by them instead of being copied by women. We are all our own self-destruct mechanism.</i><br><br>Helen Keller was born with many repressive handicaps. She was, as a young child, almost as if she were a wild beast, unreasoning, ruled only be her passions. Until her teacher could get her to begin to learn, to listen, no progress could be made. Richard L. Evans said:<br><br><i>Those who break windows to let in fresh air, do not love fresh air, as much as the sound of tinkling glass. Freedom which Christianity affords is a freedom to soar above the sordid, the mundane. "They that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with wings as eagles; they shall run and not be weary; and they shall walk and not faint." (Isaiah 40:31)</i><br><br>The great energizer of the true Christian, the battery which generates the starter of our inner strengthening motors, is prayer. Dr. Alexis Carrel, celebrated physician, examined the effect of prayer from a physiological standpoint. Said he:<br><br><i>Prayer is not only worship, it is also an invisible emanation of man's worshiping spirit, the most powerful form of energy that one can generate. The influence of prayer on the human mind and body is as demonstrable as that of secreting glands. Its results can be measured in terms of increased physical buoyancy, great intellectual vigor, moral stamina and a deeper understanding of the realities underlying human relationships. If you make a habit of sincere prayer, your life will be very noticeably and profoundly altered. Prayer stamps with its indelible mark our actions and demeanor, a tranquility of bearing. A facial and bodily repose are observed in those whose inner lives are thus enriched. Within the depths of consciousness, a flame kindles, a man sees himself. He discovers his selfishness, his silly pride, his fears, his greed, his moral obligation, intellectual humility. Thus begins the journey of the soul towards the realm of grace.</i><br><br>There are in the scriptures a few especially choice statements of man's duty. May I suggest three:<br><br><i>If any man among you seem to be religious, and bridleth not his tongue, but deceiveth his own heart, this man's religion is vain.</i><br><br><i>Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this, To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep himself unspotted from the world.</i>[James 1:26–27]<br><br><i>What doth the the lord require of thee, but to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God?</i>[Micah 6:8]<br><br><i>Fear God, and keep his commandments: for this is the whole duty of man.</i>[Ecclesiastes 12:13]<br><br>From beyond the pages of the Bible, from the pen of Bonaventure comes the suggestion, "The best perfection of a religious man is to do common things in a perfect manner." The simple tragedy is that, with a loss of faith in religion, people often lose faith in themselves.<br><br>It has been my great blessing to know three perfect women. I speak of my wife, my mother, and my mother-in-law. I would like to tell you of my mother-in-law. Many a man seeks to disparage his wife's mother (Lord Rulles said the penalty for bigamy was having two mothers-in-law); I seek to venerate mine. Her name was Elizabeth Hamilton Wright. She was a twin, born into a family of fourteen children. Because she was gifted in dealing with children, she was taken out of school after the third grade and given the necessary task of tending the younger children. It used to pull my heartstrings out to watch her laboriously write a letter. But she was liberated and fully emancipated, because she had graduated<i>summa cum laude</i>in spirituality. She knew things beyond the understanding of those of us who were merely trained. She knew them by the Spirit of God. She was the humblest of the humble, the wisest of the wise, because she was simple enough to be able to accept a complete belief in God. She knew that the best religion is humanity and the best divine service is to love thy neighbor as thyself. She literally loved her neighbors beyond her love for herself. It is my belief that her daughter, Ruth, surpasses even her mother.<br><br>One wise man, Johann Kaspar Lavater, has said, "All belief that does not render us more happy, more free, more loving, more active, more calm, is, I fear, an erroneous and superstitious belief."<br><br>The subject of our discussion today, "Christianity--Repression or Liberation?" would seem also in a measure to apply to governments. A shrewd observer, Niccolo Machiavelli, declared:<br><br><i>And as the strict observance of religious worship is the cause why states rise to eminence, so contempt for religion brings ruin on them. For where the fear of God is wanting, destruction is sure to follow, or else it must be sustained by the fear felt for their prince, who may thus supply the want of religion in his subjects. Whence it arises that the kingdoms that depend only on the virtue of a mortal, have a short duration. It is seldom that the virtue of the father survives the son.</i><br><br>Being thoughtful students, you are all aware of the cynical statement of Karl Marx, "Religion is the sign of the oppressed creature. The feeling of a heartless world, just as it is the spirit of unspiritual conditions. It is the opium of the people." Rather than being like a drug, these gifts of the Spirit work differently. They do not excite; they calm. They do not hallucinate; they strengthen. They do not weaken, but make more powerful. They are not mere escape hatches from responsibilities, but instruments of insight into what life really means. The spiritually liberating life proves itself by moral responsibility, by an awareness of human fallibility, yet reserves, indeed teaches, the ultimate majesty and meaning of life. It is that which spans our horizons, our feelings, our senses, rather than limiting and inhibiting them. It is the learning of the vast difference between saying prayers and praying. Our prayers, like lightning, go into the unseen, and the responses that we receive give us the safest course that can be found.<br><br>This great unique University, maintained in a large measure by the tithing of those who are not affluent but are faithful, by the widow's mite, is founded and maintained on the premise that pure Christianity is not repressive, but is the most liberating to the human soul of all of the forces at work in the world.<br><br>Your great President, for whom I have such great respect, when he talks to you about the standards of how you look, is trying to tell you that how you look will affect how you think and act. He looks to the future. He wishes that when you walk down the street, that when you sit in councils, that when you speak, people will marvel and say that you are truly a liberated person--free of groveling, debasing, and confining, feelings, thoughts, and passions being merchandised in the finite world. We hope it will be said of you with awe and respect, "This person has so much wisdom and grace, he or she has found the ultimate of all truths--the redeeming power of Christ."<br><br>We hope that you will reach for the finite. I pray that you will, in addition to the great teachers at this University, be under the personal tutelage of the Savior. I pray this in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>James E. Faust was an Assistant to the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when this devotional address was given at Brigham Young University on 10 June 1975.</i></i><br><br><i>© Intellectual Reserve, Inc.

<h1> on the Process of Conversion - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Brothers and sisters, it is great to be with you on this wonderful campus--a few acres of land which are made most sacred by the lives of those of you who occupy them and especially by the lives of those who manage and teacher here. I'm painfully aware of the fact that normally during this hour you are instructed by one of the Lord's anointed, one of the Brethren, each of whom we love and honor so very much. I can't possibly match or seek to match them in power or wisdom, but I can speak from the heart and pray that the Spirit will give utterance. I hope that we can seek the spirit of a fireside chat and achieve edification.<br><br>I wanted to speak to you about the welfare program of the Church, a marvelous plan whereby we, through preparing for consecration, may live the covenants which we have made. But I feel constrained to talk about something more basic which will cause us to participate more fully in all of the activities and programs of the Church, and that is the process of conversion, the mellowing of the heart whereby the Lord makes us his sons and his daughters.<br><h2><b>Developing Christlike Character</b></h2><br>In one of the great instructional volumes of teachings of our dispensation, the<i>Lectures on Faith,</i>the Prophet makes this statement:<br><br><i>These teachings of the Savior most clearly show unto us the nature of salvation, and what he proposed unto the human family when he proposed to save them--that he proposed to make them like unto himself; and he was like the Father, the great prototype of all saved beings; and for any portion of the human family to be assimilated into their likeness is to be saved; and to be unlike them is to be destroyed; and on this hinge turns the door of salvation.</i><br><br>When you ponder this statement you are seized with the question, "How can I be assimilated into the likeness of Christ and thus secure salvation?" Developing Christlike character is the aim and goal of every Latter-day Saint. But, unfortunately, many miss the mark. Stories and books, meetings and manuals, discussions and performances are all used to aim us in the right direction. But often, because our hearts aren't right, these prove to be empty wells instead of fountains of living water.<br><br>If you will permit me, I would like to be autobiographical for a minute and admit some well-intended but rather fruitless attempts to grasp the meaning and the means of becoming Christlike. I was born and raised in the mission field, and when I was nine we were holding our meetings in the practice band room of Colorado College. Because my two older brothers were the only Aaronic Priesthood bearers in the branch, I unofficially helped them prepare the sacrament table. After each meeting when we would clean up, I would carefully sequester myself in the janitor's closet, and, while polishing the water trays, I would eat all the extra sacrament bread and drink the extra water. (Now, I know none of you brethren have done that.) But as fate would have it, one day my father caught my closet act, and, as the branch president, he requested an explanation. While I admitted that the bread was filling, I protested, "Dad, all this extra sacrament will help me be more like Jesus right through the week." Such wonderful naivete! I didn't understand that emblems, in and of themselves, could not deliver me from the power of the adversary. I was trusting in the arm of the flesh--in things. Things or possessions simply have not the power to bring forth Christlike character. I was the prototype materialist, ignorant of the powers of the Atonement commemorated in the sacrament.<br><br>Some years later, as a junior in high school, I again attempted to plumb the gospel. (After all, an eleventh grader knows about all there is to know, so why not penetrate the inner creases of gospel scholarship?) After furious labor, I emerged from my room one morning with a list of rules, seventy-two in number, and I ran upstairs and presented it rather pompously to my mother: "Here it is. If any person will live these seventy-two rules, he will receive exaltation. The Lord will have no choice but to let him in." Notice how I projected the fruits of the gospel into the next life. This life was to be only harsh realities and back-breaking laws. But how disappointed I was to learn in the ensuing weeks that I couldn't even live half the laws half the time. Like my Israelitish cousins, I sought Christlike character in stone tablets. Measuring and calculating. I suffocated my heart in the law of carnal commandments. Unknowingly I was operating in the best tradition of Pythagoras, Bacon, Saul of Tarsus, and others.<br><br>But the Lord must have smiled at my efforts, for he had already promised Israel though Ezekiel that "I will give them one heart, and I will put a new spirit within you; and I will take the stony heart out of their flesh, and will give them an heart of flesh" (Ezekiel 11:19). Indeed, the letter killeth and bringeth forth a stony heart.<br><br>Twenty months later, when I came here to BYU as a robust freshman, I had gone full circle from being a marshal of the gospel law to a wide-eyed idealist. The practical had yielded to the theoretical. I wasn't prepared to live those seventy-two laws and a few others I discovered--including the one my brother taught me upon returning from his mission when he indicated that kissing was not Christlike dating etiquette. I didn't have the wisdom to heed that good counsel. Fresh from having discovered Plato and enthralled with Nephi's dream, I set my heart on principles, not so much to live them but to discuss them. Since I couldn't be bothered with mundane things, my home teaching was rather sporadic, my service to others largely self-serving, and my aspirations rather romantic. In the midst of this sentimentalism, my heart, while sensitive, went untamed. Christlike I hadn't become. My feet were not even on the path, because my head was so far in the clouds.<br><h2><b>Experiencing a Change of Heart</b></h2><br>In this condition I was called on a mission to teach the humble as well as the great of Uruguay, but to my amazement neither my appeal to gospel ordinances, nor my grave explanations of gospel laws, so long studied but not practiced in high school, had much effect. Not even my stunning explanations of sacred principles moved these dear people to conversion. I felt a failure, and my heart was very sick. And in this unsettled condition I found myself reading in Mosiah one day when the teachings of King Benjamin sank deep into my soul:<br><br><i>And moreover, I say unto you, that there shall be no other name nor any other way nor means whereby salvation can come unto the children of men, only in and through the name of Christ, the Lord Omnipotent.</i><br><br><i>For behold, he judgeth, and his judgment is just; and the infant perisheth not that dieth in its infancy; but men drink damnation to their own souls except they humble themselves and become as little children, and believe that salvation was, and is, and is to come, in and through the atoning blood of Christ, the Lord Omnipotent.</i><br><br><i>For the natural man is an enemy to God, and has been from the fall of Adam, and will be, forever and ever, unless he yields to the enticings of the Holy Spirit, and putteth off the natural man.</i>[Mosiah 3:17–19]<br><br>For one so full of pride who hadn't heard of developing a broken heart and a contrite spirit, these were hard teachings. Like Laman and Lemuel I stiffened my neck; nevertheless, I was touched by the prayer of King Benjamin's people. Listen to their plea as recorded in Mosiah:<br><br><i>And they viewed themselves in their own carnal state, even less than the dust of the earth. And they all cried aloud with one voice, saying: O have mercy, and apply the atoning blood of Christ that we may receive forgiveness of our sins, and our hearts may be purified; for we believe in Jesus Christ, the son of God . ... And it came to pass after they had spoken these words, the Spirit of the Lord came upon them, and they were filled with joy, having received a remission of their sins, and having peace of conscience.</i>[Mosiah 4:2–3]<br><br>At that moment I greatly desired to share this peace which passeth understanding and to have my heart made right before the Lord. But I learned in the ensuing weeks that I wasn't yet prepared to pay the price of conversion in terms of study, prayer, repentance, and personal discipline. Because of my spiritual weakness, I didn't grasp the meaning of the change of heart which they experienced, for after they covenanted to live the royal law, the celestial law, we read that the Spirit regenerated their hearts:<br><br><i>And now, it came to pass that when King Benjamin had thus spoken to his people, he sent among them, desiring to know if they believed the words which he had spoken unto them.</i><br><br><i>And they all cried with one voice, saying: Yea, we believe all the words which thou hast spoken unto us; and also, we know of their surety and truth, because of the Spirit of the Lord Omnipotent, which has wrought a mighty change in us, or in our hearts, that we have no more disposition to do evil, but to do good continually.</i>[Mosiah 5:1–2]<br><br>Think of that: "having no disposition to do evil but to do good continually." I am persuaded, my brothers and sisters, that this is the heart of the matter. This is what we are questing for: to have our hearts changed through the baptism of fire and lose the propensity to sin. King Benjamin, this wise prophet, knew that his life and these teachings had borne sweet fruit:<br><br><i>Ye have spoken the words that I desired; and the covenant which ye have made is a righteous covenant.</i><br><br><i>And now, because of the covenant which ye have made ye shall be called the children of Christ, his sons, and his daughters; for behold, this day he hath spiritually begotten you; for ye say that your hearts are changed through faith on his name.</i>[Mosiah 5:6–7]<br><br>Through adoption they had taken upon themselves the name of Christ and desired to live after the manner of Christ. This, I believe, is a living example of the Prophet's teachings when he said, "We must have a change of heart to see the kingdom of God, and subscribe the articles of adoption to enter therein" (<i>Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith,</i>p. 328). Knowing that conversion was a process--sometimes slow, sometimes fast--and realizing the saints must endure to the end, King Benjamin gave them this last bit of counsel: "I would that ye should remember to retain the name written always in your hearts, that ye are not found on the left hand of God, but that ye hear and know the voice by which ye shall be called, and also, the name by which he shall call you" (Mosiah 5:12).<br><br>These teachings of King Benjamin are profound and significant, brothers and sisters. They define for us the gifts and powers of the Atonement, by which we may have our hearts renewed, have Christ's name written thereon, and then lose the desire for sin. But isn't that what we renew each Sunday when we partake of the sacrament and think in our minds and in our hearts these words: "That they may eat in remembrance of the body of thy Son, and witness unto thee, O God, the Eternal Father, that they are willing to take upon them the name of thy Son, and always remember him, and keep his commandments which he has given them, that they may always have his Spirit to be with them"? Have we understood? Have we fully sought these gifts of the Atonement? Joseph Smith taught that to be made like the Father and the Son is to be saved, and to be unlike them is to be destroyed. I am persuaded that the assimilation process is centered primarily in experiencing this change of heart. That is really what makes possible the development of Christlike virtue.<br><br>It would be valuable to weigh the testimony of a second witness regarding these matters, and so I would like to read from Alma, as he is speaking to the saints of the stake in Zarahemla:<br><br><i>Behold ... did not my father Alma believe in the words which were delivered by the mouth of Abinadi? And was he not a holy prophet? Did he not speak the words of God, and my father Alma believed them?</i><br><br><i>And according to his faith there was a mighty change wrought in his heart. Behold I say unto you this is all true.</i><br><br><i>And behold, he preached the word unto your fathers, and a mighty change was also wrought in their hearts, and they humbled themselves and put their trust in the true and living God. And behold, they were faithful unto the end; therefore they were saved.</i>[Alma 5:11–13]<br><br>Later Alma confronted the people of Zarahemla with a question, and by virtue of inspiring Moroni to record it, he asks you and me this same question: "And now behold, I ask of you, my brethren of the church, have ye spiritually been born of God? Have ye received his image in your countenances? Have ye experienced this mighty change in your hearts?" (Alma 5:14). Isn't that the crucial question of life? I think so. And yet it seems hard to face. In defense of self, we say, "Well, now isn't that kind of righteousness reserved for the General Authorities or for my religion professors or perhaps the stake president? Again the Lord provides the answer:<br><br><i>Now they, after being sanctified by the Holy Ghost, having their garments made white, being pure and spotless before God, could not look upon sins save it were with abhorrence;</i>and there were many, exceeding great many, who were made pure and entered into the rest of the Lord their God. [Alma 13:12; emphasis added]<br><h2><b>Seeking Total Faith</b></h2><br>My dear friends, it's so easy to avoid the basic issues of life, but we soon discover with Lehi that the fruit of the tree of life is sweet above all that is sweet and desirable above all that is desirable. Finding the Savior, taking upon us his name, and renewing our hearts compose one of the most primary purposes of life. Yet once we come to understand this doctrine, we often get discouraged and say in our hearts, "But often I don't even have the faith to get an answer to simple prayer. Where will I generate the faith and the courage to lose the very desire for sin?" Well, I daresay that misconstruing the answers to prayers is something that we've all faced, something that Satan loves to nettle us with, but the Lord in his infinite mercy and goodness has again provided the answer. He has said it many places in many ways, but I understood it best when I read this valuable statement:<br><br><i>Nevertheless they did fast and pray oft, and did wax stronger and stronger in their humility, and firmer and firmer in the faith of Christ, unto the filling their souls with joy and consolation, yea, even to the purifying and sanctification of their hears, which sanctification cometh because of their yielding their hearts unto God.</i>[Helaman 3:35]<br><br>There they were, these seventh-generation Nephites, working out their salvation one day at a time, line upon line and precept upon precept.<br><br>Now I understood why President McKay was denied of the Lord when, as a young man riding in the cornfields, he slipped from his saddle and dropped to his knees and cried out to the Lord, hoping for the vision of Paul or the reawakening of Alma the Younger. For the vast majority of us, it doesn't come that way. It isn't quite so dramatic, but every bit as significant, when we finish our round and our course and keep the faith. So it was with the original Twelve, wasn't it? They had to be instructed until they understood, until they were prepared. Then on the day of Pentecost the spiritual endowment was given. As I understand it, it wasn't greatly different for some of the Twelve when originally called in 1836, for we read in the Doctrine and Covenants: "And after their temptations [speaking of the newly called Twelve], and much tribulation, behold, I, the Lord, will feel after them, and if they harden not their hearts, and stiffen not their necks against me, they shall be converted, and I will heal them" (D&amp;amp;C 112:13).<br><h2><b>Preparing for Sainthood</b></h2><br>Brothers and sisters, the profession of sainthood requires career preparation. Just like the fields that each of you is seeking to enter, full conversion is a process. Losing the propensity to sin usually takes time. So if every prayer doesn't seem to be answered, don't give up. And if every desire isn't immediately filled, don't slacken your faith. Abraham waited ninety-two years for his own promised son. If we can agree to be patient and to wait upon the Lord, let's not fall into the trap that so many do, expecting that by having our names on the records of the Church and being part of the kingdom we will somehow become automatically Christlike. It's just not so. It requires constant struggle and effort and great self- discipline, relying continually on the merits of him who is mighty to save. For without the Spirit, this conversion process simply won't culminate.<br><br>It's so easy to veer from one side to the other, either expecting sanctification immediately--now, because I want it!--or assuming it will happen at the time of resurrection and I won't worry about it. May I suggest that either course can prove fatal.<br><br>Let me outline for you briefly four vital signs by which we can monitor our progression toward full conversion. Like the vital signs of physical health, blood pressure, pulse rate, and respiration, which indicate very basically if we're in good physical health, these vital signs similarly indicate how healthy we are, spiritually.<br><br>I would name, as the first sign of a changing heart, an<i>increased capacity for meaningful prayer</i>. "Watch and pray always," the Lord instructed. And why? President Clark supplies the answer: "Because the royal road to heaven is traveled through prayer." Now, sisters, do you spend half as much time praying as you do combing your hair? I know you love your spirit more than half as much as you do your body. And brethren, do your lips form the words<i>thee,</i><i>thine,</i>and<i>thou</i>with anything near the frequency that they form<i>sports,</i><i>girls,</i><i>homework</i>? Tough questions? Perhaps, but not half as tough as the questions posed to those people in Zarahemla when Alma said, "Can you look up to God at that day with a pure heart and clean hands?" I say, "Can you look up, having the image of God engraved upon your consciences?" From Adam to Enoch, from Nephi to the Prophet Joseph, from Brigham Young to President Kimball---each received what he sought because of mighty supplication, which bringeth forth a broken heart and a contrite spirit.<br><br>Second, I think a person can judge if he's becoming mighty in the Lord and losing his propensity to sin by whether or not he is<i>becoming increasingly sober</i>--sober in the sense that Alma taught to his sons. I believe this means that our capacity for lightmindedness and frivolity simply decreases. Sacred things are more carefully handled, and taking the name of the Lord in vain is made nigh unto impossible. Respect increases for the Lord's anointed and for all duly appointed priesthood leaders, and honor for parents is made most genuine. The sober-minded individual, I believe, characterizes his life by increasing calm and subdued feelings, and greater reverence is shown for every living thing. Further, one gives up excess, extravagance, and exaggeration, and from major and measured self-control he emerges a temperate person.<br><br>I think the third vital sign of our changing disposition to desire no sin at all is<i>avoiding</i><i>contention</i>. Contention robs us of the Spirit. The less we fight back, the closer we come to the Lord. Most of you have roommates, and in dorms and apartments you develop what can be called "community property." Sisters, the last time you reached for<i>your</i>can of hairspray and found that someone else had used the last drop, how did you react? The big date was at hand and your hair was going to be a mess. And when Dad's letter came with no money in it but just counsel that those shoes would have to do for another month, did you think ill of your state of life? And brethren, how do you feel when someone else takes our<i>your</i>girl? Or better still, how do you feel when you are unfairly criticized or otherwise have your feelings hurt? Do you seek retribution? Do you fight back? Do you contend with the Lord or with your neighbor? When we can properly respond to these common occurences--so-called little things--then we will be responding to the Lord's dictum when he said, "And behold it is written also, that thou shalt love thy neighbor and hate thine enemy; But behold I say unto you, love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them that despitefully use you and persecute you" (3 Nephi 12:43–44).<br><br>Finally, I would name<i>malleability</i>. There are many words that could be used to express the sentiment--<i>submissive,</i><i>humble,</i><i>meek</i>--but so often we concentrate on the negative connotations of those words, and we conjure up in our minds the perfect milquetoast person. That's not what the Lord meant. Paul, I believe, has given an apt word picture to describe what I consider malleability, in these most significant words: "O man, who art thou that repliest against God? Shall the thing formed say to him that formed it, Why hast thou made me thus? Hath not the potter power over the clay?" (Romans 9:20–21). The malleable soul listens to President Kimball with an active ear, seeking how to obey his counsel rather than determining in what ways that message does not apply to him. When the prophet states that every young man should go on a mission, the malleable soul says, "How can I get ready?" The unmalleable seeks excuses in education or finance or marriage. Seek not to counsel the Lord, but to take counsel from his hand. Eventually, as with Job, we must learn who is the master and who the servant. When we can do that--when we can understand that the Savior's yoke is easy and his burden is light--then we can gracefully submit to being reforged in his image.<br><br>Now can we chart our progress in these areas? I think we can. I think we know if we are praying frequently enough and if we are really communing with the Lord. I don't think it's so hard to tell if we're sober-minded and if we've gained the maturity to handle sacred things properly. Surely we know when we are avoiding contention and if we are permitting the Lord to mold our lives. I submit we can know, if we seek to measure. Think of the words "Yea, we know with a surety. We believe these things, for the Lord has wrought a mighty change in us or in our hearts that we no longer have disposition to do evil but to do good continually."<br><br>I believe we can bring these thoughts to a meaningful close if we will simply look--and I would invite you to study it in your spare time--at the fruit of the labor of those who followed the commandments of the Savior at the time of his great preaching to the Nephites. After receiving these instructions, here is what happened to those wonderful people: Jesus prayed and said, "I pray thee that thou wilt give the Holy Ghost unto those who believe on my words." And as he looked upon them, their garments were made white, even as white as the garments of Jesus. And then he prayed again:<br><br><i>Father, I thank thee that thou hast purified those whom I have chosen, because of their faith, and I pray for them ... also ... who shall believe on their words, that they may be purified in me. ...</i><br><br><i>Father, I pray ... that through faith on their words they may be purified in me and be one with us.</i><br><br><i>And when Jesus had spoken these words he came again unto his disciples; and behold they did pray steadfastly, without ceasing, unto him; and he did smile upon them again; and behold they were white, even as Jesus.</i>[see 3 Nephi 19:28–30]<br><br>My brothers and sisters, may we seek the Lord with all our hearts, might, minds, and strength and experience this change of heart, which will culminate this assimilation process that the Prophet said was the hinge on which the door of salvation turns. I bear you a witness that Jesus is the Christ, that he lives, that he loves us, that he seeks our hearts to write his laws thereon so that we might be his sons and his daughters. This prayer I leave with you in gratitude for this testimony and all that I have in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>R.

<h1>ations—The Ultimate Power - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Thank you, President Oaks. This is a far cry from the old College Hall, where we used to have our devotionals when I attempted to attend this institution. I am deeply honored to be asked to occupy this brief time with you this morning. Truly there is no spot on earth with more significance for me than this campus, and there's no group of people for whom I have greater admiration and respect than those who lead this institution and carry forward its great works. I am grateful for the beautiful prayer--I need it--and for that lovely music.<br><br>When asked how he came to choose his special branch of scientific research, George Washington Carver, the famous Negro scientist, said:<br><br><i>When I was a child I would rise early in the morning and walk in the woods marveling at nature. I prayed and asked the Lord to reveal to me all the wonders of his universe. And although I continued to walk and to study, to pray, no great flash of understanding came to me. Finally, in desperation, I pleaded, "Lord, if you can't reveal all knowledge to me, at least help me to know some little thing--even the lowly peanut."</i><br><br><i>Well, the Lord answered me on that one. He said, "Now, George, you're getting down to your size."</i><br><br>In all modesty and humility, with due appreciation to a great man--Dr. Carver--I would like to state that the Lord has not challenged us with a peanut.<br><br>In spite of the fact that I am fully aware of the meaning of the statement that "the greatest vice is shallowness," I have the audacity this morning in this brief moment of time to title this discussion "The Ultimate Power." (The priesthood of our Heavenly Father, the organizations of the gospel, I preclude from this definition.) The ultimate power is not atomic energy nor gold nor money nor military might nor great industrial machinery nor great hordes of people. The ultimate power, my brothers and sisters, with which we deal--all of us deal--is called "mass communications." It is indeed a proper subject for this campus, above all campuses I know of, because you who operate it, have more of value to communicate to the world than anyone else I know. The world has more urgent need of what you have than any other institution of higher learning in all the world.<br><br>This ultimate power--mass communications--consists of three divisions, in my mind. I divide it into (1) facilities, (2) abilities, (3) motivations. Let's talk briefly about each of these points.<br><h2><b>Communications Facilities</b></h2><br>In our country we live in the millennium of communications technology. We have a glittering toolbox of communications instruments unequaled in all human history. But we live bordering the Dark Ages in our utilization of these marvelous instruments to communicate the basic value structure of an enlightened and wholesome civilization. Let's start with the facilities. We'll divide this into two sections: transmitting and receiving. To transmit, just in the United States alone we have over 1,700 daily newspapers, over 9,000 weekly newspapers, nearly 8,000 radio stations, 1,000 television stations, thousands and thousands of different types of magazines. We have books in abundance never before dreamed of--over $2.5 billion spent last year for them--and printing presses capable of spewing out thousands of books per hour. We have satellites; we have microwaves, cables, laser beams. Indeed we do have a glittering toolbox beyond imagination for transmitting.<br><br>The receiving side is equal in stature. In the United States we buy over 65 million newspapers a day. We have in our homes and automobiles over 350 million operating radios, and we bought over 35 million new ones last year. The average person listens to a radio over two hours a day. We have over 110 million operating television sets; 40 percent of our homes have over two sets. Last year we bought over 15 million new television sets, and in the average home this instrument is used over six hours a day. The average child in the United States spends 242 minutes daily in front of a television screen. We have utilization of these instruments beyond my comprehension, even though I've spent over 40 years in this business. Our tools for receiving communications are marvelous, indeed.<br><h2><b>Communications Abilities</b></h2><br>Now the second element of communications--the abilities. We have proven our ability to transmit and receive effectively entertainment knowledge of all kinds into the human brain through devices our ancestors could not imagine. Many gifted and dedicated people possess the "know-how" to utilize our great machines of communication to transmit types of material capable of attracting large audiences and to hold their attention for unbelievable amounts of time. Dr. David M. Blank, director of research for CBS, Incorporated, tells us that on the average each of us has about 2,600 hours of leisure time per year. Of those hours nearly 1,800 are spent with the radio and television, some 400 hours in reading. I emphasize that we have the abilities to transmit and to receive many types of entertainment and information that generate large audiences and consume much of their time.<br><br>We do know how to sell products and services and how to communicate all types of ideas, both good and ill, via these marvelous tools. But there are other types of materials equally or more important to our society that we seemingly do not know how to effectively transmit or receive or both--areas of vital subject material where we attract only small segments of our population as audience and in which only the very few seem to find any interest. This is the focus of my remarks today, for as I mentioned a few moments ago we do live in the millennium of communications technology. We do have a glittering toolbox of communications instruments unequaled in all human history, but we do live bordering the Dark Ages in our utilization of these marvelous instruments to communicate the basic value structure of an enlightened civilization. Some explanations for this strange paradox will be found in what I term the third element of this ultimate power we call mass communications--motivation.<br><h2><b>Communications Motivations</b></h2><br>The third category--motivation in transmitting and receiving--is where we really reach the core of this ultimate power. We are financially motivated! The advertising profession in the United States alone this year will take in over $25 billion in revenue. That's a substantial sum of money. We're motivated to use these tools for financial gain, and well we should be within reason. We're also motivated to use these instruments for political purposes throughout the world. It's our privilege to work internationally with many countries. What a great blessing it is to have the freedoms we still enjoy--even though they seem to be evaporating rapidly. The uses of mass communications for political purposes has been illustrated so forcefully in modern history. All of us should be familiar with the fantastic work of Joseph Paul Goebbels and recognize how his influence is still felt throughout the world. We should know how he studied our techniques of mass communications in this country and distorted them and perverted them so effectively in taking a very intelligent nation to destruction. More recently in history, our adversaries in Vietnam won from us a tragic military victory--our nation provided military resources ten times greater than those of our adversaries in that battle. Our defeat in that sorrowful event came, in my opinion, because we were out-communicated. (May I add a footnote here. In my opinion our adversaries of the collectivist world are our superiors in communicating the significant, basic values they believe in. In their efforts to triumph over us they seem to understand and utilize the power of mass communication better than we do.)<br><br>Undoubtedly our greatest challenge is to prepare effective programs dealing with the significant--and to discover how to motivate people to listen and view such programs. When we attempt to present programs that are beneficial, people shut off their sets because unfortunately to understand the significant world around us requires us to think. Some social scientists tell us that the average person is not capable of dealing with the significant. If that is so, it places an even greater responsibility upon you who have come to this institution. Your presence here is evidence of your ability to think and your concern with the basic values of human existence. In this area of communicating significant values, many people are deeply concerned. Dr. Frank Stanton, former president of CBS, Inc., and a great leader in mass communications, commenting about the development of the first telstar, said, "Unless the satellite is used to link minds in a significant way, it is utterly useless." No one could have said it better. For our complex, confused, intense world (our Heavenly Father's great schoolroom) requires us to match our fantastic machinery of communications with our superb talents and abilities and to deal with the significant issues and values of our day.<br><br>Our day is not so much different from that of our ancestors, going back through recorded history. How impressed I am with a communication from the Old Testament prophet Hosea, who lived in the Northern Kingdom of Israel 750 years before the birth of our Savior. He recorded what must have been a deep ache in his heart, saying, "My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge" (Hosea 4:6). So it is today in our world. What a travesty it is that, with all these marvelous communications instruments Heavenly Father has given us, we have to admit such is happening to us! We, too, are threatened by destruction for lack of knowledge! Unfortunately, we have overemphasized the development of the tools of communication, and we have failed to recognize the near vacuum of our abilities or our motivations to utilize these tools.<br><h2><b>The Challenges of Morality and Freedom</b></h2><br>In the brief time we have, let's be specific in highlighting a few areas of special importance. Our moral climate seems to be in rapid decay--most thinking people are concerned about it. Things are falling apart in many ways. We claim to be a Judeo-Christian nation, whatever that means. Actually we are a nation of religious illiterates. Dr. Gallup tells us that 67 percent of the adults in the United States cannot name the first four books of the New Testament, that 54 percent cannot even give you the name of one of the first four books of the New Testament, that less than 20 percent of the adults in the United States can give you the name of an Old Testament prophet. Surely our communication system has the power to correct this most serious deficiency. Look at our escalating crime rate, our drug problems, hideous as they are, with alcohol and its slaughter on our highways alone. We're ineffectual in communicating solutions. There are problems of divorce and the need for more effective educational programs. These are only a few of the problems which are damning the human family and where we lack the ability to communicate helpful solutions.<br><br>We're not motivated, it appears, either in transmitting or in receiving, to destroy the curse of economic illiteracy that plagues our nation. Luther Hodges--former secretary of commerce under President Kennedy, former governor of the state of North Carolina, former president of Rotary International--in a scathing attack on our economic ignorance states that "only one adult in twenty in the United State of America knows enough about our economic system to vote intelligently." In fact, he said, "We are a nation of economic boobs." We are locked in mortal warfare with a counter economic system which seeks to destroy us and which is making immense headway all around us in the world and in our own country as well because of our economic illiteracy. The current serious economic situation we face--we watch the news flow through our radio and TV facilities. We're stunned because those who would lead us in Washington and other places seem to be masters of obfuscation and stifle us with much heat and little light. There's practically no light at all being cast, and we see evidences of tragic distortions. Do we know what causes inflation, truly? Dollar devaluation? Productivity? Our energy crisis? How ridiculous is it that 68 percent of the people in the United States believe that the oil companies have caused the energy crisis. That is only one of many, many fallacies we could mention. How ridiculous to watch the environmentalists block our development of our energy. I was in the White House recently for a briefing, along with eighteen other broadcasters, and Secretary Morton tried to explain to us why our energy situation today is actually worse than it was when the oil embargo was imposed. Our government people apparently aren't interested in or capable of communicating the facts to us, or else we're not interested in or capable of receiving them, because he made a startling statement. He said that the development of energy in this nation is effectively paralyzed by the legal actions of the environmentalists. We're getting no place. Imagine blocking off-shore drilling! Seventeen thousand off-shore wells have been drilled, with only four major spills in all that record, and yet you'd think that the entire ocean had been covered with oil. These are tragic facts, my brothers and sisters, and they apply to the gospel of Jesus Christ because economic freedom is an integral part of it.<br><br>Our competitive enterprise system in the United States is now considered by some to be a controversial matter insofar as radio and television are concerned. Some tell us we cannot release items over the air defending our competitive free-enterprise system unless we find someone to speak equal time against it. Can you imagine that? Truly we can be destroyed; we are being destroyed for lack of knowledge, and that's why you on this campus are more important than any other group on the face of this earth.<br><br>I wish all of you could have sat with me when for nearly an hour in one of our Inter-American Association of Broadcasters board of directors meetings, I watched a man who formerly operated successful television and radio stations throughout Cuba. This man, my old friends of many years, asked for the microphone to be placed on the table, sat before us, and took off his coat. I didn't understand why he wanted to sit down but I soon did. For over forty-five minutes he poured out all the anguish I've ever heard come out of a human soul. He soaked the front of his shirt with his tears as he told us how he, because of apathy, had permitted freedom to be destroyed in his great land. He didn't care about what it did to him, he said, "but what I did to my children and my children's children--this most precious of all gifts." Do we feel that strongly about freedom? Again, I repeat, you have more to communicate of the significant in basic human values than any other installation or institution of higher learning in the world. The world desperately needs to know the value structure found on this campus, which is based on the gospel of Jesus Christ.<br><h2><b>Communication of the Gospel Message</b></h2><br>The Lord has made very plain to us what he expects us to do. I suppose each of us looks at the scriptures from the particular field in which he spends most of his time. The Lord has told us many times specifically what he wants us to do about our knowledge. He said, "Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven" (Matthew 5:16). What a profound challenge! I call your attention to one simple word--<i>so</i>. He didn't say, "Let your light shine before men"; he said, "Let it<i>so</i>shine before men that they will see your good works." What does that mean? It means that he's telling us to be effective in our communications of the applications of his truth. What have you done? You have special opportunities, and so do I. Those of us in broadcasting have frightening opportunities when we realize the millions of people we reach. Some of the things we're very happy about, such as the fact that tens of millions of people in Latin America know about Brigham Young University because your basketball games are televised on seventy-six stations throughout that continent. Yes, we have special opportunities to<i>so</i>shine. We have magnificent opportunities to be that light upon the hill that he asked us all to be. I also tell you it's humbling and frightening to a degree I cannot describe.<br><br>I'm pleased to give you a brief report of our team that we have in the Bonneville operation. We attempt to put that light upon a hill and to<i>so</i>shine about the good works that always follow those who attempt to live the gospel of Jesus Christ. I would like to preface this portion of my remarks with a thought contained in an ancient Arabic legend about a spindly sparrow lying on its back in the middle of the road. A horseman came by, dismounted, and asked why the sparrow was lying upside down.<br><br>Replied the sparrow, "I heard the heavens were going to fall today."<br><br>"Oh," said the horseman, "and I supposed you think your puny little bird legs can hold up the universe.<br><br>Replied the sparrow, "One does what one can." That's the way we feel: We do what we can. That's the challenge to each of us, isn't it?<br><br>May I show you two things that have happened that are very pleasing to us. A Gabriel is the highest award given by the Catholic Church for excellence in communications. My wife, Peg, and I had the opportunity of stopping off at a university campus in Detroit less than a month ago and receiving, not one of these, but two of the twenty Gabriel awards given for outstanding broadcasting excellence in the United States. We made a clean sweep of the top awards for public service, both radio and television. But this is recognition from our peers that perhaps our works are worthy--praiseworthy, to some degree. We hope they are. We humbly acknowledge the blessings of our Heavenly Father in our feeble efforts to work in broadcasting. And we pray with all our hearts that in some small way these works may glorify our Father which is in heaven. Now, that is one award. Just a week or ten days ago came another. This is called the "Clio." It is the highest award given by the Association of National Advertisers--most of the big companies in this country. It is given for excellence in many categories, and this represents the highest award given--the sweepstake award--for public service broadcasting. It was given to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints for radio and television programming prepared under contract by Bonneville. This is a trophy--an emblem that we are very proud to have won. We hope that it serves as a spur for more.<br><br>Each of us must do the best he can in the areas where he operates. But truly the "ultimate power" the mass media are waiting for is the graduates from this institution to come and show them how to communicate more effectively light and truth on the significant elements of the human experience. Truly the world is waiting for the rays of that light the Lord has asked us to put upon the hill. The world is waiting for us to<i>so</i>shine that all people may understand the priceless gospel of Jesus Christ! Millions are diligently groping in search of answers. You in this room and on this campus have more answers than any other group of people in this whole world.<br><br>In concluding, I would like to repeat the words of the Jewish Theological Seminary in New York. I've mentioned them on this campus on prior occasions, and they are so appropriate:<br><br><i>Do you say, "There is nothing I can do about the problems of this world--nothing?" This is a common mistake, for there isn't a single world problem that does not begin right where you are. And always you can diminish or add to it. Not to be aware of this, not knowing the difference you make, is in itself one of the biggest of all world problems. We are the descendants of great men who recognize their obligations to fight ignorance, poverty, and oppression everywhere. We must do no less, for we are the generation to whom greatness of heritage and opportunity have been given, so each of us faces these questions: How shall we pass on this heritage? How will it be diminished, or will it be increased? Will we be the grandparents or only the grandchildren of great men?</i><br><br>How effectively we utilize the "ultimate power" of mass communications will determine in large measure the answers to these questions.<br><br>Our knowledge and our skills and our attitudes should go toward heeding the words of the Lord that we are a light upon a hill, and we should<i>so</i>shine that others, seeing our good works, will glorify him. May all of us be diligent in learning and applying and communicating the precious truths of the gospel of Jesus Christ in all we do, I humbly pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen<br><br><i><i>Arch L.

<h1>and Personal Liberty - Robert D. Hales - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
It is always a difficult occasion for me to ask our Heavenly Father that I might have the Spirit to say those things that are proper at a time like this. I know that God lives. I know that Jesus is the Christ. To communicate that to others is very easy. The difficult part, for you young men and women who are about to embark on your two-year missions, is how do you get somebody else to feel that Spirit. Because this Spirit respects free agency, you cannot force somebody to believe; he has to have free agency. What does that mean in a free land?<br><br>I thought today (and I will come back to this subject of free agency as it applies to each of us individually) that because it is July 6 we should spend a minute or two reviewing our history and the reasons why we can assemble here today in such a free way. We are a free people because of what we have just celebrated, an event that happened 199 years ago--the signing of the Declaration of Independence.<br><h2><b>Our Heritage of Freedom</b></h2><br>Possibly Patrick Henry summed up the tensions of that time as he spoke to the Virginia Convention of Delegates on March 23, 1775. I will read excerpts from his speech. It is familiar to many of you who are history students. He said:<br><br><i>I know of no way of judging of the future but by the past. And judging by the past, I wish to know what there has been in the conduct of the British ministry for the last ten years, to justify those hopes</i>[that there will be reconciliation].<i>. . . Ask yourselves how this gracious reception of our petition comports with these war-like preparations which cover our waters and darken our lands. Are fleets and armies necessary to a work of love and reconciliation? Have we shown ourselves so unwilling to be reconciled that force must be called in to win back our love?...</i><br><br><i>They tell us, sir, that we are weak; unable to cope with so formidable an adversary. But when shall we be stronger? Will it be the next week, or the next year? Will it be when we are totally disarmed, and when a British guard shall be stationed in every house? ... Sir, we are not weak, if we make a proper use of the means which the God of nature hath placed in our power. Three millions of people, armed in the holy cause of liberty, and in such a country as that which we possess, are invincible by any force which our enemy can send against us. Besides, sir, we shall not fight our battles alone. There is a just God who presides over the destinies of nations; and who will raise up friends to fight our battles for us. The battle, sir, is not to the strong alone; it is to the vigilant, the active, the brave. ... There is no retreat, but in submission and slavery! Our chains are forged! Their clanking may be heard on the plains of Boston! The war is inevitable--and let it come! I repeat it, sir, let it come!</i><br><br><i>... Gentlemen may cry peace, peace--but there is no peace. The war is actually begun! ... Is life so dear, or peace so sweet, as to be purchased at the price of chains and slavery? Forbid it, Almighty God! I know not what course others may take; but as for me, give me liberty, or give me death!</i><br><br>That is why we are able to gather here this day--because men have been willing to give their lives--as stated in this impassioned speech of Patrick Henry--for liberty, for life, and for the pursuit of happiness.<br><br>There are three questions that Patrick Henry's speech brings up: (1) Was this really a holy cause of liberty, as he said? (2) Is there a just God, who presides over the destinies of nations? (3) Is free agency important? Should we have liberty, or should we have bondage? To all three questions, for those of us who are here this day, the answer is an emphatic yes. Free agency is important. We know that there is a God who presides over this world and who looks after the destinies of nations.<br><br>Six hundred years before Christ an ancient American prophet foresaw the establishment of the colonies and the War of Independence. This is what he said:<br><br><i>And it came to pass that I, Nephi, beheld the Gentiles who had gone forth out of captivity did humble themselves before the Lord; and the power of the Lord was with them.</i><br><br><i>And I beheld that their mother Gentiles were gathered together upon the waters, and upon the land also, to battle against them.</i><br><br><i>And I beheld that the power of God was with them, and also that the wrath of God was upon all those who were gathered together against them to battle.</i><br><br><i>And I, Nephi, beheld that the Gentiles that had gone out of captivity were delivered by the power of God out of the hands of all other nations.</i>[1 Nephi 13:16–19]<br><br>Another ancient prophet outlined the principles upon which the freedom of this land depends:<br><br><i>For behold, this is a land which is choice above all other lands; wherefore he that doth possess it shall serve God or shall be swept off; for it is the everlasting decree of God....</i><br><br><i>Behold, this is a choice land, and whatsoever nation shall possess it shall be free from bondage, and from captivity, and from all other nations under heaven, if they will but serve the God of the land, who is Jesus Christ.</i>[Ether 2:10, 12]<br><br>It is clear, therefore, that to preserve our liberty, our national freedom, and ultimately our personal free agency, we have a responsibility to serve God.<br><br>Are there any among us who would disagree with the founders of our nation or who would say that they were not inspired and dedicated men? The Lord, in a revelation to Joseph Smith, stated this truth simply: "I established the Constitution of this land, by the hands of wise men whom I raised up unto this very purpose" (D&amp;amp;C 101:80).<br><br>Do you realize the heritage that we have? On July 4, I had the opportunity of giving a talk in St. George. There the words of President Wilford Woodruff came to my mind, his great tribute to our founding fathers:<br><br><i>Those men who laid the foundation of this American government and signed the Declaration of Independence were the best spirits the God of heaven could find on the face of the earth. They were choice spirits, ... inspired of the Lord.</i><br><br><i>... Every one of those men that signed the Declaration of Independence, with General Washington, called upon me, as an Apostle of the Lord Jesus Christ, in the Temple at St. George, two consecutive nights, and demanded at my hands that I should go forth and attend to the ordinances of the House of God for them. ... Would those spirits have called upon me, as an Elder of Israel, to perform that work if they had not been noble spirits before God? They would not.</i>[<i>Conference Report</i>, April 1898, pp. 89–90]<br><br>Said they, " ... We laid the foundation of the government you now enjoy, and we never apostatized from it, but we remained true to it, and were faithful to God." [<i>Journal of Discourses</i>, 19:229]<br><br>Knowing that this is a choice land, a nation with a divine mission, founded under the guiding hand of God the Father and his Son, Jesus Christ, we ask, "What is our obligation to preserve the tenets of the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, and the Bill of Rights?" I thought I would make a comment or two about what the basic tenets of these documents are. I would hope that every one of us here this evening would take the time some evening on a date to read the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, and maybe a few other things. (I noticed in reading from the history of the Church that Brigham Young at the July Fourth celebration had the whole Constitution read before the people started their festivities. I noticed at St. George we did not do that.)<br><h2><b>The Declaration of Independence</b></h2><br>The Declaration of Independence states:<br><br><i>We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness--That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed,--That, whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive to these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or abolish it, and to institute new Government.</i><br><br>Does that sound familiar? Haven't we seen it working in our day, in the past few years? And then the signers said this: "With a firm reliance on the protection of divine Providence, we mutually pledge ... our Lives, our Fortunes and our sacred Honor." The signers of this document knew that they were putting their lives foremost with their beliefs.<br><br>This document was the prelude to the American Revolution, which started on the field of Lexington, a small skirmish on April 19, 1775, and which ended six years later, in 1781. The colonial troops started as few as 3,000. They built up to as many as 17,000 at one time, and over 400,000 men enlisted for short periods during that time, with 5,000 dying for their liberty.<br><br>I would like to make one comment about the British. I think it is very unfair that we think we Americans were the ones who generated freedom of religion in the colonial culture. Actually, our British heritage is the reason we do not have a state religion today. During the seventeenth century, for instance, the Puritans in Massachusetts persecuted anyone who did not accept their church. They assumed that they had the only correct religion and that everyone else must accept it or be persecuted. The need to entice settlers, however, and the economic conditions were also important. The colonies needed to have more settlers; so they became more tolerant in their religious beliefs. But more importantly, the English Toleration Act of 1689 granted the right of public worship to all Protestants. Since all English liberties applied to the colonies, such toleration had to be established here. The Puritans chose to ignore this particular act for some time and continued to persecute the Baptists and the Quakers, but from 1731 through 1734 the Puritans were forced to come into line with English practices. And so religious tolerance entered the colonies.<br><h2><b>Our Inspired Constitution</b></h2><br>After the war came the Constitution. I would like to mention only one thing in connection with the Constitution. The Constitution set apart, as you know, the legislative, the judicial, and the executive branches of government. They formulate and administer the law which all of us live under. William E. Gladstone, the nineteenth-century British statesman, once said that the Constitution was "the most wonderful work ever struck off at a given time by the brain and purpose of man."<br><br>I think Mr. Gladstone would be interested to know that it was not written only by just men, for it also had the help of God. When the Constitution was being written and the revolutionary war was being fought, there were fourteen to fifteen hundred miles of colonies from New Hampshire to Georgia--all embodying different beliefs and started under different charters. To unite them in this document took four months of very hard work, and there was discouragement.<br><br>One of the most striking features of this particular document is the fact that it allows for representation in two ways. We would have representation according to what has been called the magnificent concession. In the early days of the convention, Roger Sherman of Connecticut proposed this solution to the knotty problem of representation--that the members of the House of Representative would be elected on the basis of population and the Senate on the basis of equality of states, with two senators per state. His proposal was considered and voted down. But as you know, it was later approved.<br><h2><b>The Bill of Rights and Free Agency</b></h2><br>Now, let's ask what happened after the Constitution had been established. Let's go on to free agency and the Bill of Rights. There were a hundred proposals for amendments to the Constitution. Forty to fifty were eliminated as duplications. Seventeen were approved by the House in the First Congress; twelve were approved by the Senate; and finally, ten were approved by all the state legislatures and became the Bill of Rights.<br><br>The first amendment provides for freedom of religion, freedom of speech, freedom of the press, the right peaceably to assemble, and the right to petition the government for redress of grievances. We are able to gather here this evening because of this amendment. I have lived in countries where we could not gather more than twelve people without a permit. Had we wanted to change our permit for any reason, it would have been turned down.<br><br>The second amendment concerns the right to bear arms. The third amendment ensures that during times of peace no soldiers will be quartered in our houses without consent of the owner--and in times of war, only according to the law.<br><br>The fourth amendment stipulates that there should be no unreasonable searches and seizures and no warrants except for cause; no person can be held to answer for a capital crime except by an indictment by a grand jury (except military personnel during war or public danger). The fifth amendment guarantees that there should be no double jeopardy and that persons cannot be held as witnesses against themselves nor deprived of life, liberty, or pursuit of happiness without due process of law. Private property cannot be taken for public use without just compensation. The sixth amendment guarantees the right of the accused to have a speedy trial by an impartial jury, to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation, to confront the witnesses against him, and to have defense counsel. The seventh amendment concerns the rights to jury trial if the value of the controversy exceeds twenty dollars. The eighth amendment protects us from excessive bail or cruel and unusual punishment.<br><br>The ninth amendment provides that we are not denied of any rights not specified in the Constitution, for these rights are retained by the people, not by the government. The tenth amendment states that the powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution are reserved to the states or to the people.<br><h2><b>Bondage Versus Freedom</b></h2><br>We, then, are responsible for what this nation is and what our communities are. Let me ask a question in that regard: "What do we do when we find that our freedoms are imposed upon?"<br><br>I would like to describe to you, if I may, a place where I took my son--the Berlin Wall. We drove out and walked onto a metal platform and then onto a wooden platform, and then we were up in the air possibly forty or fifty feet. As we looked out across the Berlin Wall, we saw barbed wire. We saw fields that were mined. We saw tank embankments that stopped trucks and tanks from leaving, not from coming into, the walled area. We saw guards with dogs and with searchlights, towers were there were guards looking at us through binoculars as we looked back at them. They had machine guns and guarded the wall.<br><br>Let me make this recommendation to any young man or young woman--and I say that to you only after having been in international work for fifteen years. If you ever get disillusioned about your country, please take a trip abroad. Live there, and then after five years, return home, as I did. Then I would like to ask you, as you enter into the sight of the Statue of Liberty, to be emotional. The reason I say that is this: The man who made the Statue of Liberty, Frederic Auguste Bartholdi, had, as a young man, seen a young lady with a torch in her hand jump onto a barricade during a French rebellion. There she was shot, and she died setting the barricade on fire. Thirty years later, as he sailed into the harbor of New York, he conceived the idea of a tribute to America from France, a statue symbolizing<i>Liberty Enlightening the World</i>. He thought of the young girl with the torch in her hand, and that is how the statue of liberty was conceived.<br><br>The Statue of Liberty has in her left arm a tablet, with the inscription July 4, 1776; in her right hand she holds the torch of freedom; and in the base is inscribed a poem by Emma Lazarus: "Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free." What has happened recently with the refugees from South Vietnam could not have been a better fulfillment of the vision of that fine lady who stands in the harbor of New York City.<br><br>Emma Lazarus's poem also declares, "I lift my lamp beside the golden door." How do we hold the lamp of freedom? Do you place yourselves in such a position that you cannot exercise your free agency?<br><br>All we have talked about to this point is only a preamble as we begin to discuss ourselves and our own free agency, which these documents proclaim and protect. Joseph Smith could not have restored the gospel without freedom of religion. Do you think it an accident that Joseph Smith was born just a few years after our land had become free and after we had gained these documents ensuring our unalienable rights? No, it was not an accident.<br><h2><b>The Right to Reject</b></h2><br>With your freedom of speech, do you do this?<br><br>1. Do you place yourself and your families in a position where you have no alternative but to listen to television programs, or view movies, or read magazines or books that are degrading? Our free agency can be used for accepting or rejecting; we may avoid evil.<br><br>2. But there is also something positive we can do about this problem. We are in a position to express our personal beliefs in public forums and in elections. Our founding fathers in New England used town meetings. Today every citizen still has the right to discuss an issue as a citizen of the community in a town meeting. Do the communities that you come from have such public forums for freedom of speech? Does your legislature (and do you by your vote) put in the kind of men who will protect that right?<br><br>3. Moreover, we are in a position to withdraw personal time and financial support from those books, movies, television programs, magazines, and political and public establishments that do not uphold the standards of a free people.<br><br>I would also like to pose the problem that the total freedom of one person may be an oppression of another's freedom. And I ask this question: Should we tolerate an individual's saying, printing, and doing whatever he wants (and say that he deserves freedom) without bounds or restraints of any moral sensibilities? Let's think about that for a moment. That does not seem to be an easy question, but the answer is easy. A justice of the Supreme Court summed the problem up this way, in essence, after the court had worked for weeks trying to come up with a definition of pornography: We cannot agree on what the legal definition of pornography is, but show it to us and we know what it is.<br><br>Do you realize that pornography today takes up $550 million of the public's money? One basic truth that I have learned over my twenty years in business is that the devil himself will not participate in any venture, such as pornography, that does not make a profit.<br><br>The other day I went down to a grocery store on an errand. I bought about a pound of plums, which was my little venture on the side (it was not on the list), a loaf of bread, and one other item. The total came to $2.55. (I can remember when my mother with $5.00 could fill two grocery bags that I could not even hold.) There I was with this little bag that cost $2.55. And as I was checking out, I looked across the stand; and there were magazines that absolutely appalled me. I could not understand how a proprietor of a store could tell his own young son or daughter that that display represented freedom.<br><br>I ask you today, young men and women, what are our freedoms? We have the freedom to accept or reject. We should talk directly to the offenders about what our rights are as well as what theirs are. Isn't that fair? If they are offended, aren't they the ones who become the bigots?<br><br>Let me give you a few examples that I have noticed in my life. First of all, most of us are part of that famous silent majority. We are pushed around, for example, by the vociferous minority's profanity. Have you ever sat with your family in a restaurant and heard profanity to the point that you could not take it any longer? Have you ever thought of turning to somebody and saying, "Sir, do you mind? I have my wife and children with me." I will tell you that the majority of people, when it is called to their attention, admit that they use profanity completely unknowingly. It is a part of their way of life, but they will be shocked if someone reminds them.<br><br>When a workman steps into your car or your home, he may have conditioned a reflex to pull out a cigarette and smoke it. I have found that not one of them is offended when I remind him that his smoke will permeate our clothing. I can tell you, the odor of one cigarette smoked in our home by a workman remains in our home (or our car) for days. Once he realizes that, he is understanding. Why aren't we willing to express our freedom (and be kind about it) to others?<br><br>When a person sitting next to you on an airplane asks, "Do you mind if I smoke?" it is easy to say, "I really would." The shock on his face comes from the fact that he usually has the cigarette out and a match lit. But when you exercise your rights, he pauses, and then you can start telling him why you do not smoke and explaining a few of your own beliefs. He will enjoy it. Nobody wants to offend knowingly, but smoking is a conditioned reflex.<br><h2><b>Reflexes and Freedom</b></h2><br>I want to talk about conditioned reflexes in our own personal lives. As young pilots, we sat for hundreds of hours in Link trainer airplanes. When the fire-warning light came on, we had to turn all of the switches off and save our lives within eight seconds. That developed a conditioned reflex. When the light came on, we literally went through the motions of turning off all the switches. For about three years I thought that was a large waste of time on my part--until the fire-warning light came on as I was on takeoff row. I can remember my crew chief saying to me, "I have never seen a man get all the switches off and be out with his parachute and raft in less than ten seconds." And I said, "have you ever been in a burning airplane?" That is the motivation you need.<br><br>Now, I want to talk to you about your conditioned responses and your fire-warning light. As you leave here this evening, as the young man turns up the canyon instead of toward the dorm, does a fire-warning light come on? I once heard a young lady say, "Well, what can I do when that happens?" I say, "Wear a very comfortable pair of shoes." I mean that. All of you young men, I would ask that you would not be the cause for the fire-warning light to come on in a young lady's life.<br><br>What is your preconditioned response when someone hands you a cigarette or a beer? I was talking with a young man recently and asked, "Why have you used such bad language?"<br><br>He looked down, a bit chagrined. "Well, I was just going along with the crowd."<br><br>My only answer can be, "That's the wrong crowd." If those are the kinds of things you need to do in order to be friendly with your peer group, you are in the wrong peer group. You had better be alone rather than with them. That is difficult to say because loneliness and depression are probably two of the most difficult things we have to face in life. But it is better to face problems alone than with that type of crowd as you go down life's road.<br><br>Many of you young ladies are looking for a partner, and young men the same. There is only one thing worse than not being married in the temple of God, not being sealed for time and all eternity; that is being married to the wrong person. If you do not believe me, talk to someone who has made that mistake. I can only repeat: There is only one thing worse than not being married, and that is being married to the wrong person. Think carefully who you are going to give yourself to, because it should last for time and all eternity.<br><h2><b>Free Agency and Obedience</b></h2><br>Too often we think of free agency as something that lets us do what we want. We know that this idea is not true; we have found that out in life. I would like to give you a little story. As one of the younger General Authorities, I look up to the other General Authorities. I am number forty-seven out of forty-nine. We look to the Twelve, the Twelve look to the First Presidency, the counselors in the First Presidency look to the President, and he looks to Jesus Christ and God the Father. That's the way it must be in our lives. We must establish where we are going to look for direction and where we are going to get the direction for free agency. Are we going to get it from our peer group? Are we going to set up rationalizations to make life more comfortable? Oh, my brothers and sisters, the commandments of our Heavenly Father are there for one reason; they are there for one purpose--to save us from those things that will ultimately destroy us.<br><br>Look at the commandments as positive things, not as things that say, "No, you can't do this," or, "no, you can't do that." Let's look at commandments in a way you have perhaps never looked at them before. Do you realize why we have tithing? Tithing is here so that each one of us, even as students, has as much right to go to this institution as anyone else in the Church or in the world. We can go to any temple and share just as much.<br><br>I was in a chapel in the East that we bought a few years ago. When I was there I noticed that in front of the podium was the name of the family who had given the podium. On the glass behind me in that chapel was the name of the family who had donated the beautiful stained-glass windows. Even the cedar of Lebanon walls had the names of those who had donated.<br><br>Do you realize that tithing is there so that each of us owns equally in anything the Church possesses? When you go up to the twenty-sixth floor of the Church Office Building, you own as much of that building as Mr. Marriott. He is a great man, but I want you to know that he does not possess any more of any building than any of us. He is the kind of man who understands that, and that is what makes him great.<br><br>Do you realize that if you pay your tithing you will never have money as your number-one-goal? Maybe you are going to have to live a few years to think about that, but let me say that to you. If you will pay your 10 percent tithing and use the rest of the 90 percent, you will never have to worry about money because you will learn how to budget and live within your means. Money and wealth are insatiable. I have known men who, after they had the half-million-dollar home and the yacht and the airplane, would then want other possessions. They were never satisfied, and they went into debt millions of dollars satisfying that need. Why? Because they had not learned the law of sacrifice and the law of consecration at the lowest levels. That is what tithing is. What the Lord tells us is that if we cannot live the law, we are not ready for greater laws.<br><br>Brothers and sisters, let us ask ourselves about moral laws. Why are they there? They are there for one reason: to protect us. Do you realize what happens in your life when you get diverted on moral issues? You whole eternal progress changes. You have to wait until you can repent and come back, and valuable time is lost in your progression. There is nothing as dangerous as a fallen lighthouse. When you give your life and yourself to someone, do it totally. Even if you have made a mistake at this time, the miracle of forgiveness is there and it is real. You can come back; that is what President Kimball writes in his book<i>The Miracle of Forgiveness</i>. There is a beautiful story about a bird who, when a man came along selling worms, took a few inconspicuous feathers under her wing and gave them to the man because it was so easy to buy the worms. But as time went on, she ran out of the little inconspicuous feathers. Pretty soon she had to take one of the key pinfeathers on her wings. She could no longer fly to the top of the tree and sing. Then the man who sold the worms was not to be found because she had lost her beauty. She could not sing from the high treetops and fly. Do you want to give away your morality a little feather at a time until you lose the beauty that is yours, the beauty you should keep for that one person for time and for all eternity? It is not worth it. It will absolutely consume you if you are not willing to repent.<br><br>What is it that makes us listen to the commandments of our Heavenly Father? You know, I love Alma because, although he was rebelling with the sons if Mosiah, he still repented. He was striking out against his father. His father not only prayed, but he had his congregation pray, and you know the story: An angel appeared to him. Later that same Alma, who had worked against his father, who had repented and then gone on a mission, was talking to his sons. This is what Alma said as he talked to his three sons: "If you keep the commandments, you will have happiness in your life. If you do not, you will be cast out" (see Alma 36:30; 37:13; 38:1; 41:10–11). That is the simplest advice a father can say to his son or daughter.<br><br>As we exercise our free agency, it is free agency to keep the commandments of our Heavenly Father. It is for our growth and our protection. If we do not keep the laws, as we know, with every law there is a counterpart punishment that we suffer.<br><br>Knowing that, we can look at the commandments of our Heavenly Father and ask, in all love and care and in our prayers, as Alma instructed his sons: "Oh, my sons, pray every night and every morning" (see Alma 37:37). He told us how to pray. That is the key. We must pray and stay close to our Heavenly Father. Too often when I was a bishop (and I was a bishop three times over the years), I went to conference and looked up at the General Authorities and said to myself, "Wouldn't it be nice to be a General Authority" They have it made. They have no problems as I do."<br><br>I was at a conference and a young person asked me, "What is your greatest problem?" My greatest problem, like yours, is having the Spirit with me always. May I remind you that you took the sacrament today. What did you say then? You said, and you were promised, that if you keep the commandments you will always have the Spirit with you. That is how simple that particular obligation is.<br><h2><b>Endure Grief and Suffering Patiently</b></h2><br>As for General Authorities, let me digress for one moment.<br><br>You know, I have been to four funerals since April. I have seen the wives of General Authorities go, and I have seen a great General Authority leave us and leave his wife alone. It would be very easy for someone to say, "Why me?" It is the same thing that Job could have said. But I want to let you know that within two or three days after Elder Cullimore lost his wife, when I climbed on an airplane with Elder Ashton to go up to Ricks, there sitting in the first row, first seat, was Elder Cullimore going to his assignment. There is a message there for a young man or a young woman. It may be ten years, it may be twenty, it may be thirty, but the time will come when that lesson must be learned either by you or by your wife. None of us wants to face it, but we have leaders who show us how.<br><br>Have you had any problems recently in terms of physical disabilities? We recently set apart a mission president, and there was a sweet daughter in a wheelchair, who while on her mission had had an automobile accident. She was paralyzed from the neck down. Mom and Dad are now being called on a mission and she is going back on a mission. President Rex Reeve and his daughter showed Elder Hunter and me a great testimony. Beautiful, happy, smiling, she could have been just lying down the rest of her life. But she said, "I prayed only to sit in a wheelchair, and my prayers have been answered." That showed us a great deal.<br><br>How many of us would have the same attitude she did? Or do we feel sorry for ourselves and then see that as an excuse for why we do not keep commandments? If we do not get the young lady we want or the young man we want, do we get down on our knees and pray about it, or do we go and do something foolish?<br><br>May I ask in closing that we exercise our free agency in a free land, that we know what our beliefs are, that we know God lives and Jesus is the Christ. Oh, how we know that!<br><h2><b>President Kimball</b></h2><br>We have a leader as a prophet who has told us to lengthen our stride. He is a man who is a prophet, Spencer W. Kimball. How do I know that? By having been around him a very short period, but also by having observed him and heard stories about him for many years.<br><br>On my first stake assignment, the stake president told me this: "You know, when President Kimball was first assigned as a prophet and an apostle, he came to our house. My father was the stake president at the time. It was 5:30 in the morning, and we heard hammering. Out on our little shed at the back of our house where we needed some repairs was Elder Spencer W. Kimball--hammer in hand, nails, and shingles, repairing the roof." On my next call, when I went to a particular stake where the lawn needed mowing, I almost felt as if I should have brought a lawnmower along because that is what the prophet had shown us. President Kimball has been dedicated--throughout his open-heart surgery, his cancer. And all of the afflictions that he has had could have caused him to give up. But he has dedicated every hour of every day so that this Church might move forward.<br><br>It is my prayer and my blessing that each one of us might get the vision of President Spencer W. Kimball, that we might know that he has dedicated every hour and every day of his life. He is impossible to slow down. For his next trip for area conferences Elder Fyans and those that are were making the schedule tried to put in two free days. Do you know what the President did? He put two mission tours in those days. It is impossible to slow him down. He is also an example to all of us. The time is late, and he is telling us that we must quicken our step and lengthen our stride.<br><br>I ask the Lord's blessings to be with you, and I leave a simple testimony with you once more. I know God lives. I know that Jesus is the Christ, that Joseph Smith was brought forth in a free land at a time when it was opportune for him to restore the gospel. We have the responsibility of living the commandments. May we be able to do this without any firewarning lights in our lives and without being fallen lighthouses for those who love us. There is nothing so dangerous as that fallen lighthouse. May the Lord bless us that we might always be an example to our younger brothers and sisters and to our parents. For you elders and sisters as you embark on your missions, may I say that there are many mission you will embark upon but none greater. May the Lord's blessings be with you, I say in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Robert D.

<h1>ng a Personal Relationship with the Savior - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Brother and sisters, this is a delightful experience for me today. I don't know when I've been more terrified and frightened. I feel a little like the cowboy who rode into town and shot up the place and jumped on his horse and rode off in all directions. But I hope with all my heart that I might have that presence of mind and that presence of Spirit which will allow me to share with you some of the feelings and the ideas I have relative to developing a personal relationship with the Lord.<br><br>I appreciated the introduction this morning. There happen to be on the stand two men who have been the two most effective teachers in my life. I wouldn't want to embarrass them by calling them by name, and so I won't mention President Robert K. Thomas and Dean Chauncey C. Riddle. As a young freshman at BYU, I took my English class from Brother Thomas. He touched my heart, set my spirit on fire, and I determined in my heart I was going to do everything I could to measure up to the kinds of things he suggested we could measure up to. As the years have slipped by, I have had the opportunity of being continually fed by Brother Riddle and stimulated by his insight into the gospel.<br><br>I'm also grateful that I can have my wife here today. I appreciate her so much. Brother Thomas indicated that we anticipate the coming forth of our tenth child, which will make our third son. (Should he be a girl, it's because you laughed.) On the basis of the number of children we have, I have concluded that to offset the power of women in our household I'd have to have another 113 sons.<br><br>Not long ago I was with my wife in Carson's Market, we were getting some groceries, and I was negotiating with a local banker so we could swing the deal. Truman Madsen came up behind us, we got to chatting, and I said, "Have you ever met my wife?"<br><br>He said, "No, I don't believe I have, but I would like to," so I introduced them. Then he said, "How many children do you two have?"<br><br>I said, "We have nine."<br><br>The next thing I heard, and I think everyone in the store heard it, was Truman saying, "Eighty-one months of pregnancy!" My wife and I have never viewed it in quite that perspective; consequently we collapsed. But we are delighted with the beautiful experience of having a family.<br><h2><b>Testimonies of the Savior</b></h2><br>Having this opportunity today brings back a lot of fond memories. My heart has really been touched over the years as I've had the opportunity of hearing men speak at BYU devotionals. I'll never forget, as a young man, listening to the great prophet David O. McKay as he gave a stirring sermon on the bread of life. How it touched my heart. How stimulated I was by what he had to say about the Savior. How I hoped with all of my heart that somehow the Savior might become my bread of life, that somehow I might be able to partake of his divine nature, that somehow I might be able to take advantage of my membership in the Church and ultimately put on the nature of Christ and become like him. In fact, over the years, of all the ideas and all the concepts I have been exposed to, none has touched my heart, none has stirred me with such great determination to try to do the things that I felt the Lord would have me do as much as those ideas that pertain directly to the living reality of the Savior.<br><br>I remember one occasion at Salt Lake City in old Barrett Hall. I was going on a mission. There were about 250 of us listening to different Brethren speak. Finally, at a particular hour, one stood and spoke. I had a testimony at that time. I knew that Jesus was the Christ. I knew that the Church was true, that Joseph Smith was a prophet of God, and that this Church was headed by prophets. But on that occasion, without fanfare, without visual aids, quietly and powerfully, he shared with us his feelings about the Lord. I vowed in my heart that someday I too would know the Lord even as he. As a result of that one talk I set out on a quest to know the Lord and to know him well--a quest which has changed my life more than any other effort.<br><br>I think of a beautiful experience of Elder Melvin J. Ballard which occurred while he was serving as a mission president in the northwestern states. He had gone over to the Fort Peck Indian Reservation to take care of mission business. He and his counselors had fasted that they might solve some problems that had come into existence on the reservation. After much fasting and prayer, and after making the best decisions they could, Brother Ballard then got on the train to go back to Portland, Oregon. In the dreams of the night, he found himself in what I would assume to be the Salt Lake Temple. He was in conversation with a group of men. After a period of time an individual came over to him and said that it had been requested of him to go to an adjoining room to meet another individual. Brother Ballard said he opened the door to this adjoining room, and as he looked into the room, he saw seated upon a raised platform the most glorious person he had ever seen. As he entered the room this individual arose and smiled and softly spoke his name. Brother Ballard said that this individual came right up to him and put his arms around him and embraced him and kissed him. Brother Ballard at that moment felt a love so intense that he thought the very marrow of his bones would melt. He said he then fell at the feet of this individual, and, seeing the wounds, he knew he was in the presence of Jesus Christ. Throughout the rest of his life he bore powerful witness to the effect that he would be pleased to give all he had and all he could ever hope to have if he could have the privilege of dwelling in the presence of Christ forever. Brothers and sisters, how that touched my heart.<br><br>I was standing in a beet field on another occasion in Idaho, doing some irrigating. I pulled out of my pocket a crumpled piece of paper and read the account of Lorenzo Snow having the opportunity of being visited by the Master in the Salt Lake Temple. As I read that account, there came to me an assurance that that indeed did occur, that Lorenzo Snow did see the living Christ, that he did converse with him, that he obtained knowledge and power and understanding from him. Again, how my heart was touched with that particular experience.<br><br>As I have attempted to understand what the role of the Church is, my feeling is that the fundamental message of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is to declare that Jesus Christ lives, that he is indeed the Son of God, that he has appeared in our day, that men and women today can know him, that they can know him better than they know anyone else on the face of the earth, that he can have a greater impact on their lives than the combined influence of anybody else. I believe with all of my heart that this is the fundamental message: that in the Master strength can come, that in him men and women can become all that they were potentially created to become--that is, very gods. But it's through a personal relationship with the Savior that that's accomplished.<br><br>I love Joseph Smith. I'm grateful for his mission. I revere his name. Oh, I would some day that I might be sufficiently faithful to be able to walk up to him and shake his hand and express appreciation for what he has done. That appreciation would be housed in the framework, "Joseph, through you, through the Restoration, through the grace of our Heavenly Father and his Christ in raising you up, you placed me in a position where I might know who the Master is. Oh, I rejoice for your mission, for your calling, for the role that you performed so marvelously as a prophet." I feel the spirit of Joseph Smith moving to and fro in our day, in effect tapping men and women on the shoulder and saying, "Would you, too, discover who he is? Would you, too, learn how to communicate with him as I did and do? Would you feel his power? Would you become filled with his love as I have? Would you know that in all I did, the reason I did it is so that I might be a living witness that he lives?" In fact, Joseph summed it up so beautifully: "This is the testimony, last of all, which we give of him: That he lives!" (D&amp;amp;C 76:26). The purpose of the programs of the Church, the purpose of the ordinances and the principles, and everything that is done in the church and kingdom of God, will only find its creative fulfillment if members somehow will accept the challenges that they can know who the Lord is and that they can have a marvelous relationship with him.<br><h2><b>The Savior's Example</b></h2><br>Many people have had a great influence in my life, for which I am grateful. I can't help but think of President Joseph Fielding Smith. On one occasion he was asked, "Who, President Smith, has had the greatest influence in your life of anyone?" Very quickly President Smith came back with, "Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ has had the greatest influence in my life." Oh, again, brothers and sisters, what a delight to belong to a church and a kingdom that testify so vividly and so powerfully of the possibility of a personal relationship with the Creator of this earth, a relationship that will give us the power and the ability to accomplish everything that the Lord would have us accomplish. I don't know that we could ever adequately express the gratitude that ought to be in our hearts for that restored knowledge, for that available power, for that available relationship with the Lord.<br><br>Brigham Young once said:<br><br><i>The greatest and most important of all requirements of our Father in heaven and of his Son Jesus Christ, is . . . to believe in Jesus Christ, confess him, seek to him, cling to him, make friends with him. Take a course to open and to keep open communication with your Elder Brother or file-leader--our Savior.</i>[<i>Journal of Discourses,</i>8:339]<br><br>Then I think, brothers and sisters, of the great apostle Paul, about the mightiest missionary that the world has ever seen. He was a man trained in the ways of the world, having been taught by great teachers--a man who had a marvelous mind but who was touched by the finger of the Lord and as a result of that experience summed up his feelings about life. In speaking to the Corinthians, he said, "I determined not to know any thing among you, save Jesus Christ, and him crucified" (1 Corinthians 2:2).<br><br>I'm sure I echo your feelings when I share with you the feelings that came to me as I read with real intent for the first time the Book of Mormon. Oh, how Nephi came alive! It was as though Nephi were telling me in person, "George, I want you to know that I've seen the Lord. I want you to know that I've talked with him, that my spirit has been carried away on high mountains, that I have been filled with his power, that it was through him I've been able to accomplish the things I've been able to accomplish." Along with that witness I felt so strongly coming from him, I also felt I could hear him say, "George, I want you to know that you, too, can know him as I do. I want you to know that the reason I have written and testified of these things is so that you might determine to your heart that ultimately your relationship with the Master will be even as mine. That is the purpose of my intent, to testify of the God of Israel, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob." Brothers and sisters, how touched I have been by Nephi's testimony.<br><br>In the Book of Mormon, Moroni, after speaking about the mansions that are prepared on high and the great love of the Lord, wants to emphasize to us that he knows whereof he speaks, and he attempts to do that by speaking of judgment day and his personal relationship with the Lord:<br><br><i>Then shall ye know that I have seen Jesus, and that he hath talked with me face to face, and that he told me in plain humility, even as a man telleth another . . . concerning these things . . . .</i><br><br><i>And now, I would commend you to seek this Jesus of whom the prophets and apostles have written.</i>[Ether 12:39, 41]<br><h2><b>Christ the Center of the Church</b></h2><br>Now, brothers and sisters, recognizing that the Savior is the center of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and that everything points to him, I should like to share with you a scripture that has triggered many insights in my life. Nephi says, "Behold, my soul delighteth in proving unto my people the truth of the coming of Christ; for, for this end hath the law of Moses been given; and all things which have been given of God from the beginning of the world, unto man, are the typifying of him" (2 Nephi 11:4). In other words, brother and sisters, as we take a look at the scriptures, every major experience that God has had transpire between him and us is to typify or point to Jesus Christ.<br><br>Let me refer first to the law of sacrifice that was given to Adam. Everything in the law of sacrifice was to point the minds of the children of God to the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ, to help them appreciate and realize that somehow (and we don't totally understand how) there is no remission of sins, there is no breaking of the bands of death, there is no possible way men and women can overcome the effects of the Fall and become clean and filled with his Spirit save it be through the shedding of blood. The sacrificing of all of those animals from the time of Adam to the time of Christ was to help men and women realize that ultimately in a person, in a man, in a divine being, would come the source of redemption as he, even Christ, shed his blood.<br><br>I think of the experience of Abraham, commanded to offer up his son, Isaac. On many occasions I have gathered one at a time my young sons on my lap. As I held them, in my mind I recounted the experience of Abraham offering up his son. I have felt deeply the personal implications of Abraham having been commanded to do that. I have felt, by the quiet witnessings of the Holy Ghost, the overwhelming impact of what it meant for the Father to send his Son. Much of that impact has come as I have studied and reflected and prayed on that great experience of Abraham offering up his son Isaac.<br><br>I think, brothers and sisters, of Moses standing on a mountain (actually an elevated piece of land) high enough that everyone could see him. Poisonous serpents had gone among the children of Israel; many were losing their lives because of the bite of those poisonous serpents. Moses, standing on this piece of elevated land somewhat parallel to the piece of elevated land where the Master would hang on the cross, spoke for and in behalf of Jehovah. He invited everybody to look at him, to listen to his words spoken under the inspiration of the Lord. He asked them to look at the rod and the brazen serpent that was on the rod, and he promised that if they would look they would be saved. Again, the lesson that incident teaches is that only in the Master, only in looking to him, only in being respectful of his anointed, only in recognizing that his prophets speak in his behalf and being respectful of what they have to say and doing it, can we through Christ be saved.<br><br>I think of the manna coming down from heaven, typifying the ultimate bread of life which would come in the form of Christ. Our manna today can be seen in the form of the sacrament. Oh, the power that will flow from the Master, the divine nature that will come from him into our lives, the changes that will come through that simple ordinance, the sacrament, if we can catch the significance of the life and the mission of the sacrifice of one Jesus Christ.<br><h2><b>Church Ordinances to Lead to Christ</b></h2><br>Now, brothers and sisters, in the Doctrine and Covenants is a particularly significant scriptures relative to the goal of the Church which I would like to share with you. I, like you, am appreciative of the good lives of men and women across the width and breadth of the earth. I'm grateful for their feelings for the Lord, grateful for their willingness to live and abide by the light that they have. But, brothers and sisters, our witness to the world concerning an understanding and comprehension of the life and the mission of Christ, compared to the understanding that the world has, is the difference between the brightness of the sun and the moon. This is why the Church was restored. Again, with all due respect and feeling for what the Christian world has, I know how much more comprehension and power could be theirs if people would accept the message of the Restoration. I think this message is beautifully portrayed in the following verses:<br><br><i>And this greater priesthood</i>[<i>speaking of the Melchizedek Priesthood</i>]<i>administereth the gospel and holdeth the key of the mysteries of the kingdom, even the key of the knowledge of God.</i><br><br><i>Therefore, in the ordinances thereof, the power of godliness is manifest.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 84:19–20]<br><br>The Church today says that through the instrumentality of the Prophet Joseph Smith and the restoration of the priesthood the very key to the knowledge of God has been brought back to the earth. Once again men and women can know who the Lord is and can relate with him in a total and complete kind of way, but they can't relate with him save they obtain through the ordinances of the gospel of Jesus Christ the power of godliness. It's for this reason, brothers and sisters, that we go forth teaching the world that no one--be he ever so good--will ever know fully the hands of one who has divine authority, save he enters the waters of baptism through the hands of one who has divine authority, save he searches the scriptures and humbles himself and seeks mightily for a revealed knowledge and understanding of the Lord so that he might exercise faith in him.<br><br>Every ordinance in the gospel is a channel of power to us if, as we function in those ordinances, we develop in an ever-increasing way a personal relationship with the Lord. But those ordinances won't change our lives unless we know who he is. They can't touch us in the manner they ought to do unless somewhere along the line he really comes alive. The power of redemption isn't in the ordinances per se; the power of redemption isn't in the Church per se. The ordinances and the Church are a means to an end, channeling the power that can flow from the Master. The degree to which you and I know him and relate with him and give our lives to him is the degree to which that power will flow through the ordinances and principles. Oh, brothers and sisters, I know that's true. I know we're finally saved by the blood of Jesus Christ, but we must have the ordinances.<br><br>We have a divine organization, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. If we'll see the Church as a means to and end and simultaneously look to the Lord with all of our hearts, then every ordinance that we participate in will be a blessing, will lift us, will change us, will qualify us to become more and more like the Lord. However, some of the time we find ourselves getting caught up in the machinery of the Church. Some of the time we get caught up in the theology of the Church, in the programs. Some of the time, because we get caught up in those things, we fail to realize that, unless somewhere along the line the image of the Savior becomes emblazoned on everything we see and everything we do, then the great purpose for that divine organization and its divine principles will be nullified.<br><br>Let me liken membership in the Church to the possession of a beautiful, powerful car. In fact, it's the finest car money can buy. We love to get in it and drive around; there is a great deal of satisfaction in just owning it. We obtain so much satisfaction in possessing the car that we fail to realize the car was given to us as a means to an end, not an end in itself. It was given to us to make the most important journey in our lives. SO it is with the Church. It's a beautiful, successful organization capable of bringing many blessings into our lives, but the<i>main</i>reason we were given the Church is so that we might make the journey from where we are to where the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ is, that we might learn who he is and exercise a mighty faith in him!<br><br>What a challenge to make sure we realize the Church must be a divine launching pad to Christ, that the Church is a means to an end, that it may be possible to be converted to the Church without being converted to the Lord, but it's never possible to be converted to the Lord without being converted to the Church. If you go all the way to the Lord, you'll see the Church is the only means whereby ultimate redemption will come to the world--the only means.<br><h2><b>Spiritual Rebirth</b></h2><br>The fundamental process by which the Lord and his divine church can accomplish their destined purpose is through the scriptural doctrine of being born again. If an individual will enter the waters of baptism and receive the gift of the Holy Ghost and then with all his heart search the scriptures and serve in building the kingdom--recognizing his dependency on the Lord even to the point of having a broken heart and contrite spirit--then the heavenly element of the Holy Ghost will cleanse him of his sins and free him from ignorance. His body will be clean and a veritable temple for the Spirit to dwell in constantly. As the full experience of being "born again" transpires, one becomes a son or daughter of Christ, having been spiritually begotten of him. In fact, brothers and sisters, that's the time when the Lord really becomes personal, because marvelously enough, amazingly enough, through the ordinances and the principles and this experience of being born again, you and I can partake of the divine nature of Christ. We can have his image engraved upon our countenances. Through that process we then stand in a position to solve our problems, to free ourselves from our personality idiosyncrasies, to discover who we really are. We can pick up a sense of destiny. Through that experience, brothers and sisters, there will be no question in our minds that in Christ we can find the solutions to<i>every</i>problem that comes into our lives and that in him we can do everything he asks us to do. In that experience we will see the Lord as the fountain of<i>all righteousness.</i><br><br>The gospel, in a sense, is composed of two different kinds of truth. There is what we refer to as the doctrine of Christ, that is, those principles and ordinances we need to know and participate in to become clean from sin and to partake of the special powers of the Atonement. It is the doctrine of Christ that is distinctive to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. The second dimension of truth in the gospel is the moral and ethical truths, which truths are found essentially in every great and good system of thought on earth. When the prophets speak of the "power of godliness" that's available in the gospel, they are referring to the doctrine of Christ. If we, having obtained testimonies of the gospel, will immerse ourselves in the doctrine of Christ--that is, resolve to comprehend by revelation the meaning of the first principles and their relationship to Christ--then we will acquire, as an endowment from the Spirit, a celestial dimension of moral and ethical character. However, if after acquiring our testimonies we then spend endless hours in a humanistic, secular approach to living the good life we can never--worlds without end--go above or beyond the development of a terrestrial character.<br><br>Some of the time I am deeply troubled in my heart when I see members of the Church approach the gospel as though it were simply a moral and ethical system. True, it is a moral and ethical system, but it's also much more than that. As President J. Reuben Clark put it powerfully in 1938 in Aspen Grove:<br><br><i>We use the tithes of the Church to carry on the Church school system, and these are impressed with a holy trust. . . . The tithing represents too much toil, too much self-denial, too much sacrifice, too much faith, to be used for colorless instruction of the youth of the Church in elementary ethics. . . . Students fully sense the hollowness of teachings which would make the gospel plan a mere system of ethics, they know that Christ's teachings are in the highest degree ethical, but they also know they are more than this.</i>[<i>The Charted Course of the Church Education,</i>8 August 1938]<br><br>Years ago President McKay, as a young member of the Sunday School general board, was going over to the islands. The evening before arriving he stood on the deck of the ship and marveled at the beauty of God's handiwork. The clouds overhead were tinged in pink, and the islands in the distance were like velvety diamonds. He said, "Is there anything more beautiful than this?" As he thought about it, he said, "Yes, there is something more beautiful than this. The character of men and women who know who Christ is is more beautiful than this. The innocence that you see in children's eyes is more beautiful than this." That night, after he retired, he saw in the dreams of the night what he referred to as the eternal city. He said he saw people dressed in long, white, flowing robes, moving along through a gate into that heavenly city. Off to one side he saw the Master, even Christ. He was some distance away, but he couldn't see the Savior's features clearly and wondered who these people were who were moving in through the gate. As though his mind were being read by the Lord, the Lord raised his hand and drew his attention to the writing of the gate: "These are they who have overcome the world--who have truly been born again."<br><br>President McKay in general conference in 1960--speaking to members of the Church, those who had gone down into the waters of baptism and had had hands laid on their heads but who perhaps for one reason or another hadn't persisted in paying the price to grow and develop in the endowments of the Spirit so that it could be said of them that they were truly born again--said:<br><br><i>May God grant that . . . members of the Church everywhere resist temptations that weaken the body, that destroy the soul, that we may be born again; that our souls might bask in the light of the Holy Spirit, and go on as true members of the Church of Jesus Christ until our mission on earth is completed.</i>[<i>Conference Report,</i>April 1960, p. 29]<br><br>What a challenge! From my perspective, brothers and sisters, just from what I see, I think the greatest need in the Church is for the members of the Church to be truly born again, to be quickened by that heavenly element of the Holy Ghost, to grow in the stature of Christ, to acquire his qualities and his characteristics--as Peter put it, to partake of his divine nature.<br><br>In that setting, then, could I share with you a quote of Brigham Young's about what would happen if we tried with all of our hearts to live under the influence and power of the Holy Ghost? (I remember hearing President McConkie say it ought to be the goal of all members of the Church to so live as to have the Spirit with us at all times.) President Young made a statement that I would like to read because of the simplicity of the message. (Jacob 4 says that the Jews tended to look beyond the mark and therefore had the simplicity of the gospel taken away from them, and they stumbled.) Brigham recorded a dream in which he went to visit Joseph Smith, who said:<br><br><i>Tell the people to be humble and faithful, and be sure to keep the spirit of the Lord and it will lead them right. Be careful and not turn away the small still voice; it will teach them what to do and where to go; it will yield the fruits of the Kingdom. Tell the brethren to keep their hearts open to conviction, so that when the Holy Ghost comes to them their hearts will be ready to receive it. They can tell the spirit of the Lord from all spirits; it will whisper peace and joy to their souls; it will take malice, hatred, strife and all evil from their hearts; and their whole desire will be to do good, bring forth righteousness and build up the kingdom of God. Tell the brethren if they will follow the spirit of the Lord, they will go right. Be sure to tell the people to keep the spirit of the Lord; and if they will, they will find themselves just as they were organized by our Father in Heaven before they came into the world. Our Father in Heaven organized the human family, but they are all disorganized and in great confusion.</i>["Journal History," 23 February 1847]<br><br>What a beautiful experience, brothers and sisters, testifying again that the fundamental process by which human nature is changed is really quite simple. This process consists of having faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, forsaking our sins, keeping the commandments, being filled with the Spirit, partaking of the divine nature of Christ, really becoming like him--the greatest personality of all. If we want to change our personalities, if we want to come alive, if we want to get excited about who we are, why not touch home base with the greatest personality of all, even the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ? Finally, it's only he who can change human nature. Oh, it's true we can change human behavior, but changing human behavior is a lot different form changing human nature. Only the blood of Christ can place us in a position to have our nature changed.<br><h2><b>Personal Knowledge of the Savior</b></h2><br>Brothers and sisters, for several years I have read this particular verse: "Verily, thus saith the Lord: It shall come to pass that every soul who forsaketh his sins and cometh unto me, and calleth on my name, and obeyeth my voice, and keepeth my commandments, shall se my face and know that I am" (D&amp;amp;C 93:1). I've heard the Brethren bear witness to the truths of that particular statement. I've pondered in my mind what it meant. I know how careful one needs to be in seeking for certain experiences, but as I read that scripture, and as I look at my involvement in the Church and the involvement of those that I have great respect for, I see men and women who in their minds and in their hearts are convinced that ultimately they can know the Lord fully and totally. Ultimately they can see him. They know that he lives by the whisperings of the Spirit.<br><br>Because they know that he lives, they're pleased to forsake their sins, to come to him, to obey his voice, to do all of the things that he would have them do, but there's a lively hope in their hearts and ultimately they will see him. Brothers and sisters, I believe in the ideal with all of my heart. I believe that there's something lifting, something tremendously soul-transforming that occurs to us when we determine in our hearts that someday we're going to know the Lord, that we're going to see him, that sometime we're going to have a total and complete relationship with him, and that someday we'll be able to stand up and say we have a perfect knowledge that he lives. By the time that we can bear that testimony, we can rest assured that he has worked a mighty work in us, that he has changed us, that we will have been transformed into his image.<br><br>In conclusion, I'm convinced in my own mind that the great key by which we can obtain the power and develop the relationship with the Lord that he would have us have is prayer. Some years ago I read this inspiring statement of Joseph Smith's: "It is the first principle of the gospel to know for a certainty the character of God, and to know that we may converse with Him as one man converses with another" (<i>Documentary History of the Church,</i>6:305). One that occasion there came a witness to my soul that it is possible to converse with the Lord as one man converses with another. We can call upon the Father through Christ and have a marvelous relationship with the Lord. Knowing Joseph couldn't lie, I determined in my heart that I would try to develop that kind of communication.<br><br>Could I, brothers and sisters, bear witness to you that I know that if every day with great fervor and great determination we will go to the Lord in mighty prayer, lifting up our voice, pleading with him that we might be filled with his Spirit and that we might be instruments in his hands to bless and to strengthen and to build his kingdom, if we will go to him with the kind of intensity that will suggest that we want that more than anything in life--then gradually, beautifully, quietly, the Holy Ghost will distill upon our hearts that strength, that peace, those qualities and characteristics that will enable us to do his work. Oh, I know that is true! I know it with all of my heart. I know even as I know that God lives, that Heavenly Father hears and answers prayer, that personal revelation is real, that the veil can become thin so that you and I can see mighty things, that he's pleased to bare his arm, even Jehovah, so that we might know he is a god of power and that in him we can accomplish all of the things he would have us do. Oh, I know that with all of my heart.<br><br>Joseph Smith, on one occasion while he was away from home and away from his wife, wrote in a letter to Emma:<br><br><i>My situation is a very unpleasant one although I will endeavor to be contented the Lord assisting me. I have visited a grove which is just back of the town almost every day where I can be secluded from the eyes of any mortal and there give vent to all the feelings of my heart in meditation and prayer. I have called to mind all the past moments of my life and am left to mourn and shed tears of sorrow for my folly in suffering the adversary of my soul to have so much power over me as he has had in times past, but God is merciful and has forgiven my sins and I rejoice that he sendeth forth the Comforter unto as many as believe and humble themselves before him. I was grieved to hear that Hiram had lost his little child. I think we can in some degree sympathize with him but we all must be reconciled to our lots and say the will of the Lord be done. Sister Whitney wrote a letter to her husband which was very cheery and being unwell at the time and filled with much anxiety it would have been very consoling to me to have received a few lines from you. But as you did not take the trouble I will try to be contented with my lot knowing that God is my friend. In him I shall find comfort. I have given my life into his hands. I am prepared to go at his call. I desire to be with Christ. I count not my life dear to me only to do his will.</i>[6 June 1832, Chicago Historical Society]<br><br>In a sense, brothers and sisters, there's really only one principle of the gospel of Jesus Christ, and that's faith in Jesus Christ. In a sense there's only one law, and that's obedience to Jesus Christ. And in a sense, there's really only one endowment, and that's charity, the pure love of Christ. I know with all my heart that--if we will take advantage of our membership in the Church and will search the doctrine of Christ, serving the Lord with all of our hearts, carrying a heavy load of responsibility as we try to climb the mountain of spirituality--as time goes on the living reality of the Savior will be the greatest reality in our lives, and we will see him as the center of all things. He will be the home of our heart, and in him we will have the ability to help Zion put on her lovely garments. As the Savior said, "Therefore, hold up your light that it may shine to the world. Behold I am the light which ye shall hold up" (3 Nephi 18:24). May we do that in his power. May the Lord bless you that you might grow and increase in the knowledge and stature of him after whom this Church is named and through whom we can have the power ultimately to become sanctified and perfected. I say this humbly and express appreciation for being with you today in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>George W.

<h1>rd for My People - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
It's a great privilege for me to be here this morning. I am always more thrilled when I am in the presence of the young people of the Church because there is such promise among them, and I am very blessed and feel honored to be on this campus.<br><br>Summer students, it seems to me, must be rather special. Although tradition is changing, it is rather usual to go to school during fall, winter, and spring. So those who go in hot June, July, and August indicate to me that they are really anxious about an education and are making a serious endeavor. I'm also aware that the great genealogy seminary is being held, and those of you engaged in this betterment of self are among choice people. So I have a great respect for you this morning because I look upon you to be among those who are truly the leaders and anxious to make a contribution to life.<br><br>What an exciting, wondrous time to live and to learn and to love. Such a day! There is such an outpouring of the Spirit of the Lord, and it is such a wonderful time to be worthy to enjoy and receive the blessings from him.<br><br>When I mentioned to some of the young people of my family (former BYU students) that I was to have this opportunity, they counseled: "Talk about courtship and marriage--that always turns them on." I suppose that's a true statement. It seems to me that courtship and marriage turn on the whole world.<br><br>I'm not going to talk about courtship and marriage, but what I say could have an effect on your courtship and marriage. And I pray the Lord will help me influence your thoughts and feelings in the way he would have it.<br><h2><b>A Spirit of Remembrance</b></h2><br>There is a special spirit of reminiscence in this land today. Call it the bicentennial commemoration of the birth of the nation or whatever. But people young and old are concerning themselves with the past and the heritage and the foundation of this nation. History is being reviewed and dramatized and relearned.<br><br>The arts of the past are being revived. Lately, old things have become priceless: ten-gallon milk cans, old butter churns, quilts, blacksmith forges. The founding fathers--Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson, John Adams--are enjoying a popularity. Take for example some of Franklin's sayings that I've heard recently:<br><br><i>He that lieth down with dogs shall rise up with fleas.</i><br><i>God heals and the doctor takes the fee.</i><br><i>An empty bag cannot stand upright!</i><br><br>We are being brought to a new appreciation of the Lord's purposes for this nation in that the Constitution of this land was established by wise men raised up for this purpose and this land was redeemed by the shedding of blood.<br><h2><b>The Challenge of Establishing Zion</b></h2><br>This movement of relating the past to the present and learning again the reasons for the founding of this nation is timely and has purpose. There is more to it than a commemoration. For in this day a living prophet of the Lord has lifted his voice, which has been miraculously preserved, and there is an urgent call from him to each of us as he strives to extend our vision regarding our assignment as a church to prepare this nation and the world for the coming of the Savior--to further establish Zion in preparation for his coming.<br><br>The very air is vibrating with the challenge, and while it is exhilarating, it is also sobering. And you who are of his chosen ones, because you have chosen him, are on the threshold and the firing line, and you have so much to do. There is a call for everyone from the Lord. Listen to it. President Spencer W. Kimball in the just-passed historic June Conference said:<br><br><i>Truly, we have become a global Church. ...</i><br><br><i>And now we seem to hear the voice of our Savior calling, "Now you are established and have become successful. ... Gird up your loins and go forth and teach the gospel to the whole world, leaving no soul without an opportunity."</i><br><br><i>The Church has grown and now it is ready to put on its beautiful garments and go preach the gospel and we call upon all members of the Church, old and young, to accept the challenge and to assist in this great, prolonged, and relentless effort.</i><br><br><i>"Zion must increase in beauty, and in holiness; her borders must be enlarged; her stakes must be strengthened."</i><br><br><i>When we are asked by the Lord to enlarge the borders of the Church, that means not only more stakes, more missions, greater missionary work, but greater effectiveness and security within by having more and more of our members, young and old, more fully converted and in control of their lives and less tossed about by the trends of time. When the Lord asks us ... "to strengthen our stakes," he means just that. For the stakes of the Church are where the Zions of today are found.</i><br><br>He further said in the recent mission president's seminar:<br><br><i>The spirit of this work is urgency and we must imbue in our missionaries and our saints the spirit of NOW--"N-O-W." We are not just waiting for the natural slow process of bringing people into the Church. We must move rather hastily.</i><br><br>We are to move toward the establishment of Zion. Zion when perfected will be as the prophet Moses said:<br><br><i>And the Lord called his people ZION, because they were of one heart and one mind, and dwelt in righteousness; and there was no poor among them.</i>[Moses 7:18]<br><br>What would it be like to read a newspaper story like this:<br><br><i>And there were no contentions in the land, there were no envyings, no strife, nor tumult, nor whoredoms, nor lyings, nor murders?</i>[<i>See</i>4 Nephi 15–16]<br><br>Could we believe it?<br><br><i>... and surely there could not be a happier people among all the people who had been created by the hand of God. ... They were in one, the children of Christ, and heirs to the kingdom of God.</i>[4 Nephi 17]<br><br>This is the scriptural description of the condition of the ancient people in this land for two hundred years following the Savior's appearance to them. They waxed strong, became an exceedingly fair and delightsome people, and they were married and given in marriage and were blessed according to the promises that the Lord had made unto them. This wonderful life existed for the same length of time as the period since the independence of our country--two hundred years.<br><br>Because of their righteousness and blessings they had become exceedingly rich, and there began to be those who were "lifted up in pride" such as the wearing of costly apparel and all manner of fine things of the world. They began to be divided into classes and build up churches unto themselves to get gain and began to deny the true church of Christ.<br><br>The account says it took just ten years after they began to be divided into contentions for persecutions and the denying of Christ to take place. They cast the disciples into prison, and the people hardened their hearts and were led by false priests and prophets. They didn't just dwindle in unbelief, but they did willfully rebel against the gospel of Christ and their children were taught to hate. Does that sound like our day--false priests and prophets, denying Christ, rejection of religion, hate and violence?<br><h2><b>The Spread of New Social Values</b></h2><br>Along with the exciting move to appreciate and renew our heritage in this country there are powerful and, it seems, almost all-pervading forces at work to see that a people are not fit to receive the Savior. A recent valid research study, entitled<i>The New Morality--A Profile of American Youth in the 1970s</i>, reflects the vast changes in the complexion and outlook of an entire generation. It shows that the so-called set of new values which were incubated on the nation's campuses in the upheaval of the 1960s have now spread to the entire youth generation. I choose to believe "majority" rather than "entire" youth generation.<br><br>These new values were identified as--<br><br>1. Acceptance of more liberal sexual mores.<br><br>2. Lessening of automatic obedience to and respect for authority.<br><br>3. A rejection of church as a source of guidance for moral behavior.<br><br>4. A great preoccupation with self at the expense of sacrificing one's self for family, employer, and community.<br><br>The study serves to focus, define, and emphasize what is apparent all around us through practically every medium: literature, television, movies, newspapers, advertising, and observation of lifestyles among the people. The extreme and offensive values born on the volatile campuses in the 1960s have in these few short years, months really, been accepted and espoused by masses of the population. A significant observation of this study is that<br><br><i>Our prediction that the process of diffusion of the old and the new might take decades and even a generation to accomplish has been proven incorrect, and we are amazed with the rapidity with which it is taking place and by the challenges it poses to society.</i><br><br>Nearly everywhere I go I find young people who are seeking and searching, a little determined to do their own thing, confused by conflicting values, and greatly swayed by the statement that "everybody's doing it."<br><br>Not long ago I listened to a handsome Indian young man say that the Indians are trying to discover who they are and what they are by going back home. Perhaps this could be said of many more than only Indian people.<br><br>Doesn't the prophet say the call is urgent and the need is<i>now</i>for every member to be fully converted, in control of his life, and less tossed by the trends of time?<br><h2><b>Standards for a Covenant People</b></h2><br>For our guidance the Savior revealed the following to the Prophet Joseph Smith:<br><br><i>And even so I have sent mine everlasting covenant into the world, to be a light to the world, and to be a standard for my people, and for the Gentiles to seek to it, and to be a messenger before my face to prepare the way before me.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 45:9]<br><br>An everlasting covenant, or the gospel, is given as a standard for his people. In the work of the Aaronic Priesthood and the Young Women we are vitally concerned with standards. Nearly always when we ask a group to respond to the word<i>standard<b>,</b></i>they relate it to standards of dress and grooming, and the discussion centers around defining a standard in terms of inches. Many of the letters we receive request, almost demand, a firm statement about just how long dresses or hair should be. Is this really what the Lord was referring to when he said "an everlasting covenant as a standard for my people"?<br><br>For the Savior further said of this everlasting covenant:<br><br><i>Come ye unto it, and with him that cometh I will reason ... and I will show unto you my strong reasoning.</i><br><br><i>Wherefore, hearken ye together and let me show unto you even my wisdom. ...</i><br><br><i>... and I will speak unto you and prophesy.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 45:10–11, 15]<br><br>As we go forth to withstand the whirlwind of radical moral and social changes which oppose the everlasting covenant, here are some of the standards for his people:<br><br>1. We believe in God the Eternal Father, and in his Son Jesus Christ, and in the Holy Ghost. That is basic.<br><br>2. We are the spirit children of God with the promise of inheriting his kingdom and through righteousness have the opportunity to become his literal sons and daughters, taking upon us his name. We are affiliated with organized religion and look to the Church as a guide for moral conduct.<br><br>3. We are obedient to and respectful of proper authority. The priesthood is the power and authority of God delegated to his worthy sons for the blessing and governing of both men and women and we honor it. We also believe in being subject to kings, presidents, rulers, and magistrates in obeying, sustaining and honoring the law.<br><br>4. The home and family are the basis of a righteous life. Men and women were created by God different from but complementary to one another, in order to make it possible for children to come into the world and be nurtured and loved by a father and mother, each with their singular, and yet one, responsibility in parenthood. The father bears the priesthood and is responsible to guide, bless, protect, provide for, and be the head of the family. "For this cause shall a man leave father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife" (Matthew 19:5). The mother is to bear and have primary responsibility for nurturing and influence the children. "And thy desire shall be to thy husband" (see Genesis 3:16).<br><br>Is there anything more acceptable, more beautiful, and more reassuring than a marriage relationship based on priesthood principles in righteousness as it grows majestically and matures? Look at the marriage of the prophet. And to think there are those who advocate sexual freedom and no marriage! "The rights of the priesthood are inseparably connected with the powers of heaven, and ... the power of heaven cannot be controlled nor handled only upon the principles of righteousness" (D&amp;amp;C 121:36). In other words, priesthood operates on a standard of righteousness. When one undertakes to cover sins, gratify pride or vain ambition, or exercise control or dominion or compulsion upon another soul in any degree of unrighteousness, the Spirit withdraws and the priesthood cannot operate (see D&amp;amp;C 121:37).<br><br>Priesthood holders, then, have an awesome responsibility. If they are unrighteous and therefore unable to exercise their priesthood, families, other priesthood bearers, women, and children will be deprived of the necessary and vital blessings and ordinances. A priesthood bearer cannot ordain himself, cannot administer to himself, cannot call or set himself apart to a position. He can help perform these vital ordinances and functions for someone else, but he is dependent on others for them.<br><br>For women also, there is no way decreed by our Father in heaven for them to receive the precious and essential blessings of the priesthood to which they have a right except through righteous priesthood holders. Therefore, one of the greatest works and missions of women is first to live by a standard of righteousness themselves and be able to influence priesthood bearers--fathers, brothers, husbands and sons, friends--to live righteously. Then the rights of the priesthood which are connected to the powers of heaven can be controlled in her behalf. If only every young woman could know this as she enters the marriage covenant! When the scriptures say, "Thy desire shall be to thy husband," that desire would be for the priesthood which her husband bears to be so magnified in righteousness that she and her children could be the recipients of the most profound and perfect blessings of heaven. If only every young woman could understand how important it is and what a powerful role is hers!<br><br>A sad but revealing story is that told in the words of Elder George A. Smith, a member of the Quorum of the Twelve, in conference, April 6, 1856:<br><br><i>The wife of Thomas B. Marsh, who was then President of the Twelve Apostles, and sister Harris concluded they would exchange milk, in order to make a little larger cheese than they otherwise could. To be sure to have justice done, it was agreed that they should not save the strippings, but that the milk and strippings should all go together. Small matters to talk about here, to be sure, two women's exchanging milk to make cheese.</i><br><br><i>Mrs. Harris, it appeared, was faithful to the agreement ... but Mrs. Marsh, wishing to make some extra good cheese, saved a pint of strippings from each cow and sent Mrs. Harris the milk without the strippings.</i><br><br><i>Finally, it leaked out that Mrs. Marsh had saved the strippings, and it became a matter to be settled by the Teachers. They began to examine the matter, and it was proved that Mrs. Marsh ... had wronged Mrs. Harris. ...</i><br><br><i>An appeal was taken from the Teacher to the Bishop, and a regular Church trial was held, and it was decided that Mrs. Marsh had violated her covenant. President Marsh did not consider that the Bishop had done him and his lady justice ... and ... immediately took an appeal to the High Council, who investigated the question with much patience, and I assure you they were a grave body. Marsh being extremely anxious to maintain the character of his wife, as he was President of the Twelve Apostles, and a great man in Israel, made a desperate defense, but the High Council finally confirmed the Bishop's decision.</i><br><br><i>Marsh, not being satisfied, took an appeal to the First Presidency of the Church, and Joseph and his Counselors had to sit upon the case, and they approved the decision of the High Council.</i><br><br><i>This little affair, you will observe, kicked up a considerable breeze, and Thomas B. Marsh then declared that he would sustain the character of his wife, even if he had to go to hell for it.</i><br><br><i>The then President of the Twelve Apostles, the man who should have been first to do justice and cause reparation to be made for wrong, committed by any member of his family, took that position, and what next? He went before the magistrate and swore that the "Mormons" were hostile toward the State of Missouri.</i><br><br><i>That affidavit brought from the government of Missouri an exterminating order, which drove some 15,000 Saints from their homes and habitations, and some thousands perished through suffering the exposure consequent on this state of affairs.</i>[<i>Journal of Discourses</i>3:283–84]<br><br>Thomas Marsh said later:<br><br><i>Many have said to me, "How is it that a man like you, who understood so much of the revelations of God as recorded in the Book of Doctrine and Covenants, should fall away?" I told them not to feel too secure, but to take heed lest they also should fall, for I had no scruples in my mind as to the possibility of men falling away. (Sec. 20:32–34.) I can say, in reference to the Quorum of the Twelve, to which I belonged, that I did not consider myself a whit behind any of them, and I suppose that others had the same opinion; but, let no one feel too secure; for, before you think of it, your steps will slide. You will not then think nor feel for a moment as you did before you lost the Spirit of Christ; for when men apostatize, they are left to grovel in the dark. ... Had I known as much of the Church of Jesus Christ and its doctrines before I apostatized as I now know, I think I could not have backslidden.</i><br><br>I look back to my experience as the very young wife of a very young bishop, and from this point in my life I say, "How I wish I had more fully understood howimportant in our lives was the magnification of my husband's priesthood. While he lived, he was twice a great bishop, but I'm sure I could have done more for him as a bishop and as the head of our family had I only known how better." Young women and young men, learn and try to understand and experience this priesthood relationship and try to enhance it. A basic standard is a strong home and family.<br><h2><b>Other Church Standards</b></h2><br>In addition to the four standards listed above:<br><br>5. We do not accept nor espouse the acceptance of the so-called sexual freedom. In fact, we tenaciously advocate moral chastity for both men and women, with sexual relations limited entirely to the marriage union.<br><br>6. We advocate living in such a way as to reflect our knowledge of God and our esteem in ourselves because we are his children: dressing and conducting ourselves modestly and moderately, with confidence because of our understanding of the principles, and being obedient to the instruction and guidance of the prophets.<br><br>7. Inasmuch as we are accountable to an all-knowing God we cannot be less than completely honest with ourselves and our God. Thus we must be honest with others.<br><br>8. We have a standard for the Word of Wisdom, not given for constraint, but for strengthening and blessing even the weakest of us.<br><br>9. Overall we believe in being true, chaste, benevolent, and in doing good to all men. If there is anything virtuous, lovely, or of good report or praiseworthy, we seek after these things.<br><br>The lines of confrontation are drawn, and the greatest challenges and pressures may continue to be on the college campus, for that is where most often social upheaval and change are initiated by extremist groups. Therefore, you, whether you like it or not, are on the front battleline. We have been told that in the latter days the stakes will be a defense and refuge from the storm (see D&amp;amp;C 115:6). How prophetic that stakes should be organized on this campus, and each of you belongs to one of them. Each should want his or hers to be as strong as possible.<br><br>Surely not from this campus has come any contribution to the survey that reflects the establishment of patterns and values so completely opposite to the standards of a covenant people. We have a standard based on profound truth and spiritual as well as temporal values. It is a standard for chosen people who have a mission and purpose to establish Zion, who have received a renewed call, and who are charged with being converted, being in control of their lives and becoming less tossed by the trends of time.<br><br>The Lord has asked you to learn to live by love and compassion and understanding and to be knowledgeable of his purposes and his ways and his principles. You'll have to walk by faith much of the time. You must be disciplined. You must have hope. Most important, you need to know that God lives and you can kneel and pray to him and he will give you personal revelation for your decisions and needs. As you do this, something will happen--you will learn, your vision will expand, the Spirit of the Lord will be more recognizable to you, and you will grow and increase in understanding and truth. I doesn't come all at once. It comes precept by precept--a challenge here, a defeat here, a repenting here, a victory here; but every decision that is made to uphold the standard of righteousness gives that much more power from within.<br><br>Oh, what a challenged but what a blessed generation you are! The structure of your families now and in the future is being eroded and chopped at, but the Lord has given you a refuge and a defense in your stakes, if you will but strengthen them and stay close and accept the call of the living prophet.<br><br>I testify to you, my young friends, that President Spencer W. Kimball is indeed the prophet of the Lord. I have heard him prophesy. He is leading this people in the ways of the Lord. He sees the vision of what we must do and he is counting on us--not just on the General Authorities or the Regional Representatives of the Twelve. He is counting on you and me to be able to carry the standard, to be the covenant people, and to lift the standard high where it can be an ensign and a light forever. I bear you this testimony with deep humility in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Hortense H.

<h1>e of Glory - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Brothers and sisters, this is a very imposing and thrilling sight, and if you haven't stood here before, I might add that it's a little frightening. I don't know what I'd have done if I'd been an all-star football player and had you looking down on me while I was trying to play football. Fortunately I wasn't a very good football player.<br><br>I have just one desire this evening, and that is to strengthen your faith and testimony by sharing with you some experiences and thoughts that would be appropriate for this Sabbath day. I had outlined some things I was going to try to speak on, but on the way over my wife said, "Why don't you tell them a few things about this past weekend?" I would like to give you just a few thoughts about what's been happening.<br><h2><b>Our Living Prophet, President Kimball</b></h2><br>Yesterday morning the Presidency of the Church, President Benson, Elder LeGrand Richards, and myself went to Calgary, Alberta, Canada. President Kimball is a most dynamic prophet, and I guess my purpose in telling you some of the things that happened this weekend would be to give you a little closer personal look at President Kimball.<br><br>We boarded the plane to Calgary for the purpose of going up there to attend a solemn assembly. President Kimball has instituted, and there will be held in various parts of the United States in the months to come, several solemn assemblies. As you may or may not know, most of the solemn assemblies are convened in the temples. Now, we have had solemn assemblies in the Tabernacle when we sustain new Presidents of the Church, and you're familiar with those. But, because there aren't enough temples in the world yet and because there are priesthood brethren that need to be instructed, the President has outlines a very ambitious schedule of solemn assemblies.<br><br>The solemn assemblies are for the purpose of instructing the priesthood. Those who are invited to come need a temple recommend and a ticket; there are men placed at the doors, just as you would find if you were to go to the temple here in Provo, who check recommends and tickets.<br><br>We arrived in Calgary yesterday, right after noon. As we came off the plane and were walking through customs, President Kimball reached over to carry Elder Richards' briefcase for him. (President Kimball is eighty, while Elder Richards will soon be ninety.) Unless you've been associated with President Kimball, you've never seen a more thoughtful, humble, unpretentious, unimposing man--one who doesn't try to stand above anybody else.<br><br>We were driven to the stake center where we were to have the meeting. As we came, I saw the lawn covered with about five hundred little Primary children who had assembled there to sing to the prophet. They sang, concluding with that wonderful primary hymn, "I Am a Child of God." There aren't many things that make the President lose his composure, but this touched his heart. He spoke to those wonderful little children. We then went inside, and there were over nine hundred brethren, priesthood leaders--elders quorum presidencies, bishoprics, high councils, stake presidencies, and seventies and high priests leaders--from the nine stakes in Alberta and the mission districts. It was a great experience to sit there for four hours. We partook of the sacrament first. Elders quorum presidencies passed the sacrament; the presidencies of the stakes administered to it. It was a great experience. All of these brethren had come fasting for one purpose: to be in tune with the Spirit as they were instructed by those assigned, particularly the prophet. I appreciated all that was taught by the great men who were there. But there was a difference when the prophet stood up to teach the priesthood. There was a spirit about it that I'm sure you can imagine, but it was unusual. For one hour President Kimball, with a few notes but without a prepared script, instructed the priesthood. This was a thrilling experience.<br><br>Afterwards we had a fireside. I was assigned to speak at the fireside with some young people. As we were having dinner before, President Kimball asked me, "Bishop, do you think it'd be all right if I came to the fireside for just a few minutes?"<br><br>I said, "I'm sure it'd be all right, if you want." So he did. He didn't come in right at the beginning because he had some other duties, but we were right in a break when I saw him come in. I went to the microphone and said, "If you young people want to have a great thrill, look back and see who just walked in the door." And five hundred of them looked around. When they saw President Kimball had come in, both the girls and the boys started wiping their eyes. They were thrilled by a once-in-a-lifetime experience. Having a prophet come in and give them a blessing and speak to them.<br><br>He really is a prophet. There's no question about it. You have every right to know, as do we who work so closely with him, that he is a prophet. How fortunate we are that we can feel the security of knowing that we have a real prophet leading us! He is a very human individual, too. One of the people was surprised to see that he ate his soup with a spoon, like the rest of us, and that he liked pie and other things that we all like.<br><br>I'll just tell you one more thing. This morning, as we gathered at the airport in Calgary, many of the families of the stake leaders were there to bid President Kimball goodbye. They brought their little children, of course, and waited outside by the sidewalk, where we were shaking hands and saying goodbye. Presently the plane was about to leave, so we hurried inside and started down toward the plane. One of the Brethren commented that President Kimball was missing. We were told that the President had seen a young lady, the daughter of one of the stake leaders, and said, "I forgot to tell her goodbye." So he had gone back outside and shaken her hand. We thought the plane would have to wait for him, but he didn't want to dismiss anyone. He's sensitive to everyone.<br><br>I don't know, brothers and sisters, if you've ever shaken his hand. Those of you who have, and those who have looked into his eyes, have gotten a special feeling. I remember the first time it happened to me. As he shook my hand, he didn't say anything except hello, but he said it with a love that overpowered me. We're fortunate to have a prophet leading us today. May the Lord bless us to recognize him as such and to listen and obey the things he tells us to do.<br><br>One of the brethren from the newspaper here on campus called me and asked, "What are you going to talk about? What's the subject?"<br><br>I said, "I don't have a subject. I'm not sure what I'm going to talk about." As we talked a little more, I got some idea. He began to tell me what he was going to write down for the paper, and so I got these ideas. I think I'd like to give you folks tonight a glimpse of the glory that is available to all of us.<br><h2><b>Joan of Arc, a Woman Who Died for Her Faith</b></h2><br>I'd first like to tell you a story. This is a story that you're familiar with. It's one that Elder Sill has repeated. It's a story about Joan of Arc. You've heard this story, and you've studied about this young lady. As you know, she was a French peasant maid who heard angelic voices calling her to aid her country. Unlike the fictional story of Don Quixote, the story of Joan of Arc was taken from the court records of the great trial that convened in her behalf in 1431. Her biography comes to us under oath, from the witness stand.<br><br>Joan of Arc found her bankrupt country helpless and hopeless, lying in chains, enslaved by an alien conqueror. Joan said to the uncrowned king, "Be not afraid, for God has sent me to help you." Then she laid her inspired hand upon her withered country and by the power of her calling broke the siege of Orleans, drove out the British, saved France, and crowned the Dauphin the king of Rheims.<br><br>Louis Kossuth says that Joan of Arc was the only person of either sex who ever held supreme command over a great national army at the age of seventeen. By nineteen this untaught girl had become the deliverer of France and the savior of her country. She explained her power by saying something that's significant: "When God fights, it's of small consequence whether the hand that holds the sword is big or little." Everyone knew that in her heart was something that raised her above the greatest men of her day. She had the mysterious ability to turn mobs of cowards into armies of patriots. Her soldiers went into battle with joy in their eyes and a song in their hearts. Her own soul was the embodiment of nobility and righteousness. Although she lived in the most brutal, wicked, and rotten period since the Dark Ages, she did her job as well as anyone that any nation has ever produced. She was perhaps one of the few entirely unselfish persons whose name holds a high place in history. She lived when crime was the common business of mankind. She was truthful when lying was the ordinary speech of man. She was honest when honesty was a lost virtue. She maintained her personal dignity unimpaired in an age of fawning and servility. She had dauntless courage when even hope had perished in the hearts of her countrymen. She was spotlessly pure in mind and body when most of society was foul in both. She was the genius of patriotism. She said that even the rude business of war could be better conducted without profanity and other brutalities of speech. Few could understand why Joan continued to be alert, vigorous, and confident while her strongest men were exhausted by long marches and severe extensive exposure.<br><br>On one occasion, with an almost impossible objective ahead, she said, "I will lead the men over the wall." One of her generals said, "Not a man will follow you." Then she said something else that's very significant. Joan said, "I will not look back to see whether anyone is following or not." Then, with a flash of her sword, she gave the signal and led the way, and the soldiers of France followed her. With her unshakable belief in her mission glowing in her heart, she swept everything before her. She sent a thrill of courage and conviction through the French army such as neither King nor patriot could produce.<br><br>When her country was safe, she declined the highest honors and the most profitable employments that a loving and grateful country could bestow upon her. As she was planning to return to her family, she was treacherously betrayed into the hands of her foreign enemies. For many weary months she was kept in chains as she underwent a long and wicked trial on trumped-up charges of witchcraft and sorcery. She was threatened and abused. The judges and jurors were carefully selected enemies; she was finally condemned to die for witchcraft. As the fires were being lighted around the stake at which this nineteen-year-old French peasant maid would be burned alive, she was given an opportunity to obtain her freedom by denying what she believed. In choosing the fire above her freedom, she said this, and this is significant:<br><br><i>I know this now. Every man gives his life for what he believes. Every woman gives her life for what she believes. Sometimes people believe in little or nothing, and yet they give their lives for little or nothing. One life is all we have, and we live it as we believe in living it, and then it is gone. But to surrender what you are and live without belief is more terrible than dying, even more terrible than dying young.</i><br><br>And, may I add, particularly is it more terrible when there's so much to believe in. We have some among us today who are in the process of dying young--in a spiritual sense.<br><h2><b>The Spiritual Versus the Physical</b></h2><br>We should understand that the spirit isn't killed with the sword. The spirit isn't killed with the bullet from a gun. But a spirit dies gradually. One of the responsibilities I have in the Presiding Bishopric is to review the minutes of courts that come in from all over the world to headquarters of the Church. The Presiding Bishopric is the repository of these minutes. I've noted, as I've reviewed these minutes, that people, young and old, don't fall into sin and transgression in an instant. It's a gradual step-down process.<br><br>I've used the example before that the moment we come to the earth--the moment our spiritual body entered the physical body and we were born on the earth--that very moment a conflict began between the spiritual body and the physical body. The conflict, of course, is for the physical to try to overcome the spiritual, and the spiritual to try to rise above the physical. We all have things we'd like to do that aren't good for us. Our bodies want to do them. We all have appetites, passions, and desires. Every day there is a conflict that goes on when our physical body says, "I want to do this," and the spiritual body says, "no, we shouldn't do it. We<i>won't</i>do it." The physical body says, "Yes, we will." This argument goes on and on, as you've all experienced.<br><br>When the physical body finally overpowers the spirit and says, "Well, we will do it," and the spirit isn't strong enough to withstand, then the spirit steps down. Every time the physical body overcomes the spirit, the spirit continues to step down and down and down. Every time one fails to get on his knees in prayer in the morning, the spirit steps down. Every time one is unkind or dishonest, the spirit steps down. And in a gradual process, brothers and sisters, the spirit can step down, step by step, until there can come a time in your life when the spirit can lose the power to change, when your spirit has stepped so low that it loses the power to repent. The Lord tells us that this is possible in the scriptures.<br><br>Every time a conflict goes on the spirit has this toe-to-toe argument with the physical. When the spirit controls and says, "No, we will<i>not</i>do this," then the spirit climbs. Every time it controls again, it climbs again. Of course, you know what happens as the spirit continues to climb: it ascends to our Father, who sent us here.<br><br>This is our great challenge in this life: to learn how and then to<i>do</i>the things that will strengthen our spirits so they continue to climb. It isn't an easy thing. It's a very difficult thing, because we do choose to do some things that aren't right for us. It seems, as we get lower and lower, our ability to resist becomes less and less, and the physical takes over the spirit more and more.<br><br>Now, I'd like to give some suggestions to you, and they're very simple. There are just two or three really, that may help you strengthen your spirit so that when the time comes to make a decision, your spirit will be strong enough to say yes or no--whichever would be the correct answer.<br><h2><b>Pray</b></h2><br>I think the most important thing to do is to learn to pray. I'm amazed how many don't understand this. As you can imagine, I interview a lot of missionaries, particularly now. I interview a lot of brethren who are to be called to be bishops, counselors, and so on. Long ago, I stopped asking the question "How often do you pray?" and started asking the questions "Brother So-and-so, Sister So-and-so, when was the last time you were on your knees?" "Brother and Sister So-and-so, how often do you get on your knees?" Because, you see, this is the real, down-to-earth prayer. Now, I agree that we all spend time during each day when we go to the Lord--as we're driving somewhere or before a test for which we haven't studied as we ought to. Those times are important, but every day, in the morning and in the evening, he deserves to have us kneel, acknowledge him as our Father, acknowledge him as he really is. Now that's one thing that each of us can do.<br><br>I know that some of you live in crowded conditions, but there is always a time and a place where you can go to be alone every day in prayer. Praying is probably the most important thing you will do any day.<br><br>Now, if you've tried, and it hasn't worked--you didn't get the answer immediately--then you try it again. If the answer still doesn't come, then keep trying and don't give up. You see, there's a companion to praying, and that's pleading. There are many who pray, but few who plead. You can read many examples in the scriptures about those who have learned to plead with the Lord as they've wanted special blessings.<br><br>There's also a great lesson to learn in the praying process; this is the lesson of patience. I decided that one of the greatest lessons we learn on the earth is patience. We want things now. We don't want them when the Lord wants us to have them, we want them right<i>now</i>. "Can't he understand that?" This is sometimes the way we act.<br><br>In one of the recent meetings we had in the Temple the President and the General Authorities were together. President Kimball had turned the meeting over for testimonies. President Romney was bearing his testimony to us and telling us how much he enjoyed kneeling in prayer with the Brethren, how much he loved us, and what a great uplift it was to him to kneel and pray together. Then he went on to say how much he loved his wife and the great experience he had every morning and evening of kneeling with her in prayer. "But," he said, "Brethren, the greatest experience I have every day, above all others, is when I go by myself into a room and close the door. I kneel down and I talk with the Lord." That's the greatest experience a prophet, a counselor in the First Presidency, has--to kneel in prayer. We could do no less than that. That's one of the most important things we can do in strengthening our faith and strengthening our spirits.<br><h2><b>Study the Scriptures</b></h2><br>Another point has to do with study of the scriptures. I know you've heard this time and again, and I know you probably have rationalized that you're busy in your life with school: you have many important things to learn, if you don't study them you won't pass, and you won't complete the educational process you came here for. But may I suggest to you that there isn't one of you who doesn't have time to read from the scriptures every day. I'm not suggesting a two- or three-hour study course every day. Even if it's only five minutes, it will give you a rejuvenation and a strength to your spirit that will help as the conflict of decision comes to you.<br><br>You know, your mind is an unusual instrument with tremendous capacity. You can put into your mind whatever you want to. You can put in good or you can put in garbage, yet your mind will take every bit of it. Everything your eyes see or your ears hear or your lips utter affects your spirit. If you see something that isn't good, it stays with you. If you see a picture that isn't right or hear words that aren't right, they stay with you. If you physically take something in that isn't good for you, such as poison or trash, your physical body has a way of getting rid of it, but your mind doesn't get rid of it that quickly. This great reservoir you have will just fill with whatever you're going to put into it. Sometimes there are things you can't help seeing or hearing. I don't mean you look for them, but occasionally you happen on something that wouldn't be good for you to hear or see. Thus it's important for you to keep your mind, your reservoir, filled with good things so that, as these things come in that aren't right, they'll come into a clear stream of water, as it were, and have little effect because of the purity of what's already there.<br><h2><b>Make Correct Decisions</b></h2><br>Even though you have learned to pray, and even though you learned to study, there comes a time with each of us when he must make the decision. The Lord has told us, as we read the scriptures, about the house built on the sand as well as the one built on the rock. The storms came to the house built on the sand as well as to the one built on the rock. The trials come to the faithful as well as to the unfaithful. The trials come to the pure as well as to the weak. The trials come to all, but this fortification we're talking about will help us make the right decisions. Still, the time comes when you must act, when you must do certain things.<br><br>For instance, the time comes when you must decide whether you will involve yourself in a petting situation or not. Now, no matter how you look at it, no matter how you rationalize, no matter how much you're in love, nor matter whether you think it's harmless, petting is wrong. There is no first step in petting that's right. It's wrong. The Lord is displeased and I'm sure he sheds many tears in behalf of those who have fallen into this trap, but you have to be the one to say no. This is the time when you can't turn around to your mother or your father or your bishop and say, "Should I or shouldn't I?" This is the time when<i>you</i>finally have to say, "No, it's wrong. I won't do it."<br><br>The fortification to say no comes as you prepare your spirit, as you strengthen it. You have to say, "No, I won't go to this X-rated or R-rated movie or many of the PG movies." You have to say no. You can't go to your stake president. He's not there on every date you have, and<i>you</i>have to decide (lucky for him and lucky for you.) You have to ask, "Am I going to leave when stories start getting vulgar?" You have to say, "Yes, I will," or, "No, I won't." You have to find out whether you have the courage to get up and walk out of a situation. You're the one that has to decide if you are going to repeat a dirty story or not. There are things<i>you</i>have to do because of the great principle of free agency.<br><br>Sisters (if some of you need to squirm, why, go right ahead and squirm), you have to decide how modestly you're going to dress. You have to decide how you're going to wear your skirts and your blouses and all that goes with them. The time has to come when you have to decide that.<br><br>You also have to decide on the principle of confession. The principle of confession is an eternal principle. I'm honestly persuaded, brothers and sisters, to believe than any of us, of any age, who's had any sexual relations outside the bonds of matrimony and hasn't confessed theme can never be exalted until he goes to his stake president, bishop, or branch president to confess them. Part of the repentance process is acknowledging and confessing to the proper priesthood leaders.<br><br>I have had some wonderful experiences, and I consider them such, when I have had people come to me as I was the bishop or stake president. I remember one sister who had been carrying this burden on her shoulders for fifty years. She came on time and said, "How do I get rid of it?" How can I feel relieved?" I told her what she needed to do. I have talked with others who have had similar experiences.<br><br>I can plead with you, and I can tell you what I know about the eternities to come (which all of us would know if we studied), but<i>you</i>have to decide--you have to do it. There's no way you can accomplish on the earth the things you're to accomplish, or enjoy the things of eternity you're to enjoy, until you have taken this step of confession.<br><br>The Lord bless you to understand this, and the Lord bless you to do the things that will give you the strength to do what's necessary. One is to pray, to plead with the Lord, every night and every morning. Another is to study from the scriptures every day. Another is to make correct moral decisions and to confess transgression if necessary. Still another is to be of service to others, to look for someone that you can help. It's amazing what it does to you to help someone who needs help. Another is to fast as you need to. I've seen some tremendous things happen in the lives of people who have done these simple things in preparation. Before I conclude, let me tell you two or three of them.<br><br>We have a group of members of the Church in Vietnam. During the recent exodus, about a third of the members left. As they left, a branch president in Saigon sent out his wife and children, not knowing if he'd ever see them again, and he stayed behind because he knew the remaining members of the Church would need a leader to help them in a time like that. He was also translating the holy scriptures into that language, so he decided to stay. He's a simple man, as you are, but that kind of faith he has is developed in these very simple ways.<br><br>I met an elderly couple in the mission field not long ago. The man, when they left for the mission field, was blind in one eye. But when he was called on a mission, it was felt all would be well. The couple went to the mission field, and after they'd been out for two or three months, the man lost the sight of his other eye. He was now blind in both eyes. The mission president called him in and said, "I believe we should send you home because you can't see and do what you're supposed to do." But the man, very straightforwardly, said to the president, "President, don't send me home just because I can't see. I was called by the Lord to fulfill an eighteen-month mission. When I was called, he knew that I would be blind even if I didn't, yet he still called me. Now, please let me stay and finish my mission. My wife is my companion, and she'll help me see what I need to see, through her eyes. Don't send me home. Let me finish what I'm here to do." And he did. He stayed. His faith was developed in the very simple way we're talking about.<br><h2><b>Experiences in the Mission Field</b></h2><br>Some of the most interesting and rewarding experiences I've had have been in the mission field as I meet with the missionaries--the elders and the sisters. I have really thrilled at these experiences. I've seen evidences of faith that you wouldn't believe. Maybe I could tell you two that are kind of humorous and then one that's for real, too. They're all real.<br><br>While visiting a mission, we were in the mission home and had just had testimony meeting. The missionaries, instead of going back home to work the rest of the day, were exchanging experiences. There was a missionary there from Idaho; he was a farm boy with arms that were about twice the size of mine--just a really husky young fellow. They were doing some arm wrestling on the table. As each new contender came up, he'd put his arm up and put the other's down easily. No one could take him. Then one little fellow that looked about half my size said, "Elder, why don't you let me try?" The big farm boy got hold of him, and then started to push. The more the farm boy pushed, the more it was as if he had hold of a piece of steel: he couldn't get the little fellow's arm moving. His eyes started to get wider and wider, and pretty soon his own arm started to go back. This little 100-pound weakling started pushing his arm back and back, and the first thing you know, he had him down. As his arm went down, the elder from Idaho said, "He's beating me. I can't believe it. He's beating me!" But he did! You have great experiences in the mission field.<br><br>I've eaten some of the most interesting meals at the hands of the missionaries. After we'd had some Saturday afternoon meetings in one mission, the missionaries had invited the mission president, his wife, and me over for dinner; "dinner" is either an understatement or an overstatement. We went into their flat, where they had the table set, but we could see nothing on the table except a big bowl of sliced, cooked carrots. I saw a bunch of elders in the kitchen really working. They were poking in a big boiling pot with knives. As I got close I could see they had potatoes in it. It looked as if they were hitting rocks. There was no way we would eat those potatoes that day, so we sat down at the table with the bowl of carrots (that was all there was on the table), and we started to eat.<br><br>The mission president leaned over to me and said, "Bishop, do you taste something unusual?"<br><br>And I said, "I do, President."<br><br>And he said, "Bishop, I believe they have their whole year's supply of salt in these carrots."<br><br>And I said, "I believe you're right, President, but let's keep eating, They'll never know the difference."<br><br>After a while they remembered that they'd forgotten to bring us our salad (it was Jello, and we had to drink it). Then we went on with the rest of the meal. I hope you brethren have learned what to cook by now!<br><br>These same kinds of missionaries, though, have the faith of Alma. I'll conclude with one more story about faith in the mission field. I was in Mexico a few weeks ago. One of the missionaries stood up to bear his testimony, and he let us know that he knew why he was there and that the Lord was watching over him. Then he told us about a family he and his companion were teaching. The father had had an operation two or three months earlier. The incision had opened up his stomach from his breastbone down to his belt. Because of the poor medical facilities there he hadn't healed, and he had a large open wound. He was not even able to sit up. The physicians seemed to be doing nothing to correct it, so he had to lie down again in bed for two months. The missionaries were teaching him and his family the gospel. The family liked what they heard, they accepted what they heard, and they were ready to be baptized the next Saturday. The father, of course, couldn't be, because he couldn't get out of bed. The elder said that evening, after the family had accepted the challenge of baptism, they went home and were thinking about and reading some stories about missionaries of former days. They read about Brother Matthew Cowley and his great healing experiences down in the South Pacific. The elder said to his companion, "You know, Brother Cowley was a missionary. We're missionaries. He wasn't an apostle when he was out there on that first mission, yet the Lord helped him heal. Why can't he help us? Why won't he help us heal?"<br><br>Then the elders did something that's significant, and we must remember this: they decided to<i>prepare</i>themselves to call down a blessing from the Lord in behalf of this man. They spent a day in fasting and prayer. Before they left their home that evening, the knelt down and prayed, "Heavenly Father, now please bless us to say what thou wouldst have us say." They went to that family's home, laid their hands on the man, and administered to him in the power of the priesthood. They blessed him to get well, and they said they felt full confidence that he would. As they got up, the man also got up and walked around the bed for the first time in two months. He was tired, so he went back to bed, but three days later he went down into the waters of baptism and was baptized along with his family. This is the faith of the elders. This is the faith of those who prepare themselves to receive the blessings of heaven.<br><br>Now, lest you be discouraged, the Lord doesn't always come to our rescue that quickly. He doesn't always answer our prayer immediately, even after many pleadings. We could tell story after story of some babies that have been born after years of pleadings. One young couple had been married eleven years, and still no children. Finally they started to plead and plead, as they've never pled before, and it happened. The Lord holds back his answers sometimes for a very special reason, and that's so we'll be tested and tried and our faith will be strengthened.<br><br>The Lord bless you, brothers and sisters. The Lord bless you to get a glimpse of the glory that is available to all the children of our Father in heaven. But you have to do your part to get that glimpse of glory. I want to testify to you that whatever effort it takes to live righteously, whatever effort it takes to say no at the right time or to say yes at the right time, it's worth it. I testify to you that Jesus is the Christ, that he really does live, and that this is his Church. I know this without any reservations. I pray that you'll have the blessings that will sustain you as your testimony is strengthened, that you might have the happiness that will come to those who are faithful and devoted to our Father in heaven, in the name of Jesus Christ. amen.<br><br><i><i>H.

<br>
<br>
My beloved brethren and sisters, this is a humbling moment. I have been very much touched and impressed by the singing of this beautiful chorale, by the inspiring and moving prayer by Brother Porter. In fact, coming at the end of the trail, as it were, as far as campus activities are concerned, I seem to have the yearning of the poet, somewhat paraphrased:<br><br><i>Backward, turn backward, oh time, in thy flight.</i><br><i>Make me a freshman again--just for tonight.</i><br>[Elisabeth Akers Allen, "Rock Me to Sleep"]<br><br>Brothers and sisters, I sincerely pray that the Spirit of the Lord will be with us in rich abundance as it has been thus far, that the things I say may be edifying, uplifting, and worth your coming here this morning.<br><br>There was a man who was invited to a masquerade ball. He decided he would go in an unusual costume, so he rented a costume of the sectarian's idea of the devil. As he walked to the place where the masquerade ball was being held, rain began to fall. He darted into the first open door available along the street, which happened to be the door leading into a church. The minister was in the pulpit, and he was haranguing his audience against that fellow, the evil one. He looked up from his text, and there standing in the doorway in the foyer was the fellow he had been talking against. He immediately made a hurried exit right through the plate-glass window at the back. The audience, wondering why the pastor had made such a hurried exit, looked back and saw the devil standing there in all of his diabolical glee. That particular church was evacuated in record time--all but the heavyset lady who found it difficult to get out of the pew. She finally made her way to the aisle and was trying to hurry to the exit when she fell flat on her face. The devil, gallant fellow that he turned out to be, came over to help her up. As she looked into his diabolical face, fear and consternation written all over hers, she blurted out, "I've been a member of this church for the last thirty years, but I've really been on your side all the time."<br><br>As President George A. Smith often said, he knew a lot of Saints in pioneer days that served the Lord like the very devil. The Prophet Joseph Smith taught us how to serve the Lord as the Lord would have us serve him. In fact, he said if we aren't drawing near the Lord in principle, we are going from him and drawing towards the devil.<br><h2><b>The Prophet's Friendliness</b></h2><br>There wasn't anything that was so dear to the heart of the Prophet Joseph Smith as friendship. How the Prophet Joseph loved his friends! President Brigham Young said that August day of 1844: "Joseph so loved this people that he gave his life for them. He loved them unto death. You did not know it until after his death" (see<i>Documentary History of the Church</i>, 7:240). As the Prophet was leaving Nauvoo to go to Carthage, he stopped before the temple, which was up one story, looked over the city that housed the Saints that he loved, and he exclaimed, "This is the loveliest place and the best people under the heavens; little do they know the trials that await them" (see<i>Documentary History of the Church</i>, 6:554).<br><br>He could see no fault in the Church. He loved the majority of the Church members so well that he wanted to be resurrected with them. He was not concerned whether they were resurrected in heaven or in hell. In fact, he was to say that if we find ourselves in hell, we will turn the devils out of doors and make a heaven of it. Wherever the Saints should be Joseph knew there would be a good society.<br><br>Joseph loved the people. He ended a letter to a new convert in words something like these: "I love your soul and the souls of all men, and do all I can to bring them salvation." The Prophet Joseph Smith taught that "love is one of the chief characteristics of Diety, and ought to be manifested by those who aspire to be the sons of God. A man filled with the love of God, is not content with blessing his family alone, but ranges through the whole world, anxious to bless the whole human race" (<i>Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith,</i>p. 174). He loved the Saints, but he was not blind to their misgivings or their shortcomings. During the last conference address he gave in mortality, he said, "I love you all; but I hate some of your deeds. I am your best friend, and if persons miss their mark it is their own fault. If I reprove a man, and he hates me, he is a fool; for I love all men, especially these my brethren and sisters" (<i>Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith,</i>p. 361).<br><br>The Prophet was not too concerned as to a man's character if he was his friend. He said, "I will be a friend to him, and preach the Gospel . . . to him, . . . helping him out of his difficulties." Joseph also taught, "Friendship is one of the grand fundamental principles of "Mormonism"; [it is designed] to revolutionize and civilize the world, and cause wars and contentions to cease and men to become friends and brothers" (<i>Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith,</i>p. 316). The spirit and practice of friendship, my brothers and sisters, is contagious. Said the Prophet Joseph Smith:<br><br><i>It is a time-honored adage that love begets love. Let us pour forth love--show forth our kindness unto all mankind, and the Lord will reward us with everlasting increase; cast our bread upon the waters and we shall receive it after many days, increased to a hundredfold. Friendship is like Brother Turley in his blacksmith shop welding iron to iron; it unites the human family with its happy influence.</i>[<i>Documentary History of the Church</i>, 5:517]<br><br>The spirit of friendship is the essence of charity, which Moroni defined as the pure love of Christ. Channing Pollock once called love "friendship put to music" and said, "I thank God for love of life."<br><br>Joseph taught, "I do not dwell on your faults, and you shall not upon mine"--good counsel for us all. He said, "Charity, which is love, covereth a multitude of sins, and I have covered all the faults among you, but the prettiest thing in the world is to have not faults at all. We should cultivate a meek, quiet, and peaceable spirit" (<i>Documentary History of the Church</i>, 5:401).<br><br>The Prophet Joseph Smith despised sham. Pretense to him was folly. Once he said, "I love that man better who swears a stream as long as my arm, yet deals justice to his neighbors and mercifully deals his substance to the poor, than the smooth-faced hypocrite. I do not want you to think that I'm very righteous, for I am not. There was one good man, and his name was Jesus" (<i>Documentary History of the Church</i>, 5:401).<br><br>There came to Nauvoo a Baptist priest to determine the piety of the Prophet Joseph. When he saw Joseph, he folded his arms and, weighing his words, uttered, "Is it possible that I now flash my optics upon a prophet, upon a man who has conversed with my Savior?"<br><br>"Yes," said the Prophet, "You've had that privilege. Now, how would you like to wrestle with me?" (<i>Journal of Discourses</i>, 3:67).<br><h2><b>The Prophet's Forgiving Nature</b></h2><br>Joseph Smith's forgiveness of others is impressively illustrated in an incident involving William W. Phelps. During those trying days of persecution in Missouri, Phelps apostatized and turned against the Church. He signed his name to a false affidavit that brought much suffering to the Saints and imprisoned the Prophet Joseph. In a short time he realized the error of his ways and asked forgiveness and readmittance into the Church. He wrote the Prophet:<br><br><i>I have seen the folly of my way and tremble at the gulf I have passed. I have done wrong, and I am sorry. The beam is in my own eye. I ask forgiveness in the name of Jesus Christ of all the Saints. For I will do right, God helping me. I want your fellowship, for we are brethren, and our communion used to be sweet.</i>[<i>Documentary History of the Church</i>, 4:141–42]<br><br>The Prophet's reply reveals the admirable quality of love and forgiveness for the wayward. Wrote the Prophet in reply to William W. Phelp's request to be readmitted into the Church:<br><br><i>I feel a disposition to act on your case in a manner that will meet the approbation of Jehovah, whose servant I am, and inasmuch as long-suffering, patience, and mercy have ever characterized the dealings of our Heavenly Father towards the humble and penitent, I feel disposed to copy that example, cherish the same principles and by so doing be a savior to my fellowman. Believing your confession to be real and your repentance genuine. I shall be happy once again to give you the right hand of fellowship and rejoice over the returning prodigal. Come on, dear brother, since the war is past, for friends at first are friends again at last.</i>[<i>Documentary History of the Church,</i>5:162]<br><br>The Prophet Joseph Smith taught, "Ever keep in exercise the principle of mercy and be ready to forgive a brother on the first intimation of repentance and asking forgiveness. And should we even forgive our brother, or even our enemy, before he repents, and asks forgiveness, our Heavenly Father would be equally merciful to us" (<i>Documentary History of the Church</i>, 3:383).<br><br>Is it any wonder, my brothers and sisters, that Joseph's contemporaries, those who knew him best, were to comment as President Wilford Woodruff did: "When I look at the history of Joseph Smith, I sometimes think that he came as near following the footsteps of the Savior as anyone possibly could" (John A. Widtsoe,<i>Joseph Smith--Seeker After Truth</i>, p. 348). To bring about peace on the earth and the millennial reign of the Christ, the Prophet Joseph taught that the act of kindness must extend to the animal kingdom. Said he, "Men must become harmless before the brute creation, and when men lost their vicious dispositions and cease to destroy the animal race, the lion and the lamb can dwell together, and the suckling child can play with the serpent in safety" (<i>Documentary History of the Church,</i>2:271). Someone has written:<br><br><i>Be kind to all dumb animals,</i><br><i>And give small birds a crumb;</i><br><i>Be kind to human bein's too,</i><br><i>For they are sometimes dumb.</i><br><h2><b>The Prophet's Cordial Personality</b></h2><br>Joseph Smith possessed the secret of making friends. His radiant personality, his acceptance of man's innate goodness, and his love for all men won him many friends. Josiah Quincy was to observe that Joseph was one of the two men, among all he had ever met, who seemed best endowed with that kingly faculty which directs, as by intrinsic right, the feeble and confused souls who are looking for guidance. Parley P. Pratt described Joseph Smith as "possessing a noble boldness, an independence of character. His manner was easy and familiar, his benevolence unbounded as the ocean. Even his most bitter enemies were generally overcome if he could once get their ears" (<i>Autobiography of Parley P. Pratt,</i>pp. 45–46).<br><br>William Taylor, a brother of President John Taylor, was a personal companion to the Prophet Joseph Smith. These are the words that he said in describing that wonderful man Joseph:<br><br><i>Much has been said of his geniality and his personal magnetism. I was a witness of this. People old or young loved him and trusted him instinctively. I have never known the same joy and satisfaction in the companionship of any other person--man or woman--that I felt with him, the man who conversed with the Almighty. He was always the most companionable and lovable of men, cheerful, and jovial.</i>[<i>Young Women's Journal</i>, 17:548]<br><br>Dan Jones, a mite of a man physically and a college graduate who left the field of learning to become a sailor, sailed the five oceans and had set foot in almost all of the ports. He ran a steamboat called<i>The Maid of Iowa</i>up and down the Mississippi River, and it was seamanship that brought Dan Jones to the Prophet Joseph Smith. One day he landed a boatload of Saints in Nauvoo, and the Prophet came to the wharf to meet him. He walked up to the little captain, put his hand on his shoulder, and said, "God bless this little man." Dan Jones never forgot that benediction. He joined the Church that year to become one of the Prophet's most trusted friends. He was with his beloved Prophet in the Carthage Jail the night before the martyrdom when the Prophet asked, "Brother Jones, are you afraid to die?"<br><br>Dan Jones replied, "has it come to that, Brother Joseph? Being engaged in such a work as we're engaged in, I don't think death would have any terror for me."<br><br>The Prophet said, "Brother Jones, you shall not die, but you shall go to Wales and fulfill the mission assigned you." After the martyrdom Dan Jones sailed for Wales, where he performed a most successful mission, setting an all-time record for convert baptisms. He testified, "I have come in obedience to the counsel of the martyred prophet, as a messenger to my native land to bear testimony of the work for which his brother Hyrum died, and which he sealed with his own blood." (See Thomas C. Romney,<i>The Gospel in Action</i>, p. 89.)<br><br>The Prophet Joseph on one occasion was to say, "I'm not an enemy of mankind; I am a friend of mankind. I have no enemies but for the gospel's sake." The Lord promised the Prophet Joseph that he could have anything he desired, and the Prophet was to say, "I have been afraid to ask God to kill my enemies lest some of them, perchance, repent."<br><br>During the troublesome days at Far West, Missouri, there came to the home of the Prophet's parents eight men from Daviess County, Missouri, who believed the lies circulated about Joseph Smith and the Mormons. They had come to kill the Mormon leader. Mother Smith greeted them at the door and invited them to come in. They refused to sit down; in fact, they informed the mother of the Prophet, "We have come to kill him."<br><br>Mother Smith was to say, "If you were to see Joseph you would not want to kill him." At that particular point the Prophet Joseph Smith entered the room, and Mother Smith introduced the eight men to him. They stared at him in mute silence. The Prophet smiled, extended his hand, and invited them to be seated. His friendly, cordial manner convinced them that he was guilty neither of murder nor of any other crime. A pleasant half hour was spent, during which time the Prophet explained his views, his feelings, his mission, the purpose of the Church, and the brutal treatment he and the Saints had so unjustly received. He then excused himself, stating that he must be on his way home. Immediately two of the men sprang to their feet and offered to escort him home as they considered it not safe for him to travel alone. He thanked them but did not accept their offer. As the eight men were leaving the house, Mother Smith overheard their departing words. One said, "Did you not feel strange when Smith took you by the hand?"<br><br>Another man replied, "I could not move. I would not harm a hair of that man's head for all the world."<br><br>The third one said, "I never saw a more harmless, innocent appearing man than the Mormon Prophet."<br><br>"Yes, indeed," said the fourth, "that story about him killing those men is a lie, but they'll never fool me again."<br><h2><b>The Prophet's Love for His Enemies</b></h2><br>The Savior, in his inspiring Sermon on the Mount, taught, "Ye have heard that it hath been said, Thou shalt love thy neighbor, and hate thine enemy. But I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you; That ye may be the children of your Father which is in heaven" (Matthew 5:43–45).<br><br>The Prophet Joseph Smith practiced this most difficult of all the Savior's teachings. The Prophet was betrayed into the hands of the mob-militia in Missouri. He was court-martialed and sentenced to be shot. One of the officers of the mob-militia, Moses Wilson, came to one of the Prophet's friends, Lyman Wight, and tried to bribe him into testifying against Joseph. He said, "We don't want to kill you, but we have one thing against you, and that is you are too friendly with Joseph Smith. We believe him to be a rascal, but you're a fine fellow. If you will swear against him, we will spare your life and give you any office you want. If you won't you'll be shot at nine o'clock."<br><br>Wight looked Wilson squarely in the eye and said, "Wilson, you have your men entirely wrong--both in regard to myself and to Joseph Smith. Joseph Smith is the most philanthropic man I ever saw. He is not your enemy; he is a friend of mankind and a maker of peace. In fact, he is the best friend you have, for if it hadn't been for Joseph Smith, you would have been in hell long ago. I'd have put ya there myself by cuttin' your throat, and Joseph is the only man on earth that could stop me from doin' it. You can just thank Joseph for being alive" (<i>Documentary History of the Church</i>, 3:436–37).<br><br>Strangely enough, my brothers and sisters, as Parley P. Pratt stated: "If Joseph could get the ears of his most devout enemies he generally made friends of them." Years afterward, Moses Wilson was to say, "Joseph Smith was a most remarkable man. I carried him a prisoner in chains to my house in Independence, Missouri, and he hadn't been there two hours before my wife loved him better than she loved me."<br><br>After being kidnapped by two sheriffs and brutally treated by them, his life constantly being threatened, the Prophet Joseph was rescued by his friends. Instead of his being escorted across the Mississippi River into Missouri, as the sheriffs intended to do, he was brought to Nauvoo. While in Nauvoo, the prophet took the two sheriffs to his home, placed them at the head of his table, and his wife waited on them as though they were the most honored guests that had ever graced her house. Joseph said, "I have brought these men to Nauvoo, not as prisoners in chains, but as prisoners of kindness. I have treated them kindly. I have had the privilege of returning them good for evil" (<i>Documentary History of the Church</i>, 5:467).<br><br>The Prophet Joseph Smith was quick to express his gratitude for any little act of kindness or gift given him. In fact, he was to say that ingratitude was one of the most offensive sins of his age. On one occasion his friends gave him $64.50, and this is what the Prophet Joseph said: "My heart swells with gratitude inexpressible when I realize the great condescension of my Heavenly Father in opening the hearts of these, my beloved brethren, to administer so liberally to my wants."<br><br>While in the Liberty Jail he received letters from his wife, Emma, and other friends which certainly gave him courage to face the loneliness of imprisonment for Christ's sake. Then he wrote, "One token of friendship from any source whatever awakens and calls into action every sympathetic feeling." The Lord assured his Prophet while in the Liberty Jail, "Thy friends do stand by thee, and they shall hail thee again with warm hearts and friendly hands" (D&amp;amp;C 121:9).<br><br>When the enemies of the Prophet Joseph were seeking his life during the Nauvoo period, the Prophet was forced to go into hiding, and on one occasion some of his friends visited him. After their departure he wrote, "How good and glorious it has seemed unto me to find pure and holy friends who are faithful, just, and true, and whose hearts fail them not and whose knees are confirmed and do not falter. These I have met in prosperity, and they were my friends, and now I meet them in adversity, and they are still my warmer friends" (<i>Documentary History of the Church</i>, 5:107). The Prophet Joseph sums up most impressively why they were his friends:<br><br>[First and foremost]<i>these love the God that I serve;</i>[secondly<i>] they love the truths that I promulgate;</i>[thirdly]<i>they love those virtuous, and those holy doctrines that I cherish in my bosom with the warmest feelings of my heart. I love friendship and truth; I love virtue and law; I love the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob; and they are my brethren, and I shall live; and because I live they shall live also.</i>[<i>Documentary History of the Church</i>, 5:108–9]<br><br>As he prayed for his friends, the still, small voice whispered to his soul, "These, that share your toils with such faithful hearts, shall reign with you in the kingdom of their God" (<i>Documentary History of the Church</i>, 5:109). What a glorious reward of friendship! What wouldn't one of us give to have the privilege of being with the Prophet Joseph Smith in the kingdom of God?<br><h2><b>The Principle of Love</b></h2><br>While conversing with his cousin George A. Smith on one occasion, the Prophet wrapped his arms around him and said with emotion, "George A., I love you as I love my own soul!" This left his cousin speechless. In fact, George A. said, "I felt so affected I could hardly speak." In a few moments, after regaining his composure, he solemnly said, "I hope, Brother Joseph, that my whole life and actions will prove my feelings and the depth of my affection for you" (<i>Documentary History of the Church</i>, 5:39).<br><br>Sectarian priests often asked concerning Joseph, "How can this babbler get so many followers around him and retain them?" The Prophet answered, "It's because I possess the principle of love. All I have to offer the world is a good heart and a good hand" (<i>Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith</i>, p. 313). Joseph's love and concern for his brethren was shown in action. Word came to Nauvoo on one occasion of a poor man who had lost his house by fire. Nearly all the brethren said they were sorry for the man. The Prophet Joseph Smith put his hand in his pocket and pulled out a five-dollar gold piece and said, "I feel sorry for this brother to the amount of five dollars. How much do you feel sorry?"<br><br>Phineas H. Young, an older brother of the Prophet Brigham Young, was once away in Tiffin, Ohio. While there he wrote Willard Richards, the Prophet Joseph's secretary, and said, "I long to see the day when I can again visit my brethren and see the Lord's Prophet, and hear the words of life sweetly distilling from his lips. Give my love to Brother Joseph when you see him. Tell him I'd come to the Rocky Mountains to see him and fight my way through an army of wildcats and Missouri wolves and live on skunks the whole journey" ("Journal History of the Church," 14 December 1842).<br><br>Well, meeting the Prophet Joseph was an experience, my friends, and those who had had that opportunity never forgot. Amos M. Lyman traveled some six hundred miles to see the Prophet Joseph Smith. He was the only member of his family to join the Church. He arrived at the John Johnson home in Hiram, Ohio, and received employment working on the farm for ten dollars a month. Shortly after his coming, the prophet Joseph returned from Missouri, and young Lyman had the opportunity of meeting him. The impression the Prophet made on the new convert was stamped indelibly upon his mind, heart, and soul through the years: "When he grasped me by the hand in that cordial way, known to those who had met him in the honest simplicity of truth, I felt as one of old in the presence of the Lord, my strength seemed to be gone so that it required an effort on my part to stand on my feet; but in all of this there was no fear, but the serenity and peace of heaven pervaded my soul and the still small voice of the Spirit whispered its living testimony in the depths of my soul, where it has ever remained, that he was a man of God" (<i>Deseret News</i>, 8:117).<br><br>Now, the climax of all the teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith on love and friendship: "Until we have obtained perfect love we are liable to fall, and when we have the testimony that our names are sealed in the Lamb's Book of Life we have perfect love, and then it isn't possible for false Christs to deceive us" (<i>Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith</i>, p. 9).<br><br>One of the most touching scenes in the life of the Prophet Joseph (and one of the most thrilling, for it demonstrates the unbounded love of his followers for their beloved Prophet) was when, in the summer of 1843, the Prophet Joseph Smith rode triumphantly into Nauvoo after he had been kidnapped by a couple of sheriffs. His friends had come to the rescue, and he entered Nauvoo in triumph. The Saints had been notified the day before of his coming, and almost all the people came out meet him, with his wife, Emma, and his brother, Hyrum in the lead. After embracing his wife and his brother Hyrum, he mounted his favorite horse, Old Charlie. The band struck up "Hail, Columbia," and the procession started into town. Besides a long line of carriages and persons on horseback, the streets were lined with people whose countenances were joyous and full of satisfaction to see their beloved Prophet once more safe. The Prophet was greeted with cheers from the people and the booming of gun and cannon.<br><br>At his home he was embraced by his mother, with tears of joy streaming down her cheeks, while his little children clung to him with feelings of enthusiastic and enraptured pleasure. His little son Fred exclaimed, "Pa, the Missourians won't take you away again, will they?" His friends from out of town looked on with amazement and astonishment, but with unconcealed pleasure at the loving attachment of the Prophet's family and his friends toward him. His friends were loath to depart. One can feel the Prophet's love for his friends as he blessed them: "I thank you for your kindness and love for me. I bless you all, in the name of Jesus Christ."<br><br>Josiah Quincy spent two days in Nauvoo. He followed the Prophet Joseph around. He noted the power and influence of the Prophet as he walked among the people. It was then that Quincy said, "General Smith, it seems to me that you have too much power to be safely trusted in one man."<br><br>Joseph replied, "In your hands, or that of any other man, so much power would no doubt be dangerous. I am the only man in the world whom it would be safe to trust with it. Remember, I am a prophet." And in all the solemnity of my soul I testify to you that he is and was a prophet, a servant of the Most High God, a seer of God, a revealer of truth, and a friend to man, in the sacred name of our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Ivan J.

<h1>Priorities - Victor L. Brown - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
My dear brothers and sisters, this is a glorious sight in front of me and behind me: so many wonderful young people gathered here tonight for a righteous purpose. I feel we have here young men and women of the same caliber as the sons of Helaman but ten times greater in number. These are not my sentiments alone. I visited with the chief justice of the United States, Associate Justice Powell of the Supreme Court, and other judges who attended the dedication of the Law School this week, and they were enthusiastic about the students they saw on this campus. Many of them said you were different. One of them noticed that you even walk on the sidewalks and not on the lawns. Mr. Chief Justice Burger was so impressed with his impromptu visit with the law students. He said that many intelligent, sharp questions were asked, but that they were respectful questions. He felt an attitude of respect from those in the group. I couldn't have been more proud as I listened to these distinguished guests praise you and your school.<br><br>You find yourselves here at a very interesting and important time in the history of Brigham Young University. As the centennial of the University is celebrated, we are reminded more forcefully than at any other time of our heritage and, I hope, our blessings.<br><br>This school is different from other schools. It has a different faculty, a different student body, a different administration, a different Board of Trustees. Visitors tell us of these differences and yet I'm not sure they understand fully what makes the difference. There are many reasons. In my opinion one of the most basic reasons is we are "not ashamed of the gospel of Jesus Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/rom/1.16?lang=eng#p15">see Romans 1:16</a>). Another reason is that we know each of us is a spirit child of a loving Heavenly Father. We also know that, should we be valiant in this life, we can return to that same Heavenly Father.<br><br>I hope that no student on this campus is afraid to be different from the world. Of course, it isn't too hard when you have several thousand others who think and act as you do. It's not quite so easy, however, when you leave here and go out into the world. As I look at you, I don't see a mass of some eighteen thousand people; I see eighteen to twenty thousand individuals--each a child of God, endowed with separate and distinct personalities, talents, and abilities. You come from the same number of different homes and environments--from farms, villages, towns, and cities--from different cultures having different aspirations and desires. Yet with all of these differences, the Lord has told us, "If ye are not one ye are not mine" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/38.27?lang=eng#p26">D&amp;amp;C 38:27</a>). This, of course, has reference to our being one in keeping his commandments.<br><h2><b>The Right Attitude</b></h2><br>Have you ever considered how important attitude is? A. B. Wells tells of an experience she had with a young man who had the right kind of attitude. As I relate this experience, will you please adapt it to your personal situation, not just in obtaining an education, but also in your attitude toward the Church and your responsibilities in it?<br><br><i>The great overland bus came to a stop. I looked out of the window to see the fringe of a small town. On the other side of the highway, pastureland stretched in many rolling acres. Suddenly I turned from that peaceful scene to see the reason for our stop. One lone passenger entered. The young man, hesitating a bit, looked shyly around. Noting the vacant place beside me, he asked haltingly, "Do you mind if I sit here?"</i><br><br><i>"Not at all," I answered, "I like company when I travel. Do sit down."</i><br><br><i>He removed his cap and slid into the seat. After a moment he inquired, "Going far, lady?"</i><br><br><i>"Only as far as Fort Worth, that is my home," I replied. "We will be there in a little less than an hour."</i><br><br><i>"Think of that," he said with a seeming air of relief. "I've been hoping I'd run into someone from there. Don't know much about the place; I grew up on a ranch far out beyond where I boarded the bus. I'm on my way to Fort Worth, but I don't know how to find the school once I am there."</i><br><br><i>"What school is that? Maybe I can help you," I said.</i><br><br><i>"It's that real big school; college, I guess you'd call it." Then he went on gravely, "You see, I'm just out of the army, and I'll get to start school. Servicemen can go, you know, and Uncle Sam pays for it."</i><br><br><i>"You'll be a student at Texas Christian University?" I asked.</i><br><br><i>"Oh, I don't know just where they'll send me, but I'm all excited over having the chance to go at all. You see I didn't have much schoolin' as I grew up. But before I get started anywhere I have to go to the Forth Worth School, an' take what they call an 'attitude' test. After I take it, they will know where to send me."</i><br><br><i>"Poor dear," I mused, "he means aptitude, but I can't embarrass him by explaining."</i><br><br><i>After a short silence he asked enthusiastically, "Ain't it wonderful what they are doing for us guys--sending us to school?"</i><br><br><i>"Well," I suggested, "the government feels that you did a lot for your country; it is the least the country can do for you."</i><br><br><i>"Maybe," he drawled, "but what's fighting a few battles amount to if a fellow can get educated? I'm getting the big end of the deal, lady. I've made up my mind to study real hard. I don't want Uncle Sam's money throwed away on me."</i><br><br><i>Later we stood in the Fort Worth bus station. In his shirt pocket was the slip of paper that was to give him his "attitude" test. With a strong calloused hand he gripped mine, "Thanks a million, ma'am. I feel like I am already on my way to be gettin' that schoolin'. Ain't it wonderful?" As I settled myself and my bags in a taxi, I began to review in my mind the gratitude and enthusiasm displayed by the prospective student. "Why," I thought, "he has the priceless ingredient for success--a right attitude." Perhaps he had used the correct word, after all.</i>[<i>Sunshine Magazine</i>, September 1963]<br><h2><b>Correct Priorities</b></h2><br>Now that we all have the right attitude, I should like to introduce the theme of what I have to say by relating an experience I had in Japan some time ago. Approximately six years ago I was in Osaka, Japan. I received a telephone call from one of the Japanese officers of the Church requesting an appointment. He indicated he had a personal problem to review with me. I invited him to my hotel room and there listened to one of the most intelligent and articulating young men I had ever met. He was a college graduate. He had majored in a special field of science and was employed by a stable, conservative corporation. It happened that one of his classmates who was at the top of his graduating class in the same field of science had become employed by a relatively new, progressive firm in Tokyo. Several times in recent months this classmate had tried to entice his friend, a member of the Church, to come and work for his company. Little interest was shown until one day a vice-president of the firm made contact and indicated he would like to have this young Mormon come to work for him. He could set his own salary, and it could be three or four times what he was then making. His response was, "I have a position in my Church. If there is the slightest question in the minds of the officers of my Church about my leaving Osaka, which will require my being released from my Church position, it doesn't matter how much money you offer me. I will have no interest in your proposal."<br><br>The vice-president answered, "I'm not a Christian. I know nothing about religion, but you are the kind of man I want in my organization."<br><br>This was his dilemma: should he move from Osaka to Tokyo, which would require his being released from his Church assignment? Of course, I assured him he could serve the Lord in Tokyo as well as in Osaka. So he moved to Tokyo.<br><br>I happened to be in Tokyo last October, and I received another call from this same young man asking for a conference. We visited for quite some time. Now, this fine, intelligent young man had become extremely successful in his field. He had broadened his experience and was now a consultant teaching top managers in major corporations how to operate their companies. He had become a specialist in human dynamics--in other words, teaching people how to behave as they thought they were behaving or as they knew they should be behaving. His time was in great demand. He was making a very handsome income. He was neglecting his Church work, and he was neglecting his family responsibilities. Now his dilemma was "What should I do?" I told him I wouldn't tell him what to do, but did tell him that there was a scripture that would tell him what to do--if he was truly converted. Then I quoted the scriptures: "But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/matt/6.33?lang=eng#p32">Matthew 6:33</a>). I sensed that this scripture might have caused a few little ripples, because he had tasted the fruits of success in the business world. However, we parted as good friends.<br><br>A few weeks after I returned home I received a letter from him. He said that now he had his priorities straightened out. He had resigned from the company. His first priority would be his family; second, his Church; and then employment. That is what I wish to discuss tonight, my brothers and sisters: setting priorities--setting priorities and then reviewing them to see that we are not straying. Of course, in setting priorities we must establish goals or objectives. Then, establishing priorities aids us in achieving our goals. It helps us place first things first.<br><br>You have heard many times of the pilot who announces to his passengers that he had some good news and some bad news: The good news was "We are traveling at six hundred miles an hour." The bad news, "We are lost." I suppose he had an objective, and that was to arrive at his destination. But his priorities were confused. He let himself get lost. Many people have the same problem. I am quite sure every person would agree that the ultimate goal for each of us is to return to our Heavenly Father, and yet sometimes we become confused and lost in the process. Satan has an unusual ability to distract our attention and deflect us from our course. But if our first priority had been to keep our eye on the compass, we would not have lost our way.<br><h2><b>The Proper Relationship with the Father and the Son</b></h2><br>May I suggest some thoughts for your consideration. To me the permanent, unchanging, first priority in our lives is our relationship with our Heavenly Father and his Son Jesus Christ. If that relationship is one of love, of trust, and of obedience, all else will be well. May I try to picture for you what I mean? Recently an attractive young woman--the age of the majority of you students, one of your peers--came to my office with her parents. She came from a good family, but she had lost her way and now was in serious difficulty. She was unmarried and expecting a child. What should she do? My heart went out to her. I think she loved the Lord. She had forgotten, however, that if you love the Lord you keep in touch with him and you keep his commandments. She had control over her emotions until I asked her if she said her prayers. Then she began to cry. How important it is to communicate daily, and more often if necessary, with our Heavenly Father. He always loves us whether we are good or bad. It takes initiative on our part if he is to bless us.<br><br>Another experience occurred last Thursday when all of the General Authorities met in the upper room of the Salt Lake Temple under the direction of the First Presidency. This we do on the first Thursday of each month. This is our fast day. One of the most inspiring experiences for me associated with this meeting is to view three paintings portraying three experiences in the life of the Savior. They hang on the wall over the chairs where the First Presidency sit. One shows the Savior on the shores of the Sea of Galilee. Another shows him hanging on the cross, and the third shows him just after he has risen from the tomb. This latter one is the one which draws my attention most of all. The artist has caught what I visualize would most likely be the feelings one would have were he to find himself in the presence of the risen Lord. The Savior is standing straight and tall, looking down with a smile on his face upon the face of a lovely woman who is reverently kneeling before him. She is looking up into his eyes with a worshipful expression on her countenance. To me, being worthy to be received by him, as the artist has portrayed, could well be the first priority of every Latter-day Saint woman and man.<br><h2><b>Eternal Family Relationships</b></h2><br>Akin to that priority, of course, would be the goal of temple marriage and becoming a righteous parent in Zion. The establishment of righteous and eternal families is our most important responsibility. The Lord commanded that we multiply and replenish the earth (see <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/gen/1.28?lang=eng#p27">Genesis 1:28</a>). He also said, "Children are an heritage of the Lord. ... Happy is the man that hath his quiver full of them" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/ps/127.3,5?lang=eng#2">Psalms 127:3, 5</a>). He had also indicated that he who fails to take care of his own is worse than an infidel (see <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/1-tim/5.8?lang=eng#p7">1 Timothy 5:8</a>).<br><br>Some of you have begun your families. You will never have a more important responsibility in this life. President McKay said, "No success can compensate for failure in the home." There are some very strident, loud voices in society today teaching lessons that come from Satan himself. They would try to tell you that marriage is not necessary for a man and a woman to live together, that sexual intercourse out of wedlock is a part of normal, acceptable relationships, that should a couple marry there should be no more than two children--and better still, no children at all. The daughter of one of our fine Church families recently announced to her parents that she would not have any children, that she was embarrassed at the size of their family--four--and that her parents had better not have any more. And yet the Lord has said, "Children are an heritage of the Lord." I'm not sure that the Lord has predetermined when a couple has its quiver full of them.<br><br>There are those who are not blessed with natural children. There are some wonderful women who do not have the opportunity for marriage in this life. I believe they, as all of us, will be judged not only on their actions, but also on the intent of their hearts, as taught by King Benjamin.<br><br>While some of you are parents, or about to become so, there are many who have that experience to look forward to in a few years. For you young women in particular, my I pass on some good advice from Rosemary Park, given when she was president of Barnard College. Speaking to young woman entering college, she said:<br><br><i>In the next few years you are undertaking the interior decorating of your living for the rest of your life. You are determining whether it is to be sparse and niggardly or whether it is to be rich and varied and vibrant. Most of you will probably live to be one hundred. If you want to keep from being a stuffy bore for forty years, that is between sixty and one hundred, then you've got to learn to be something now. In other words, you can't rely on preserving either your youthful charm or your feminine allure through one hundred. To be young and feminine at sixteen is no achievement. To be a respected person at sixty is.</i>[<i>Saturday Review</i>, 20 April 1963]<br><h2><b>Obedience to the Prophet</b></h2><br>Another point of priority that to me is right at the top of the list is best described in a song--"Come, Listen to a Prophet's Voice." What a wonderful blessing we have to have a living prophet on the earth today, one who speaks with the Lord and for him. When he speaks to us as the prophet, it is as though the Lord himself were speaking. It is essential then to have the courage to obey. If we listen to him and fail to obey, of what value is it to listen?<br><br>One of the great lessons on obedience is found in the Old Testament:<br><br><i>Now, Naaman, captain of the host of the king of Syria, was a great man with his master, and honourable, because by him the Lord had given deliverance unto Syria: he was also a mighty man in valour, but he was a leper. ...</i>[You will recall that the king of Syria sent Naaman to the king of Israel, thinking he could cure him of leprosy, which he could not do. Elisha heard of the king's distress, and suggested that Naaman come to him, Elisha.]<br><br><i>So Naaman came with his horses and with his chariot, and stood at the door of the house of Elisha.</i><br><br><i>And Elisha sent a messenger unto him, saying, Go and wash in Jordan seven times, and thy flesh shall come again to thee, and thou shalt be clean.</i><br><br><i>But Naaman was wroth, and went away, and said, Behold, I thought, He will surely come out to me, and stand, and call on the name of the Lord his God, and strike his hand over the place, and recover the leper.</i><br><br><i>Are not Abana and Pharpar rivers of Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel? may I not wash in them, and be clean? So he turned and went away in a rage.</i><br><br><i>And his servants came near, and spake unto him, and said, My father, if the prophet had bid thee do some great thing, wouldst thou not have done it? how much rather then, when he saith to thee, Wash, and be clean?</i><br><br><i>Then went he down, and dipped himself seven times in Jordan, according to the saying of the man of God: and his flesh came again like unto the flesh of a little child, and he was clean.</i>[<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/2-kgs/5.1,9-14?lang=eng#1">2 King 5:1, 9–14</a>]<br><br>Naaman showed obedience to a prophet's voice. Even the Savior learned obedience, for we read in the scriptures: "Though he were a Son, yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered; And being made perfect, he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him" <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/heb/5.8-9?lang=eng#p7">(Hebrews 5:8–9</a>).<br><h2><b>Service</b></h2><br>There seems to be no end to the priorities, and they all seem so important. Yet many of them can be worked on simultaneously. One of these is service. The Savior himself tells us how important service is. In Saint Luke we read:<br><br><i>And, behold, a certain lawyer stood up, and tempted him, saying, Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?</i><br><br><i>He said unto him, What is written in the law? how readest thou?</i><br><br><i>And he answering said, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all they heart, and with all thy soul, and with all they strength, and with all thy mind; and thy neighbor as thyself.</i><br><br><i>And he said unto him, Thou hast answered right: this do, and thou shalt live.</i><br><br><i>But he, willing to justify himself, said unto Jesus, And who is my neighbour?</i>[<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/luke/10.25-29?lang=eng#p24">Luke 10:25–29</a>]<br><br>Jesus then told of a good Samaritan who found the robbed and wounded man who had fallen among thieves and who had already been passed by a priest and a Levite. You will recall how the good Samaritan took care of his needs. Then Jesus said, "Which now of these three, thinkest thou, was neighbour unto him that fell among the thieves? And he said, He that shewed mercy on him. Then said Jesus unto him, Go, and do thou likewise" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/luke/10.36-37?lang=eng#p35">Luke 10:36–37</a>). It would be interesting to know what some of these characters said as they arrived home that day. In<i>The New Testament Speaks</i>by Obert C. Tanner we read the following:<br><br><i>In his interesting book,</i>Stewardship Parables of Jesus,<i>Dr. Long writes an imaginary sketch of what each character in the parable told his family when he reached home that night. He has the priest say, "I saw a sorry sight on the road down today. It seems that the robbers got that traveling man today. I always told him not to carry too much money and never to resist the brigands. He must have done both today, because they evidently took both money and life.</i><br><br><i>"I shall take this matter up with the officers of the church. We need better provisions for relief in such cases. I would have helped myself, but apparently the fellow was already dead, and I would have missed my appointment on the program of the meeting of the priests of Jericho if I had stopped to look after the case myself. I referred to the evils of robbery and needs of relief in my address to the priests. I think the church ought to do more preaching along the line of honesty and business and government, and our relief societies should have more money with which to look after such cases. As my boys grow up, I hope they will become great preachers of righteousness for such a time as this."</i><br><br><i>Dr. Long continues with the innkeeper. And late in the evening, when the guests had all retired, in the living quarters of the inn, the innkeeper, or hotel manager, speaks to his family: "Well, this house by the side of the road has witnessed a real drama today. You remember that traveling man who always makes it here around noon? Instead of his putting in for lunch, we had two dour-looking churchmen--a priest and a Levite. They had little to do with each other, ate at separate tables, but both told the same story. It seems the robbers got our good-natured and free-handed man today. The priest was sure they had left him dead, but the Levite offered some hope that life was yet in him. They both insisted that I send up for his body, and, if possible, bring him to life. I sent the porter out to get a couple of mules, and that was what I was preparing to do when you asked me this afternoon where I was going. But before I could get away, I saw the strangest sight these old eyes have ever seen. You remember how the Jews hate the Samaritans? Well, what should I see but a Samaritan with the wounded Jewish traveler on his own mule coming up to the inn? And that is the fellow that you heard groaning over in the other room a while ago. The Samaritan paid his bill and said he would take care of all expenses. Surely this is the spirit of the Nazarene whose teaching is the talk of the town; and it will bring these people of different races together as nothing else. I am glad we have lived to see this day when a man despised will go out of his way and, at great sacrifice of time and money, do a good turn to the despiser by sharing his goods with him. Surely we have lots to talk to God about in our prayers tonight."</i>[<i>The New Testament Speaks</i>, pp. 343, 345–46]<br><br>Service to mankind should be a hallmark of a true Latter-day Saint's life.<br><h2><b>Sacrifice</b></h2><br>There are so many other principles, but for now, finally, sacrifice. The Lord has promised that he will open the windows of heaven if we will pay our tithes and offerings. Sacrifice is preparing us to live the higher law--the law of consecration. Again the Lord was asked about eternal life:<br><br><i>And a certain ruler asked him, saying, Good Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?</i><br><br><i>And Jesus said unto him, Why callest thou me good? none is good, save one, that is, God.</i><br><br><i>Thou knowest the commandments, Do not commit adultery, Do not kill, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Honour thy father and thy mother.</i><br><br><i>And he said, All these have I kept from my youth up.</i><br><br><i>Now when Jesus heard these things, he said unto him, Yet lackest thou one thing: sell all that thou hast, and distribute unto the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come, follow me.</i><br><br><i>And when he heard this, he was very sorrowful: for he was very rich.</i><br><br><i>And when Jesus saw that he was very sorrowful, he said, How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God!</i><br><br><i>For it is easier for a camel to go through a needle's eye, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.</i>[<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/luke/18.18-25?lang=eng#p17">Luke 18:18–25</a>]<br><br>Those who pay their tithing, fast offerings, ward budget, and all that is asked are preparing themselves to live the law of consecration. I am convinced that, as soon as we are prepared, that great law will be given to us. There are those who are ready now, but there are not enough.<br><br>In conclusion, let me tell you of one lovely woman who is ready. Some time ago I received a telephone call from a bishop. His clerk had opened a contribution envelope which contained a substantial amount of money. It was a contribution from a widow who had been made a widow for the second time in her young life. She had been injured in the accident that took her husband's life and had not fully recovered. She had a family of young children to raise. The contribution was the tithing on the insurance settlement on the death of her husband. The clerk said to the bishop, "Sister So-and-so needs this money much more than the Church does. Don't you think we should return it?" The bishop asked me the same question: "Bishop, what does Sister So-and-so need more than all the money in the world can buy?" Can you imagine the opening of the windows of heaven to this wonderful young woman who had the faith, the conviction, and the devotion to her Heavenly Father to pay her tithes and offerings?<br><br>This experience of being with you tonight is a wonderful, thrilling experience. When I think of all of the energy that rests in your bosoms and think of how important it is that that energy be channeled in proper channels with righteous desires, my heart overflows. Each of us is a child of God, and we must always remember that in all we do, in every act--when we're alone when we're on a date, when we're out with a group. If we'll remember who we are and act accordingly, so that our Father who knows us better than we know ourselves will be pleased, what a glorious life we will live!<br><br>I want you young people to know that I know God lives. I know this beyond a shadow of a doubt. I know that Jesus Christ is the Son of God, the Only Begotten in the flesh, and that God the Father and his Son, Jesus Christ, appeared to Joseph Smith--a boy of fourteen years old, younger than any of you students. I know that for several years following that great vision heavenly messengers trained Joseph Smith for his mission. It didn't just happen miraculously any more than it's going to happen that you're going to gain your education miraculously. We have to train and learn how to discipline ourselves if we're going to achieve the fullest measure of our creation.<br><br>I know that Spencer W. Kimball is a living prophet of God. I have the great blessing as a member of the bishopric to meet with the First Presidency at least twice each week. As I sense and feel and witness the workings of the Spirit of the Lord on that great and wonderful man, I cannot deny that he is the Lord's mouthpiece on the face of the earth today. My prayer for you and for me tonight is that we will follow him, that we'll listen to him, and that we will have the courage to obey him. After all is said and done, when you go about your labors remember the one scripture I suggested to that wonderful Japanese Latter-day Saint: "Seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you." I ask this in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Victor L.

<h1>ent Body and the President - Dallin H. Oaks - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Each year this annual President's assembly is one of my greatest challenges. I feel responsible to give something different each fall. Now, as I enter my fifth year, I have already spoken on most of our major concerns, and these talks have been disseminated widely in print and on television. I have spoken on various aspects of BYU standards, on the meaning of a University education, and on the blessing of commandments. This fall I have felt impressed to speak to you about yourselves and about myself, a kind of centennial review of the student body and the President.<br><br>During the year I often visit one of our campus cafeterias, take a tray, and enjoy my lunch with some surprised group of students. I find this is one of my best chances to find out what is on the minds of our students. One fall a few years ago I joined a table of freshman boys at the Cannon Center. Without introducing myself, I began to question the group about their experiences and view of BYU. Soon, one of the young men, apparently slightly irritated at this probing from a stranger, said, "Do you work here or something?" When I replied that I did, he asked a few questions of his own: "What do you do?" "I am the President," I replied. Ignoring his neighbor's jabbing elbow, he pressed on, "What're you president of?" I explained and we all had a somewhat tight laugh together. Then he added this comment I will never forget. "Oh," he said, "I go to all of the assemblies and I see you there, but you are so far away I can't see your face."<br><br>When this freshman boy made that comment, I resolved that sometime I would try to help the student body see my face. That resolve was reinforced later when I told a student that my wife and children and I had done a lot of camping, and had in fact stayed overnight in our tent, sleeping on the ground in twenty-five different states of the union. He was incredulous. "Do you really do that?" he asked. "I can't imagined a President doing anything like that." Again I was reminded that the aura and distance of the office were so great that my family and I were not real persons to most. Even my children felt the distance. After they saw me sitting on the stand for one of my talks, one of my two oldest daughters said, "Daddy, you looked so cross and crabby. If we hadn't known you we would have thought you were angry." This reminded me that only my closest associates had heard me laugh or knew that I have some good-natured fun even in the midst of some very stressful circumstances. I wanted to remedy this since I am a teacher and it is not wise for a teacher to be so distant from others that he is not a real person to them. It is important that you see my face, just as I try to see yours. I am only sorry that your numbers, more than twenty-five thousand, and the shortness of my time make it necessary for us to get acquainted in a highly public manner, before one another and a large television audience.<br><br>First, I will tell you something about yourselves, the students of BYU. Then I will tell you something of me. What I say about myself stands for thousands of others who have committed their lives to teaching or other service in the University. Each has an interesting story. Each has pursued a path of adversity, sacrifice, and accomplishment to bring him or her to this place. And remember that we are not so far removed from the challenges you are experiencing. In fact, most of us are so close that as we look into your faces each year we vicariously relive your confusion, your wonderment, and your pain. Our fondest hope is that you can benefit from our experiences, obtain a preparation superior to what we obtained, and go on to accomplishments far greater than ours. You must do this, for I am convinced that your challenges will be greater than ours. But in the end, the most important qualities about faculty and students are those we share: we are all spirit children of God, struggling to perfect ourselves, serve one another, and return to our Heavenly Father.<br><h2><b>A Profile of the Student Body</b></h2><br>First, a few facts about the student body: 52 percent of you are women; 48 percent are men. Despite this slight preponderance of women, there are six times more married men than married women, and as a result the single women at BYU outnumber the single men by a ratio of twelve to ten. Moreover, two out of three persons in the student body account for two-thirds of the students. (I just threw that in to see if you were listening.) Don't laugh at this, men. Our women students get better grades, with grade-point averages that lead the men by a small margin in every class except the sophomores. We also have a large number of transfer students. Last year 30 percent of our undergraduate students and 52 percent of our graduates had transferred from another college or university.<br><br>About one-half of our BYU students are employed part-time to support themselves in the University, one-half of these, or about six thousand, being employed by the University. Because of the generous appropriations we receive from Church tithing revenues, more than two-thirds of the cost of your education at BYU is paid by the Church; your tuition covers less than one-third. Thus, every student admitted to BYU has, in effect, a scholarship of about $1,400 per year. Our Board of Trustees is obviously interested in keeping the tuition low and creating as many jobs as possible to help our students work their way through college. That is evident in the fact that when you compare the amount we pay our student employees with the total amount we receive in student tuition, an amount equivalent to forty cents is paid out to the student workers of BYU for every dollar taken in as tuition and fees. Our student payroll is so large that the cost to increase the compensation of our student workers by five cents per hour is approximately $200,000 a year. Thus, the raise of fifteen cents an hour we gave this year is equivalent to two-thirds of a million dollars or thirty dollars for each of our twenty-five thousand students.<br><br>One out of seven of our entering freshman last year was a convert to the Church, and half of these had been converted within the last three years. The proportion of our entering freshman who came from families with four or more children was 78 percent, and those who expected to have families of four or more children themselves was 95 percent, materially higher than their parents' records.<br><br>Why did our freshman come to BYU? The four most important reasons they cited, in order of importance, were: the spiritual environment, associations with other Latter-day Saint people, the high academic standing of the institution, and the competence of the faculty. About a dozen other factors, such as low-cost tuition, work opportunities, parental wishes, and marriage opportunities, were also mentioned, but they trailed far behind the first four reasons.<br><br>The essential optimism of last year's freshmen is evident in the fact that 97 percent indicated that they expected to have a B average or better by the end of their freshman year. Ninety percent said they looked on college as a real opportunity for intellectual development.<br><br>But only 60 percent said they read any daily newspaper, including the<i>Daily Universe,</i>or any weekly news magazine. Seventy percent indicated that they rarely did serious reading aside from what they had to do in their course work and that they rarely questioned the accuracy of statements made in the textbooks and reference books. Over 40 percent indicated that they generally put off writing themes, reports, and term papers until the last minute. As we contemplate these responses of entering freshman, it is heartening to have this reaffirmation that there is still need for the teacher and the University.<br><br>Our survey of freshman men and women also gave some insights on the interesting subject of choosing a mate. In response to questions about the most important qualities they would seek in selecting a mate, the principal characteristics cited, in addition to the obvious ones of love and enjoyment of companionship, were membership and activity in the Church, maturity, character development, and a sense of humor. Physical appearance was practically at the bottom of the list. In fact, in terms of characteristics "very important" in the selection of a mate, sense of humor ranked six times higher than physical appearance. So much for the accuracy of surveys! As for me, I was more impressed with the accuracy of the attitude reflect in an unsigned letter I received during the first week of school last fall from one of the Heritage Halls:<br><br><i>Dear President Oaks,</i><br><br><i>It has come to my attention that there are very few good looking men on this campus. I was under the impression that BYU was a HAPPY HUNTING GROUND for</i>[women].<i>I feel that I was lured here with false information and I would like either a complete refund or a Tall, Dark, and Handsome MAN to report immediately if not sooner to</i>[such and such]<i>Hall. We will handle things from there.</i><br><br><i>We sincerely appreciate your cooperation in this matter.</i><br><br>[signed]<br><br><i>A DESPERATELY</i>[sic]<i>DISAPPOINTED</i>[sic]<i>MAN-HUNTER</i><br><br>That letter says it all. Its playful writer, pretending she came to BYU for romance, can't send her message without revealing that at least for the present she needs education more than matrimony.<br><h2><b>Some Qualities of BYU Students</b></h2><br>Again and again I have been impressed and humbled by the great personal qualities and desires of BYU students. Nowhere on earth could you find a group of young people who are your equal for faith, unselfishness, teachableness, knowledge of the gospel, and desire to do right. That last factor--desire to do right and the basic optimism it engenders--is probably the most apparent of all your virtues. After the author Alvin Toffler spoke on this campus two years ago he had lunch with Dr. Robert K. Thomas and expressed his astonishment and admiration at the faces he had seen at BYU. They were different than he had seen at any other campus on his nationwide tour. He remarked on the absence of fear or discouragement and the fact that he had seen in your face a kind of "moral earnestness" that gave him hope for the nation. Similarly, the non-LDS editor and publisher of a major newspaper in California described seeing in the faces at BYU the generation he had envisioned for many years that would rise up and lead the country.<br><br>The same distinguishing virtues of BYU students appear in the description of a faculty member who came here after an experience at another university. He described how he had seen young people at the other university depressed at being involved in the drug scene and in other types of immoral and criminal behavior. Similarly, at BYU, where our students set such high standards for themselves, he had also seen young people depressed and discouraged with themselves, but the BYU students' despair was because they had not been able to keep their resolution for regular early-morning jogging and scripture study.<br><br>We have high expectations of ourselves, and others share them. That makes us especially vulnerable to criticism, and how some love to criticize! It doesn't always turn out as happily as the criticism one of our hosts received when a prominent visitor excused himself from his luncheon table to visit the men's room on the third floor of the Wilkinson Center. When the visitor returned he said, "Well, I've discovered you Mormons are just like everyone else. When I go in a public restroom in some other location I usually find things written on the walls, and it's the same way here in the Wilkinson Center." Then, before our host could finish a lame apology, the guest admitted that he was only teasing. "It's true there was something written on the wall in there," he said, "but I have never seen that word on a restroom wall anyplace else." "Well, what was it?" his host asked. "Just one word: Repent."<br><br>And repent you do. Scores of letters come to my office from students who realize they have committed some wrong involving the University and who desire to complete their repentance by making restitution and getting back on the road of growth and progress. For example, just two weeks ago I received the following letter:<br><br><i>President Oaks:</i><br><br><i>Please accept this $30.00 in payment of a fire extinguisher that was taken from BYU lower campus two years ago. I am going on a mission and didn't want this on my conscience for two years.</i><br><br>I have also received letters of regret and confession about cheating on examinations, plagiarism in submission papers, false certifications, and cheating or attempting to cheat on our dress and grooming standards. In every instance we try to help the individual make the matter right with himself or herself and any other persons who have been wronged. Although our policies must apply to general situations and large masses of people, we do try to focus our concerns on the individual, just as we know our Savior would do. No experience gives me greater personal pleasure than to see young men and women grow toward their stature as sons and daughters of God.<br><br>Along the rocky road of self-improvement most of us tend to get a little self-righteous, and the average BYU student probably has a slightly larger than average measure of self-righteousness. A<i>Daily Universe</i>cartoon a few years ago gave a deft criticism of this tendency. The cartoon showed a hippie, obviously not a member of the BYU community, standing in a campus location surrounded and almost covered by a pile of rocks and boulders, looking all bruised and beaten by the stoning. "All I said," he explained to a bystander, " was, 'Let him who is without sin cast the first stone.'"<br><br>One of the most appreciated virtues of BYU students is the support they show and the appreciation they express for the ideals and standards of the University and for their teachers and administrators. As I have discussed this characteristic with the presidents of other colleges and universities, they have been almost unwilling to believe that I am frequently stopped on campus by students who say, "President Oaks, what can we do to help BYU?" or "Tell me what I can do to help you as President." I receive many letters of appreciation and support, and they mean more to me than I can tell you. I will quote only one example, which I select because its source and content are quite unexpected. It came from a young man who had just graduated from BYU:<br><br><i>Four years ago I came to Brigham Young University because I wanted to associate with people who humbly follow in the footsteps of the Savior. I found the sort of people I was looking for and experienced the four happiest years of my life. Even though I was not a member of the church and I did not join the church, I always felt welcome wherever I went and I feel greatly blessed that I have had the opportunity to personally experience the great power and beauty of the gospel of Jesus Christ as lived by the LDS people. . . . I am very grateful to the many faithful members of the church and other benefactors of the university that have helped make my education possible. I shall always be proud that Brigham Young University is my alma mater. It is my sincere hope that many others will be blessed as I have been.</i><br><br>I even receive plates of cookies or cakes from time to time, usually with messages of love and support. Sometimes the offering is anonymous. While I do make a practice of reading anonymous letters, I admit to a certain big-city bias against sampling of anonymous cookies.<br><br>BYU students are also remarkable for their unselfishness and their willingness to serve. The work of the Student Development Association, which is raising money for our addition to the Harold B. Lee Library, is one example. Our students' generous response to the SDA's efforts is truly remarkable. Similar unselfishness is evident in the programs carried on under the auspices of the student body office of Student Community Services, currently presided over by ASBYU vice-president Sylvia Law. Their projects include services to senior citizens and the Utah State Hospital, community beautification and conservation, and the "You've Got a Friend" program, where our students work on a one-on-one basis to help young students in the local school districts. Last year BYU students recorded over ten thousand service hours, making you the national leader in service hours for a university.<br><br>In fact, you have been so oriented toward service and so unselfish with your time that University and Church officials have sometimes had to encourage you to slow down and think more of your own needs for health, education, and self-support during this critical period. Although this caution is not needed for everyone, I would say to a few of you who need this counsel that you should use good judgment not to let your own wonderful impulses to serve others today use so much of your time that you do not obtain the education you need to give maximum service to your family, your Church, and your community in the future. Use good judgment. Remember King Benjamin's caution, as he told his people to impart of their substance to the poor, and to visit and administer to the needs of the sick: "See that all these things are done in wisdom and order," he said, "for it is not requisite that man should run faster than he has strength" (Mosiah 4:27).<br><h2><b>About the President</b></h2><br>And now, in the time that remains, I will tell you something about myself. My first intention is to help you to see that your teachers and other leaders have been through the same kinds of experiences that you find so difficult and discouraging. I also want you to see that we do not take ourselves too seriously. Institutions, like the Church and the University, we take seriously, especially in a centennial year when we are enjoying so many dignified, ceremonial occasions. Once in a while we need to step out of our academic robes--literal or figurative--and enjoy a good laugh at ourselves. I propose to offer you a few, but first a little personal history.<br><br>My parents were both raised on Utah farms in very humble circumstances. My father rode a trapline in the predawn hours in all kinds of weather to earn money to attend BYU. Here he supported himself by cleaning out the stables at the National Guard armory. Borrowing money to attend medical school, he graduated, built a large practice in Idaho, and then died at age thirty-seven before he had ever been able to repay the entire debt for his medical education. He left a widow and three children, of which I was the eldest, age eight. Upset with my father's death and the later serious illness of my mother, I went through a difficult period in grade school when I was the dumbest boy in the room. I simply could not or would not do arithmetic, and my spelling was hopeless. I remember one occasion when some classmates threw rocks at me and called me stupid. I have the experience to sympathize with those who find schoolwork difficult. I also have a faith born of experience that failure or mediocrity need not be permanently disabling.<br><br>I also know something of the tensions of uncertainty. When I was a seventeen-year-old high school student in Provo I joined the Utah National Guard field artillery unit that had once included my father. I was corporal in that unit when the Korean War broke out, two weeks after I graduated from high school. Our field artillery group was alerted for active duty, and most of the units were soon called up and sent to training and on to Korea. When it came time to register at BYU in the fall I fully expected to be on my way to Korea before my first quarter was over, but after prayerful consideration I decided to register anyway since this would at least give me something to do while I waited. In that atmosphere of uncertainty I began my college work. The tension and uncertainty continued for the succeeding four years, but so did I. My unit was never called, but the prospect was never far from my mind, especially since missionary work was sharply curtailed and persons immediately vulnerable to military orders, such as I, were not called.<br><br>I also know the feeling of uncertainty about selecting a major. Having come from a medical family, I assumed I should be a medical doctor. Fortunately, I took a typical preparatory premed course during the first quarter of my freshman year and recoiled in horror. The experience of cutting up a frog and dissecting the eye of a beef was sufficient to persuade me that medicine was not my chosen activity. I ricocheted into the language department, where I drifted through French, German, and Russian before admitting to myself that this was not for me either. Along the way I registered for a math series, with algebra in the fall quarter, trigonometry in the winter, and solid geometry in the spring. I got a B in algebra, a C in trigonometry, and then dropped the series at spring registration. I was obviously deficient in math, but I knew a trend when I saw one.<br><br>(I read an earlier draft of this talk out loud at our home evening last night to obtain suggestions from my wife and children. Just before doing so I had chided my fifteen-year-old son for being behind in his algebra class at Provo High. When I read that last passage about my own experience in the math series at BYU he muttered bitterly: "Then why pick on me?")<br><br>As you may have gathered, my initial studies at BYU were erratic. In fact, I did not perform at a consistently high level until June came into my life, and we were married after my sophomore year. I owe so much of my accomplishment to her. She knows this, and it is only appropriate that I acknowledge it to you. I finally selected a major, accounting, during the second quarter of my junior year, but did not decide to try for law school until I was well into my senior year. I chose the University of Chicago because I was selected for a full-tuition scholarship and President Wilkinson said it was one of the best law schools in the country.<br><br>I have no difficulty identifying with students who need to work their way through school. During my entire BYU experience I worked thirty hours a week in a local radio station where I was an announcer and transmitter engineer. This excellent job, at which I worked all through high school as well as in college, paid me 75 cents an hour at the beginning and $1.15 an hour before I graduated. It provided the means to support me and my growing family. I had worked part-time since I was twelve or thirteen. While my widowed mother had the education and the experience to earn a living for our family, I had always felt the responsibility to help out by supporting myself to the maximum degree possible.<br><br>When June and I married we began our family immediately, which temporarily terminated her education after the completion of her freshman year plus one quarter. When I graduated from BYU in the spring of 1954 we had two daughters. Both of these daughters graduated from BYU last year, both are now married, and our oldest daughter made us grandparents last fall.<br><br>Arriving at law school in Chicago with two little babies, we moved into a fifty-five-dollar-a-month apartment in a converted army barracks and proceeded to live a very meager but happy existence during the three years that followed. My scholarship paid my tuition, but all other living expenses were paid from my small earnings as an officer in an artillery battery in an Illinois National Guard and from borrowed funds. Like some of you, our parents had the means and the willingness to help us more than they did, but we wanted to make our own way. We rarely ate any kind of meat except liver and hot dogs, which we had no more than several times a week, but on special occasions we did get some of the less expensive cuts of chicken or hamburger. Our three-room apartment was heated by an oil-fired space heater whose small attached tank had to be filled manually several times each day from storage drums out on the street. When our two daughters were ages two and three, the old one dipped her little cup down into the oil tank on the back of the heater, took a large drink of clear fuel oil, and then shared in generously with her younger sister. Bad results followed, and June had to rush them to the local hospital to have their stomachs pumped. Several weeks later the little girls climbed up into our medicine cabinet and seized a bottle of candy-flavored cough syrup that included some sedative drug. Cooperatively alternating their draws at the bottle, the two finished its contents, with predictable results. June grabbed one child under each arm and rushed for the hospital again. After their stomachs had been pumped, the nurse told June that would be ten dollars each. The total of twenty dollars would be a terrible drain on our funds, and June argued with the nurse, pointing out that the last time she brought the girls in to have their stomachs pumped she had been charged only five dollars each. The nurse made appropriate record of that fact, and within a week we were visited by a Chicago public health nurse, who made some very pointed inquiries about the storage of our harmful substances and our fitness as parents. In the meantime, one of my playful law school classmates was heard to tell a group that Dallin and June Oaks wouldn't drink anything but their daughters would drink everything.<br><br>My favorite play activity with the little girls was "daddy be a bear." When I came home from my studies for a few minutes at lunch and dinnertime, I would set my books on the table and drop down on all fours on the linoleum. Then, making the most terrible growls, I would crawl around the floor after the children, who fled with screams, but always begged for more. "Daddy be a bear" was our favorite game. While I was in my third year of law school a prominent Milwaukee law firm invited June and me to come up at their expense to interview me for a job. As part of the process they had me interviewed by a psychologist, an unusual practice with law firms but standard with that one. As part of his examination this professional asked me to tell him what I saw in some weird ink-blots I had never seen before but which I now know to be a Rorschach test. In the first set of blots I saw nothing but two bears on their hind legs fighting. I couldn't see anything in the second one. The third was clearly a mother bear in the woods followed by a cub, and I so advised the interviewer. After two more blots that meant nothing to me I saw another familiar subject, a bear peering around a large bush. When I described that to the psychologist, he looked at me intently, put down his pencil, and said, "Now, Mr. Oaks, suppose you tell me about your thing about bears." So I told him about "daddy be a bear." He just shook his head, made some notations on a paper, and sent me back to the law firm. I must have passed the test because the firm raised the proposed starting salary by a thousand dollars per year when they received his report. Remember that if you have to take a Rorschach test in Milwaukee. I never did know what that fellow was driving at until I talked to another law student who took the same test. When he told me what he saw in those ink-blots I was shocked. Even if I'd seen that stuff I surely wouldn't have admitted it to a gentleman.<br><br>Our oldest son and third child was born toward the end of my senior year in law school. He is entering BYU as a freshman this fall. After graduating from law school, we lived in Virginia for a year while I served as a law clerk in the United States Supreme Court, and then returned to Chicago for thirteen more years. For the first three I practiced law with a large law firm in Chicago, and during the next ten I was a professor in the law school at the University of Chicago, from which I had graduated. During this period two more children were added to our family, a son and a daughter, who are now in high school and junior high school here in Provo.<br><br>As soon as I had finished my education, June resumed hers, and the completion of her bachelor's degree was an important family project during most of our years in Chicago. She had supported me magnificently during my education, and I felt I an obligation and privilege to give support and cooperation in the completion of hers. I firmly believed that an education is just as important for a woman, married or single, as it is for a man. (I urge you to give careful consideration to a statement I will publish on that subject in the<i>Universe</i>later this week.)<br><br>During our first years in Chicago, June attended Roosevelt University, Wheaton College, and Elmhurst College. She also came out to BYU several summers to take courses in Summer School while I stayed in Chicago, though I joined the family briefly for the weeks permitted by my vacation. During these summers in Provo, June and the children lived in rented student apartments, including one summer in an apartment in Heritage Halls, where I also lived for a week during my vacation. She also took the maximum number of hours permitted through BYU Home Study, and the sight of her studying or at the typewriter in our home was a familiar one to all of us. A favorite experience that characterized this period was the time that our oldest son, then five or six years old, came up to his mother and showed her a shirt that was missing a button. "Mother," he asked sweetly, "will you sew on this button after you have graduated?" Finally, in 1965, fourteen years and five children after she had enrolled at BYU, June received her bachelor's degree from Brigham Young University. All of us consider that one of our family's finest achievements. In the meantime, the boy learned how to sew on his own buttons, which will help him on his mission.<br><br>While June was still working on her degree, I began my first year of law teaching at Chicago. During this time a young man approached me after a class and complimented me warmly on the quality of my presentation. As I began to swell up just a little bit with his compliments, he quickly but unintentionally brought me back to size by concluding: "You're going to be a heck of a fine teacher . . . someday."<br><br>My opinion of myself as a teacher was also somewhat deflated by my youngest son. In the course of trying to teach a four- or five-year-old the principle of tithing, I described how as a young boy on the farm I had gathered every tenth egg to pay in tithing and how I had once driven the horses and a load of hay to the bishop's storehouse. After I finished with such illustrations, drawing liberally on my farm experience since I thought this would be most interesting and vivid to a little boy, I sought to test the effectiveness of my teachings by asking him a question. "If you were a farmer and had a harvest of crops and some livestock, what would you give to the bishop?" The little fellow thought carefully for a moment and then said: "I would give him a very old horse." I have thought of that childish reply many times as I have observed how supposedly mature individuals handle themselves in relation to the principle of tithing. Fortunately, I have had some additional years to work with my son on the subject.<br><br>Last spring an elderly resident of Provo took me down a peg. I had just attended the convocation of the College of Physical Education in the Provo Tabernacle and was rushing out of the Tabernacle to try to get to the Smith Fieldhouse for the convocation of the College of General Studies. My two daughters were graduating, and I wanted to be present for each of them. As I came running out of the Tabernacle dressed in my academic costume, the robes flowing behind me with my agile wife and younger children running to keep up, an elderly man just coming out of the post office across the street stopped, hooked his thumbs in his trouser pockets, and watched the spectacle with a combination of amazement and indulgence. As I hurried past him toward the car he tried to make a friendly conversation with this question and comment: "Well, you finally made it, did you?"<br><br>Those of you who were on the campus last year have heard some opinions of the new Carillon Tower, pro and con. But did you know why it has taken us so long to complete this tower? The workers' language kept getting confounded.<br><br>A few Sundays ago we were walking around the campus on a Sunday afternoon showing the sights to some visiting friends from Chicago. As I showed them various buildings and new construction, they observed that many of the buildings were named after presidents of the University. "What are they going to name after you?" one of them asked. "Nothing, I hope," I replied, pointing out that in its second century BYU was likely to have more presidents than new buildings, and I thought it would be appropriate if I were to be the president who broke the tradition. As we engaged in this conversation, we were walking near the northwest corner of the Eyring Science Center where there is a great air vent. As we passed this vent my freshman son threw his arm around my shoulders and said, "Well, Dad, I think they'll name something for you." Then motioning toward this vent, he said, "Perhaps it could be the Dallin H. Oaks Memorial Hot Air Duct."<br><br>I have always had my best criticism from my own family. For the past ten years Professor Marvin S. Hill of the BYU History Department and I have been working on a book on the trial of the nine men who were indicted for the murder of Joseph Smith, which will be published in the next few weeks. We tried very hard to make the book interesting rather than just scholarly, and I was very proud and sure we had succeeded. About a year ago, when we had what we thought was a final typed manuscript, I proudly presented the fat packet to my wife, June, and asked her to read it and give me her comments. I then went to Washington for several days on business. When I returned I asked her what she thought of the manuscript. She replied that she had only found time to read one chapter. I expressed my disappointment and chided her for not reading the book and helping me. Quick to leap to her mother's defense, our youngest daughter said, "Daddy, I know she was reading the book when you were gone because I came by and woke her up twice."<br><br>And now I would like to introduce you to the youngest member of our family, our sixth child, born on May 27, 1975. You might have read that the births at Utah Valley Hospital set a nationwide record last May for hospitals and communities of its size. The BYU community is surely responsible for most of that distinction, and June and I were proud to participate. We brought little Jenny June with us this morning, as you can see.<br><br>We have had a few expressions of astonishment from acquaintances who assumed we were a little older than we are, and June even made a few jokes herself. The other evening, she was explaining to friends that we had waited thirteen years for this special addition to our family, hoping all the while that we would have more children. "If we have to wait another thirteen years for the next one," she added, "I wonder if we can get maternity benefits on medicare?" But seriously, I assure you that this little girl is the greatest thing that has happened to us in the last four years. I firmly believe that the things of eternal significance, even during the period of our education, are not those the registrar records on the permanent transcript of credits in the University, but those the branch or ward clerk records on the membership records of the Church, including baptisms, marriages in the temple of the Most High, and births of the children of God. I yield to none in my assessment of the importance of our achieving in our educational pursuits, but in the long run it is the growth, knowledge, and wisdom we achieve that enlarges our souls and prepares us for eternity, not the marks on our transcripts. The things of the Spirit are the things that are eternal, and our family relationships, sealed by the power of the priesthood, are the ultimate fruits of the Spirit.<br><br>I have shared this personal portion of my talk in order to help you understand that your teachers and your President are just other Latter-day Saints who are struggling and growing and trying to work out their own salvation, subject to all of the frustrations, difficulties, and joy of family and work. In conclusion, I want to thank you for the fact that the very sweet family life in the Oaks family is in large part due to the consideration of the student community at BYU. Although we live in the midst of this beehive of campus activity, with thousands of students passing our door daily, we are rarely interrupted in the choice family life we salvage from the moments we have together. If even one student in a thousand at BYU stopped by the President's home each year and stayed for one hour, that would cut out a significant portion of the uninterrupted time we have to spend as a family. When I first came I was fearful that this would be the case, but the great understanding and love of our students have intervened, and we live a relatively normal life in that home on the edge of the hill.<br><br>To those of you who are struggling to earn your way through the University, casting about for a suitable major area of study and making great sacrifices to pursue your life's goals, I can only say that you should have a measure of gratitude for these experiences. The strengths you develop by this means will be with you in the eternities to come. Feel no envy for those whose financial or intellectual resources make it easy. The stuff of growth was never made of ease, and the persons who have it easy will need to experience their growth with other sacrifices, or forego the advancement that is the purpose of life. The law of life is properly described in the last two stanzas of the anonymous poem "Trees and Man":<br><br><i>Good timber does not grow with ease.</i><br><i>The stronger winds, the tougher trees.</i><br><i>The further sky, the greater length.</i><br><i>The more the storm, the more the strength.</i><br><i>By sun and cold, by rain and snow,</i><br><i>In "trees or man" good timbers grow.</i><br><br><i>Where thickest stands the "Forest Growth,"</i><br><i>We find the "Patriarchs" of both,</i><br><i>Who hold a converse with the stars,</i><br><i>Whose broken branches show the stars</i><br><i>Of many winds and much of strife.</i><br><i>This is the common law of life.</i><br><br>May God bless us to take advantage of our opportunities and adversities and to grow by them. I know that the gospel is true and that we are led by a prophet of God. I give you that assurance and also the assurance of my love and of the prayerful consideration of the officers and faculty and other workers of this University in all of our activities to serve you and our Heavenly Father, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>© Intellectual Reserve, Inc. All rights reserved.</i>

<h1>nge Benefits - LeGrand Richards - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
As I stand before this wonderful audience for a few moments to take some of your valuable time, I have no greater desire than to have that beautiful prayer uttered in my behalf by Dean Bateman realized. President Oaks has indicated that this is the first devotional for the season, and therefore many of you are probably here for the first time. I want to bear you my testimony that I don't think there's anywhere in this world you could spend the next few years of your lives to a better advantage. If you take advantage of what you get here, it will change your lives and prepare you, not only to be successful in the battle of life, but also to help build the kingdom of God in the earth. The graduates from this institution are renowned all over the world for the leadership that they are giving.<br><h2><b>Choose Worthy Companions</b></h2><br>I imagine that when your parents helped you decide to come here they were not only interested in your academic achievements and accomplishments (although President Oaks has pointed out that your first responsibility is to get an education). But your parents wanted you to associate with other young men and women of your own standards, your own faith. This group here today represents some of the choice young people of the Church from all over the entire world.<br><br>Then there are other fringe benefits you get by attending here that will help to change your life. One of them, of course, is that many of you will find your mates here at this school. That isn't what you came for, of course, but that will be one of the natural fringe benefits. I have a friend, a retired stake president, who sent nine children to this great institution, and all nine of them found companions here. That's a record, and I hope you do as well. When I travel throughout the Church holding conferences (I just got home yesterday from Hawaii), I stay in the homes of the stake presidents everywhere. You'd be surprised how many of them have found their companions here at this great University. It has been a marvelous thing, and it increases our appreciation as leaders of the Church for the Saints who provide the means through their faithful tithes and offerings to make the operation of this wonderful University and building of this marvelous campus a reality. Their support allows so many of our young people to enjoy the blessings thereof.<br><br>I would like to say to the young women that you have to be a little more careful about the men you associate with. This will be one of the most wonderful groups of young men in all the world, but they are not all wonderful, so you have to be careful in the companionship that you seek. A short time ago Sister Richards and I were down in California, and we went to a Relief Society bazaar down there. We met a young lady who is the daughter of one of the families that lived in the stake when I was the stake president there. She had come up to the Y and met a young man who was a member of the Church. She started keeping company with him, and finally he became serious and proposed. But he was not active in the Church, so she said, "I'll never marry a man who doesn't do his duty in the Church and honor his priesthood. I'm going to be able to point to my children and say, 'You follow your father.'" My, I like a girl who has that kind of courage. The young man wasn't willing to pay the price, so their courtship ended right there. In a short time she started keeping company with another young man, and finally their engagement was announced in the newspaper. A friend of this first suitor sent a copy to him in Chicago. When he read it, he called her up all the way to Los Angeles (That was before we had these cheap rates.) and said, "I can't live without you. If you will call off that engagement and give me another chance, I'll do anything and everything you ever ask me to do in the Church." When I met him down there he was a counselor in the bishopric. I mentioned him later to his stake president, "Oh he's now the bishop, and he's the best bishop we have in our stake." A short time ago I met him up here in Salt Lake City out in front of the Hotel Utah and learned he'd just been appointed a member of the stake presidency. Now, that's the kind of woman you ought to be, so you will help the men to be outstanding and do what they should do.<br><br>There isn't anything more important to success in your life than that you be united in spiritual things in your home. Remember what President McKay and our Brethren have said: "No success in life can compensate for failure in the home." If a home is not going to fail, the most important thing is that the husband and the wife are united in spiritual things. Some time back, a young man called one night and said, "Are you Bishop Richards?"<br><br>I said, "Yes, sir. I'm still a bishop."<br><br>He said, "I'm in trouble."<br><br>"What's your trouble?"<br><br>"I've been keeping company with a girl for three years, and she heard you preach the other night, and now she won't go out with me anymore."<br><br>I said, "Why won't she?"<br><br>"Because I'm not active in the Church."<br><br>I said, "Good for her! I'm glad to know that there is at least one girl in all Israel who will listen to an old man like me. Now what are you going to do about it?"<br><br>He said, "What can I do?"<br><br>I said, "Get active in the Church, and then go back and court her."<br><br>"How can I?"<br><br>"You go back and talk to your bishop, and if he doesn't help you, you come back to me and I will." He's never come back, so I reckon he went to the bishop.<br><h2><b>Build Your Foundation for the Millennium</b></h2><br>We can do a lot if we will just make sure that we build upon the right kind of foundation, lay the right kind of foundation to build our lives on. I've always liked the little story about when they built that Salt Lake Temple up there. We're told that the foundations are sixteen feet wide, and one day President Brigham Young came and saw the workman throwing in chipped granite. He made them take it out and put in those great granite blocks with this explanation: "We're building this temple to stand through the Millennium." Now you young people are going to build your homes to stand through the Millennium. That's a long, long time. I'm sure you don't know how long it is.<br><br>I have a little pet story to give you something to think about. If my wife were here I wouldn't dare tell you because she doesn't like it. When we'd been married thirty-five years, I said, "Mummy, what do you think we'll be doing in thirty-five million years from today?"<br><br>She said, "Where did you get that crazy idea? It makes me tired to think of it."<br><br>"Well," I said, "You do believe in eternal life, don't you? In the Book of Mormon we're told that time is measured only to men, that with God there isn't such a thing as time. It's one eternal round. The Prophet Joseph illustrated this point by taking a ring and saying, 'When you cut it, there is a beginning and an end, and as long as you don't cut it there's no beginning and no end.' Now, Mother, if you believe that, you and I will be pretty well acquainted with each other in thirty-five million years from today."<br><br>If you just think of that, you can understand what Cicero meant when he said that he was much more interested in the long hereafter than in the brief present. While you are in the brief present is the time to lay the foundation upon which you can build a happy, long hereafter, and this institution will go a long way in helping you to do that.<br><br>When I was president of the Southern States Mission, we converted a lovely schoolteacher down in Florida. And at the close of one of our conferences she came up to me and said, "President Richards, I'm going to get married. What do you think of that?"<br><br>"Oh," I said, "I think it's wonderful. Do I know him?"<br><br>"No."<br><br>I said, "Is he a member of the Church?"<br><br>"No." I didn't dare tell her that she couldn't marry out of the Church down there, because I didn't know where she could find a man<i>in</i>the Church except our Mormon elders, and we had hands-off signs hanging all over them.<br><br>I said, "You're a beautiful, sweet, clean Mormon girl, and you could never be happy with an unclean man. In your association with him you'll know whether he's clean or not and whether he'd take advantage of you if you'd permit him. He must be a prayerful man because, as wicked as the world is today, I wouldn't trust any man to be true to his wife and children if he doesn't believe that there is a God and that someday he will have to answer to him for his life here upon the earth. Your young man must be willing to let you raise your children in the Church because, knowing as you do that the God of heaven has restored his truth to the earth, you would be a very unhappy woman if you had children and couldn't teach them the gospel. If he measures up, let me know when he joins the Church." I didn't see her for about four months, when we had another conference. Her train was late, and after the meeting she came along the aisle. I could see she was headed for me, so I went down and said, "Name, please?"<br><br>"Oh, I'm still Miss So-and-so."<br><br>I said, "What became of the marriage?"<br><br>"He didn't come up to your specifications." Well, that's the way you should judge, before you get married, that you're laying the right kind of foundation. I told that little story in Alabama a short time after it happened, and at the close of the meeting a seventeen-year-old Mormon girl came up to me. (They marry young down there.) She said, "President Richards, if I'd have heard that story six months ago, I'd be an unmarried woman today." It didn't take that little girl very long to find out that you can't find happiness with an unclean man. These are some of the fringe benefits that you can keep in mind while attending this institution.<br><h2><b>Study the Gospel</b></h2><br>Another benefit of BYU is that it will help you to understand the gospel: why you're here, where you came from, and where you're going. As Jesus said, "For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?" (Mark 8:36). The whole world is a lot, isn't it? But the soul is what lives on for these thirty-five million years, and so blessings that will give us a preferred place through that long period are the most important things in our lives.<br><br>Concerning the gospel in this institution, you study religion in your classes, and even the nonmember study religion in their classes. We welcome them here. We know we have the truth, and we just like to divide it with them. To illustrate what I'm trying to tell you, I had a letter from one of the faculty members down here, and he told me this story. He had had a young man in his class who wasn't a member of the Church, and this young man didn't want to have to study religion. The professor spoke with him and handed him a copy of the missionary book that I wrote called<i>A Marvelous Work and a Wonder</i>. He said, "If you'll read that and give me a book report on it, I'll excuse you from any other study." The professor sent me the letter that this boy had written when he was about halfway through the book. The final result was that he joined the Church, and I had the privilege of performing the marriage ceremony for him and one of our Mormon girls in the Salt Lake Temple.<br><br>We have a great message to tell the world. We have to live it, and then we have to tell it, too. If you're interest in history and in geography, just think what you can get out of the Book of Mormon! The Book of Mormon is the most tangible evidence that we have the truth, for no man could have written it at the time that it was written--except the story of the Prophet Joseph be a true story. Just imagine what that book has to tell us about America. Go back to the promises of Jacob and Moses and Joseph, who was sold into Egypt and who was promised a new land in the utmost bounds of the everlasting hills. Nobody in this world, outside of this Church, can tell you where that new land is, and yet Moses, in describing that land, used the word<i>precious</i>five times in just four short verses in the bible (see Deuteronomy 33:13–16). He called it a precious land, and we read the history of how Lehi and his people came here and how they were told that it was a land choice above all other lands. This fact is repeated over and over again in the scriptures.<br><br>From a historical standpoint, it ought to be worth something to people to know about this land of America or when Columbus discovered it. The knowledge that we get through the Book of Mormon is a knowledge that we can't get any other way in all this world. It not only tells us of the great destiny of this land of America, but it also gives the promises of the Lord through his prophets that it would be a land choice above all other lands and that it would be the land upon which God would build his New Jerusalem in the latter days. It was hidden away from the eyes of the world that it might not be overrun, and the Spirit of the Lord moved upon a man across the great waters to come here. We understand and know that man was Columbus. You see what a marvelous thing it is to have understanding.<br><br>While I was president of the Southern States Mission, an article appeared in the newspaper from the Associated Press about a man who came here to the United States from Lima, Peru. His name was William A. Kennedy. I read that article and I included it in the book<i>A Marvelous Work and a Wonder</i>that I wrote. He came here for the purpose of raising money to establish a school or seminary down in Lima, Peru, to study the early inhabitants of this land of America--the Incan and Mayan civilizations. The article said that he had collected enough money here and, when backed by the small American countries, he'd have thirty million dollars. The article also said that former President Herbert Hoover had agreed to serve on the board. The promises to this Peruvian man indicated that within ten years that sum would increase to seventy million dollars. I never heard what actually became of that, but I said to myself, when I read that article, "Just think. They are willing to spend sixty or seventy million dollars to learn something about the past history of this great land of America. After they've spent that amount of money they will never know even one-hundredth part as much as they could know if they'd read the Book of Mormon. They may find a few hieroglyphics, pots and pans, and so forth, but they will never know what the God of heaven had in mind when he led the descendants of Joseph here to this land." You see, it's a historical thing. Also from a geographical standpoint we know the history of this great land of America as no other people in all the world know it. that's only one of the great contributions of this book that you learn about here in your schoolwork.<br><h2><b>Know that Joseph Smith Is a Prophet</b></h2><br>We have truth revealed that no other people in all the world have. Just think of the vision of the Prophet Joseph Smith. He didn't know which church to join. that was a reasonable condition, and he read these words in the scriptures: "If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God" (James 1:5). He went out into the woods and prayed, and a light did appear from heaven brighter than the noonday sun. In the midst of that light were the Father and the Son. The Father pointed to the Son and said, "This is My Beloved Son. Hear Him!" (Joseph Smith 2:17). No event has transpired in this world, since the resurrection of the Savior, that can compare to that. Why didn't it happen five hundred years ago? Because the Lord hadn't prepared this land for the restoration of the gospel. That boy Joseph Smith was in waiting for many, many years.<br><br>If you read and study the scriptures you learn that prophets were ordained prophets even before they came into the world. You remember that Jeremiah, when he was called to be a prophet, couldn't understand it. The Lord said, "Before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee; and before thou camest forth out of the womb I sanctified thee, and I ordained thee a prophet unto the nations" (Jeremiah 1:5). In that same sense Joseph Smith was ordained long before he came upon this earth. When you read in the Book of Mormon, you read the account of Lehi in the desert. He told his son Joseph about how the Lord had promised Joseph who was sold into Egypt that in the latter days he would raise up a prophet from his loins like unto Moses (see 2 Nephi 3). We read in the Bible that there was no prophet in Israel like unto Moses because he talked with God face to face (see Deuteronomy 34:10). But that's the kind of prophet he would raise up in the latter days from the loins of Joseph. Obviously that prophet was the Prophet Joseph Smith. That promise, you see, was made to Joseph over three thousand years ago.<br><br>The Lord had Joseph Smith in waiting for this, the dispensation of the fulness of times. Lehi said that he would bring forth the word of the Lord. He brought us the Book of Mormon, he brought us the Doctrine and Covenants, and he brought us the Pearl of Great Price and many other wonderful writings. He has given us more revealed truth than any other prophet who has lived upon the face of the earth as far as the history and the records show us. The Lord said, "Unto him will I give power to bring forth my word--and not to the bringing forth my word only, . . . but to the convincing them of my word, which shall have already gone forth among them" (see 2 Nephi 3:11). What did he mean by that? He would give them to understand the Bible in the spirit in which it was written.<br><br>Do you realize that in this nation there are 697 different churches--just in America? (I checked over a year ago.) We have this many just because men couldn't agree in their interpretation of the Bible and were dependent upon their own wisdom. And so the Lord said that this prophet should not only bring forth his word but would bring men to a conviction of his word that had already gone forth among them. He said that he would bring men unto salvation, because he would be the recipient of the restoration of the holy priesthood, the power to administer the saving ordinances of the gospel. Then the Lord says: "and he shall be great in mine eyes" (2 Nephi 3:8). Whatever the world may think of the prophet of this dispensation, here is the word of the Lord--"He shall be great in mine eyes."<br><br>To illustrate what he meant when he said, "and not to the bringing forth my word only, . . . but to the convincing them of my word, which shall have already gone forth among them," I'd like to tell you a little experience I had when I was on a mission over in Holland. I was invited to talk to a Bible class of businessmen in The Hague. We met in the home of a prominent furniture dealer. There were about twenty men; the only woman there was the daughter of the man of the house. Each had his Bible, and they gave me an hour and a half to discuss universal salvation, which includes our work for the dead. I just gave them chapter and verse and an explanation and let them look it up in their own Bibles and read it. People believe it more readily when they read it themselves. Then when I was through I closed my Bible, laid it on the table, folded my arms, and waited for a comment. The first comment came from the daughter of the man of the house. She said, "Father, I just can't understand it. I've never attended one of these Bible classes in my life that you haven't had the last word to say on everything, but tonight you haven't said a word!"<br><br>He said, "My daughter, there isn't anything to say. This man has been teaching us things we've never heard of and has been teaching them to us out of our own Bibles." That's what the Lord meant when he said that the Prophet of this dispensation should not only bring forth his word but would bring men to conviction of his word that had already gone forth among them. I could tell you many more stories like that.<br><h2><b>Bear Witness of Gospel Truths</b></h2><br>A few years ago two of our American churches on the West Coast were holding a convention in Salt Lake City. The people came from California, Oregon, Washington, Idaho, Utah, and Nevada and represented the Congregational and Evangelical churches. The leader of that group wrote a letter to President McKay and asked if he would send one of the General Authorities to talk for two hours in the morning session of their convention to tell them the story of Mormonism, then to remain as their guest for lunch, and then to stay an hour and a half in the afternoon for questions. Well, I got the assignment, and I don't mind telling you I was glad to get it. I always tell our missionaries you never need to argue with anybody--"If you learn how to tell our story, you tell them things they've never heard of, and prove them out of their own Bibles." When I arrived at the meeting, I asked, "Now, do you want it just the way we believe it, how we got the church and what we believe?"<br><br>The man in charge said, "That's just what we want." Some of them had to get away on earlier planes, so they moved the luncheon back half an hour and gave me two hours and a half in that morning session. I just gave them chapter and verse and showed them what we received through the restoration of the gospel. You remember the words of Peter when he said the heavens were to receive the Christ until the restitution of all things spoken by the mouths of all the holy prophets since the world began (see Acts 3:20–21). A restitution is<i>not</i>a reformation, which is how all these other churches have come into existence. They have tried to correct the mistakes of history, but we have a restitution of all things. I showed what we got by the coming of the different holy prophets, as Peter said, and when I was through, I had only one question out of all those ministers and church leaders. You might be interested in that question. The man in charge said, "Now, Mr. Richards, you've told us that you believe that God is a personal god."<br><br>I said, "That's right."<br><br>He said, "We're heard it said that you believe that God has a wife. Would you explain that to us?"<br><br>I think he thought he had me in a corner and that I couldn't do it. So rather facetiously I said, "Well, I don't see how in the world he could have a Son without a wife, do you?" They all began to titter, and I didn't have any more trouble with that question.<br><br>Since it will be time to close in a few minutes, I will add one more thought. When I go to conferences, at the close of the conference the Saints always bring up their nonmember friends and introduce them to me. I say this: "You know what I always say to the nonmembers who honor us with their presence?"<br><br>"What's that, Mr. Richards?"<br><br>"There are only two kinds of people in this world--those who are in the true church and those who ought to be. Get your boots on; we don't want to wait too long for you. We'll get you sooner or later. You don't know that, but we do, and it had just as well be sooner as later." You know, I've had letters come back from all over the world telling me they got their boots on. I walked up to the United Airlines counter in Chicago about a year and a half ago, and the young man in back of the counter looked at me and said, "Aren't you LeGrand Richards? I'm one of those guys you told to get my boots on. I've joined the Church and I'm going out to the Y next fall." Last general conference a woman came in from California. She'd made me a pretty little figurine with two boots and a little motto in the middle--"Get your boots on!"--to put on my desk. Just the other day I received a letter from a young man dated August 24. Now that's not very long ago. About a year ago I entertained a young group from the Y in my office, and I showed them through the Church Administration Building. As I did, I said, "I'm sure you're all Mormons. If you're not, you ought to be." In this letter this young man wrote me back and said, "I was the only 'ought to be' in that group you showed around, and I just wanted to tell you I've joined the Church." I say there isn't an honest man or an honest woman in this world who really loves the Lord and would take the time to study it in a spirit of prayer who wouldn't join this Church.<br><br>Now, God bless you and keep you young people within the hollow of his hands from all the wickedness of the world and the false philosophies of men. I pray that you may learn what life really is for and that you'll be mighty instruments in his hands in helping to establish his kingdom. I leave my love and blessing with each one of you in the name of the Lord, Jesus Christ. amen.<br><br><i><i>LeGrand Richards was a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when this devotional address was given at Brigham Young University on 16 September 1975.</i></i><br><br><i>© Intellectual Reserve, Inc.

<h1>, Mercy, and Faith: The Weightier Matters of the Law - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
My dear and beloved brothers and sisters, it is a very great privilege for me this evening to have this opportunity. This is certainly a little larger congregation than we have at the Language Training Mission. I do, however, express my appreciation for the support that our missionaries give us. I express my great love for them and for all missionaries everywhere. It's a thrilling experience for me and for my wife and our family to be associated with the missionary program of the Church. Prior to the close of our mission in the Netherlands, we were anticipating our return, and our employment was secure. But a call to come to the Language Training Mission overwhelmed us with joy, for we would still be involved in this greatest of all work in the kingdom, the missionary effort. This evening I express gratitude to my Heavenly Father for his goodness and for the opportunities he has given me to serve in this great cause. I would like to discuss something with you tonight that I feel is especially applicable for those of you preparing for missions, for those of you who will not go on missions, for those of you who have been on missions, and I suppose that takes everyone into account.<br><br>I'd like to read just a few verses from Matthew:<br><br><i>Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye pay tithes of mint and anise and cummin, and have omitted the weightier matters of the law, judgement, mercy, and faith: these ought ye to have done, and not to leave the other undone.</i><br><br><i>Ye blind guides, which strain at a gnat, and swallow a camel.</i><br><br><i>Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye make clean the outside of the cup and of the platter, but within they are full of extortion and excess.</i><br><br><i>Thou blind Pharisee, cleanse first that which is within the cup and platter, that the outside of them may be clean also.</i><br><br><i>Woe unto you, . . . for ye are like unto whited sepulchres, which indeed appear beautiful outward, but are within full of dead men's bones, and all uncleanness.</i><br><br><i>Even so ye also outwardly appear righteous unto men but within ye are full of hypocrisy and iniquity.</i>[Matthew 23:23–28]<br><br>I would hope that this evening for the time we're together that we could exchange some thoughts relative to weightier matters of the law. Now, in this exchange I'll be doing the speaking, the talking, and I hope some thinking. I hope you will be doing some thinking so that we might have an exchange. Think we must and pay attention we must if we're to receive the message of this hour. I'm not naïve enough to believe that everyone hangs on every word I say, so I prefer to use the scriptures, and we know what the scriptures say.<br><br>The Lord declares, if you'll permit me to paraphrase: "You pay tithes, you keep the Word of Wisdom, you attend twelve-stake firesides, you attend Sunday School, sacrament meeting, priesthood meeting, Relief Society, But do you know what is more important? It is to render a righteous judgment, to have mercy, and to have great faith. Don't leave the other undone. It is important to pay tithing; it is important to keep the Word of Wisdom; it is important to attend Church; it is important to do our home teaching." Let me, if you will, discuss these three important items: judgment, mercy, and faith.<br><h2><b>Judgment</b></h2><br>The great prophet Isaiah cautions us against making a man an offender for a word (see Isaiah 29:21). So often, brothers and sisters, we misjudge other people. On the basis of a few moments' experience, it isn't uncommon for us to, I wouldn't say condemn others, but to grossly misjudge them.<br><br>Several years ago I was attending an institute class at the University of Utah, and I heard Elder Marion D. Hanks, Assistant to the Council of the Twelve, tell of this experience. He said one afternoon about sunset he was traveling east on North Temple. As he approached the intersection of Main Street at North Temple, there was a car stopped at the traffic light. As he pulled up behind the car, his foot slipped from the brake and hit the accelerator, and he hit the car. Well, he was very embarrassed about it and was about to get out of his car when there emerged from the automobile a mountain, a giant of a man. "So," he said, "I stayed in my own automobile. The next five minutes I received the most vulgar, most vile, the most wicked tongue-lashing I have ever received in my life. After he was through mauling me verbally, he got back in his automobile and sped away. I thought I had just met the worst man in the world. Certainly such vocabulary I'd never heard since my days in the service." Elder Hanks thought about this a great deal. And he was greatly concerned about such a person running loose in the streets of Salt Lake City.<br><br>About two or three weeks later Elder Hanks was at a stake conference in the Salt Lake Valley. Seated on the stand, he was looking down at the congregation. Lo and behold, there was his vulgar, vile friend. Well, after the stake conference this good brother came up to the stand and asked Elder Hanks if he could have a few words with him. They went into another room, just the two of them, and this good brother apologized, asked for Elder Hanks to forgive him. He said, "Do you know, two or three weeks ago there on the street I made this great scene. I'm very sorry and very embarrassed, and I apologize for the language I used and the embarrassment I caused you. But you know, I was sitting in my automobile, waiting for the light to change and contemplating the events that had just transpired in my life in the past hour or so. I was on the way home from the hospital to tell our four small children that their dear mother and my beloved wife and sweetheart had just passed away. My entire world had just caved in, and I was sitting there contemplating all of these things--the gloom and despair of my life--when you hit into the back of my car. So I ask your forgiveness."<br><br>"Well," Brother Hanks said, "if I could have found a crack I would have crawled into it." "There," Elder Hanks explained later, "I had made a man an offender for a word. On the basis of a few moments' exposure or experience with this man I had literally condemned him. Indeed, I was the one who needed to plead for forgiveness." I wonder, brothers and sisters, how often you and I are guilty of misjudging others.<br><br>May I suggest another point in terms of judgment. In section 89 of the Doctrine and Covenants we have revealed that great revelation known as the Word of Wisdom. Now, I may say some things in the next few minutes which hopefully will not offend anyone. If I do offend you, I ask your forgiveness in advance; and if you choose not to forgive, then the sin is not upon my head.<br><br>In my judgment members of the Church reduce the gospel of Jesus Christ to section 89. General Authorities of the Church traveling throughout the stakes and missions of the Church, the stake presidents who are sitting on the stand, and many of you may have had experiences with the Saints today who give great condemnation to those who do not see section 89 as they see it. For example, some who prefer to eat brown bread would condemn those who eat white bread. Those who would prefer white sugar would look at those who eat molasses as odd, as people to steer clear of, if I could put it that way. There are those among us who declare that it is not good for man to eat meat. There are those even who declare that by not eating meat one is living a higher law. I'm not about to condemn the person who so believes, but let me read section 49 to you: "And whoso forbiddeth to abstain from meats, that man should not eat the same, is not ordained of God" (D&amp;amp;C 49:18).<br><br>In this Church, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, why do we continue to judge those who do not eat as we eat? In my judgment it makes not one bit of difference. Let me refer you to the fourteenth chapter of Romans. (You know, it's a great advantage to the speaker to be able to select those scriptures which support his point of view.) Paul, a great apostle, had those in his congregation who apparently did not eat meat and those who did eat meat, those who thrived on herbs and those who did not eat herbs, those who ate brown bread only and those who ate white bread, those who ate only the whites of eggs and those who ate only the yolks, and so on. He said, "For one believest that he may eat all things: another, who is weak, eateth herbs. Let not him that eateth despise him that eateth not; and let not him which eateth not judge him that eateth" (Romans 14:2–3). Did you understand that? In other words, I think he's saying, "Please eat as you please." He declares forcefully, "For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink; but righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost. For he that in these things serveth Christ is acceptable to God, and approved of men. Let us therefore follow after the things which make for peace, and things wherewith one may edify another" (Romans 14:17–19). Judgment? I don't know. Personally I prefer brown bread over white bread. If you come to our home and would like to eat white bread, please bring your own! I prefer honey over white sugar, but on occasion while my wife's not looking, I slip some white sugar in. In other words, in my judgment it does not make any difference. All I'm suggesting, brothers and sisters, is that we reserve judgment. Let him judge whose right it is to judge. If I read the scriptures correctly, it is not my right to judge another.<br><h2><b>Mercy</b></h2><br>One definition of mercy is "a disposition to be kind, to forgive." We could talk about this as it relates to roommates here at school--a disposition to be kind in the apartment, a disposition to forgive. We could talk about this as it relates to parents and children, as it relates to husbands and wives, as it relates to missionaries and companions.<br><br>Now, sisters, you good sisters on this campus, stop having so much mercy with these missionaries. There is too great a disposition to be kind to them. I think this is my opportunity to tell you that these young men and women are in the mission field; they're<i>not</i>students on this campus. We have a tough enough time convincing them of that fact, especially when they meet Mable or Lulu or Joan or Sarah or someone else at the St. Francis School or down at Allen Hall or at the men's gym. Sisters, listen carefully. We implore you--repent! Leave these young men alone! We're trying to prepare them; we're trying to channel their efforts right down this narrow channel. When they receive all that attention, yea, verily, it doth distract them!<br><br>Look at the situation in your apartment. How often do you roommates get irritated with one another, and what is it that irritates you? What is it that's bothering you? Well, if it's that serious, then go to your branch president. But is it possible, roommate, that you are the principal cause? You who would find fault, are you the principal source of the contention, of the frustration within your apartment? Husbands and wives (although the greater number here are unmarried), it is not uncommon for a husband, if there is frustration, if there is contention, to look to his wife as the source of his contention or frustration. Nor is it uncommon for the wife to look to her husband as the source of the frustration or contention. I wonder if it wouldn't be wise on our part to show mercy, to demonstrate a greater disposition to be kind and to be forgiving, to be patient with those with whom we reside--our roommates, our spouses, our parents, our children. At the feast of the Passover the Savior said, "Verily I say unto you, that one of you shall betray me." Each in his turn said, "Lord, is it I? Is it I?" (Matthew 26:21). They were not pointing an accusing finger. All of them did not point to Judas Iscariot and say, "There he is. There's the betrayer." No, each asked himself, "Lord, is it I?" I would suggest to you that you and I could very fittingly ask ourselves this question whenever, in any personal relationship with others, there is contention or frustration or what we estimate to be failure. We should ask ourselves this question: "Lord, is it I?"<br><br>Let me quote a statement here from Dr. Ken Higbee. He suggests that we ask ourselves this question: "To what defect in myself do I attribute this failure?" If there is a lack of communication between husband and wife, let the husband ask himself, "to what defect in myself do I attribute this failure?" Let the wife ask herself, "To what defect in myself do I attribute this failure?" Let each roommate ask of himself or herself, "To what defect in myself do I attribute this failure?" Someone wrote, "Each of us is part of the problem or part of the answer." I would submit to you this evening that each of us<i>is</i>part of the problem and therefore responsible for the solution, responsible for the answer.<br><br>I do no think it is possible for me to change the behavior of another, but it is totally within my power to change my own behavior. As I look at myself in relationship to others and identify that the source of the problem is not there but here, then I ought to fall on my knees and thank God Almighty that I have finally found the cause of my problem to be right here with myself. Then I have at my command all the powers of heaven to change, to solve the problem. If we will look to ourselves, my dear brothers and sisters, as the major cause of the problems we face, as well as the major source for the solution to these problems, we will have a far great disposition to be kind and to be forgiving.<br><h2><b>Faith</b></h2><br>May I discuss briefly with you this great principle of faith--the third of the group judgment, mercy, and faith. There are many things we could discuss. First of all, let me just suggest that we ought to have faith in the leaders of the Church. I'm going to say something that perhaps will influence some for good but undoubtedly will not win me any friends. On this campus during the last school year Elder Bruce R. McConkie of the Council of the Twelve spoke in this building at a Tuesday <a href="https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/bruce-r-mcconkie_ten-commandments-peculiar-people/">devotional</a>. He made an appeal to all former missionaries to return to their missionary grooming standards. I'm not going to be guilty of misjudging, but as I observe with the naked eye, it is fairly obvious that this counsel is to a great extent ignored. It is a weightier matter to consider the counsel of the prophets of God than to consider following the council of cherished friends.<br><br>The other night a missionary came to my office about eleven o'clock and had an urgent problem he had to discuss. At the close of his class that evening his teacher had borne his testimony. The student said, "Everyone in the class was thrilled with his testimony, but I felt terrible inside because my teacher said he knew the gospel is true. Before I came on my mission my best friend told me no one can know the gospel is true, so I'm just filled with gloom. I'm filled with discouragement, for my best friend, one in whom I have great confidence--he is a member of the Church--told me I could not know."<br><br>I asked this young man, "Would you rather believe your friend or the prophets of God?"<br><br>"Well," he said, "he's my best friend!"<br><br>"Well," I said, "what is your best friend compared with a prophet of God?" If anyone, a cherished friend, a parent, a brother, a sister, anyone, counsels us to go contrary to a prophet of God, he is<i>wrong</i>. You former missionaries are derelict in your sustaining and your support of the prophets of God if you do not return to your former standards of grooming as a missionary.<br><br>Next point: I would hope that you and I would develop the faith that brings constructive, concrete action. Some years ago there lived in the South, in fact in the state of Mississippi, a teenage Negro boy. This young boy was Len Hope. I'm sure many of you are familiar with this story. Len Hope read the Bible, and he believed it. He read in the Bible that one could receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. He went to his minister and said, "I want you to give me the gift of the Holy Ghost."<br><br>His minister said, "Len, I'm sorry, but I don't know how to give this great gift." He went to another minister. This minister tried to persuade him that there was no such thing as the gift of the Holy Ghost. He said it was only available in the times of the apostles of old. Well, Len Hope was determined to receive this gift, so one morning early he left the shack of his sharecropper family and walked some miles distant, where he found an old abandoned farm house. He went down into the basement. The windows were broken out, it was very dirty, but he was alone. And there this young man knelt in humble prayer, pleading with God Almighty to shed forth upon him this great gift. He prayed all through the day--you're familiar with the experience of Enos--and when the night came he still prayed. He cried unto God that he would bless him with this gift of the Holy Ghost. He prayed through the night, and during the night there was a great rainstorm in that area. The water descended upon that house, poured in the broken windows of that basement, and Len Hope knelt waist deep in mud and water, pleading for God to bless him with the gift of the Holy Ghost. Then there came a voice to this young boy telling him, "Len, this isn't how you receive the Holy Ghost, but if you will return home and remain true and faithful, the way will be opened for you to receive this gift." So he started his trek back home.<br><br>The previous afternoon, when Len had been engaged in prayer, two young representatives of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints were walking along a dusty country road. At a given point one elder said to his companion, "I feel strongly impressed that we should go down this road here." His companion wanted to know why, but he didn't know why. They went down the road and saw in the middle of a field this old shack, and they approached the shack. As I understand the story, Len Hope's mother came out onto the porch. She wanted to know what these two white boys wanted. She hadn't seen white boys out in that area before. The one elder said, "Do you have a young teenage son? Is he at home?"<br><br>"No, he isn't here."<br><br>"When he returns," the elder said, "give him this." (He handed her a pamphlet.) They left.<br><br>The next morning when Len Hope returned home, his mother was worried sick about him. She saw him muddy and wet and wanted to know where he had been. She asked him to change clothes, and after he had done so, she said, "While you were gone yesterday two white boys came. They asked me to give you this." She handed him a pamphlet entitled "The Gift of the Holy Ghost." The name of the Church was written on the tract, as were the names and address of the Elders. Len Hope contacted those missionaries, was taught the gospel, and was baptized. Some years later he converted his girl friend, and she was baptized. They moved to Cincinnati, Ohio, and there raised their family. Finally they moved to Salt Lake City. This is the faith that causes something to happen. Lack of faith brings blindness and hardness of heart, so said Moroni, but the demonstration of great faith enables one to tap the very power of God (see Ether 4:14–15).<br><br>Well, my dear and beloved brothers and sisters, these are some of the weightier matters of the law: judgment, mercy, and faith. If lived in righteousness, these qualities will indeed bring to one true happiness. Kin Hubbard said, "It's pretty hard to tell what does bring happiness. Poverty an' wealth have both failed." I would hope that tonight each of us would carefully examine our life, get a sense of direction. Richard L. Evans said, "If we don't change direction, we will arrive at where we are going." We want to make certain that we're going in the right direction, and I submit to you that<i>this is your decision.</i>It's also my decision. Our great prophet, Spencer W. Kimball, has said, "Your destiny is in your hands, and your important decisions are your own to make."<br><br>Bearing these things in mind, I would submit to you that it is a weightier matter of the law to ponder righteously one's future course regarding intimate and personal relationships with the opposite sex than to prepare one's Sunday School lesson well. It is a weightier matter to return home from a date undefiled than it is to be in church on Sunday morning. It is a weightier matter to confess honesty and forthrightly wrongdoing to one's bishop or stake president than it is to attend a stake meeting. "Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye pay tithes of mint and anise and cummin, and have omitted the weightier matters of the law, judgment, mercy and faith: these ought ye to have done, and not to leave the other undone" (Matthew 23:23). I bear my witness to you this night that these are divine principles, that this is the gospel of Jesus Christ, this is his Church, that God our Father reigns in the heavens above, and that his Son is Jesus the Christ, the very Savior of the world. Of this I bear witness in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. amen.<br><br><i><i>Max L.

<h1>nd Century of Brigham Young University - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
My beloved brothers and sisters: It was almost eight years ago that I had the privilege of addressing an audience at the Brigham Young University about "Education for Eternity." Some things were said then that I believe, then and now, about the destiny of this unique university. I shall refer to several of those ideas again, combining them with some fresh thoughts and impressions I have concerning Brigham Young University as it enters its second century.<br><br>I am grateful to all who made possible the Centennial Celebration for the Brigham Young University, including those who have developed the history of this university in depth. A centennial observance is appropriate, not only to renew our ties with the past, but also to review and reaffirm our goals for the future. My task is to talk about BYU's second century. Though my comments will focus on Brigham Young University, it is obvious to all of us here that the university is, in many ways, the center of the Church Educational System. President McKay described the university as "the hub of the Church educational wheel." Karl G. Maeser described the Brigham Young Academy as "the parent trunk of the great education banyan tree," and recently it has been designated "the flagship." However it is stated, the centrality of this university to the entire system is a very real fact of life. What I say to you, therefore, must take note of things beyond the borders of this campus, but not beyond its influence. We must ever keep firmly in mind the needs of those ever-increasing numbers of LDS youth in other places in North America and in other lands who cannot attend this university, whose needs are real, and who represent, in fact, the majority of LDS college and university students.<br><br>In a speech I gave to many of the devoted alumni of this university in the Arizona area, I employed a phrase to describe the Brigham Young University as becoming an "educational Everest." There are many ways in which BYU can tower above other universities--not simply because of the size of its student body or its beautiful campus--but because of the unique light BYU can send forth into the educational world. Your light must have a special glow, for while you will do many things in the programs of this university that are done elsewhere, these same things can and must be done better here than others do them. You will also do some special things here that are left undone by other institutions.<br><h2><b>Education for Eternity</b></h2><br>First among these unique features is the fact that education on this campus deliberately and persistently concerns itself with "education for eternity," not just for time. The faculty has a double heritage that they must pass along: the secular knowledge that history has washed to the feet of mankind along with the new knowledge brought by scholarly research, and also the vital and revealed truths that have been sent to us from heaven.<br><br>This university shares with other universities the hope and the labor involved in rolling back the frontiers of knowledge even further, but we also know that through the process of revelation there are yet "many great and important things" to be given to mankind that will have an intellectual and spiritual impact far beyond what mere men can imagine. Thus, at this university among faculty, students, and administration there is and must be an excitement and an expectation about the very nature and future of knowledge that underwrites the uniqueness of BYU.<br><br>Your double heritage and dual concerns with the secular and the spiritual require you to be "bilingual." As scholars you must speak with authority and excellence to your professional colleagues in the language of scholarship, and you must also be literate in the language of spiritual things. We must be more bilingual, in that sense, to fulfill our promise in the second century of BYU.<br><br>BYU is being made even more unique, not because what we are doing is changing, but because of the general abandonment by other universities of their efforts to lift the daily behavior and morality of their students.<br><br>From the administration of BYU in 1967 came this thought:<br><br><i>Brigham Young University has been established by the prophets of God and can be operated only on the highest standards of Christian morality. . . . Students who instigate or participate in riots or open rebellion against the policies of the University cannot expect to remain at the university.</i><br><br><i>The standards of the Church are understood by students who have been taught these standards in the home and at Church throughout their lives.</i><br><br><i>First and foremost, we expect BYU students to maintain a single standard of Christian morality. . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . attendance at BYU is a privilege and not a right, and . . . students who attend must expect to live its standards or forfeit the privilege.</i>[Ernest L. Wilkinson, President of BYU, July 1967]<br><br>We have no choice at BYU except to "hold the line" regarding gospel standards and values and to draw men and women from other campuses also--all we can--into this same posture, for people entangled in sin are not free. At this university (that may to some of our critics seem unfree) there will be real individual freedom. Freedom from worldly ideologies and concepts unshackles man far more than he knows. It is the truth that sets men free. BYU, in its second century, must become the last remaining bastion of resistance to the invading ideologies that seek control of curriculum as well as classroom. We do not resist such ideas because we fear them, but because they are false. BYU, in its second century, must continue to resist false fashions in education, staying with those basic principles that have proved right and have guided good men and women and good universities over the centuries. This concept is not new, but in the second hundred years we must do it even better.<br><br>When the pressures mount for us to follow the false ways of the world, we hope in the years yet future that those who are part of this university and the Church Educational System will not attempt to counsel the board of trustees to follow false ways. We want, through your administration, to receive all your suggestions for making BYU even better. I hope none will presume on the prerogatives of the prophets of God to set the basic direction for this university. No man comes to the demanding position of the Presidency of the Church except his heart and mind are constantly open to the impressions, insights, and revelations of God. No one is more anxious than the Brethren who stand at the head of this Church to receive such guidance as the Lord would give them for the benefit of mankind and for the people of the Church. Thus, it is important to remember what we have in the revelations of the Lord: "And thou shalt not command him who is at thy head, and at the head of the church" (D&amp;amp;C 28:6). If the governing board has as much loyalty from faculty and students, from administration and staff as we have had in the past, I do not fear for the future!<br><br>The Church Board of Education and the Brigham Young University Board of Trustees involve individuals who are committed to truth as well as to the order of the kingdom. I observed while I was here in 1967 that this institution and its leaders should be like the Twelve as they were left in a very difficult world by the Savior:<br><br><i>The world hath hated them, because they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.</i><br><br><i>I pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the world, but that thou shouldest keep them from the evil.</i><br><br><i>They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.</i>[John 17:14–16]<br><br>This university is not of the world any more than the Church is of the world, and it must not be made over in the image of the world.<br><br>We hope that our friends, and even our critics, will understand why we must resist anything that would rob BYU of its basic uniqueness in its second century. As the Church's commissioner of education said on the occasion of the inaugural of President Oaks:<br><br><i>Brigham Young University seeks to improve and to "sanctify" itself for the sake of others--not for the praise of the world, but to serve the world better.</i><br><br>That task will be persisted in. Members of the Church are willing to doubly tax themselves to support the Church Educational System, including this university, and we must not merely "ape the world." We must do special things that would justify the special financial outpouring that supports this university.<br><br>As the late President Stephen L Richards once said, "Brigham Young University will never surrender its spiritual character to sole concern for scholarship." BYU will be true to its charter and to such addenda to that charter as are made by living prophets.<br><h2><b>Pursuit of Academic Excellence</b></h2><br>I am both hopeful and expectant that out of this university and the Church Educational System there will rise brilliant stars in drama, literature, music, sculpture, painting, science, and in all the scholarly graces. This university can be the refining host for many such individuals who will touch men and women the world over long after they have left this campus.<br><br>We must be patient, however, in this effort, because just as the City of Enoch took decades to reach its pinnacle of performance in what the Lord described as occurring "in process of time" (Moses 7:21), so the quest for excellence at BYU must also occur "in process of time."<br><br><i>Ideals are like stars; you will not succeed in touching them with your hands. But like the seafaring man on the desert of waters, you choose them as your guides, and following them you will reach your destiny.</i>[Carl Schurz, 18 April 1859, address in Faneuil Hall, Boston]<br><br>I see even more than was the case nearly a decade ago a widening gap between this university and other universities both in terms of purposes and in terms of directions. Much has happened in the intervening eight years to make that statement justifiable. More and more is being done, as I hoped it would, to have here "the greatest collection of artifacts, records, writings . . . in the world." BYU is moving toward preeminence in many fields, thanks to the generous support of the tithe payers of the Church and the excellent efforts of its faculty and students under the direction of a wise administration.<br><br>These changes do not happen free of pain, challenge, and adjustment. Again, harking back, I expressed the hope that the BYU vessel would be kept seaworthy by taking "out all old planks as they decay and put[ting] in new and stronger timber in their place," because the<i>Flagship BYU</i>must sail on and on and on. The creative changes in your academic calendar, your willingness to manage your curriculum more wisely, your efforts to improve general education, your interaction of disciplines across traditional departmental lines, and the creation of new research institutes here on this campus--all are evidences that the captain and crew are doing much to keep the BYU vessel seaworthy and sailing. I refer to the centers of research that have been established on this campus, ranging from family and language research on through to research on food, agriculture, and ancient studies. Much more needs to be done, but you must "not run faster or labor more than you have strength and means provided" (D&amp;amp;C 10:4). While the discovery of new knowledge must increase, there must always be a heavy and primary emphasis on transmitting knowledge--on the quality of teaching at BYU. Quality teaching is a tradition never to be abandoned. It includes a quality relationship between faculty and students. Carry these over into BYU's second century!<br><br>Brigham Young undoubtedly meant both teaching and learning when he said:<br><br><i>Learn everything that the children of men know, and be prepared for the most refined society upon the face of the earth, then improve on this until we are prepared and permitted to enter the society of the blessed--the holy angels that dwell in the presence of God.</i>[<i>JD</i>16:77]<br><br>We must be certain that the lessons are not only taught but are also absorbed and learned. We remember the [statement that Karl G. Maeser made to President John Taylor] "that no infidels will go from my school" (in John Taylor,<i>JD</i>20:48 [4 August 1878]).<br><br><i>Whatever you do, be choice in your selection of teachers. We do not want infidels to mould the minds of our children. They are a precious charge bestowed upon us by the Lord, and we cannot be too careful in rearing and training them. I would rather have my children taught the simple rudiments of a common education by men of God, and have them under their influence, than have them taught in the most abstruse sciences by men who have not the fear of God in their hearts. . . . We need to pay more attention to educational matters, and do all we can to procure the services of competent teachers. Some people say, we cannot afford to pay them. You cannot afford not to pay them; you cannot afford not to employ them. We want our children to grow up intelligent, and to walk abreast with the peoples of any nation. God expects us to do it; and therefore I call attention to this matter. I have heard intelligent practical men say, it is quite as cheap to keep a good horse as a poor one, or to raise good stock as inferior animals. And is it not quite as cheap to raise good intelligent children as to rear children in ignorance.</i>[<i>JD</i>24:168–69 (19 May 1883)]<br><br>Thus, we can continue to do as the Prophet Joseph Smith implied that we should when he said: "Man was created to dress the earth, to cultivate his mind, and to glorify God."<br><h2><b>Cultivation of Spiritual Values</b></h2><br>We cannot do these things except we continue, in the second century, to be concerned about the spiritual qualities and abilities of those who teach here. In the book of Mosiah we read, "Trust no one to be your teacher nor your minister, except he be a man of God, walking in his ways and keeping his commandments" (Mosiah 23:14). William R. Inge said, "I have no fear that the candle lighted in Palestine years ago will ever be put out."<br><br>We must be concerned with the spiritual worthiness, as well as the academic and professional competency, of all those who come here to teach. William Lyon Phelps said:<br><br><i>I thoroughly believe in a university education for both men and women; but I believe a knowledge of the Bible without a college course is more valuable than a college course without the Bible.</i><br><br>Students in the second century must continue to come here to learn. We do not apologize for the importance of students' searching for eternal companions at the same time that they search the scriptures and search the shelves of libraries for knowledge. President McKay observed on one occasion that "the university is not a dictionary, a dispensary, nor is it a department store. It is more than a storehouse of knowledge and more than a community of scholars. The university life is essentially an exercise in thinking, preparing, and living." We do not want BYU ever to become an educational factory. It must concern itself with not only the dispensing of facts but with the preparation of its students to take their place in society as thinking, thoughtful, and sensitive individuals who, in paraphrasing the motto of your Centennial, come here dedicated to love of God, pursuit of truth, and service to mankind.<br><br>There are yet other reasons why we must not lose either our moorings or our sense of direction in the second century. We still have before us the remarkable prophecy of John Taylor when he observed:<br><br><i>You will see the day that Zion will be as far ahead of the outside world in everything pertaining to learning of every kind as we are today in regard to religious matters. You mark my words, and write them down, and see if they do not come to pass.</i>[<i>JD</i>21:100]<br><br>Surely we cannot refuse that rendezvous with history because so much of what is desperately needed by mankind is bound up in our being willing to contribute to the fulfillment of that prophecy. Others, at times, also seem to have a sensing of what might happen. Charles H. Malik, former president of the United Nations General Assembly, voiced a fervent hope when he said that<br><br><i>one day a great university will arise somewhere . . . I hope in America . . . to which Christ will return in His full glory and power, a university which will, in the promotion of scientific, intellectual, and artistic excellence, surpass by far even the best secular universities of the present, but which will at the same time enable Christ to bless it and act and feel perfectly at home in it.</i>["Education and Upheaval: The Christian's Responsibility,"<i>Creative Help for Daily Living,</i>21 September 1970]<br><br>Surely BYU can help to respond to that call!<br><br>By dealing with basic issues and basic problems, we can be effective educationally. Otherwise, we will simply join the multitude who have so often lost their way in dark, sunless forests even while working hard. It was Thoreau who said, "There are a thousand hacking at the branches of evil to one who is striking at the root" (<i>Walden</i>[1854], I, "Economy"). We should deal statistically and spiritually with root problems, root issues, and root causes in BYU's second century. We seek to do so, not in arrogance or pride, but in the spirit of service. We must do so with a sense of trembling and urgency because what Edmund Burke said is true: "The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing" (letter to William Smith, 9 January 1795).<br><br>Learning that includes familiarization with facts must not occur in isolation from concern over our fellowmen. It must occur in the context of a commitment to serve them and to reach out to them.<br><br>In many ways the dreams that were once generalized as American dreams have diminished and faded. Some of these dreams have now passed so far as institutional thrust is concerned to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and its people for their fulfillment. It was Lord Acton who said on one occasion:<br><br><i>It was from America that the plain ideas that men ought to mind their business, and that the nation is responsible to Heaven for the acts of the State--ideas long locked in the breast of solitary thinkers, and hidden among Latin folios--burst forth like a conqueror upon the world they were destined to transform, under the title of the Rights of Man . . . and the principle gained ground, that a nation can never abandon its fate to an authority it cannot control.</i>[<i>The History of Freedom and Other Essays,</i>1907]<br><br>Too many universities have given themselves over to such massive federal funding that they should not wonder why they have submitted to an authority they can no longer control. Far too many no longer assume that nations are responsible to heaven for the acts of the state. Far too many now see the Rights of Man as merely access rights to the property and money of others, and not as the rights traditionally thought of as being crucial to our freedom.<br><br>It will take just as much sacrifice and dedication to preserve these principles in the second century of BYU--even more than that required to begin this institution in the first place, when it was once but a grade school, and then an academy supported by a stake of the Church. If we were to abandon our ideals, would there be any left to take up the torch of some of the principles I have attempted to describe?<br><br>I am grateful, therefore, that, as President Oaks observed, "There is no anarchy of values at Brigham Young University." There never has been. There never will be. But we also know, as President Joseph Fielding Smith observed in speaking on this campus, that "knowledge comes both by reason and by revelation." We expect the natural unfolding of knowledge to occur as a result of scholarship, but there will always be that added dimension that the Lord can provide when we are qualified to receive and he chooses to speak:<br><br><i>A time to come in the which nothing shall be withheld, whether there be one God or many gods, they shall be manifest.</i><br><br>And further,<br><br><i>All thrones and dominions, principalities and powers, shall be revealed and set forth upon all who have endured valiantly for the gospel of Jesus Christ.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 121:28–29]<br><br>As the pursuit of excellence continues on this campus and elsewhere in the Church Educational System, we must remember the great lesson taught to Oliver Cowdery, who desired a special outcome--just as we desire a remarkable blessing and outcome for BYU in the second century. Oliver Cowdery wished to be able to translate with ease and without real effort. He was reminded that he erred, in that he "took no thought save it was to ask" (D&amp;amp;C 9:7). We must do more than ask the Lord for excellence. Perspiration must precede inspiration; there must be effort before there is excellence. We must do more than pray for these outcomes at BYU, though we must surely pray. We must take thought. We must make effort. We must be patient. We must be professional. We must be spiritual. Then, in the process of time, this will become the fully anointed university of the Lord about which so much has been spoken in the past.<br><br>We can sometimes make concord with others, including scholars who have parallel purposes. By reaching out to the world of scholars, to thoughtful men and women everywhere who share our concerns and at least some of the items on our agenda of action, we can multiply our influence and give hope to others who may assume that they are alone.<br><br>In other instances, we must be willing to break with the educational establishment (not foolishly or cavalierly, but thoughtfully and for good reason) in order to find gospel ways to help mankind. Gospel methodology, concepts, and insights can help us to do what the world cannot do in its own frame of reference.<br><br>In some ways the Church Educational System, in order to be unique in the years that lie ahead, may have to break with certain patterns of the educational establishment. When the world has lost its way on matters of principle, we have an obligation to point the way. We can, as Brigham Young hoped we would, "be a people of profound learning pertaining to the things of this world," but without being tainted by what he regarded as the "pernicious, atheistic influences" that flood in unless we are watchful. Our scholars, therefore, must be sentries as well as teachers!<br><br>We surely cannot give up our concerns with character and conduct without also giving up on mankind. Much misery results from flaws in character, not from failures in technology. We cannot give in to the ways of the world with regard to the realm of art. President Romney brought to our attention not long ago a quotation in which Brigham Young said there is "no music in hell." Our art must be the kind that edifies man, which takes into account his immortal nature, and which prepares us for heaven, not hell.<br><h2><b>Challenges for BYU's Future</b></h2><br>One peak of educational excellence that is highly relevant to the needs of the Church is the realm of language. BYU should become the acknowledged language capital of the world in terms of our academic competency and through the marvelous "laboratory" that sends young men and women forth to service in the mission field. I refer, of course, to the Language Training Mission. There is no reason why this university could not become the place where, perhaps more than anywhere else, the concern for literacy and the teaching of English as a second language is firmly headquartered in terms of unarguable competency as well as deep concern.<br><br>I have mentioned only a few areas. There are many others of special concern, with special challenges and opportunities for accomplishment and service in the second century.<br><br>We can do much in excellence and, at the same time, emphasize the large-scale participation of our students, whether it be in athletics or in academic events. We can bless many and give many experience, while, at the same time, we are developing the few select souls who can take us to new heights of attainment.<br><br>It ought to be obvious to you, as it is to me, that some of the things the Lord would have occur in the second century of BYU are hidden from our immediate view. Until we have climbed the hill just before us, we are not apt to be given a glimpse of what lies beyond. The hills ahead are higher than we think. This means that accomplishments and further direction must occur in proper order, after we have done our part. We will not be transported from point A to point Z without having to pass through the developmental and demanding experiences of all the points of achievement and all the milestone markers that lie between!<br><br>This university will go forward. Its students are idealists who have integrity, who love to work in good causes. These students will not only have a secular training but will have come to understand what Jesus meant when he said that the key of knowledge, which had been lost by society centuries before, was "the fulness of the scriptures." We understand, as few people do, that education is a part of being about our Father's business and that the scriptures contain the master concepts for mankind.<br><br>We know there are those of unrighteous purposes who boast that time is on their side. So it may seem to those of very limited vision. But of those engaged in the Lord's work, it can be truly said, "Eternity is on our side! Those who fight that bright future fight in vain!"<br><br>I hasten to add that as the Church grows global and becomes more and more multicultural, a smaller and smaller percentage of all our LDS college-age students will attend BYU or the Hawaii Campus, or Ricks College, or the LDS Business College. It is a privileged group who are able to come here. We do not intend to neglect the needs of the other Church members wherever they are, but those who do come here have an even greater follow-through responsibility to make certain that the Church's investment in them provides dividends through service and dedication to others as they labor in the Church and in the world elsewhere.<br><br><i>To go to BYU is something special. There were Brethren who had dreams regarding the growth and maturity of Brigham Young University, even to the construction of a temple on the hill they had long called Temple Hill, yet "dreams and prophetic utterances are not self-executing. They are fulfilled usually by righteous and devoted people making the prophecies come true."</i>[Ernest L. Wilkinson,<i>Brigham Young University: The First One Hundred Years</i>]<br><br>So much of our counsel given to you here today as you begin your second century is the same counsel we give to others in the Church concerning other vital programs--you need to lengthen your stride, quicken your step, and (to use President Tanner's phrase) continue your journey. You are headed in the right direction! Such academic adjustments as need to be made will be made out of the individual and collective wisdom we find when a dedicated faculty interacts with a wise administration, an inspired governing board, and an appreciative body of students.<br><br>I am grateful that the Church can draw upon the expertise that exists here. The pockets of competency that are here will be used by the Church increasingly and in various ways.<br><br>We want you to keep free as a university--free of government control, not only for the sake of the university and the Church, but also for the sake of our government. Our government, state and federal, and our people are best served by free colleges and universities, not by institutions that are compliant out of fears over funding.<br><br>We look forward to developments in your computer-assisted translation projects and from the Ezra Taft Benson Agriculture and Food Institute. We look forward to more being done in the field of education, in the fine arts, in the J. Reuben Clark Law School, in the Graduate School of Management, and in the realm of human behavior.<br><br>We appreciate the effectiveness of the programs here, such as our Indian program with its high rate of completion for Indian students. But we must do better in order to be better, and we must be better for the sake of the world!<br><br>As previous First Presidencies have said, and we say again to you, we expect (we do not simply hope) that Brigham Young University will "become a leader among the great universities of the world." To that expectation I would add, "Become a unique university in all of the world!"<br><br>May I thank now all those who have made this Centennial Celebration possible and express appreciation to the alumni, students, and friends of the university for the Centennial Carillon Tower that is being given to the university on its 100th birthday. Through these lovely bells will sound the great melodies that have motivated the people of the Lord's church in the past and will lift our hearts and inspire us in the second century--with joy and even greater determination. This I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><h2><b>Dedication of the Carillon Tower and Bells</b></h2><br>Our Father in heaven, we are grateful for this, the gift of thy people, the alumni, the faculty, the staff, and the friends of Brigham Young University, for this collection of fifty-two bells in this carillon tower on the campus of this, thy great University.<br><br>We are grateful for the faithfulness and craftsmanship of those who constructed the bells, those who have transported them, and those who have placed them into the tower.<br><br>Father, we are grateful for the diversity of the bells in their size, versatility, and music-giving tones, for the clavier and the clappers and the magnetic tape and the keyboard, and we ask thee, O Father, to protect this tower, these bells, and all pertaining to them, and we pray that the carillonneur will have the preciseness and the ability to create beautiful music from the bells in this tower.<br><br>Father, we thank thee for this institution and what it has meant in the lives of hundreds of thousands of people and their posterity, for the truths they have learned here, for the characters that have been built, for the families that have been strengthened here. Let thy spirit continue to be with the president of this institution and his associates, the faculty, the students, alumni, staff, and friends of this University, and their successors that thy Spirit may always abide here and that stalwarts may emerge from this institution to bring glory to thee and blessings to the people of this world.<br><br>Just as these bells will lift the hearts of the hearers when they hear the hymns and anthems played to thy glory, let the morality of the graduates of this University provide the music of hope for the inhabitants of this planet. We ask that all those everywhere who open their ears to hear the sounds of good music will also be more inclined to open their ears to hear the good tidings brought to us by thy Son.<br><br>Now, dear Father, let these bells ring sweet music unto thee. Let the everlasting hills take up the sound; let the mountains shout for joy and the valleys cry aloud, and let the seas and dry lands tell the wonders of the Eternal King.<br><br>Let the rivers and the brooks flow down with gladness; let the sun, the moon, and the stars sing together and let the whole creation sing the glory of our Redeemer forevermore.<br><br>Now, our Father, we dedicate this carillon tower, the bells, the mechanical effects and equipment, and all pertaining to this compound and ask thee that thou wouldst bless it and protect it against all destructive elements. Bless it that it may give us sweet music and that because of it we may love and serve thee even more.<br><br>In the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Spencer W.

<h1>od and Preparation - Paul H. Dunn - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Your President has always been most gracious and most thoughtful in introducing people. I think my mother puts me in better perspective, however. Learning some time ago that I had written another book, a neighbor brought the fact to my mother's attention. She said, "I see your son has produced another book."<br><br>Mother, recalling earlier days of my youth when I had had problems in school, said, "Yes, but I doubt if he can read it."<br><br>I appreciate the thoughtful prayer of President Tingey. He's a great personal friend, and it meant a great deal to me. He's a great friend of youth; he's a great friend of the Lamanites. I think it's fitting this time of the year that he be so recognized. I always appreciate friends praying for friends.<br><br>You ought to know something personal about President Tingey. Occasionally when I'm with him I pray for him. He's a pilot, you see. On occasion I have flown with him, and that's an experience all by itself. I submit to you that when you have been running down the runway for about ten minutes, it's time to leave. He's the only pilot I've ever flown with who flies under the wires instead of over.<br><br>I am reminded of an experience I had in Polynesia. (Some of you here are from that great part of the world.) I don't know if you've had an opportunity to fly Polynesian Airlines. It's a thrilling experience. It's the only airline in the world I've been on where the pilot is barefooted. I got on one flight, a forty-five-minute one from America Samoa to Western Samoa, and I was the only passenger. There was no partition between me and the pilot and copilot. I could handle that all right, but after we were in the air for about thirty minutes, we hit a storm, it clouded over, and we dipped down between the clouds on one occasion. The copilot said to the pilot, "Nope, that's not it," referring to the airport. I was on that same airline between Samoa and Rarotonga, about a six-hour flight, in a DC 3. Things were going well for the first two or three hours until I noticed an oil leak on my window. It was then I dedicated the Pacific Ocean six times. I think about that a little when I see President Tingey.<br><br>I was thrilled last week as I sat with you in your great Centennial Convocation. I think it's marvelous, and I'd like to take that as something of a theme, recalling the great counsel from our great prophet, President Kimball. He gave a keynote address highlighting the next hundred years. I see in you the fruition of that challenge and charge given to this great University. I'm aware that in this audience--both unseen and seen--are not only students, delightful and wonderful as you are, but parents and educators as well.<br><br>I would like to direct my remarks to you young people about your youth, your future children. I think it fitting that I see beyond your faces and eyes of today. I see in your places your children and through them to their families. As I envision this picture before me, I see the incalculable effect of what we are doing now upon the vision of tomorrow. I'd try to imagine what your children might have me say to you this morning if they were blessed with the power of articulation to say it. For just a few moments, may I represent your children to you?<br><br>I think as I see you sitting here, recognizing the position of this great University, I would hope and pray that you are preparing yourselves not only physically and mentally, but also spiritually to meet the challenge that lies ahead. James Adams said on one occasion: "There are obviously two kinds of education. One teaches you how to make a living; the other, how to live." I spend most of my time as a General Authority trying to help people learn how to live. I see in you the answer for the generations yet unborn. There are just four things I'd like to speak about as I represent your children and the generations unborn.<br><h2><b>Parenthood and the Infinite Worth of Souls</b></h2><br>The first thing I think your children would have me direct to you and would have you remember this morning is the infinite worth of a soul. You're going to be charged--all of you--with precious souls from our Heavenly Father. No greater institute than The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints stands with its greatest goal as the infinite worth of a soul. The Lord, speaking to a prophet, said, "Remember the worth of souls is great in the sight of God; For, behold, the Lord your Redeemer suffered death in the flesh; wherefore he suffered the pain of all men, that all men might repent and come unto him" (D&amp;amp;C 18:10–11). And you remember that it was the Prophet Joseph Smith who taught us the true definition of a soul: "The body and the spirit constitute the soul."<br><br>I think there is a tendency in today's world to put a great emphasis upon the physical and not enough upon the spiritual. The children you will bring into this world will have a great need for spiritual emphasis. As some of you probably know, I'm the father of three daughters, and, of course, I have a wife. It is interesting to note the great emphasis they put upon their physical attraction. I'm not here to denounce that; I think it's terrific. When my wife leaves the car, she's made certain that everything is in its proper order. I learned along time ago never to walk by an open bathroom door, with three daughters in there using hairspray. I made that mistake one time and got lacquered to the wall.<br><br>Having gone through a little physical challenge last year myself, I'm sensitive to that aspect of my life. In almost every magazine or newspaper I open I see an ad wanting me to donate my body to some health spa, to get into shape and to look proper. That's fine, but I hope we put an equal if not great emphasis upon the spiritual and the mental. That's what I see before me today--that great effort.<br><br>How much value would you put upon a soul? The Lord said it's of great worth. Could you attach a dollar-cent price tag to it? When I was back in Boston a few years ago, a very interesting account came to my attention. Most of you are familiar with that old historic site, Boston Harbor, where Paul Revere caught the signal from the Old North Church; where the old wonderful battleship "Ironsides,"<i>U. S. Constitution</i>, is anchored. On the Mystic Bridge just above it there was a gentleman, as the news report gave it to us, walking one March day. It was a cold day but with something of an early spring in the air. He happened to look over the bridge and saw a little dog out on a cake of ice in the harbor. The ice had thawed enough that it had broken up, and the little dog was stranded, yapping and barking. The man, taking note, walked to the other side of the bridge and made a telephone call to the Boston police department. Policemen rallied to the call but surmised quiet early that they did not have the facility to retrieve this dog, so they called the Boston fire department. As things will often happen in communication, some eight ladder companies answered the call. You ought to see a ladder truck trying to get down a Boston street. Well, when they got there, they couldn't quite figure out how to get this dog, literally floating out to sea, off the cake of ice. So they called for some additional emergency equipment. One enterprising reporter, sizing up the situation, did some fast calculations and surmised that in about a six-hour effort the city of Boston had paid $8,250 of the taxpayers' money to get one mongrel dog off a cake of ice. Well, I'm not here to debate the value of a dog. My daughter would tell you that it was worth it. We have one.<br><br>Question: What is the worth of a soul? Permit one other little "for instance." This is quite tender to me because I remember it vividly. I was near the scene where it happened, and, more particularly, I had a little girl exactly the same age when it occurred. I'm going to read the story because the reporter says it better than I.<br><br><i>At 4:45 on a Friday afternoon in April 1949, a laughing three-year-old child was playing with her small friends in a grassy vacant lot beside her home. Suddenly she disappeared. She had fallen into a long-abandoned well. Fifteen minutes later her mother called the police and reported that her daughter was wedged in a rusty old shaft. Half an hour later firemen were pumping oxygen into the small opening. At the end of an hour, efforts to raise Kathy with a rope had failed, and at 6:00 power equipment began digging a parallel hole. During this brief time the girl called back bravely to the familiar world above her. She always answered those she loved with courage: "Yes, I'm all right." She wanted to please. "Will you try to grab hold of the rope, Kathy?"</i><br><br><i>"I am. I am." Then her voice ceased, but she had spoken long enough to convince those above her that she was unhurt by her fall.</i><br><br><i>By the time I reached the lot, it was no longer vacant. Under a blaze of light men and machines began to battle with Mother Earth. Men by the hundreds began to volunteer their help. Circus midgets lived in the vicinity arrived and risked being lowered by their feet into the crumbling old shaft. There were boy scouts, long thin men, acrobats, engineers, firemen, and contractors. They were men with dark skin, with red hair, with fierce accents and waving hands. Some wore patched pants; others, well-cut business suits. All were drawn by the human drama, wanting to help. By daybreak people throughout the world were invisible spectators. Newspapers, radios, and television put aside war and international news to headline the story of a desperate rescue attempt.</i><br><br><i>Bill Yancy, a thirty-eight-year-old contractor who was one of the nation's underwater demolition men who often cleared the water of mines in the fortified beaches long before the first troops landed, was on the scene. He was the last man out of the hole. At one stretch he moved back five back-breaking feet of earth in less than half an hour.</i><br><br><i>An ex-sandhogger and boilermaker left his home in San Fernando Valley the minute he heard of the accident. In spite of the stabbing pain of a hernia this man stayed at his dangerous job beneath the ground until he himself collapsed and was rushed to the hospital.</i><br><br><i>The father of five children sneaked out of his home to volunteer his help, although he had not done any deep excavation work for a long time. "I didn't want to worry my wife," he said, "but I have good reasons at home." There were so many more.</i><br><br><i>The parallel hole reached the fifty-seven-foot level early Saturday morning. The parallel hole had been started the night before. By Saturday night a steel casing had been completed in the new shaft, but workers hit a sand pocket and water had flowed into the tunnel. Pumping began desperately. Seldom had so much prayer power been focused on one person or on any one rescue. Exhausted gray-faced men continued their dangerous work around water, sand, and cascades of rock.</i><br><br><i>And what was happening around the world! Men on a lonely watch on a ship far at sea followed the progress and took up a collection. Hard coalminers in Denver had offered help, a neighbor brought a chocolate cake, the only offering she could think of. One unidentified man brought over seven hundred gallons of coffee and stacks of doughnuts for the workers.</i><br><br><i>Meanwhile, sitting side by side in a parked car during most of these frantic operations were the girl's white-faced mother and father. Beneath the giant machines and rigging, bright lights, and microphones booming directions lay a tiny figure whom none of these gallant rescuers had ever seen. Was all well with her? Was there water where she lay? Did she know moments of consciousness and fear?</i><br><br><i>Fifty-three hours later, after a total expenditure of a half-million dollars, Bill Yancy was lowered into the rescue shaft on a bucket fastened to the end of a cable. The trapped girl's own doctor, clad in a blue jacket, aviator's cap, and dungaree trousers, began his descent while the world waited above. Then the answer came up. Men had lost. Kathy Fiscus, the little girl whom the whole world had come to know, was dead. She had gone shortly after she had last spoken.</i><br><br><i>And that was all the facts I had to report but not the end of the story. I knew there was something to explain the frantic, futile fight. I looked around the city room. There were the usual reports--wars, strikes, famine, family in trouble, racial problems--and suddenly I saw the contrast. There on the vacant lot in San Marino, California, the whole world had united for a few hours over the life of one little child. Men had not lost. The little girl had got people loving one another. No distinction of color, race or creed, rich or poor rose to mar the efforts of men and women who fought to save one who was made in His image. That was the story, that was the miracle, of little Kathy Fiscus.</i><br><br>Let me ask you another question. Was that effort worth it? What price would you place upon the physical well-being of a soul? Well, I don't think we'd argue the case in point. I suppose the parallel question is what price would you place upon the spiritual soul of an individual. I am representing your children, remember, and I would like to ask you this question. Are you preparing spiritually to teach me, the whole person, when I come into your care and keeping? I remember the incident in the life of Horace Mann, the great educator. He was speaking, as I recall, to a dedicatory service for a new school. In the course of his remarks he said, "The great investment we have made together [and it was in the multi-thousands of dollars in those days] for this building will be worth it all, if we save but one child." Following his address he was approached by one who challenged him: "Didn't you overstate that just a trifle?"<br><br>"Not if that one child were mine," he replied.<br><h2><b>Spiritual Nourishment</b></h2><br>Second, would you remember that I have needs to be met and a soul to be nourished? There's a tendency of parents and educators to forget what it is that they are about and to concentrate upon their own needs. I see in you the great challenge to refocus that attention on the lives of the young people who you will influence.<br><br>I'm reminded of the experience a teacher had who had taken a few history classes at the university and then brought back his cynicism into the junior high school by debunking the religious faiths of his students. One mother went to the teacher and reminded him of his responsibilities. She said, "Remember, we hired you to teach our boys skills, not to undermine their faith." Oh, how educators, parents, and you young college people need to have burned into your souls the words of Edward Markham. Let me quote his poem:<br><br><i>We are all blind until we see</i><br><i>That in the human plan</i><br><i>Nothing is worth the making</i><br><i>If it does not make the man.</i><br><br><i>Why build these cities glorious</i><br><i>If man unbuilded goes?</i><br><i>In vain we built the world</i><br><i>Unless the builder also grows.</i><br><br>Let me just make a couple of suggestions. As you leave this great University, this year or next or the following years, you have a tremendous opportunity not only to put your own houses in order and train up the young people that will be sent to you, but also to take active involvement in community and church affairs. What we need today is a group of delightful young leaders like you who can set society correct.<br><br>I was impressed by a young Texas housewife. Let me share her little story showing what one person involved in proper values can do. More than ten years ago Mrs. Gabler decided that something was wrong with some of the books used in Texas schools when one of her sons asked some question about the Constitution of the United States. "It seemed to me that my children were not learning as they ought to," Mrs. Gabler said, "What really bugged me was that the textbooks seemed to divide the children from their parents." Mrs. Gabler questioned eight paperback civil government books from a noted publisher. For fourteen-year-old pupils, the books take up a large amount of space on how to apply for welfare. This series cannot do as it claims--motivates children for citizenship--because the texts are based on a false premise. They are almost completely negative in that they explain the bad and emphasize it. They had nothing of beauty or encouragement to challenge students to become better men and women.<br><br>Mrs. Gabler said she and her husband, with the help of mothers (and she was the rallying effort), caused the state of Texas to reject the education commission recommendation on such books, to reject the fifth-grade history that had a sentence or two on each of five different pages about George Washington but a six-page spread about Marilyn Monroe. She also objected to passages in the text which she claimed separated the young people from a religious way of life. One placed a farm leader, Cesar Chavez, and the late Martin Luther King on a par with our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.<br><br>These are real influences in our life. Consider the Idaho community where young people like you got together because the parents of your generation would not close down an X-rated theater. I'm always reminded of the simple lesson that President Kimball so often teaches just by his very presence. He was relating to us a little experience that occurred to him one day at the hospital. He was going in for a very close check, perhaps an operation on his throat. We were aware of that and were quite concerned. Being somewhat medicated in preparation for surgery, he was being wheeled down the hospital aisle by an orderly on one of those tables that you are familiar with from<i>Medical Center</i>if you haven't been there yourself. In trying to maneuver the table with our President on it to the elevator, the orderly caught his finger between the table and the elevator door. He let out a string of words among which he took the Lord's name in vain. Let me just ask you a question. What would you have done? Just passed it by because that's what people do? The President of our Church, sick as he was and partly medicated, raised his head and said to the young orderly, who was perhaps even a member of the Church, "Please, please, young man, don't talk that way about my best friend." Well, you can imagine the lesson that was taught to the young boy by the Prophet of the Lord.<br><br>Now you go into the locker room or in the dressing room; you are even around Latter-day Saints who sometimes forget their standards and quality. Can you be counted on to stand up and gently and lovingly set society in order? That's what will be needed as you take your places as parents and future leaders in our great society. As you consider the needs of your young people, would you also not forget to educate the spirit along with the body? Do you remember what Theodore Roosevelt said on one occasion? "To educate a man in mind and not in morals is to educate a menace to society." John Dickey put it this way: "The end of education is to see man made whole both in competence and conscience, for to create the power of competence without creating a corresponding direction to guide the use of that power is bad education; furthermore, competence will finally disintegrate apart from conscience."<br><h2><b>Inspiration for Achievement</b></h2><br>Third, would you remember (and I am now speaking for your children) how to keep me inspired and reminded about my worth, my responsibility, my potential? The home plays a vital role here, and I think so vital. Understanding, as you and I know, is perhaps one of the greatest of all ingredients in God's wonderful plan.<br><br>Permit one other little story in this connection. A man was putting up a sign in a window: "Puppies for Sale." Before he had driven the last nail there was a small boy standing at his side. That kind of sign seems to attract small boys. The youngster wanted to know how much the puppies were going to cost. The man told him that they were very good dogs and that he did not expect to let any of them go for less than thirty-five to fifty dollars. There was a look of disappointment and then a question, "I got $2.37. Could I look at them?" The man whistled and called, "Lady." Out of the kennel and down the runway came Lady, followed by four or five little balls of fur and one lagging considerably behind. The boy spotted the lagger and, pointing, asked, "What's wrong with him?" The reply was that the veterinarian had said that there was no hip socket in the right hip and that the dog would always be lame. The boy's immediate rejoinder was "That's the one I want to buy. I'll give you $2.37 and 50¢ a month until I get him paid for." The man smiled and shook his head. "That's not the dog you want. That dog will never be able to run, jump, and play with you." The boy very matter-of-factly pulled up his little trouser leg and revealed a brace running down both sides of his badly twisted leg and under the foot, with a leather cap coupled over the knee. "I don't run so well myself," he said, "and he'll need somebody that understands."<br><br>I don't suppose there's any greater attribute you can take into marriage and into parenthood than real understanding. Mrs. James Parker, president of the National Congress of Parents and Teachers, made this statement: "Boys and girls are not delivered as raw material to the school door; they are products of four or five or six year of processing in their homes. More and more we can realize what the school can do is to develop a child's potential, but it's limited by what the home has already done and is doing for him or her." What can the home do? Well, I think that this audience, of all audiences, knows; for that has been our theme in the Church since the restoration of the gospel. The home provides the child's positive or negative self-concept, the child's propensity to work or just get by, the attitudes toward community and church leaders, and goals to achieve such as church service, missions, happy marriage, and worthwhile, contributing operations and occupations.<br><br>How are these attitudes learned? Well, I remember what my father-in-law taught me many years ago. He wasn't even a member of the Church. He said, "Paul, will you remember,<i>remember</i>, that you don't teach anybody anything: you help them find it within themselves." And then he made this very distinct statement: "Religion is caught, not taught." And I've never forgotten it. You and I catch a lot of truths by what we are and what we are trained up to be. In my experience there is no such things as an identity crisis or a poor self-image to the youth. There is no such thing; I just don't believe it. I think every young person knows from instinct that he is a child of God, and you and I need to reinforce that as parents in the home.<br><br>May I just say a word about our collective self-image, the weight of Watergate, and the tragedy of Southeast Asia. We are engaged today in a national self-assessment, and we don't like what we see. We have become our own self-accusers. We have seen our prestige slip, and we are starting to believe what others are writing and saying about us--that we are second-rate. What a wonderful opportunity for you as leaders of this country, as parents in your homes, to reassess that thinking and redirect it in the lives of young people who will come under your influence.<br><br>Now, I get pretty tender on this point. I served as a lonely soldier in a great conflict some years ago. I just think somehow you and I and your children have got to get the lump back in the throat when we see the flag, when we hear our national anthem, when we read about our history and review the great contributions of this country and its preparation by the Lord himself. I mentioned this briefly in my conference talk last week. The situation is still very forcefully upon my mind. I recall helping to shoot a lock off a concentration camp on an island in the Pacific. Because we are in devotional and have ladies present I won't attempt to describe the filth and the misery, the pain and the muck I saw there. Three thousand people had been incarcerated for over three years. Over thirty babies had been born that year alone--all with terrible malnutrition and disease. As I was helping to evacuate these natives back to a safe part of the beach where medical aid and comfort could be given, I was interrupted by a thump on my boot. I looked down, and wallowing in the mud was a human being. I later learned he was a sixty-seven-year-old Protestant minister who had been trapped on the island during the invasion. He was 6′1″ and weighed 85 pounds. We got him on a stretcher and cleaned the mud off his face, and I asked what I could do to help. As we were preparing for evacuation (I'll never forget this lesson in American history), he said, "Soldier, do you have a flag?"<br><br>I said, "I don't have one on me, but I can secure one." We secured one from a local jeep, I handed it to him, and he held it on his bosom and welled up with tears. He said to me (I was nineteen years old at the time), "Thank God you came." I have often thought, as I looked through my daughter's history book, "Where is that kind of feeling--that 'Thank God you came'?" I saw one battle in which I took part described in a U.S. history book for eleventh grade, and it gave us two lines. That kind of hurts my feelings--not because I was so important out there, but I saw the price that some of my buddies paid for those two lines in your history book. I hope you have the sense to instill in your youth, your children, the desire for patriotism in defense of this country and love of God with it, because it's important. I think your precept here will be important, and how you do it and the way you do it will make the difference in the outcome of this great nation of ours.<br><br>Please, my beloved young people, make your home a gospel-centered home. I hope you are taking time in your classes now to prepare to give for the future. I know school is school, and sometimes you have to (all due respect to your wonderful teachers) sift through this chaff to get the grain. You may wonder, but it's in there. I challenge you to find it and prepare. Don't waste a minute in these vital years in your education.<br><br>I was touched by a little poem that came to my attention some years ago. As a teacher I try to collect these. Louise Strobeck put it this way:<br><br><i>As I pass up the aisle between the rows of desks,</i><br><i>Sometimes a little hand creeps out to touch my dress,</i><br><i>Not because the fabric is rich or fine,</i><br><i>But just because it happens to be mine.</i><br><i>There was another garment long ago,</i><br><i>And other hands reached out to touch His hem--</i><br><i>A gesture of reverence and love and gratitude</i><br><i>For tender thoughts of him</i><br><i>Makes me very humble, and I see</i><br><i>A little hand reach out to touch me.</i><br><br>Now, there are thousands of little hands that will reach out to touch you, and I hope and pray that you will have the courage and the strength and the preparation to reach back in a way that the Lord would have you do.<br><h2><b>Enthusiasm</b></h2><br>Finally and in conclusion, you've heard me say this from this pulpit many times before: For heaven's sakes, as you go through life in preparation for these great honors that will be bestowed upon you, be enthused! Get excited about what this life is and what this Church offers. If I have one concern as I travel around the world, it's in seeing a Latter-day Saint who doesn't have that vision. We ought to<i>bounce</i>through life. My dad taught me a great lesson many years ago. He said, "Paul, when you grow up, if you aren't careful, you'll be a little disappointed. You'll look around the Church, and you'll see a lot of Latter-day Saints who have gone to seed. That isn't everybody, and I don't want you to do it. Remember life is a journey process; too many Mormons are camping. You move, boy and move fast." I have been trying to move ever since. Life<i>is</i>a journey, not a camp. You and I have got to break camp. We've got to do it enthusiastically.<br><br>I see these wonderful missionaries sitting here in their white shirts. You don't have to look very far to see who they are. That's terrific. Let me just close with a little experience I had with one of them, and I challenge them to go out and do the same thing. I think they will. But I want to be on all of you. You know, when you travel around this Church you see Mormons everywhere. You can't get on a plane without being with one or two of them. I got on a plane the other day in San Francisco going home. The stewardess brought me a cup of coffee and said, "Here you are, sir."<br><br>I said, "Good heavens, you've got me confused with somebody else! I didn't order that."<br><br>"I know," she said, "but I'm just testing you, Elder Dunn."<br><br>Well, I like to test you. When I get on a plane, and when I find that I'm not recognized, I have a little fun in reverse. Once I was coming back from New York, and then I got on a transfer at Chicago. I had just gotten seated and was strapping myself in the seat. Lo and behold, on the plane comes a returned missionary. We can spot them everywhere. They may not think so, but we can, and I caught his eye and nodded at him. He nodded, but there was not recognition, so he went on back to the other cabin, took his seat, and we got airborne. I thought I would just check him out and see if he really knew, so I walked back and forth two or three times, and it didn't register. Then I noticed that there were two open seats beside him, and so I thought, "I'm going to really give him the whole test." I got a magazine and said, "Pardon me, young man, is that seat taken?"<br><br>I knew right then what kind of missionary we had because he said, "No, sir, sit down." And that was all I needed to know. I sat down, opened up my magazine, and got real involved. I watched out of the corner of my eye his approach, and I saw him gird up his loins, fresh courage take. He cleared his voice and said, "Pardon me, sir, what do you know about the Mormons?"<br><br>"Oh," I said, "I know a little bit."<br><br>He said, "Would you like to know more?"<br><br>I said, "I believe I would." Now, that isn't a lie, is it? Before I could get another word out, he opened up his briefcase, took out one of those portable flannelboards, and put it on the seat between us. Out came his flipcharts, and in the next 2 1/2 hours I got four complete lessons. He was terrific! He was enthused. He was excited. He knew what it was all about. I thought, "Now I'm going to give him the supreme test." So I asked him every miserable, hard question I have ever been asked. He looked at me and said, "Ah sir, You're missing the point."<br><br>I said, "How am I missing the point?"<br><br>He said, "You're not listening with your heart; you're arguing with your head. Now listen," he said. "I'm going to bear my testimony, and you'll know what I know." He bore his testimony. It was sweet and wonderful. I wanted to be rebaptized. Well, he was great. As we finished the fourth lesson, we circled over the Wasatch Range and headed into Salt Lake Valley. All of a sudden without any notice he closed his book and said, "I've got to quit."<br><br>"What's the matter? This is getting good."<br><br>He said, "I'm home."<br><br>I said, "Where's home?"<br><br>"Right here."<br><br>"Well," I said, "Where have you been?"<br><br>"I have been on a mission for the Mormon Church."<br><br>I said, "Was it worth it?"<br><br>He teared up and said, "Was it worth it? It was the greatest time of my life."<br><br>I said, "Anybody here to meet you?"<br><br>He said, "I think my whole genealogy is here." The plane landed, taxied over to the runway, and there was a sign that you could see had been made in family home evening--about twenty feet long. "Welcome home, Elder So-and-so." The plane stopped, the door opened, and he said, "Would you mind if I got out ahead of you?"<br><br>I said, "Not at all. I love to watch a successful missionary come home anytime." What a scene that was! Down the ladder he went. You didn't have to tell me who his mother was. She had broken security. As she ran over to him, she swept him off the bottom rung of that ladder and spun him around. Behind her came the little five- or six- or seven-year-old brother, proud of his big brother. He grabbed a hold of his brother's thigh, held on, and all I heard him mumble was "my brother." Behind him was the sweet little thing who had waited. You elders ought to know that they<i>do</i>once in a while. She wanted to be proper. You could tell she had come from the right kind of environment, so she put out her hand to shake his. That didn't quite seem to fit, so she pulled it back and then she kind of looked to see if heaven was looking. Finally she let her womanly instincts take over, grabbed that kid and introduced a whole new technique. When that boy came up, he was looking for President Kimball and all the Brethren. Behind her came the Father. You can always tell a father, can't you? Kind of proud, puffed up, but he doesn't want to show it. He had his hands in his belt, kind of sauntered over, and his look said, "That's my boy." They embraced as dads and sons do, patted each other on the shoulder, and I knew exactly what kind of home that was. So I tried to get out of there, made a right-hand run, but while the dad was patting the son he saw me. "Elder Dunn," he said, "Were you on that plane?"<br><br>And the boy said, "Elder who?" Well, he turned and came over, and I walked back and said, "It's true, and I just want to say this, Elder: Thank God for young people like you." And I thank that family.<br><br>I thank God this day for young people like you--great, wonderful youth who have a tremendous future and who have so much responsibility and obligation put upon your shoulders. I'm not really worried how you will turn out. You've got a few challenges. Who hasn't? That's what you and I were sent to this world for. You've been blessed by having people placed in your midst to give you that reassurance, to know in assurance that Jesus is the Christ and that God is. May you know this day, that I know that God lives and that Jesus is the Christ. I have great faith in you--great trust. You're terrific. Now go out there and show the world how to do it. May the Lord bless you to do that, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Paul H.

<h1>te Your Opportunities - Marion D. Hanks - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I'm here today physically subdued from an interesting afternoon and evening in swinging an ax and pushing a saw in the snow at Aspen Grove, but I'm built up to an exultation of spirit and emotion through that great experience. David Grayson wrote, "It is not the time of the day nor the turn of the season nor yet the way of the wind that matters most to us, but the ardor and glow we ourselves bring to the fragrant earth. It is a sad thing to reflect that, in a world so overflowing with goodness of smell or fine sights and sweet sounds, we pass by hastily and take so little of them. Days pass when we see no beautiful sights, hear no sweet sounds, smell no memorable odor, when we exchange no single word of deeper understanding with a friend. We have lived a day and added nothing to our lives."<br><br>On our way to and from Aspen Grove we passed hunters, all of them driving slowly and looking forlornly at the hillside. I personally was not sorry to see them looking so forlorn. Of course it is a proper sport, and the proper season. I think more of fishing, and have spent some successful time on the river. You may know of the man in Arkansas, described in the<i>Arkansas Gazette</i>, who went fishing at a place called Lee's Ferry on September 22, 1972, caught a few fish, and lost his wedding band. It was a matter of sore concern at his house. One year later on September 22, 1973, fishing in exactly the same place, he caught a fourteen-inch trout. While he was opening that trout with his sharp knife, the knife struck something solid. It was his thumb. Well, things are not always what they seem.<br><br>Now, I'd like to qualify my being here today. I didn't come for just another meeting, of course. I really feel like the Englishman who watched his first game of American football, saw all those huddles, and said, "Seems like an interesting game. I think I could learn to like it, but they hold too many committee meetings." I didn't come, we didn't come, to see the local attractions.<br><br>I was reading the other day about the archbishop of Canterbury who was warned about the American news media. Upon arrival he met a group of these interesting people who asked him questions. One said, "Archbishop, do you intend to visit the night clubs in New York?"<br><br>Warily he answered, "Oh, are there night clubs in New York?"<br><br>The next day the paper printed the story: "The first question the archbishop of Canterbury asked upon arriving in New York was, 'Are there night clubs in New York?'"<br><br>I'm not here today to see anything except you, really, though I certainly enjoyed the beauty of the sky and the mountains on my way here.<br><br>There is one other preliminary to the major message of my intent. That is a preliminary message which is entirely appropriate here. It came from the Tucson newspaper known to many of you, I am sure, and was in reference to a headline published over an article about the necessary discharge of a number of state employees because of budgetary limitations. The headline said: "Whom shall be fired first?" A letter to the editor said, quoting that headline, "Whom shall be fired first? That's easy.<i>Whom</i>wrote the headline,<i>him</i>shall be fired first. Him doesn't know enough good English grammar to hold the job he has."<br><br>Well, I didn't come to teach much that's new, either, and I'll therefore tell you why I'm here. I came because I like to come and so accepted the invitation. I like to get the feel of this place. Someone has written, "New leaves do not come because old leaves are falling. Old leaves fall because new leaves are coming." You are the new leaves. We look with optimism to your coming and bid you remember with Charlie Brown that there is no heavier burden than great potential.<br><h2><b>Information and Appreciation</b></h2><br>I came to deliver a nosegay of flowers collected along the road, tying together these blossoms with the frail thread of my understanding, acceptance, conviction, and appreciation. I'd like to begin what I have to say with a quotation from a hero of mine whose name is Abraham Heschel. He is gone now but was a great rabbi and teacher. Abraham Heschel wrote:<br><br><i>Two things a man needs--information and appreciation. Now when I look at our educational system and many other institutions for civilization, I see a tremendous emphasis upon information, but hardly any cultivation of the sense of appreciation. Unless there is appreciation there is no mankind. The great marvel of being alive is the ability to discover the mystery and wonder of everything. The real dignity of anything that is, is in its relationship to God Who created it. Unless we learn how to revere, we will not know how to exist as human beings.</i><br><br>For what information and appreciation shall we seek? Let me share a story you may have heard. If so, you will appreciate it more, and if not, it will be a thoughtful experience. An older man and a young man were drifting in a rowboat on a quiet lake, beneath the earthen dam that formed the lake. They had newly become friends. The older man, as they talked, picked up a leaf from the surface of the lake. He said, "Son, do you know very much about biology?"<br><br>The young man said, "I'm afraid I don't, sir."<br><br>"Well," he said, "You've lost 25 percent of your life."<br><br>They went a little farther and the older man took from the bottom of the boat a rock. He held it up, examined it, and said to the younger man, "Son, do you know very much about geology?"<br><br>He said, a little embarrassed, "no sir, I'm afraid I don't."<br><br>"Well," he said, "you've lost 50 percent of your life."<br><br>As they drifted it became dusk and the first evening star appeared. The older man asked, "son, do you know very much about astronomy?"<br><br>He said, "I'm embarrassed to tell you, sir, that I don't."<br><br>The older man answered, with a smile, "You've missed 75 percent of your life."<br><br>They drifted a little longer and then, sensing some unusual current in the water beneath them, looked up and saw coming at them a huge wall of water from the dam, which had burst. The young man said, "Sir, do you know how to swim?"<br><br>He said, "No, I'm afraid I don't."<br><br>"Well," said the boy, "you're about to lose all of your life."<br><br>A leaf, a rock, a star, swimming, biology, geology, astronomy--all are wonderful. It would be wonderful if each of us had a broad enough base in the laws of nature and the basics of science and the facts of history and the principles of philosophy to be interested in and understand in a measure the great advances being made around us. This knowledge contributes richness to life and perhaps to making a living, but more important than any of it, central to all of it, giving it all meaning and coherence, is information about and appreciation of man himself, of his relationships with others and with God, and of his understanding of origins and heritage and possibilities, responsibilities, and an everlasting future. Let me look at two or three matters of appreciation selected out of a multitude I've been turning over in my mind the last few hours.<br><h2><b>Appreciation for Life</b></h2><br>Appreciate life. Grayson's comment about ardor is complemented for me by something I heard from two wonderful psychologists, a husband-and-wife team, teaching a group of adults a long time ago. Out of all that they said, much of which I remember, one thought is foremost in my mind: "Nor heaven nor hell can him surprise, who loves his home, and loves the rain, and looks on life with quiet eyes."<br><br>You may have heard the last interview recorded with Dr. Tom Dooley before he died of leukemia. He had given the young years of his medical career, when he could have been making a lot of money, to the people of Indochina. These two or three sentences constituted the valedictory, of sorts, of Tom Dooley. Said the questioner, "Dr. Dooley, you are living on borrowed time, yet your contributions to humanity seem to take no account of the trials you personally are called upon to bear."<br><br>"Yes," he said (this conversation was replayed the day he died), "I am living on borrowed time. So are you; so is every man who walks this earth. I may live to be as old as you are now; I may not live to see my next birthday. This does not matter. What really counts is what I do in terms of human good with the days, the weeks, the months or the years allotted to me by my creator." Appreciate life.<br><h2><b>Appreciation for Others</b></h2><br>Appreciate others and be respectful of their values. I was called upon to pray at a public gathering a few days ago and found myself without premeditation thanking God for the qualities of gentility and civility and caring which permit people of diverse points of view and diverse ways of living to be together in an atmosphere of courtesy and graciousness. I've thought about that since. I think the Lord blessed me to say that. It certainly was consonant with how I feel and what I would like my life to represent. Do you remember the words of the great apostle who encouraged all of us to "honor all men. Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honor the king" (1 Peter 2:17)? We also read of the Prophet, under the inspiration of God, preceding the marvelous words "let virtue garnish thy thoughts unceasingly" with the admonition that we be filled with love toward all men, and to the household of faith (see D&amp;amp;C 121:45). This message is repeated again and again. I wonder if we always are sensitive to it.<br><br>Do you know the story of Mike Gold? I didn't until a year or so ago.<br><br><i>In the 1920s, the philosopher of American communism was a Jew named Mike Gold. After communism fell into general disrepute in this country, Mike Gold became a man of oblivion. In this oblivion he wrote a book,</i>A Jew Without Knowing It.<i>In describing his childhood in New York City, he tells of his mother's instructions never to wander beyond four certain streets. She could not tell him that it was a Jewish ghetto. She could not tell him that he had the wrong kind of blood in his veins....</i><br><br><i>In his narration, Mike Gold tells of the day that curiosity lured him beyond the four streets, outside of his ghetto, and of how he was accosted by a group of older boys who asked him a puzzling question: "Hey, kid, are you a kike?" "I don't know." He had never heard that word before. The older boys came back with a paraphrase of their question. "Are you a Christ-killer?" Again, the small boy responded, "I don't know." He had never heard that word either. So the older boys asked him where he lived, and trained like most small boys to recite their address in case of being lost, Mike Gold told them where he lived. "So you are a kike; you are a Christ-killer. Well you're in Christian territory and we are Christians. We're going to teach you to stay where you belong!" And so they beat the little boy, bloodied his face and tore his clothes and sent him home to the jeering litany: "We are Christians and you killed Christ! Stay where you belong! We are Christians, and you killed Christ."...</i><br><br><i>When he arrived home, Mike Gold was asked by his frightened mother: "What happened to you, Mike?" He could answer only: "I don't know." "Who did this to you, Mike?" Again he answered: "I don't know." And so the mother washed the blood from the face of her little boy and put him into fresh clothes and took him into her lap as she sat in a rocker, and tried to soothe him. Mike Gold recalled so much later in life that he raised his small battered lips to the ears of his mother and asked: "Mama, who is Christ?"</i>[John Powell,<i>Why Am I Afraid to Love,</i>pp. 114–16]<br><br>I read from the Book of Mormon:<br><br><i>And now, my brethren, I have spoken to you concerning pride; and those of you which have afflicted your neighbor, and persecuted him because ye were proud in your hearts, of the things which God hath given you, what say ye of it?</i><br><br><i>Do ye not suppose that such things are abominable unto him who created all flesh? And the one being is as precious in his sight as the other. And all flesh is of the dust; and for the selfsame end hath he created them, that they should keep his commandments and glorify him forever.</i>[Jacob 2:20–21]<br><br>Do you remember Shaw's<i>Pygmalion</i>? One of the lines from this play is "the difference between a flower girl and a lady is not how she behaves but how she is treated." When I think of another sentence from Abraham Heschel. "Holocausts," he said, "are caused not only by atomic explosions; holocausts are caused whenever a person is put to shame."<br><h2><b>Appreciation for Yourself</b></h2><br>Appreciate your own special spiritual heritage and value. I read in a wonderful Christian-Protestant magazine a little while ago a somewhat strange, and to me sorrowful, statement: "Like all other institutions of liberal Protestantism, this magazine is suffering from an erosion of self-confidence. There is a pervasive feeling that we no longer have anything particularly distinctive to offer by way of religious insight." In this world, where the Lord needs every strong heart and devoted hand and tongue he can find, I think that's very sad indeed.<br><br>What I'm saying to you is that we need to appreciate the special heritage and values that have come to us. Think for a moment what particularly distinctive insight the kingdom of God offers you in these matters: God, Christ, man, life, sex, marriage, family, resurrection, eternity. Special instruction has been given to us concerning conservation, pollution, liberation, population, elections, freedom, abortion, government, Christ. In these and many other very important principles, programs, doctrines, and matters, there are distinctive, special insights we have to share. But just knowing that or hearing it doesn't really suffice, does it? We must learn to understand these insights and become really converted to them, and to act on them.<br><br>I wish it were appropriate to tell you all the details of a conversation I once had with a young lady, a lovely person, who was professionally qualified in a certain field. I would not want you to know those details, so I simply share a headline. She was about to make a decision that would influence her and her generations. She came into my office reluctantly, but she came because both she and I loved her parents. She was not really interested in anything I had to say and acknowledged it openly when I asked her. I said to her, "When did you last do any serious reading about the Church?"<br><br>"Oh," she said a bit blithely, "in the ninth grade. We were reading the Book of Mormon. I quit, though."<br><br>I said, "Did you also quit praying and going to church?"<br><br>"Yes," she said.<br><br>"And pretty soon you stopped living the life of the Church?"<br><br>"Yes."<br><br>I said, "I really just have one other question to ask you. The new Church Office Building is about ready to be completed--all those many stories. Your speciality will be involved in its completion. I'd like to do what I could to get you the job to work on that great building. Would you like that?"<br><br>Looking a little dubious, she said, "Well, sure!"<br><br>I said, "All right, I think I can do it on one condition. You agree to perform your professional speciality on that building on the basis of what you knew about it in the ninth grade."<br><br>She looked a long time at the floor before the teardrops came, and she said, "Oh, Brother Hanks, I'm in terrible trouble. Can you help me?"<br><br>I said, "Yes, I think I can now."<br><br>To learn and then to act. I know a man who as a bishop won an award for his great skills and success in training teachers who work among underprivileged people. Some of his fellow teachers who knew him and knew the quality of his record and the nature of his life and his attitude toward his fellowmen said, "We just don't get it. How can you, being a Mormon, do the kind of work you do?"<br><br>He said, "You really don't get it, do you? I do the kind of work I do precisely because I am a Mormon."<br><br>Appreciate your own particular, distinctive heritage and the religious insights which it offers.<br><br>I stood under an awning one day, low in spirit, soaked by the rain. I had some law books under my arm, and they had been soaked, also. There were a lot of other problems on my shoulders, problems concerning people I loved very much, and other demands made on me, and many Church assignments. I hardly knew where to turn, and I really was depressed. There were two others under the awning who I did not at first even notice in my preoccupation with my own problems, but I couldn't keep from hearing them speaking to each other. One said--she was a beautiful person, very near the birth of a child--to her friend, "How are things going with you?"<br><br>She said, "Just fine, but we can't find an apartment. Have you found one yet, with the baby coming?"<br><br>"Oh, yes," said the pregnant girl, "we found one."<br><br>The other said, "You did? How could you? We've looked and looked."<br><br>"Oh," she said, "We did, too. Bob and I looked till we were exhausted, and then, having tried as hard as we could, we fasted and prayed for a couple of days and he went out and found a nice place."<br><br>"Oh," said the other. And I stood feeling ashamed, remembering some things I hadn't even thought of for a while.<br><h2><b>Appreciation for Humility</b></h2><br>Appreciate the importance of being humble. Do you remember the wonderful words of an anguished father recorded in scripture? "Lord, I believe; help thou mine unbelief" (Mark 9:24). Do you remember the wonderful line about matters of greater consequence--"weightier matters" the Lord called them--judgment, mercy, and faith (see Matthew 23:23)? Do you remember the wonderful man who knew how to treat his neighbor, who knew how to love God and his fellowman though he wasn't a member of the kingdom? The Savior said to him, "Thou art not far from the kingdom of God" (Mark 12:34). There was something more he had to do, but he had the spirit and the meaning. And do you remember the Pharisee and the publican, the one so congratulatory over his religious rigidities, and the other who "would not lift up so much as his eyes unto heaven, but smote upon his breast, saying, God be merciful to me a sinner" (Luke 18:13)?<br><br>Out of literature a long time ago I extracted a sentence I hope I can remember. A young priest was about to leave his calling because he saw injustice, an older priest encouraging him to remain because he saw true Christian strength in the youth. He said to the younger man, "You have inquisitiveness and tenderness. You are sensible to the distinction between thinking and doubting. And best of all, you do not have that bumptious security which springs from dogma rather than from faith" (A. J. Cronin,<i>Keys of the Kingdom</i>). In the name and worship of Jesus Christ we should be humble.<br><h2><b>Appreciation for Responsibility</b></h2><br>Two other suggestions and I'm through. Appreciate the responsibility of being an individual in an organized society, a person and a social being with responsibility to others. Avoid, I pray you, that lone-eagle complex that makes some people say, "It's my life and I'm going to live it. I'm going to do what I want to do in spite of what it does to anybody else, what effect it has on anyone else."<br><br>Do you remember Niemoller's interesting bequeathment--he who got along for a time with the Nazis and finally was imprisoned? "They came after the Jews, and I was not a Jew so I did not object. Then they came after the Catholics, and I was not a Catholic so I did not object. Then they came after the trade unionists. I was not a trade unionist so I did not object. Then they came after me, and there was nobody left to object."<br><br>Christ asked, at the end of a story well known to all of us, "Which one of these three, thinkest thou, was neighbor unto him that fell among thieves?" (Luke 10:36). Six hundred or more years before that Jeremiah had asked, "Is it nothing to you, all ye that pass by?" (Lamentations 1:12).<br><h2><b>Appreciation for Covenants</b></h2><br>Appreciate, please, the need we all have to keep the pledges we have made. Sister Hanks and I were at the tomb of Gandhi in India. We read there a few words that I have treasured since--words about pledges, words that I have found mirrored within the standard works and my own covenants and the memory of them reflected in the little piece of bread and the cup of water we take on the Sabbath. Gandhi said: "Even for life itself we may not do certain things. There is only one course open to me, to die but never to break my pledge. ... How can I control others if I cannot control myself?" I remind you to be grateful for your pledges, and to keep them. I exemplify my pledges in an experience I once had. In a small town I had a talk with a lovely young woman about an opportunity she desired and now felt ready for. We were talking about her qualifications. She was candid and humble and gentle and forthright, anxious for her great opportunity. As we finished, I said to her, "Does anyone else know about the problem that makes this conversation necessary?"<br><br>She said, "My bishop and my stake president and my parents."<br><br>I said (and I have more often felt blessed by the Spirit to ask a question than in answering one), "What was the reaction of your parents when you told them?"<br><br>She said, "My father put his arms around me and wept. He said, 'Ah, sweetheart, how could you carry this heavy burden alone without us to help?'"<br><br>I said, "Was that his first response? Was that his reaction?"<br><br>She said, "Yes."<br><br>I said, "Do you know how blessed you are? Could I have the honor of meeting your father before we leave here?"<br><br>The arrangement was made. I said to him, "If I can express in my own life the maturity of Christian understanding of the gospel that you have, I will be very grateful."<br><br>I bid you remember that, please. It is important to have that quality of character, and that kind of mature understanding of what it is really all about, and that kind of love. I see that as an appreciation of what God really expects us to grow to and is pulling for us to accomplish.<br><br>This is a good place to stop, save one, and that one is a scripture:<br><br><i>And now I, Moroni, bid farewell unto the Gentiles, yea, and also unto my brethren whom I love, until we shall meet before the judgment-seat of Christ....</i><br><br><i>And then shall ye know that I have seen Jesus, and that he hath talked with me face to face, and that he told me in plain humility, even as a man telleth another in mine own language, concerning these things.</i>[Ether 12:38–39]<br><br>And I join Moroni in this invitation:<br><br><i>And now, I would commend you to seek this Jesus of whom the prophets and apostles have written, that the grace of God the Father, and also the Lord Jesus Christ, and the Holy Ghost, which beareth record of them, may be and abide in you forever.</i>[Ether 12:41]<br><br>This is his work. I think to learn of it and appreciate it is the main undertaking and highest blessing of us all, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Marion D.

<h1>ving: The Mother of Virtues - Sterling W. Sill - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
We have an interesting custom among us in which we set aside special days to think about special things. We set aside the second Sunday in May as Mother's Day, and on this day we let our minds reach up and try and understand the purposes for which this day was set apart. We set apart the third Sunday in June as Father's Day for the same reason.<br><br>Someone has said that the human mind has some of the qualities of the tendrils of a climbing vine. It tends to attach itself and draw itself upward by what it is put in contact with.<br><br>And then we have some other great days on which we put our minds in contact with other great ideas. We have Easter and Memorial Day and Pioneer Day and Christmas and the Fourth of July.<br><br>In the month of November we set aside the fourth Thursday as Thanksgiving. On this day we try to build gratitude and appreciation into our lives. And as we recount our blessings we increase them. Cato, the great Roman philosopher, once said that gratitude is the mother of virtues. That is, virtues have parents the same as people do, and a thankful heart can produce the most profitable posterity. And we might well join with Shakespeare as he prayed, "Oh God who lends me life, lend me a heart replete with thankfulness."<br><br>However, we can't adequately think about any of these great ideas if we just think about them during one day of the year. That is, if the only day we commemorated Mother's day was on the second Sunday in May, there wouldn't be much of a Mother's Day. We do a little better with another day that we sometimes refer to as Father's Day. That is, the God of creation himself has set aside the first day of each week as a kind of Heavenly Father's Day in which we let our minds reach up toward God. Someone has said that our civilization would never have survived for a half a century if it had not been for this one day in seven that we call Sunday. This is the Sabbath. This is the day when we try to reach a pinnacle in our lives. This is the day when we pay particular attention to the washing of our bodies; this is the day when we put on our best clothes and read our best books and think our best thoughts. This is the day when we associate with the people that we love the most. This is the day for which we reserve the best meal of the week. Then, after we have laid aside the cares that concern us during the other six days, we go to the house of prayer and let our minds reach up and try and understand the purposes of God.<br><br>Like the commemoration of Easter and Christmas, the commemoration of Thanksgiving ought to last 365 days in the year. As we approach this Thanksgiving season of 1975, maybe we should do a little homework on the idea by making up a catalog of some of those things that we ought to be thankful for.<br><h2><b>Gratitude to God</b></h2><br>Of course the greatest fact there is in the universe is God. We ought to be thankful<i>for</i>God and we ought to be thankful<i>to</i>God. Some thirty-four centuries ago, from the top of Mt. Sinai, God gave the world his law. And in the first of these great commandments God said, "Thou shalt have no other gods before me." Suppose it was your privilege to discharge God. Who would you want to place in his place? How would you like to be ruled by the Democrats, or the Republicans, or the labor unions, or the economists, or the college students? We have a great article of faith in which we say, "We believe in God." That does not mean that we merely believe that he exists, but that we know the kind of being he is and what our relationship to him ought to be.<br><br>I am grateful<i>for</i>God, that he is my eternal Heavenly Father, that he has endowed me with a set of his attributes and potentialities, and that I might eventually become even as he is. I am grateful<i>to</i>God, who is the giver of all good gifts, and I can help to lift myself up to him by running these feelings of appreciation through my life. The psychiatrists tell us that when an idea passes through our minds it makes a kind of groove or engram which determines the kind of people we are. We ought to memorize the great hymns of praise and worship. Thinking about my many blessings, I like to recite to myself the great poem which says:<br><br><i>Oh God, I thank thee for each sight</i><br><i>Of beauty that thy world doth give</i><br><i>For sunny sky and air and light</i><br><i>Oh God, I thank thee that I live.</i><br><i>That life I consecrate to thee</i><br><i>And ever as the day is born</i><br><i>On wings of joy my soul doth flee</i><br><i>And thank thee for another morn.</i><br><i>Another morn in which to cast</i><br><i>Some silent deed of love abroad</i><br><i>That greatening as it journeys past</i><br><i>May do some earnest work for God.</i><br><br>I also love to repeat to myself the great masterpiece of Stuart K. Hine's entitled "How Great Thou Art":<br><br><i>O Lord My God! When I in awesome wonder--</i><br><i>Consider all the world Thy hands have made,</i><br><i>I see the stars, I hear the rolling thunder,</i><br><i>Thy pow'r throughout the universe displayed.</i><br><i>Then sings my soul, my Savior God to thee--</i><br><i>How great Thou art, how great Thou art!</i><br><br><i>When through the woods and forest glades I wander,</i><br><i>And hear the birds sing sweetly in the trees;</i><br><i>When I look down from lofty mountain grandeur</i><br><i>And hear the brook and feel the gentle breeze.</i><br><i>Then sings my soul, my Savior God to thee--</i><br><i>How great Thou art, how great Thou art!</i><br><br><i>And when I think that God, His Son not sparing,</i><br><i>Sent Him to die, I scarce can take it in,</i><br><i>That on the cross, my burden gladly bearing</i><br><i>He bled and died to take away my sin:</i><br><i>Then sings my soul, my Savior God to thee--</i><br><i>How great Thou art, how great Thou art!</i><br><br><i>When Christ shall come with shout of acclamation</i><br><i>And take me home, what joy shall fill my heart!</i><br><i>Then I shall bow in humble adoration</i><br><i>And there proclaim, my God how great Thou Art!</i><br><br><i>Then sings my soul, my Savior God to thee--</i><br><i>How great Thou art, how great Thou art!</i><br><i>Then sings my soul, my Savior God to thee--</i><br><i>How great Thou art, how great Thou art!</i><br><h2><b>Gratitude for Life</b></h2><br>Next, it seems to me that we ought to be grateful for life. Life is that mysterious primal element in which each of us, including God, has his being. God has created a plant life and animal life, but he has given us a very special kind of human life with the possibilities of growing into the kind of life which he himself has. Henry Thoreau, an early American philosopher, once said that we should thank God every day of our lives for the privilege of having been born. And then he went on to speculate on the unique supposition of what it might have been like if we had not been born.<br><br>Just suppose that you had never been born, or that your parents had never been born. Just think of all the excitements and benefits that you would have missed as a consequence. However, what Mr. Thoreau may not have known was that one-third of all the children of God never were born and never can be born, because they failed to pass the requirements of their first estate. We remember the unembodied spirits who appeared to Jesus in his day, who preferred the bodies of swine rather than not to have any bodies at all.<br><br>I am grateful to my parents and to God for this tremendous opportunity that I have of being born to live under the most favorable conditions that have ever been known in the world. One of the significant characteristics about the moment of birth is that it is an unconscious moment. Nobody realizes that he is being born when that event is actually taking place, and we usually don't find out about it until quite a long time afterward. Sometimes we never actually do find out that we have been born. One man once said about his friend, "He doesn't know that he is alive," and that sometimes comes very near the facts. That is, some people don't know why they are alive, or where they came from, or where they are going, or what the future condition of their lives will be.<br><br>There is another thing that I'm very interested in about my birth, and that is what Jesus had said, that to be born once is not enough and that everyone ought to be born twice. And so on August 27, 1911, I was born again of water and of the spirit in exactly the meaning of that term as indicated by the Savior of the world. I repented of my sins as best I knew how; then I went into the waters of baptism and came forth in the newness of life. I had authorized hands laid upon my head for the reception of the Holy Ghost, and I was confirmed a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints by my father. In all of the years since then, I have had the privilege of living by those great standards of conduct which the God of heaven has made a part of his church organization upon this earth. What tremendous advantages that has given me in my life here which will go with me throughout all of eternity.<br><br>Then I have discovered another interesting thing about being born, and that is that no one is limited to two births. Everyone can be born again as many times as he likes, and each time he can be born better. In 1932 Walter Pitkin wrote a book entitled<i>Life Begins at Forty.</i>But that is ridiculous. Life begins every morning. Life begins when we begin. Phillips Brooks was once asked when he was born, and he said, "It was one Sunday afternoon about 3:30, just after I had finished reading a great book."<br><br>When we learn a new truth, we are born again. When we get a great conviction stirring in our hearts, we become a new person. If anyone has been wrong, he can be born again, and he can be born to be exactly the kind of person that he, himself, may choose to be.<br><h2><b>Gratitude for America</b></h2><br>Another thing that I am very grateful for is that I was born an American. I have been around quite a little bit, and I have seen a lot of other places. There are a lot of wonderful places in the world. But I hope God will excuse me if I am a little bit grateful that I was born an American, that I was born in this great, free land where God raised up wise men to write the Constitution of this land and establish this country upon Christian principles.<br><br>We express our appreciation to Christopher Columbus, who in 1492 discovered America, but we might say that from several different points of view Columbus did not discover America. He was trying to find a new route to the East Indies, and until Columbus died he did not know that he had discovered America. In fact, America has not yet been discovered by most of the people in the world--or even by those people who live upon this land.<br><br>The first statement ever made about our earth is that it was without form and void, and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And we might feel that brooding, unbroken darkness when God gave that first great command, saying, "Let there be light." And God looked out upon the earth, which included America, and called it "very good." But for the first fifty-five hundred years of our earth's recorded history until the time of Columbus, most people knew nothing about the great drama of earth life which took place in America. Most people do not know that America, the land on which we live, served the world as the cradle of civilization and that the Garden of Eden made up the very central part of what is now the United States of America.<br><br>During the flood, the ark was carried to Mt. Ararat and a new cradle of civilization was established in Asia, but at the confusion of tongues at the Tower of Babel the Lord sent a colony back to establish the great Jaredite civilization, which the Lord himself said would be equal of the great empires of Assyria, Babylon, or Persia.<br><br>The world does not yet understand that America is a choice land, choice above all other lands, that it was selected by God to be the citadel of liberty, and that America has been given the great mission of keeping freedom, righteousness, and human dignity alive in the world. Most people have not discovered that the gospel of Jesus Christ has been restored to the earth in our day and that it was America that was selected to be the religious center, as well as the scientific center and the cultural center of the world, in the greatest and final age of all which the apostle Paul referred to as the dispensation of the fulness of times.<br><br>There are many people who have not yet discovered that the keys of their eternal welfare have been restored by God to America. In this coming year we will celebrate the Bicentennial of our nation's birth. It has been 482 years since Columbus arrived here. He explained why he came by saying, "Our Lord unlocked my mind, sent me upon the sea, and gave me fire for the deed. Those who heard of my enterprise called it foolish, mocked me, and laughed. But who can doubt but that the Holy Ghost inspired me?"<br><br>Three hundred thirty-eight years after Columbus, the Father and the Son made a visit to Joseph Smith in the sacred grove in Palmyra, New York. And yet many Americans, and many Latter-day Saints, do not yet understand the blessings of living in this great, free land. It is one of the purposes of the Church during this Bicentennial year to help everyone in the world discover America. And the Church of Jesus Christ, which has been established here, is now proceeding at its most accelerated pace to spread its message throughout the world under the authority of God himself in preparing the world for the glorious second coming of Jesus Christ.<br><br>George Washington believed that he was an instrument in the hands of God in the establishment of this great American nation. He said, "The singular interposition of divine providence in our behalf has been such as could scarcely escape the attention of the most unobserving." And in his inaugural address he said, "Every step by which we have advanced to the character of an independent nation seems to have been distinguished by some token of providential agency."<br><br>In the United States with some 6 percent of the world's population and 7 percent of the world's land area, we have approximately 50 percent of all the radios, television sets, automobiles, and food supply of the world. In a material way, there isn't any one of us who does not live better than any king lived just a hundred years ago. There isn't any one of us who would not count it an incredible hardship to live as Solomon lived in all of his glory.<br><br>As Joshua was about to proceed to lead his people across the River Jordan to repossess their promised land, which was already in a full state of cultivation, the Lord said to the children of Israel, "And thou shalt inhabit cities which thou didst not build and thou shalt eat from vines which thou hast not planted and thou shalt drink from wells which thou didst not dig" (see Deuteronomy 6:10–12). There isn't any American who does not eat from vines which he did not plant. There isn't any Latter-day Saint who does not drink from wells which he did not dig. There isn't any one of us who does not enjoy a thousand different benefits which he had no part in producing. And then the Lord said to the children of Israel, and he is trying to say to us, "And when thou hast eaten and art full, beware lest thou forget the Lord thy God." There is always great benefit in remembering the source of our blessings.<br><br>In his Thanksgiving Day Proclamation of 1863, Abraham Lincoln said, "We have been the recipients of the choicest bounties of heaven. We have been preserved these many years in peace and prosperity. We have grown in numbers, wealth, and power as no other nation has ever grown." Then he mentioned our perennial problem when he said, "But we have forgotten God. We have forgotten the gracious hand that preserved us in peace, and multiplied and enriched and strengthened us. And we have vainly imagined in the deceitfulness of our hearts that all these blessings were produced by some superior wisdom or virtue of our own. Intoxicated with unbroken success, we have become too self-sufficient to feel the necessity of redeeming and preserving grace, too proud to pray to the God who made us. It behooves us then," said President Lincoln, "to humble ourselves before the offended power, to confess our national sins, and to pray for clemency and forgiveness." And we ought to know the conditions by which our great American blessings are brought about.<br><br>In 1831 Alexis de Tocqueville, the famous French historian, was sent to our country in an attempt to help his country discover America. He said, "I sought for the greatness and genius of America in her commodious harbors and her ample rivers, and it was not there; in her fertile fields and boundless prairies, and it was not there; in her rich mines and her vast world commerce, and it was not there. Not until I went into the churches of America and heard her pulpits aflame with righteousness did I understand the secret of her genius and her power."<br><br>Then he said, "America is great because she is good, and if America ever ceases to be good, she will cease to be great." That is a very important fact which every American, and every Latter-day Saint, needs to discover for himself about America.<br><br>Calvin Coolidge told us a great deal about American greatness when he said:<br><br><i>We do not need more material development,</i><br><i>We need more spiritual development.</i><br><br><i>We do not need more intellectual power,</i><br><i>We need more moral power.</i><br><br><i>We do not need more knowledge,</i><br><i>We need more character.</i><br><br><i>We do not need more government,</i><br><i>We need more culture.</i><br><br><i>We do not need more law,</i><br><i>We need more religion.</i><br><br><i>We do not need more of the things that are seen,</i><br><i>We need more of the things that are unseen.</i><br><h2><b>Gratitude for Gospel</b></h2><br>One of the other blessings that I am very thankful for is my part of the faith of the Saints. One of the great documents of the world is what we call the Articles of Faith. These are thirteen statements of belief, twelve of which begin by saying, "We believe." It is probable that the greatest misfortune of many people is their disbelief in good things. So many people disbelieve in God. They disbelieve in their work. They disbelieve in religion, and they disbelieve in the purpose of life. Someone has said that the ability of people to disbelieve is unbelievable.<br><br>On the other hand, what a thrilling, exciting thing it is to be able to say from the depths of one's soul, "I believe in God, I believe in America, I believe in my work, I believe in my family, and I believe in my own eternal destiny."<br><br>Suppose we make a list of these important principles of life and salvation which have been with us since before the foundation of the world.<br><br>I believe that God has ordained and established the literal bodily resurrection. During the last seventy-three years I have never seen my own spirit, but I have gotten very well acquainted with my body. And while it may not look very exciting to some of you and it is a little bit out of shape in some places, yet I am very grateful for it. I am very grateful for this magnificent brain which God has given each one of us. Mine may not work as well as yours does, but I like it just the same. I like the way it thinks. I like the way it takes orders from me. I like the ambitions that stir around in my brain once in a while. I enjoy my several appetites and, while my eyes are getting a little weary and some of my other abilities aren't as alert as they have been, yet I'm very grateful for them. And I can't tell you of any more exciting thing that I can think of in the world than to believe in the literal, bodily resurrection, where, with quickened senses, amplified powers of perception, and a vastly increased capacity for understanding and happiness, we will continue throughout eternity.<br><br>I am grateful for this marvelous principle of revelation. How discouraging it must be for some of those poor unfortunates who believe that God has retired from business, or that God is dead, or that he has lost interest, or that he will never again speak to his people upon the earth. And what a thrill that I can say, "I believe in all that God has revealed, all that he does now reveal, and I believe that he will yet reveal many great and important things pertaining to the kingdom of God."<br><br>Here's another great Article of Faith: "I believe that through the atonement of Christ all mankind may be saved, by obedience to the laws and ordinances of the gospel." The Son of God came to the earth to take upon himself our sins, and he suffered for our transgression to the point that he sweat great drops of blood at every pore.<br><br>What a thrilling and exciting time, not only to live in this greatest and final of all dispensations, but also to look forward to an eternity of endless progression, of endless association with God, of endless family association, and of endless happiness.<br><br>I heartily congratulate you who are attending this great University. I hope you fully recognize and understand the privileges which are presently yours to form great friendships, acquire constructive attitudes, and learn the great truths of life as you are being born again.<br><br>The moment of growth, like the moment of birth, is frequently an unconscious moment. Sometimes we are being educated the most when we are least aware that the process is taking place. And so we come back again to this important procedure of strengthening our gratitude, as we exclaim with Shakespeare, "Oh God who lends me life, lend me a heart replete with thankfulness." And may God grant that it may be so, I sincerely pray, in the name of Jesus Christ. amen.<br><br><i><i>Sterling W.

<h1>g Thanksgiving Day - Harold Hansen - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
President Oaks, my fellow colleagues, students of Brigham Young University, they say that confession is good for the soul. I don't know what the state of my soul is, but I'm confessing that this frightens me. My students should gain some feeling of security that even the old man can get into trouble!<br><br>As I've been preparing to respond to this invitation to speak, finding it difficult to reach a decision about what I should say, I was reminded of some lines by the great East Indian poet Tagor. "I've spent my days stringing and unstringing my instrument while the song I came to sing remains unsung." I hope for all our sakes that I will not be in that situation today.<br><h2><b>History of Thanksgiving Day</b></h2><br>The human family has always followed the practice of special days to acknowledge God's goodness. So it was that the Plymouth colonists celebrated their second winter spent in the New World. The first dreadful winter in Massachusetts had killed nearly half of the members of the colony, but hope sprang anew the late summer of 1621. The corn harvest brought rejoicing, and the forests and streams were abundant with wild game and fish. The colonists understood the environment better the second season than they had the first. They found that they could harmonize their lives in this cold, bitter climate. Governor William Bradford decreed that December 13, 1621, be set aside as a day of feasting and prayer to demonstrate the gratitude the colonists felt toward God. The women of the colony spent days preparing for the feast. Foods were boiled, baked, and roasted. The children were kept very busy turning roasts on spits or iron rods in front of the open fires. More than eighty Indians attended the feast. The Indians brought wild turkeys and venison as their share. The tables were set outdoors, and all the people sat around the combined tables like one large family. Prayers, sermons, and songs of praise accompanied the feasting. Three days were devoted to the Thanksgiving, and then the Indians returned to the forests and the colonists to their toil.<br><br>Word of the Plymouth celebration traveled to other New England towns and colonies. Then Thanksgiving Day became a custom. Sporadic attempts were made to formulize a special day. In 1789 President George Washington was urged by the Congress to proclaim a national holiday. I was struck forcibly by the content of his message, how aptly it suits today. May I read it:<br><br><i>Whereas, it is the duty of all Nations to acknowledge the Providence of Almighty God, to obey His will, to be grateful for His benefits and humbly to implore His protection and favor; and whereas, both Houses of Congress, have by their joint Committee requested me "to recommend to the people of the United States a day of public thanksgiving and prayer," to be observed by acknowledging with grateful hearts the many and signal favors of Almighty God, especially by affording them an opportunity peaceably to establish a form of government for their safety and happiness.</i><br><br><i>Now, therefore, I do recommend and assign Thursday, the 26th day of November next to be devoted by the people of these States to the service of that great &amp;amp; glorious Being who is the Author of all the good that was, that is, or that will be; that we then all unite in rendering unto Him our service and humble thanks for His kind care and protection of the People of this Country ...; for the signal and manifold mercies and the favorable interpositions of His Providence in the course and conclusion of the late war; for the great degree of tranquility; for the peaceable and rational manner in which we have been enabled to establish constitutions of government for our safety and happiness....</i><br><br><i>And also that we may then unite in most humbly offering our prayers and supplications to the great Lord &amp;amp; Ruler of Nations and beseech Him to pardon our National and other transgressions, to enable us all, whether in public or private stations, to perform our several &amp;amp; relative duties properly and punctually; to render our National Government a blessing to all the people by constantly being a government of wise, just, &amp;amp; constitutional laws, discreetly and faithfully executed &amp;amp; obeyed; to protect &amp;amp; guide all sovereigns &amp;amp; nations and to bless them with good governments, Peace &amp;amp; Concord; to promote the knowledge &amp;amp; practice of true religion &amp;amp; virtue ...; &amp;amp; generally to grant unto all mankind such a degree of temporal Prosperity as He alone knows to be best.</i><br><br>It was a woman, Mrs. Sarah Hale, editor of<i>Godey's Ladies' Book</i>, who spent thirty years promoting the setting of a legal Thanksgiving Day. She wrote and published repeated pleas to the general public and wrote letters to the various presidents. Finally, in 1863, President Lincoln issued a proclamation setting aside the last Thursday of November in that year as a day of thanksgiving and praise to our beneficient Father. It was not until 1941 that Congress finally ruled Thanksgiving Day would be a legal holiday.<br><h2><b>Time for Gratitude</b></h2><br>It's now some 354 years since Governor Bradford decreed a Thanksgiving Day, and I want to ask, "How do we value and deserve and observe this day? Do we remember only the feasting?" I think not. One of the great human sins is ingratitude. Surely we have not grown so cynical that we cannot have the spiritual insight to observe the "prayer and praise" part of the day. Virginia Oliver says: "Thanksgiving is a time for remembering--remembering the good gifts of every day, the countless blessings that are ever ours; for remembering Thanksgiving Days that are past, the memories of families and friends, remembering at each time this day draws near the hearts of mankind, joined in grateful praise."<br><br><i>Did I forget to thank thee, Lord,</i><br><i>For things that may seem small:</i><br><i>A flower by the wayside,</i><br><i>A wild bird's lovely call,</i><br><br><i>For all the daily happenings</i><br><i>That we call commonplace--</i><br><i>For autumn and for sunsets</i><br><i>And a neighbor's smiling face?</i><br><br><i>For life is made of little things,</i><br><i>So let me not forget</i><br><i>To count my smallest blessings,</i><br><i>And before the sun is set,</i><br><br><i>To thank thee, Lord, for every one</i><br><i>That adds a note of cheer,</i><br><i>And our blessings will be multiplied</i><br><i>Before another year.</i><br>[Pauline Stone, "Little Things"]<br><br>The longer we live, the more we realize the blessings that lie in everyday living. Just a few--the marvel of good health, the dearness of home and loved ones, the little treasures that money cannot buy, the wonder of the world of nature, freedom under God, and the bounty which we enjoy in this good land. Thanksgiving is a time to celebrate these and many other blessings. It is a way of life. Let us be thankful that there still is sunshine, that we still can glimpse the blue of the sky and, in our onward way, continue to look up. One of the great characters I remember with affection on this campus when I arrived many years ago was Herald R. Clark. We used to pass early each morning just north of the Joseph Smith Memorial Building. While he was still some twenty yards away from me, he'd call out, "Look up, H. I., look up!" And I'd look toward the east. I'd get things that would fill my soul for an entire day. But I learned something else, that I had been carrying my head down with burdens. He taught me to look up, and it made life just a little sweeter. I want to be thankful for friends with kind smiles, cheerful words. This<i>is</i>a time for grateful thanksgiving. Shakespeare sang, "O Lord, who lends me life, lend me a heart replete with thankfulness."<br><br>As I was looking through the discourses of Brigham Young and noting his words about complainers and grumblers, I thought that maybe it would be appropriate, at least for me, to listen to his challenge. He was speaking about Zion's Camp, en route to Missouri:<br><br><i>We had grumblers,... unruly and discontented spirits. ... Brother Joseph led, counseled and guided the company, and contended against those unruly, evil disposed persons. When we arrived in Missouri, the Lord spoke to his servant Joseph and said, "I have accepted your offering," and we had the privilege to return again. On my return many friends asked me, ... "Who has it benefited? ... If the Lord did command it to be done, what object had he in view of doing so?" ... I then learned that those persons who asked me such questions were weak in faith and, like a faulty column in an edifice, could not bear up under the burden designed to rest upon them. ... I wish this fact to sink into your hearts, that when men or women have doubts, they also have fear; and when they have fear, they are in danger of what? Of themselves. Want of confidence is the parent of moral imbecility and intellectual weakness. Hear it, ye Saints, that man or women that is crowned with crowns of glory, immortality, and eternal lives will never be heard to grumble or complain. I told those brethren that I was well paid--paid with heavy interest--yea that my measure was filled to overflowing with the knowledge that I had received by travelling with the Prophet.</i>[<i>Journal of Discourses</i>, 10:20]<br><br>At this season I have much to be grateful for--the little things, but also the larger gifts that I live within the affection of a caring Church, that that Church teaches me I am individual and personal in the sight of God, and there<i>is</i>opportunity for affection between me and my Father in heaven, and that there is a living prophet who can and will guide and will help to lift the burden of the time. My friends, this is my testimony to you this day, and I bear it in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Harold I.

<h1>l Declare His Generation? - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I have prayed and pondered earnestly to learn what the Lord wants me to say on this occasion. In the early hours of the morning, as I tossed and turned in bed and kept my wife awake, I concluded upon a subject. I shall talk, if I am properly guided by the Spirit, about what I consider in some respects to be the third greatest miracle that has ever occurred in all eternity. This miracle is of such a nature and of such moment that its accomplishment was attended by a heavenly choir, who sang, "Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men" (Luke 2:14). It was attended by an angelic visitant who proclaimed to all of earth's inhabitants that "unto [us] is born this day in the city of David a Savior, which is Christ the Lord" (Luke 2:11). It is clear that, if we are to consider this matter, we need a great outpouring of the Holy Spirit. I need it so that what is said may be expressed discreetly and wisely and in harmony with the mind and will of the Lord, and you need it so that the thoughts expressed will sink into your hearts and you will have a feeling of their eternal verity.<br><h2><b>The Three Greatest Miracles of Eternity</b></h2><br>As I analyze and view the matter, it seems to me that the greatest miracle that ever occurred was the miracle of creation: the fact that God, our Heavenly Father, brought us into being, the fact that we exist; that we were born as his spirit children; and that now we are privileged to abide in mortal tabernacles and partake of a probationary experience.<br><br>It seems to me that the second greatest miracle that has ever occurred, in this or any of God's creations, is the atoning sacrifice of his Son; the fact that he came into the world to ransom men from the temporal and spiritual death brought into existence by the fall of Adam; the fact that he is reconciling us again to God and making immortality and eternal life available to us. This atoning sacrifice of Christ is the greatest thing that has even happened since the creation.<br><br>You probably know that the Prophet was once asked, "What are the fundamental principles of your religion?" He responded:<br><br><i>The fundamental principles of our religion are the testimony of the Apostles and Prophets, concerning Jesus Christ, that He died, was buried, and rose again the third day, and ascended into heaven; all other things which pertain to our religion are only appendages to it.</i>[<i>Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith,</i>p. 121]<br><br>The very heart and core and center of revealed religion is the atoning sacrifice of Christ. All things rest upon it, all things are operative because of it, and without it there would be nothing. Without it the purposes of creation would be void, they would vanish away, there would be neither immortality nor eternal life, and the ultimate destiny of all men would be to become as Lucifer and his followers are.<br><br>The underlying foundation upon which the atoning sacrifice of Christ rests is the doctrine of divine sonship, by which we mean that the Lord Jesus, the firstborn spirit child of the Father, having been foreordained to his mission, was born into this world, on the one hand as the Son of God, inheriting thus from his Father the power of immortality; and that he was born, on the other hand, as the offspring of a mortal women, inheriting from Mary, his mother, the power of mortality. Thus he became the only person who has ever lived who had the power within himself to either live or die as he chose--and therefore the power to work out the infinite and eternal atoning sacrifice upon which all things rest. It seems to me that it would be appropriate on this occasion--as we come into the Christmas period, when we gladly and joyously join with all Christendom in commemorating the traditional day of his birth--for us to talk about the doctrine of his coming into mortality. This is what I consider, in many respects, to be the third greatest miracle of eternity.<br><h2><b>Messianic Texts in the Scriptures</b></h2><br>There are several texts that we might take. One text is the great messianic utterance of Isaiah, which he couched in these simple words: "Who shall declare his generation?" (Isaiah 53:8). This means, "Who will give his genesis? Who will reveal his genealogy? Who will give the source from whence he sprang? Who will announce the divinity of the mortal Messiah?" We might also take another text, and this is one that Jesus himself spoke. He said, "Whose son is he?" This is the context: "What think ye of Christ? whose son is he? They say unto him, the son of David. He saith unto them, How then doth David in spirit call him Lord, saying, The Lord said unto my Lord, sit thou on my right hand till I make thine enemies thy footstool?" (Matthew 22:42–44).<br><br>Whose son is he? Is he the son of a mortal father and a mortal mother? Is he the Son of God? Is he separate and apart from all mankind by virtue of the birth that was his? Who shall declare his generation? We have an account in the New Testament that begins, "The book of the generation of Jesus Christ" (Matthew 1:1). Then Matthew proceeds to outline what appears to be the ancestry of the Lord, but we can't quite figure out how it fits in with other scriptural passages, at least in the form it has come to us. Luke gives another account that does not agree with that in the book of Matthew. We suppose it may be that one of them is a kingly, royal genealogy, intended to indicate his position and place as the one to sit upon the throne of his father, David; the other is possibly a genealogy either of Mary or Joseph--we can't be sure. The commentaries of the world talk about the virgin birth as being "pious fiction." No one, they say, could have been born that way; it was something which Matthew assumed, and so it became a tradition in the early Church. This matter of genealogy, this matter of the birth of our Lord, is at the heart of Christendom. Thanks be to God that by the opening of the heavens and by revelation in our day we have gained an understanding of what is involved. As a result we can put the atoning sacrifice in its proper position and relationship to all things, and then we are in a position to work out our salvation and do the things that we must do if we are to inherit peace and happiness in this life and go on to eternal glory in the life to come.<br><br>Whose son is he? He is the firstborn spirit child of God, our Heavenly Father. There is no possible way to conceive of the genealogy, the genesis, the generation of Christ, without knowing that God our Father is a personal being in whose image we are created; that he has a body of flesh and bones as tangible as man's--the father of the spirits of all men. The Lord Jesus, the great Jehovah, the creator of all things under the Father, is the firstborn of all that spirit host.<br><br>In that premortal life our Father ordained and established a plan of salvation named the gospel of God, which plan was to enable his spirit children, Christ included, to advance and progress and become like him. In that day he issued a great cry, a great proclamation went forth through the councils of eternity, with reference to the Father's plan. He said, "Whom shall I send to be my Son, to work out the infinite and eternal atoning sacrifice? Whom shall I send to be born into mortality, inheriting from me the power of immortality? Whom shall I send to lay down his life for the sins of men and to reconcile fallen man to me?" When that great cry went forth, as you know, there were two volunteers. One stepped forward, the firstborn of the Father, the Lord Jesus, and said, "Here am I. Send me. I will be thy son. I will do thy will. I will follow thy plan, do all things in harmony with that which thou hast ordained." There was another volunteer, and he said, "Here am I, send me, I will be thy son, and I will redeem all mankind, . . . and surely I will do it; wherefore give me thine honor" (Moses 4:1)--that is, "Let me replace you and be exalted and most noble of all the persons who live and are." Well, the decree was issued: "I will send the first" (Abraham 3:27), and that was the day when there was war in heaven, as you know.<br><br>The first volunteer was the Lord Jesus Christ; he then became the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world, the one appointed to come down and do all things needed to put in operation his Father's plan. Now from that day, from the day of creation on, the prophets foretold his coming and ministry. We call these prophetic utterances messianic prophecies, as for instance, "Behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel" (Isaiah 7:14). Or, "For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counselor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace. Of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end, upon the throne of David, and upon his kingdom, to order it, and to establish it with judgment and with justice from henceforth even for ever" (Isaiah 9:6–7).<br><br>How many sermons were preached in ancient Israel on these messianic texts we can only imagine. The most perfect prophecies and the greatest sermons are found in the Book of Mormon. Here is a sermon-prophecy that an angel spoke to a Nephite prophet:<br><br><i>For behold, the time cometh, and is not far distant, that with power, the Lord Omnipotent who reigneth, who was, and is from all eternity to all eternity, shall come down from heaven among the children of men, and shall dwell in a tabernacle of clay, and shall go forth amongst men, working mighty miracles, such as healing the sick, raising the dead, causing the lame to walk, the blind to receive sight, and the deaf to hear, and curing all manner of diseases.</i><br><br><i>And he shall cast out devils, or evil spirits which dwell in the hearts of the children of men.</i><br><br><i>And lo, he shall suffer temptations, and pain of body, hunger, thirst, and fatigue, even more than man can suffer, except it be unto death; for behold, blood cometh from every pore, so great shall be his anguish for the wickedness and the abominations of his people.</i><br><br><i>And he shall be called Jesus Christ, the Son of God, the Father of heaven and earth, the Creator of all things from the beginning; and his mother shall be called Mary.</i>[Mosiah 3:5–8]<br><h2><b>Accounts of the Savior's Birth</b></h2><br>In due course, at the appointed time, in the fulness of the Lord's own time, the Savior was born into the world. Who shall declare his generation? We have attempts made by prophetic writers of old. Matthew says, "Now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise: When as his mother Mary was espoused to Joseph, before they came together, she was found with child of the Holy Ghost" (Matthew 1:18). And then he recites what happened and quotes the prophetic utterance of Isaiah about the virgin birth. Let me read you the kindred passage in the book of Luke, this one spoken by Gabriel to Mary:<br><br><i>The angel said unto her, Fear not, Mary: for thou hast found favor with god.</i><br><br><i>And, behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a son, and shalt call his name Jesus.</i><br><br><i>He shall be great, and shall be called the son of the Highest; and the Lord god shall give him the throne of his father David:</i><br><br><i>And he shall reign over the house of Jacob for ever; and of his kingdom there shall be no end.</i><br><br><i>Then said Mary unto the angel, How shall this be, seeing I know not a man?</i><br><br><i>And the angel answered and said unto her, The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the highest shall over-shadow thee: therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the son of God.</i>[Luke 1:30–35]<br><br>Now I take those two statements--one written by Matthew and the other by Luke--not perhaps perfectly transcribed and recorded for us in their present form, and I add these words spoken by Alma as the Holy Ghost moved upon him. Alma, as we shall see, will tie together what Matthew and Luke have written and give us the accurate and perfect perspective as to the generation of the Lord Jesus. He said:<br><br><i>Repent ye, and prepare the way of the Lord, and walk in his paths, which are straight; for behold, the kingdom of heaven is at hand, and the Son of God cometh upon the face of the earth.</i><br><br><i>And behold, he shall be born of Mary, at Jerusalem, which is the land of our forefathers, she being a virgin, a precious and chosen vessel, who shall be overshadowed and conceived by the power of the Holy Ghost, and bring forth a son, yea, even the Son of God.</i>[Alma 7:9–10]<br><br>Now I shall call your attention to one other passage, and then we shall see if we know the answer to our query, "Who shall declare his generation?" This passage is from that wondrous marvelous vision that Nephi had. He said:<br><br><i>I beheld the city of Nazareth; and in the city of Nazareth I beheld a virgin, and she was exceedingly fair and white.</i><br><br><i>And it came to pass that I saw the heavens open; and an angel came down and stood before me; and he said unto me: Nephi, what beholdest thou?</i><br><br><i>And I said unto him: A virgin, most beautiful and fair above all other virgins.</i><br><br><i>And he said unto me: Knowest thou the condescension of God?</i>[If an angel had asked that of you, what would your answer have been? Nephi was a little hesitant. He knew in part, but not in full.]<br><br><i>And I said unto him: I know that he loveth his children; nevertheless, I do not know the meaning of all things.</i><br><br><i>And he said unto me: Behold, the virgin whom thou seest is the mother of the Son of God, after the manner of the flesh.</i><br><br><i>And it came to pass that I beheld that she was carried away in the Spirit; and after she had been carried away in the Spirit for the space of a time the angel spake unto me again, bearing a child in her arms.</i><br><br><i>And the angel said unto me: Behold the lamb of God, yea, even the Son of the Eternal Father!</i>[1 Nephi 11:13–21]<br><br>Who shall declare his generation? Whose son is he? Well, now it is perfectly clear. On the one hand he is the son of God, the God who said in messianic vein, "thou are my son; this day have I begotten thee" (Psalms 2:7). On the other hand, he is the son of David and the son of Mary. He inherited from his Father the power of immortality and from his mortal ancestors the power of mortality. How do we know this? How can it be established? We are dealing with spiritual things. Matthew says his book is the book of the generation of Jesus Christ, and he records the facts. He says there was a virgin birth; but the whole world--Christians, so-called--contends and is uncertain and has difficult feelings about this passage. Some say, "Yes, he was born of a virgin," and others say, "It was a pious tradition." Then we read the Book of Mormon account, and we discover what the perfect rendition of the doctrine is. Whose son is he and how do you know? Paul said a very impressive thing: "No man can say that Jesus is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghost" (1 Corinthians 12:3). The Prophet improved this by saying: "No man can know that Jesus is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghost."<br><h2><b>Testimony of the Savior's Genealogy</b></h2><br>Who shall declare his generation? Whose son is he? We have been called out of darkness into the marvelous light of Christ. We have been called to the place where the heavens are opened, where the gifts of the Holy Ghost are poured out bounteously, abundantly, upon all the members of the Church who seek the Lord in integrity and uprightness of heart. We have the gifts of the Spirit, we have the gift of revelation, and we know what is involved in these things. Every member of the Church has had the hands of a legal administrator placed upon his head, and the decree issued: "Receive the Holy Ghost." This means that we receive the gift of the Holy Ghost, which is the right to the constant companionship of that member of the Godhead, based on faithfulness.<br><br>Who shall declare his generation? His generation can be declared only by living witnesses who have had the revelation of the Holy Ghost which certifies to their souls that Jesus is the Lord. There is no possible way to know that he is Christ above all, that all power is resident in him, that he is God's Son, except by the process and means of revelation. Peter received a personal revelation as he stood in the presence of the Lord, and it came by the power of the Holy Ghost. He certified, "Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God" (Matthew 16:16), and received a blessing from the Lord for the witness that he had borne.<br><br>Now, if we want to know who is going to declare his generation, the answer is that it is the Latter-day Saints; it is the elders of Israel; it is the prophets and apostles who minister among us; and it is all of those among us who have lived in such a manner that we know by the whisperings of the Holy Ghost to the spirit within us that there is eternal verity, that these things are true. You can be one, as well as I can be one, who declares the generation of Jesus Christ, who gives his genealogy, who comes to know in his heart by a power that is beyond intellectuality, he is the Lord, that God is the Father; and this is the beginning of a course of personal righteousness. Unless and until we know that Jesus is the Lord and that God is his Father, we do not have testimonies of the truth and divinity of the work. In our day a testimony is to know, number one, that Jesus is the Lord, which is the doctrine of the divine sonship. It is to know, number two, that Joseph Smith is a prophet of God and a revealer of the knowledge of Christ and of salvation for us in our day. And it is, number three, to know that The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is the only true and living church upon the face of the whole earth.<br><br>Now, I am just one among you. There are thousands of us here congregated in the spirit of worship. I have been speaking and you listening, and the Spirit of the Lord has been present. I have given utterance to truths that are eternal, that will endure to all ages, that are the great foundation upon which the cause of truth and righteousness rests. Those truths have sunk into the hearts of all of you who have been endowed with the same Spirit, and you know as I know that they are true.<br><br>Now, in conclusion, I, acting as voice, as mouth as it were for you, declare the generation of the Lord Jesus, his genesis, the source from which he sprang: He is God's son. He was born into this world after the manner of the flesh, with God as his father and Mary as his mother, inheriting the powers of mortality and immortality thereby. He was thus able to work out the infinite and eternal atoning sacrifice. He was thus able to bow in that garden outside Jerusalem's walls, that garden called Gethsemane, and take upon himself the sins of all men on conditions of repentance. That act is the greatest miracle of all time since the miracle of creation, and underlying it is the event which we celebrate with the world this coming season, the birth of our Lord into mortality. Is it any wonder that angelic choir sang, "Glory to God on high, and peace to men"? That is the message we proclaim at this season, and we do it with a sure knowledge whereof we speak, and in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Bruce R.

<h1> at ChristmasTime - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I think when I received the assignment to come here I still had visions of College Hall. I don't know that I've been at an assembly at Brigham Young University since. It's quite overpowering.<br><br>I don't know whether I should say this or not, in view of the black-and-white-clothes brigade over there, but in our experience with missionaries we had the custom of assigning those who arrived newly in the field to speak at a street meeting on the evening of their first day in the mission field. Their usual reaction was to shudder with the feeling that the most fearsome thing that could happen to them while they were on their missions was about to happen. My feelings tonight are quite similar. Of all the things I've watched General Authorities do, this matter of standing to speak in public before ten thousand people has loomed as one of the most awesome and frightening. I'm sustained with the thought that, within thirty or forty minutes from now, whatever it is that's going to take place here will already have happened.<br><br>Before we came President Brown mentioned that the Lord would bless me, and I told him I felt how much I needed it. It reminded me of a day when I was yet in the Aaronic Priesthood, attending a special gathering of this group in our stake. One of the groups stood up and sang a song about their bishop. I believe his name was Bishop Diamond, and they said, "Here is Bishop Diamond. He's with us tonight. He's with us, God bless him. God bless him, he needs it."<br><br>Tonight is the seventh of December. My thoughts come back to the feeling, whenever this day rolls around, that all of us who are old enough reflect back on what we were doing when the news burst upon us of the Attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941. That day the lights began to go out in our country. It was a terrible feeling. The lights had already largely gone out throughout Europe, and subsequently we all passed through a period of terrible travail before the lights came back on again. We used to sing a song in those days--"When the Lights Come on Again All over the World."<br><br>Today my generation can give some hope to yours if you are troubled by the dark and gloomy prospects that sometimes appear in our future. The preceding generation has given us the feeling that there really<i>is</i>light ahead. This can and ought to be an optimistic world.<br><h2><b>The Christmas Season</b></h2><br>Now, in spirit this season is a time of light. For us who live in this hemisphere it's the darkest time of all the year, but this is never apparent when Christmastime rolls around. Since this is your last fireside before the Christmas vacation, I'm sure--together with the great music that we've already participated in--we can usher in the Christmas season tonight.<br><br>The spirit begins to soar as the soul awakens to festivity. At BYU, classes begin to lose their interest. Other thoughts start to come into focus--going home to family, to your friends and your loved ones, engagement rings, and other things. Tradition and custom have built Christmas into a wonderful experience. And it's a great time to remember. To children throughout the world it's a time for Santa Claus. To the followers of Christ it's the greatest festival of the year, for we are told that "there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved" (Acts 4:12). And herein we remember the central figure of the entire universe, the promised Savior and the Redeemer.<br><h2><b>Faith in Christ</b></h2><br>We've been taught to say in the Church that faith is the first principle of the gospel. Then we're reminded that faith is the moving cause of all action; often we're referred to the farmer who plants his crops motivated by faith, and so on.<br><br>Let me now state that faith is<i>not</i>the first principle of the gospel. The first principle of the gospel is faith<i>in the Lord Jesus Christ.</i>There is a great difference. Any unbelieving farmer can plant in faith, but to believe in Jesus Christ is something else. There's been no witnessed or authenticated event in all history that can compare to the coming to earth of Jesus Christ. It's good for university students who engross themselves in gathering facts to remember this point. He spoke as our God, by way of prophecy, about the nature of his coming. To Samuel the Lamanite he gave the prediction of heavenly manifestations. And then to Nephi, the contemporary of the Savior who was a prophet here in America, he said, "Lift up your head and be of good cheer; for behold, the time is at hand, and on this night shall the sign be given, and on the morrow come I into the world" (3 Nephi 1:13). You really can't have a Christmas without referring to that uplifting story as recorded in Saint Luke:<br><br><i>And so it was, that, while they were there, the days were accomplished that she should be delivered.</i><br><br><i>And she brought forth her first-born son, and wrapped him in swaddling clothes, and laid him in a manger; because there was no room for them in the inn.</i><br><br><i>And there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field, keeping watch over their flocks by night.</i><br><br><i>And, lo, the angel of the Lord came upon them, and the glory of the Lord shone round about them: and they were sore afraid.</i><br><br><i>And the angel said unto them, Fear not: for, behold I bring good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people.</i><br><br><i>For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Saviour, which is Christ the Lord.</i><br><br><i>And this shall be a sign unto you; ye shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes, lying in a manger.</i><br><br><i>And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God, and saying,</i><br><br><i>Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men.</i>[Luke 2:6–14]<br><br>Have you ever listened to that story in a sacred setting without feeling the spiritual assurance that this event actually took place? This heavenly influence of which the angels told, we all now feel right here this moment through the power of the Holy Ghost, which witnesses again to us--as it has done for nearly two thousand years--that the birth of the Lord is real. Its significance transcends every other event in the history of the world since the Creation. In his unsurpassed oratorio,<i>The Messiah</i>, George Frideric Handel quotes from the divine announcements and the injunctions which surround the hallowed life of Jesus Christ. Of his<i>destiny</i>we sing: "For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, The mighty God, the everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace" (Isaiah 9:6). Of his<i>mission</i>: "Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls" (Matthew 11:28–29). Of the<i>Atonement:</i>"All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one to his own way; and the Lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all" (Isaiah 53:6). Of his<i>glorification</i>: "The kingdoms of this world are become the kingdoms of our Lord, and of his Christ; and he shall reign for ever and ever" (Revelation 11:15).<br><h2><b>The Atonement</b></h2><br>Throughout the years of my life I have heard how Christ died for us. This concept has always been a little abstract to me. How could I get the feeling of just what he did and how it was accomplished and its significance? The understanding came much better into focus two years ago at a Christmas gathering when one of our dear friends told of his experience during the Second World War. He was serving in the South Pacific when the commander of his unit ordered for the following day a special reconnaissance mission for John's detachment. John said, "I shuddered at the thought of this assignment, for I knew from experience that it would be useless and foolish. There was no valuable purpose to be attained by it. It would be very dangerous, and I felt almost certainly that, if I went, I along with others would be killed. I prayed that night with great earnestness, explaining to the Lord how I wanted to devote my life to his purposes. I didn't want to lose my life in some useless, fruitless mission. I wanted to return home safely and fulfill my destiny in the earth--to find my wife and raise a family in the gospel. The Lord heard my prayer. In the morning I was afflicted with a fever. I wasn't very ill but ill enough that I was relieved from the mission, with another being sent in my stead." As he had foreseen, the mission was a disaster and his replacement, together with a number of others, was killed. Then John said, "I really began to think. This man had given his life for me. Whenever I rejoice in the blessings of my life I now remember him. The gifts of my wife, my children, my grandchildren, my whole blessed life on this earth were bought for me at the sacrifice of the life of that man who took my place. It was unavoidable, of course, in this case, but nevertheless very real."<br><br>Of such a nature, but even more infinite, was the sacrifice of the Savior in our behalf. Were it not for him--the life he lived and the atonement he wrought--we would all be without hope of continued happiness and of the blessings of exaltation, and we would be in a way to suffer grievous penalties and disasters which make life utterly unbearable. What would this world be like without the Savior? Even the profane man would have an inadequate basis from which to launch his oath. What would life be like with Christmas? From infancy it has been the symbol of our most enthralling moments.<br><br>In recent times we have had the means to project the witness we bear beyond our own society. Especially in our general conferences we begin to hear with more emphasis the statement of the fact that the prophet of this Church is not the prophet merely to the members of the Church, but indeed he is the Lord's prophet to the entire world. To every Latter-day Saint, of course, this is entirely logical; for we know that through the restoration of the gospel, with the accompanying authority of the holy priesthood, the message of salvation is now made available to all nations as rapidly as we can gain access into them. This again is a fulfillment of numerous prophecies of olden times.<br><br>The knowledge of these recent works of God among his children enables us to teach again what was fully understood among the original disciples of the Savior. Even though many inhabitants of the world now disclaim the validity of the basic principles of Christianity, there was no such doubt in the minds of Peter and of early apostles. They knew, and their every word proclaimed, that Jesus was the Redeemer, not only for the Jews, but also for all men on the face of the earth.<br><br>Recently Sister Bangerter and I had the privilege of passing over Mars' Hill in Athens, where Paul set forth in clarity the doctrine that all people everywhere come under the plan of God for salvation. As it says in the Book of Acts:<br><br><i>Then Paul stood in the midst of Mars' hill, and said, Ye men of Athens, I perceive that in all things ye are too superstitious.</i><br><br><i>For as I passed by, and beheld your devotions, I found an altar with this inscription: TO THE UNKNOWN GOD. Whom therefore ye ignorantly worship, him declare I unto you.</i><br><br><i>God that made the world and all things therein, seeing that he is Lord of heaven and earth, dwelleth not in temples made with hands;</i><br><br><i>Neither is worshipped with men's hands, as though he needed any thing, seeing he giveth to all life, and breath, and all things;</i><br><br><i>And hath made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on all the face of the earth, and hath determined the times before appointed, and the bounds of their habitation;</i><br><br><i>That they should seek the Lord, if haply they might feel after him, and find him, though he be not far from every one of us:</i><br><br><i>For in him we live, and move, and have our being. . . . For we are also his offspring.</i><br><br><i>Forasmuch then as we are the offspring of God, we ought not to think that the Godhead is like unto gold, or silver, or stone, graven by art and man's device.</i><br><br><i>And the times of this ignorance God winked at; but now commandeth all men every where to repent:</i><br><br><i>Because he hath appointed a day, in the which he will judge the world in righteousness by that man whom he hath ordained; whereof he hath given assurance unto all men in that he hath raised him from the dead.</i>[Acts 17:22–31]<br><h2><b>Gospel Truths Versus Worldly Beliefs</b></h2><br>There is quite a difference between the belief of the gospel and the belief of the world. To make a brief comparison, the gospel teaches us that he lives, that God our Father made us. The world tends to say we made God. The gospel says Christ is the literal son of God. The world says he was just a man, perhaps a great one. The gospel says he is resurrected and lives above. The world says he is dead and his resurrection is a myth. The gospel says his words are eternal truth. The world says his excellent teachings have meaning only as they relate to how we want to live. The gospel says that sin is spiritual death. The world says there is neither sin nor spirit. The gospel says love is eternal. The world says love is for convenience. The gospel says we will be judged upon principles of good and evil. The world says good and evil are relative and there is no devil. The gospel says we will live again. The world says that when you're dead, you're dead, and that God is dead. And the gospel says to serve God and your fellowman. And the world says to enjoy what comes for your own satisfaction.<br><br>I suppose it could be assumed that these worldly ideas have just recently been thought up. No greater fallacy exists. History is loaded with examples of how these same old ideas have been carried on throughout all ages, and every generation that digs them up has eventually led itself into times of destruction. In the Doctrine and Covenants we are told that "they seek not the Lord to establish his righteousness, but every man walketh in his own way, and after the image of his own God, whose image is in the likeness of the world, and whose substance is that of an idol" (D&amp;amp;C 1:16).<br><br>Among the greatest lies that we have heard are those that there was an evolution of the concept of only one god, and this is often attributed to Moses. If you go into the background of it, you find that no one who has ever studied a nickel's worth about Moses can ever imagine that he dug up the idea of one God. Moses, when he was called by the voice out of the burning bush, stepped forward, approached that holy place, and he heard the voice. I think it may be more vivid if you recall what you have seen in the movie<i>The Ten Commandments.</i>As he approached the bush, he heard the voice which said, "Moses, Moses . . . put off thy shoes from off thy feet, for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground" (Exodus 3:5). Then, as Moses conversed with the Lord, he was commanded to go back into Egypt and deliver the children of Israel. He gave every excuse he could think of, but finally he said, "I don't even know your name. When I go back, who shall I say sent me?"<br><br>And the Lord spoke again and said, "Say to the children of Israel "I Am" sent you. I Am that I Am." (see Exodus 3:14.) Have you ever thought deeply of the significance of those words? You'll realize where the idea came from that there was one God.<br><br>As we review this film,<i>The Ten Command-ments,</i>we remember much of the fictitious part. It showed how, after Moses had brought forth the various plagues upon Egypt, the son of Pharaoh was smitten in death, as were the families of all the Egyptians. In the film Pharaoh took his young son in his arms and approached his god, who stood there, an idol in the form of a great beast. It's still impressive to me how he pled to his god to bring his son back to life. In spite of all his prayers, his god stood and looked at him as dumb as he was in the beginning. Then Pharaoh's wife, who in fiction had at one time been in love with Moses, said to her husband, "Go out and find these people and kill Moses." So Pharaoh pursued with his armies who met with destruction. Finally he returned to his household.<br><br>His wife said, "Well, what happened? Did you find him? Did you kill him?<br><br>He said, "No, I couldn't kill him."<br><br>She said, "Why?"<br><br>"Because his God is God." That testimony is in the depths of the meaning of "I Am."<br><br>Another of the great lies is that chastity is puritanical or victorian. All around us we hear excuses made for licentiousness and immorality on the basis that chastity is just a faded-out, worn-out idea. This fallacy is evident to anybody who ever read a book, because the principles of righteousness or morality were embodied in truth long before Jesus Christ came on earth. He had taught them throughout the ages of earth to the ancient prophets, and they have always been the way of the Lord.<br><br>Another false idea that comes to us more frequently now is the perversion that we're witnessing in marriage, in the home, and in the family. There is a philosophy that these principles have no depth and meaning. to any true Latter-day Saint who bases his principles on Jesus Christ, there is no question that these are eternal values which the gospel teaches us. The gospel of Jesus Christ is the narrow way: "Enter ye in at the strait gate: for wide is the gate, and broad is the way, that leadeth to destruction, and many there be which go in thereat: Because strait is the gate, and narrow is the way, which leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it" (Matthew 7:13–14).<br><br>Elder Packer has pointed out that because of this declaration many people in the world have lost faith in the truth. They say, "Surely there must be other ways. This is very restrictive. It wouldn't even be fair." And so various religions and other doctrines have crept in and supposed that god didn't really mean what he said, that mankind might find a way to salvation aside from the name of Jesus Christ, that maybe there are other names and other ways to salvation. They have made adjustments in their faith, in spite of all that God has said. For all these reasons we find ourselves now as the true witnesses of Jesus Christ. We are called to live in the world but to become spiritually out of the world and "stand as witnesses," as Alma said, "of God at all times and in all things, and in all places that ye may be in, even until death, that ye may be redeemed of God" (Mosiah 18:9).<br><h2><b>Demonstrations of Faith</b></h2><br>I had an interesting experience two or three years ago as I was assigned to the West Texas Region. The stake president there had a son who played football in high school, and I'd like to tell you that in Texas they take their football seriously. They take Texas seriously, as a matter of fact, and I learned many things there. From the stake president I actually learned that George Washington was really born in Texas. The story was that one morning his father, who had planted a nice pecan orchard, had given George a little hatchet for his birthday present. Later he went out and found that one of his trees had been chopped down. He said to George, "Did you chop down the pecan tree?"<br><br>George said, "Oh, Father, I cannot tell a lie. I chopped it down with my little hatchet." That's supposedly when they moved to Virginia because his father said that anybody who can't tell a lie has no business living in Texas.<br><br>I hope that story won't be a reflection on Texas, because I recognize it as a truly marvelous place. But they do take their football seriously. I happened to attend a game with the stake president where his son played in one of the quarter-final games for the state championship. (They eventually won the state.) I noticed an interesting thing before the game: both teams came out on the field, knelt down, and had prayer. You have to understand that Texas is in what is sometimes called the Bible Belt. There are many Baptists and Disciples of Christ, and it's not uncommon to find towns in Texas that close entirely on Sunday and bar the sale of liquor, even though they're not Mormon communities.<br><br>Well, our team won the game, and after the game the other team didn't have much to pray about. Our team again knelt down on the field and had another prayer, and before they prayed all the high school students in the stands poured out on the field and joined the team. They covered nearly a fourth of the field, and they all joined in that prayer. I thought it was an impressive example. I can't tell you how sincere they were, but I would assume that they meant what they were doing and they were grateful for their blessings.<br><br>We may not necessarily use that means to demonstrate our faith in Christ, but we ought not to be behind others in our positions as true witnesses of the Lord Jesus Christ. Why should we not become the greatest witnesses in all the world of the Lord Jesus Christ? Valiance takes effort and character. Returned missionaries who forget and become entrapped in sin have failed the trust. Married people in the Church who refuse to learn and live the gospel of loving one another have also failed. These are very true challenges; they are conditions that surround us increasingly all the time.<br><br>One night about a year ago in a hotel in Lisbon, Portugal, I was by myself and found out what it means to suffer "jet lag." (You cross part of the way around the world, and when it's time to sleep you're not sleepy.) So as I went to sleep at 10:30, being tired, I woke up at 11:30 and couldn't go back to sleep. It was a wonderful opportunity for me to do some reading, because usually when I read it puts me to sleep. But I had the experience of reading extensively that night. Out of the eleventh chapter of 3 Nephi, the Savior in his visit to America declared:<br><br><i>And this is my doctrine, and it is the doctrine which the Father hath given unto me. . . .</i><br><br><i>And whoso believeth in me, and is baptized, the same shall be saved; and they are they who shall inherit the kingdom of God.</i><br><br><i>And whoso believeth not in me, and is not baptized, shall be damned. . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . and whoso believeth in me believeth in the Father also; and unto him will the Father bear record of me, for he will visit him with fire and with the Holy Ghost.</i>[3 Nephi 11:32–35]<br><br>As I read those passages I felt the truth of them by the power of the Holy Ghost, which came to me and bore witness to me that this was truly the doctrine of our Father in heaven and Jesus Christ, his Son.<br><h2><b>Testimony of the Book of Mormon</b></h2><br>You can know of the divinity of the Savior. No doubt many of you, perhaps almost all of you, know. You have a promise. We are all, I suppose, aware of the promise in the Book of Mormon wherein it states: "And when ye shall receive these things [that are written in that book], I would exhort you that ye would ask God, the Eternal Father, in the name of Christ, if these things are not true; and if ye shall ask with a sincere heart, with real intent, having faith in Christ, he will manifest the truth of it unto you, by the power of the Holy Ghost" (Moroni 10:4).<br><br>The occasion I referred to was not the first time I have felt the witness and the assuring power of the Holy Ghost about the truth of that great book, but there is a way to read that book so that you get the testimony. I remember Elder McConkie, when he was presiding over a mission in Australia, quoted this promise to a gathering that he was instructing. In the group were two Protestant ministers. One of the men arose and said, "That promise is not true."<br><br>Elder McConkie said, "How do you know it's not true?"<br><br>He said, "Because I tried it. I read the book and then I asked."<br><br>Elder McConkie said, "Well, how did you ask?"<br><br>"I said in my prayer, 'O God, if this book be true, please strike me dead.' It didn't happen, so obviously the book isn't true."<br><br>Elder McConkie said, "I explained to him as carefully as you can, and still be a Christian gentleman, about what it says about the way you should read the book. Of course, he hadn't complied."<br><br>When you come to the point of needing that testimony, take the book as a sacred thing. Before you begin to read it, kneel down and ask God if he will guide you in your study and add to you the testimony and witness of the truth of what you read. Then when you put it down each time, kneel again and ask him to assure you and indicate to you if what you've read is true or not. I'm sure that you can't go halfway through the book before you'll know through the power of the Holy Ghost that it is really true. This is what the Lord refers to as the "new covenant" of the Book of Mormon. In the Doctrine and Covenants he said that the Church was under condemnation because they had not kept the new covenant, but they said to the Lord that his promises were not true (see D&amp;amp;C 84:55–57). If we say that the Lord doesn't keep his promises, it's purely because we haven't kept his covenant, which is to read the book on the basis of what I've indicated and to come to an understanding of it. If we do so, then he's obligated by covenant to give us the answer to our prayers and to give us the assurance of the divinity of this new witness for Jesus Christ which we proclaim to all the world.<br><br>I want to tell you that I have a testimony that Jesus is the Christ. At this time I do rejoice in the wonderful event that we commemorate, in the excitement that comes to our children and the uplifting thrills that continue to return to me year after year in the realization that the Savior really was born. The camels and the angels and the manger and the animals and all the rest are vivid and vital and very clear and true to me. They're not true just because I've listened to a legend. They're true because the Spirit of our Father in heaven through the Holy Ghost has touched me and given me the testimony of the birth of his Son Jesus Christ on the earth. To him we are obligated to give service throughout our lives as members of the Church of Jesus Christ. May we do so I pray in the name of the Lord Jesus. Amen.<br><br><i><i>W.
