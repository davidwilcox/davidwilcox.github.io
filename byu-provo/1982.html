<h1> the Way; and There Is None Other Way” - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
My brothers and sisters, I come to you this evening with the desire that I can talk to you with plainness. Six years ago, as a new General Authority, I was asked to come to BYU and speak at a fireside in a setting similar to this one. I can remember at that time just looking at the missionaries. We have fifteen hundred here tonight who will be serving all over the world, and I want to give you my love and the love of the Brethren for the great example of you elders and sisters who will soon go out from here.<br><br>About a week before that fireside six years ago I received a call from a young lady at BYU who asked where my typed talk was, and I, being new at this, said, "Well, I think that I'll just come down and talk at the fireside. I would prefer not to have a prepared talk. That isn't my style."<br><br>My secretary, Sister Hansen, came to me just a few days before the date and said, "Elder Hales, you should have a talk. You really shouldn't go down there without a talk."<br><br>I said, "Well, if you think so."<br><br>I received another call from the university, so I prepared a talk and decided that I would not worry about it anymore. Then they called and asked if my talk was ready. I said, "I've prepared a talk, but what I'd really like to do when I come down is to talk informally, maybe just sit on a table and talk to the students."<br><br>There was no reply on the phone. We came to the Marriott Center and went into the Cougar Club for our punch and cookies. I met the people who were there and thought, "My, isn't this a nice group?" It was a sizable group, and I thought it was the fireside. We finished our punch and cookies, and I said a few words to those in attendance. It was the easiest fireside I'd ever had!<br><br>Then they led me through one corridor downstairs, past several doors, and through the entrance, and I faced what is affectionately called the arena--feeling what the Christians must have felt in similar circumstances. The young lady who had coordinated my visit walked beside me and, with a twinkle in her eye, asked, "Elder Hales, do you still want the table?"<br><br>I learned a lesson from that. I asked myself, "How did I get myself into this situation?" And that's going to be the subject I want to talk to you about tonight. I'm not here to talk about the gospel of Jesus Christ in terms of the principles as though you do not know who you are. I know you know who you are, but I'm also aware that some of you have forgotten. Sometimes you make a few mistakes because you don't remember who you are. So this evening, despite the thousands assembled and the ever-present media, I want to talk to you informally--one to one--and let you judge for yourself. Have you forgotten who you are? And are you acting accordingly?<br><br>In this regard I'd like to ask the question, How do you feel the Lord would have you live? Please keep that one question in your mind as we talk. I haven't come to try to tell you how to live, but rather to have you question yourself. I do not want to give you external things; I want internal things to happen this evening. You are Latter-day Saints. You are sons and daughters of God. You are of an eternal nature. You know the mysteries of God: where you came from, why you are here, and where you're going. I needn't go over the details of that.<br><br>But, I do want to ask you one other question: "When you are in the company of others, are you their friend?" and I'm going to talk a little bit tonight about what a friend is. As we look at this I'd like to ask you, "With the knowledge you have, do you realize that you are different from any other people in the whole world?"<br><br>At the conclusion of this evening, I hope it will not be as it was for Alma and Amulek as Alma described in his fourteenth chapter.<br><br><i>After he had made an end of speaking unto the people many of them did believe on his words, and began to repent, and to search the scriptures.</i><br><br><i>But the more part of them were desirous that they might destroy Alma and Amulek; for they were angry with Alma, because of the plainness of his words.</i>[Alma 14:1–2]<br><br>I want to talk plainly with you, and at the end of this evening would hope you will believe in my words and the words of the prophets which I am going to speak to you. I want you to know of my love and the love and concern of the Brethren for you. You will not realize your potential without prayer, study, obedience, and diligence. We'll also talk about that this evening.<br><h2><b>Your Score Card</b></h2><br>Perhaps we can be helped by a story about Johnny Miller, who recently won $500,000 in a one-million-dollar golf tournament, the first of its kind in the world. Several years ago he came to speak to the missionaries and youth in London. The year before that he was the British Open champion. He came as a champion; he spoke as a champion.<br><br>The next year Johnny Miller came to speak to us again. He had missed the cut on the second round of the tournament, and the headlines in the London papers and throughout the world revealed that the champion had not made it to the finals. Now he faced another group of missionaries and young people, and he had a hard time deciding whether he could make it. Like the champion he is, he decided to come. He stood and, gripping the sides of the podium, trembled all over. The first words he said were of great courage: "I don't know why you feel you can go through life without a score card." And then he proceeded to give his testimony of the gospel of Jesus Christ and to talk about our score cards of life.<br><br>Many of you here tonight have a score card. It is the BYU Code of Honor. I'd like to review it with you to remind you once again who you are and that you should act accordingly.<br><br>First of all, when you came to this institution, you agreed that you were desirous to observe the following Code of Honor, and you made a contract saying that you would abide by these rules. Let's review them quickly.<br><br>First, you said you would abide by the standards of Christian living taught by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, which means to love one another, to help one another. That Christian living is summarized by my sweetheart, my dear Mary, in teaching our family--her husband and her two boys--with a simple phrase, "Thee lift me, and I'll lift thee, and we'll ascend together." I ask you this evening, "Are you lifting one another? Are you ascending? When people are down, do you pick them up?"<br><br>Second, be honest in all behavior.<br><br>Third, respect personal rights. I might say that means both mind and body and to be courteous and to remember who you are.<br><br>Fourth, respect personal property.<br><br>Fifth, obey, honor, and sustain the law.<br><br>Sixth, avoid drug abuse.<br><br>Seventh, comply with all college and university regulations.<br><br>Eighth, obey the Word of Wisdom.<br><br>Ninth, live the law of chastity. The reason you learn to live that law here is to prepare you to live the law of fidelity after marriage. It is the same law; it is the same principle. If you will learn it here, you will have eternal families and return to the presence of God the Father. Would you listen to the voice within you when it comes to living the law of chastity? You don't need to be given a lot of details of what is proper in the dating relationship. But I can tell you this: if you have any doubts or questions in your mind of what the Lord expects of you, or if you are asking those kinds of questions, you probably already have your answer.<br><br>I can give you a very simple illustration on the law of chastity. Write down the word<i>compassion</i>. Compassion is of the Lord; it's service given and rendered; it's vicariously feeling the hurt and the suffering, the loneliness, the depression of others. When you draw a line down the word<i>compassion</i>so that<i>passion</i>is shown, remember that you will cross the line from compassion to passion when you touch each other improperly, and you will know when you cross that line.<br><br>Passion is Satan's way of deceiving us into crossing that line and touching someone improperly. You can also draw another line and you'll see c-o-m-p, companion. Stay true to your companion--for those of you who are going into the mission field as elders and sisters--and you will not err. And those of us who have been married for time and all eternity, if we will listen to our companions, we will remain true and faithful. Remember that observing the law of chastity depends a great deal on not touching and not engaging in improper actions.<br><br>The next requirement of the code is to observe a high standard of taste and decency.<br><br>The eleventh, to observe prescribed standards of dress and grooming. Here, once again, ask yourselves, in terms of being dressed with taste and decency and within the prescribed standards, "For what purpose am I dressed this day?" If it is to attract someone else, then you have your answer.<br><br>Number twelve, help others fulfill their responsibilities under this code. These codes and ethics are going to remain constant. If I can give you a concept now which you can think about through the remainder of this talk, I think it will help you a great deal.<br><h2><b>Constancy Amid Change</b></h2><br>Thirty years ago, let's say the Church was placed here, and the world was here [opposite sides of the podium], and there was a very short distance between where the world was and where the Church standards were. The world has gone far afield; it has proceeded way, way out, all the way out of this Marriott Center. We may have a tendency to remember where the world was and where the world is now and see the great gap or disparity and then want the Church to drift along and still keep a similar distance from where the world is. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and its principles will remain constant in terms of temporal and spiritual and moral things. What we and our children and our grandchildren have to remember is that the Church will remain constant, and the world will keep moving--that gap is going to become wider and wider. The simple concept is true: the world will continue moving; the Church will remain constant. Therefore, be very careful. If you judge your actions and the standards of the Church on the basis of where the world is and where it's going, you will find that you are not where you should be.<br><h2><b>Antichrist</b></h2><br>Now, to help you with this, I want to talk from the scriptures about antichrist. That's a hard word. It may help you if I give you a couple of examples of what I mean. Basically what I'm asking is this: "How do you identify those around you who appear faithful but will lead you astray?" How does John describe these people? (I also use the Bible dictionary.)<i>Antichrist</i>was a word used by the apostle John to describe one who assumes the guise of a Christian but in reality is opposed to Christ. That would be including nonmembers as well as members or priesthood holders. In a broader sense it is anyone or anything that counterfeits the true gospel or plan of salvation. Therefore, it means anyone who will prevent you from obtaining eternal life and who openly or secretly is set in opposition to Jesus Christ. The great antichrist is Lucifer, but he has many assistants, both spirit beings and mortals.<br><br>We sometimes think of Peter when he denied Christ, but he didn't deny him as the Savior; he merely denied his association with him because of fear of what he thought was going to happen to him with his peer group. And that's what happens with many of us. We are often afraid when we don't know what is going to happen, and it has always puzzled me that anyone can have more fear of man than of God. We can learn from the scriptures as John recorded,<br><br><i>Even now are there many antichrists; whereby we know that it is the last time.</i>[1 John 2:18]<br><br>We will have many antichrists among us from within the Church. President Lee used to constantly tell us that the greatest danger to the Church was internal, not external.<br><br>The teachings of the prophets are very helpful. We can clearly understand the simple teaching given by Jacob to Sherem. Jacob dealt with Sherem who preached among the people that there would be no Christ. Sherem flattered the people; he was learned. This is true of all such men who take these positions. He had perfect knowledge of the language and the people. He spoke with much power of speech according to the power of the devil. Sherem sought out Jacob. Isn't it interesting how those who are faithful are always sought out? That's the challenge. The adversary wants every one of us in this assembly more than anyone else in the world, and don't ever forget it.<br><br>In the book of Job the Lord asked the devil when he came before him, "Where have you been?"<br><br>He said, "Going to and fro in the earth" (Job 1:7). Don't ever forget that. Sherem sought out Jacob because he preached the gospel and doctrine of Christ. Sherem told Jacob that no man knoweth what would transpire many hundreds of years hence; no man knoweth such things for he cannot tell or prophesy of things to come. Be careful of those who tell you there is no such thing as prophecy or revelation.<br><br>The Lord God poured his Spirit into Jacob, who bore his testimony, and it confounded Sherem. There's a lesson here: when in doubt, bear your testimony.<br><br>Jacob said:<br><br><i>Deniest thou the Christ who shall come? And he said: If there should be a Christ, I would not deny him; but I know that there is no Christ, neither has been, nor ever will be.</i><br><br>Then Jacob asked a simple question:<br><br><i>Believest thou the scriptures? And he said, Yea.</i><br><br>Jacob testified to him:<br><br><i>Then ye do not understand them; for they truly testify of Christ. Behold, I say unto you that none of the prophets have written, nor prophesied, save they have spoken concerning this Christ. ... It has been made manifest to me, for I have heard and seen; and it also has been made manifest unto me by the power of the Holy Ghost; wherefore, I know if there should be no atonement made all mankind must be lost.</i>[Jacob 7:9–12]<br><br>Do you understand what happens when one denies Christ and revelation? It takes away repentance; it takes away forgiveness. It means that once you have made a mistake, you can never come back into fellowship in the Church. There is no hope. Be careful of those around you who would take hope and faith in the Lord Jesus Christ away from you.<br><br>Sherem replied to Jacob's testimony--the next thing you'll be asked--"Show me a sign." He wanted a sign "by this power of the Holy Ghost," he said, "in the which you know so much." Jacob replied that he would not tempt God for a sign shown to Sherem. He said, "Thou wilt deny it because thou art of the devil." Nevertheless Jacob appealed to the Lord and said, "Thy will, O Lord, be done, and not mine." As Jacob concluded, the power of the Lord came upon Sherem, and he fell to the earth. He was nourished for many days, and he then wanted to repent. He gathered the people around him with the desire to speak to them before he died. This is what he said:<br><br><i>He spoke plainly unto them and denied the things which he had taught them, and confessed the Christ, and the power of the Holy Ghost, and the ministering of angels.</i><br><br><i>And he spake plainly unto them, that he had been deceived by the power of the devil. And he spake of hell, and of eternity, and of eternal punishment.</i><br><br><i>And he said: I fear lest I have committed the unpardonable sin, for I have lied unto God; for I denied the Christ, and said that I believed the scriptures; and they testify of him. And because I have thus lied unto God I greatly fear lest my case shall be awful; but I confess unto God.</i><br><br><i>And ... when he had said these words he could say no more, and he gave up the ghost.</i>[Jacob 7:17–20]<br><br>I hope that our testimonies are much like that of Jacob talking to Sherem.<br><h2><b>Pilot Error--Loss of Perspective</b></h2><br>I've often wondered why we sometimes lose our eternal perspective. I read a survey by Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, which is called, "the Harvard of the air." They submitted a report to the Federal Aviation Administration, and in 1980 it was recorded in the<i>Stars and Stripes</i>so that the servicemen could learn from the results. The Embry-Riddle people did studies on seven hundred airplane accidents involving small private airplanes as well as large commercial ones. In 95 percent of the cases the accidents involving these aircraft had nothing to do with equipment failure or with lack of proper training and skills. Rather, they were caused by pilot error.<br><br>The accidents caused by pilot error were divided into five categories. If you can understand these, then you can understand what can happen in your life. The first, invulnerability. The pilot, the young man or woman, says, "I can do something dangerous and not get hurt." It's the equivalent of running down the football field to see how close to the sideline you can come and bring up just a little chalk dust. Invulnerability: "I can go to the disco; I can associate with certain kinds of people; I can listen to certain kinds of music; I can read certain kinds of literature; I can go to certain kinds of movies; I can handle that." You can't. Be very careful with invulnerability. In the dating relationship how far do you go? What do you do? Be very careful with invulnerability, and it applies to Elder Hales as well as to everyone else who is here.<br><br>Second, macho. This is a pilot saying, "This is going to make a bigger guy of me." The researchers told in this article of a pilot who buzzed a pickup truck, and the second time he hit the pickup truck and wiped out his airplane and the truck. Fortunately there were no lives lost in this particular accident, but the question was asked, "What would make a guy do something like this?" The idea is, "It's going to make a bigger person out of me, in my peer group, or in my own eyes." Not too smart, Embry-Riddle says, because it ends up in losing a life. I think in your case it can end up in your losing eternal life. Be careful of the macho image--that which makes you a bigger person because you challenge authority.<br><br>The third is antiauthority--not following the proper flight plans, not learning the proper procedures. This is a trait, Embry-Riddle said, found in people who hate being told what to do. I submit it's a trait found in people who haven't grown up. I sometimes wonder if you think, "Wouldn't it be nice not to be told what to do? Wouldn't it be nice to be President Kimball and be the President of the Church and not be told what to do?" Think about that one for a minute. He has pressure placed upon him by Jesus Christ. This is His church; He knows what He wants the prophet to do in this dispensation. You may wonder why that prophet gives all his heart, might, mind, and strength, as stated to us as a qualification for the ministry in the fourth section of the Doctrine and Covenants, second verse. There is no halfway commitment. Be careful of antiauthority because that mixed with the macho image will end up in a lot of heartache in this life.<br><br>The fourth, impulsivity--doing something impulsively without thinking. The tendency to do anything to correct a mistake rather than reasoning out the best solution is my definition. Then, once we've made a mistake, there's the cover-up, and one thing leads to another, instead of just going in to see the bishop and saying, "I sinned. I want to get back on that straight and narrow path."<br><br>The last, and probably the most important, when we're talking of this idea of antichrist, or one who rejects the teachings known to be true and leads others astray, would be defined as follows. I learned this one as a jet fighter pilot. "Out of control," we simply said, when we were training somebody, and the airplane got ahead of him. Many times your lives get ahead of you. You're here at the university, and things are moving very fast. It's like a jet fighter pilot in a single-seated plane--computers working, navigational aids, everything moving by hundreds of miles an hour, a thousand miles an hour and more, two and three times the speed of sound. You have to know where you're going, file your flight plan, and be very careful where you fly.<br><br>When we were flying low-level flights, we'd be going three hundred miles an hour. It was always nice to do that because, when you divide sixty into it, you can mark off five miles every minute. You can go faster, but it's a lot easier just to put your little marks on the map. And you know your guidelines along the way, water towers, reservoirs, different kinds of buildings. You're flying at maybe a hundred feet, two hundred feet above the ground, flying from Georgia to Oklahoma or even farther, and you never come up, but you can do it if you pay attention to your guidelines.<br><br>Please remember that the mistakes you are going to make will not be because you haven't been taught and you do not know what you should be doing. It will not be the equipment and the training that fail.<br><h2><b>Invulnerability</b></h2><br>Do you feel that you have invulnerability? Do you say, "I can handle that. It isn't going to happen to me"? Think carefully. On one occasion when I spoke to a number of young ladies, questions were handed to me before the meeting. And one of the questions read something like this: "What happens when you're going on a date with somebody, and you know"--underlined in red--"and you know there's going to be trouble?"<br><br>Let's think about that for a minute. The first time I received that question, I said, "Young lady, you're going to wear a very comfortable pair of shoes, because when he goes by the dormitory and up the canyon road, you're going to tell him to stop, and you're going to get out and walk home."<br><br>As I was driving home and feeling very good about myself and being very clever, my wife, as every sweetheart does, leaned over and put her head on my shoulder, and I expected her to tell me how well I'd done that night. But she said, speaking as a woman, "You know they expect more of you than that."<br><br>The second time I got the question, I think I answered it better from a mother's point of view, from a woman's point of view, when I said, "You aren't going to go on that date."<br><br>I think that there are a lot of young ladies who could sit down and say, "I know your reputation. I know what you're expecting." As my sweetheart once said--when she was told by her father in a letter to date only returned missionaries, she wrote back and said, "Father, I don't think you understand. Some of these fellows are octopuses with testimonies."<br><br>How can we forget who we are?<br><br>And so I think a young lady ought to be able to say to a young man, "All right, I'll go out with you, but if you lay one hand on me, Buster, that's it." And that's what we would like to have from the elders and sisters as they talk and discuss what their evening is going to be like, what their marriage is going to be like. I'd hope that most of you could date a few more than two or three times before everybody in your ward and stake feels you ought to be married.<br><br>Do you realize the problem we're having? A very subtle thing happened this Christmas. I was watching television one evening, and I saw a commercial for a children's cosmetic kit. There are a lot of mothers in this country and a lot of older sisters who this Christmas might have bought a little cosmetic kit for a six-year-old or an eight-year-old or a nine-year-old. Once you start having a young lady put on her eye makeup and her lipstick and start to attract those around her at an age when she literally does not know what she is doing, you are asking for trouble. Any young lady here who started dating heavily and going steady before the age of sixteen, be careful. I can give you a high correlation between early dating and immoral conduct. Dating only after age sixteen is the advice of the Brethren who have talked to you and of all the prophets in my lifetime. Listen to them. They say what they say for a reason. It's for your protection because they love you.<br><br>"I can handle that," you say. "I can put on the makeup. I can put on the nail polish. I can start dating. I can start going steady." Invulnerability? Think about it.<br><h2><b>Friends: What to Do with Them</b></h2><br>After the first small mistake is made in an airplane or in life, you rapidly have succeeding problems. And this is what happens when you start dating too young. Once a mistake is made, you ask yourself, "What can I do?" It's difficult when you're in a group. You don't want to be lonely. I've had young people tell me, "I'd rather starve than not have a friend. I'll do anything for a friend." But there's a simple phrase that will help us: "Choose you this day whom ye will serve" (Joshua 24:15). You must make a decision today whom you will serve. In 2 Timothy there is some great advice as Paul talks of those who are associating in his day with friends who lead them astray. A very simple phrase: "From such turn away" (2 Timothy 3:5).<br><br>Many of you are going to say, "Elder Hales, I can't turn away from my friends. I can't do that. I love them too much. I'm going to bring them into the Church." So I'd like to define what I believe Paul meant when he said, "From such turn away." The key is to turn away, not from your friends, but from the ways and the path your friends are taking.<br><br>You'll say, "Is that Christian behavior? I want to save them. I know that if I associate with them, I can influence them for good."<br><br>There's an Indian saying that I was taught many years ago as a young man: "Before you judge someone, you should walk in his moccasins and go his way."<br><br>I'd like to change that a little bit and say, "Turn away from the ways of your friends and the paths they are on. If you'll go on the correct, straight, and narrow path that leads to eternal life, as spoken of by Nephi and many others, then, once you have your life straightened out, invite your friends to come over and walk in your moccasins on the correct path." And I think you'll begin to understand that you don't have to reject your friends who are on the wrong path; you don't have to give them up. But you do have to give up their ways and the path they're taking, and it takes great courage. It's probably the most difficult thing I'm going to ask you to do this evening. But you have to get on the correct path and then, by example, lead them.<br><br>Zeezrom, when Alma and Amulek were teaching him, trembled with fear and wanted to accept the gospel. He wanted to convert the people who made Alma and Amulek watch their followers being burned. Zeezrom went to them and said, "These men have the truth." He'd been taught the gospel; he was converted, but they didn't listen to him. They cast him out.<br><br>Many of us turn around, go on a mission, and come to the university. I want to ask you a question, "What about the others, elders and sisters, who are still back dragging Main Street?" You've turned away. Do you have any responsibility? Think for a minute. What about your responsibility for your conduct in what happened behind the barn, or on a date? Have you repented and gone your way? Do you have any responsibility for those left behind? Have you left someone in the fire because of your actions? What kind of friend are you? Will you go back and lift them and write them and bear your testimony to them? I ask the Lord's blessing to be with you as a friend.<br><h2><b>What a Friend Is</b></h2><br>There's a marvelous lesson to be taught by those who live in the islands. When they catch crabs, they place them in a small, flat basket. If you place one crab in the basket, it crawls right out. If you place two crabs in the basket, every time one crab starts to crawl out, it is pulled back in by the other crab. Does that tell you something about your friends? What is the definition of a friend? Friends are people who make it easier to live the gospel of Jesus Christ. If they deviate from the path and lead you away, it does not matter what kind of cars they drive, who their parents are, how effective they are on the football field or the basketball floor or the baseball diamond. You have to ask yourself, "Do they make living the gospel easier? Do they help me out of the basket? Will they go with me?"<br><br>I learned a great lesson as a young man. My father sent me out to work on a ranch. I worked with Uncle Frank Hatch in Skull Valley and with my cousin Jay and others that I loved very much. I learned a great deal about the gospel out there, as well as why I was sent. My father was from Idaho, and he told me I could never learn how to work if I grew up in New York. As I went out to the ranch, I found that there were thousands and thousands of acres for the cattle to graze in. Why on earth did they go up to the fence and stick their heads through? As a boy from New York I could not understand that. I'd say, "Uncle Frank, they've got all those thousands and thousands of acres out there. Why do they push against the fence?"<br><br>That's often the way it is with us and the gospel of Jesus Christ. Within the principles of the gospel we can have such great times. We can laugh and enjoy life. What fun it is! Yet what do we do? We all push up against the fence sometimes. We keep going down the fence to try to find the hole in the south forty. Then when we find it, we romp on out and say, "Hey, isn't this great." We go out on Highway 90 and get hit by a semi truck. And we wonder what on earth happened to us. I'm sure we blame someone else, as those poor cattle who get hit blame the farmer for not keeping the fence mended.<br><br>I would hope that we could understand another lesson I learned that summer from my uncle. It was about coyotes and sheep. It's very clever. Mother and father coyote send those little coyote pups out to play and frolic. And the little lambs who are secure in the fold look over there and say, "Boy, doesn't that look like a lot of fun?" And they leave to go play with the coyote pups. Then the adult coyotes come down and kill them.<br><br>As you go out and see the things that are happening in the world, you may say, "Wouldn't it be fun to experience a little bit of that? In fact, I'd like to experience that. It'll make me a better person. I'll relate better to those who are sinning and to those who are transgressing."<br><br>I visited with a young man recently and asked him, "How is your testimony?"<br><br>He said, "Well, I want to go on a mission."<br><br>And I said, "Well, do you really feel you know the scriptures?"<br><br>He said, "No, I'm going to let my companion do that. I just want to go out. I think I can relate to all the people who have had some problems."<br><br>I said, "What happens when you have a companion who has the same viewpoint you have?"<br><br>He looked at me, and a broad grin came over his face. He said, "You have a point there, Elder." And so he went about studying the scriptures.<br><h2><b>"Remember Who You Are"</b></h2><br>President Nathan Eldon Tanner told us a story in the temple one day. He was just a young lad, and his father left him to tend their cow. He did not come from a wealthy family, and the cow was the most prized possession they had. It gave them sustenance and food. Father Tanner was going into town and asked Nathan Eldon if he'd take care of the cow. Nathan Eldon had all of his friends over and they proceeded to have a rodeo. They rode that cow and kicked it (I can see smiles on the faces of many young men from Idaho.) Fortunately, his father came back early. There'd been no time to milk the cow, time for the second milking was approaching, and things were getting serious for that animal. Father didn't yell at Nathan Eldon; he didn't strike him, but sat him on a fencepost and said, "Nathan Eldon, remember who you are. You're a Tanner." He then proceeded to give him a little bit of his heritage and told him what he expected of him and reminded him that he was a priesthood holder. Then he told the boy what President Tanner repeatedly tells us, "Remember who you are and act accordingly."<br><br>I hope you haven't forgotten that you are children of God. He has sent you here, has given you parents kind and dear.<br><br><i>Lead me, guide me, walk beside me,</i><br><br><i>Help me find the way.</i><br><br><i>Teach me all that I must do</i><br><br><i>To live with Him someday.</i><br><br>[Naomi Randall, "I Am a Child of God,"<i>Sing with Me</i>(Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1974), no. B-76]<br><br>Sometimes I think we go through life in a speedboat. As we go through the harbors of life, we never look over our shoulders at the sailboats and the lifeboats and the dinghies that are swamped in the wake of our actions. I would hope that you'd start looking over your shoulder.<br><br>While you have been cruising main street back home, as I've said, and you've turned and left, what did you leave behind? You are the most chosen of all spirit children on earth. It is your responsibility and that of your posterity to lift, to prepare for the second coming of Jesus Christ. This responsibility has been placed upon you in this dispensation. You are not here by accident. You are here to lift. But you know how hard it is to lift somebody if you're standing in the mud or, even more, how hard it is to lift somebody if you're standing on their shoulders, weighing them down.<br><h2><b>Four Steps</b></h2><br>In closing, I'd like to give you my testimony. And in doing so I'd like to tell you how to have a good relationship with the Lord and talk just a little bit about repentance. There are four steps you have to take to have a close relationship with the Lord. First, prayer, individual prayer, companion prayer, and family prayer. Then after you've prayed to your Heavenly Father and thanked him for all that he's given--and I'd like to ask each one of you, as you depart this evening and go home, to offer up a prayer of thanksgiving for all the things you have--you've got to study, individual study and companion study. If it's in the family, you've got to have family study. Once you've had prayer and study, then you must become obedient. And after obedience, diligence, working with all of your heart, mind, might, and strength to help others.<br><br>My sweetheart went to Relief Society conference, and on the wall was a sign that presented the theme of the day: "If you don't go, you can't get." She understood that if you don't go to Relief Society, you can't get what is there, but the gospel of Jesus Christ is built on a different foundation. If you don't go, you can't<i>give</i>. There is a big difference between getting and giving. Many of us spend our time worrying about the gettings of life rather than the givings.<br><h2><b>Repentance</b></h2><br>As I close, may I ask you to think of repentance. As we think of the antichrists among us and remember Korihor, what did he say? "Religion? That's the tradition of our fathers. Repentance or forgiveness? It is a derangement of the mind." All hope is taken away.<br><br>We know when we've done wrong. We realize that we should not do it again because the scriptures say to us,<br><br><i>By this ye may know if a man repenteth of his sins--behold, he will confess them and forsake them.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 58:43]<br><br>Restitution is a very interesting element of repentance. We all recognize the importance of forgiving others, but many of us forget the most difficult part--forgiving ourselves. That is one of the adversary's greatest tools. We do not forgive ourselves. We do not allow the Spirit of the Lord to come into our lives and to guide us. After you have repented, the Lord forgives you long before you forgive yourself, but remember what the Savior said about putting your hand to the plough and not looking back (see Luke 9:62). You've made a mistake. You recognize you've done wrong. You don't do it again. But then the most important part is that you forgive others, forgive yourself, and then you put your hand to the plough and never look back. You don't even talk about it; you leave it up to the Lord to let you know when it's behind you. Then you cannot have someone come to you and remind you that you made a mistake. When you go out on a mission, you won't say to yourself, "I'm a hypocrite. I really shouldn't be here. I've made a mistake." If you teach repentance and if you live it, you can bear testimony of it, and you can truly forgive yourselves and the Lord can forgive you.<br><h2><b>Testimony</b></h2><br>Mary and I were traveling through Germany, Poland, Czechoslovakia, and Austria with the BYU A Cappella Choir, and we had one of the sweetest experiences we've ever had. As we went through Poland, everywhere they sang in the cathedrals--90 percent of the people are in the chapels and in the cathedrals on Sunday--and everywhere the choir sang, the Poles would place their hands or their fists over their hearts to say "We bear our testimony of what you sing." We were in Gdansk, Warsaw, Poznan, Czestochowa, where the Black Madonna was, and they sang in all the cathedrals there. The special occasion of which I speak happened in Spittal, Austria. Our choir had been singing in competition with a cappella choirs from many countries throughout Europe, the German Democratic Republic, which is East Germany, West Germany, Czechoslovakia, Austria, and many others. When the competition was over and the judges were out the choirs had dispersed into the crowd. Our choir went to a fourth tier way above the platform where they had been performing in the castle. They really looked like angels. They sang from the words of Robert Cundick's<i>The Redeemer,</i>a very special song, "Behold, This Is the Way."<br><br>These are the words at the end of Nephi's great teachings about the first four principles of the gospel: How faith in the Lord Jesus Christ gives us the strength to repent and turn around; how, after turning around in repentance, we go through the waters of baptism and are cleansed to receive the Holy Ghost and start on a straight and narrow path that leads to eternal life, as defined in the thirty-first chapter of 2 Nephi. And I want to tell you the moving experience that Mary and I had as we stood among those of the choir of Czechoslovakia. As the word<i>Behold</i>rang out, all of a sudden that palace and courtyard became a tabernacle. These are the words that have been penned, and I read them to you with my closing testimony from the twenty-first verse:<br><br><i>And now, behold, my beloved brethren, this is the way; and there is none other way nor name given under heaven whereby man can be saved in the kingdom of God. And now, behold, this is the doctrine of Christ, and the only and true doctrine of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, which is one God, without end. Amen.</i><br><br>I add my testimony to that of Nephi. I know that God lives and that Jesus is the Christ and that this is the way. He does love us, and if you and I are true and faithful, if we will go to the temple to be sealed for time and all eternity, if we will stay on that straight and narrow path, if we will love one another, if we will help one another, if we will lift one another, we will return to the presence of our Heavenly Father for time and for all eternity. But it all depends on what kind of friends we have. And I want you to know that if you in this assembly could realize who you are and act accordingly, you would understand, as recorded in the fifty-eighth section of the Doctrine and Covenants, that the power is in you to stand alone. You know that you have the power within you to do that which is right and which you came here to do to be prepared to return to the presence of our Heavenly Father.<br><br>I ask the Lord's blessings to be with you and express again my great love for you. I hope that you will ponder upon that which we have talked plainly about this evening. As you leave this assembly with the resolve to do better, if you start to slip, please remember the many friends you have sitting on this stand who are ready to assist you.<br><br>May the Lord's choicest blessings be yours, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Robert D.

<h1>ur Blessings - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Because I am giving my talk this morning in a, for me, foreign language, I frequently, in the preparation of it, had to look up in the dictionary the true meaning or even the right pronunciation of English words.<br><h2><b>Devotional</b></h2><br>I understand that this meeting is customarily called a "devotional." Brother Bruce Olsen, assistant to the president for University Relations, wrote in his invitational letter about a Devotional Assembly (with a capital D and a capital A, probably to stress the great importance of this meeting). So I asked myself as a linguist: "What is the true meaning of<i>devotional?</i>" Well, Webster's dictionary gives the following explanation:<i>Devotional--</i>characterized by devotion! That, of course, did not bring me much further in my understanding of the true meaning. So my search continued, and I looked up the word<i>devotion.</i>Here I found that Mr. Webster and his associates listed two quite different interpretations:<i>Devotion,</i>definition number one, ardent love and affection! Since I am certainly not here this morning to teach you how to become ardent lovers, I quickly disregarded this first meaning.<br><br><i>Devotion,</i>in the second meaning, is a religious exercise or practice other than the regular worship of a congregation. This meaning is much more satisfying to me under the circumstances. But what is the purpose of a devotional? My search continued, and I found just what I was looking for because I consider this meeting a great teaching opportunity. The purpose of a devotional is to make people more<i>devout,</i>which is defined as<i>a mental attitude</i>that leads to frequent prayer and worship, manifesting itself in the faithful performance of religious duties and adherence to a way of life in keeping with the faith.<br><br>I think that's a beautiful definition for all of us. We all relate to this. I now clearly understand that I am here this morning to develop in you a positive mental attitude and to gently lead you on the straight and narrow path, that you may continue to live in keeping with the faith. Therefore, in all seriousness, I'd like to share with you at this moment some personal feelings and ideas.<br><h2><b>Education a Blessing</b></h2><br>As a convert to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, I have, right from the start of my conversion, always been greatly impressed with the importance and emphasis given to the ongoing process of teaching, training, instructing, educating, enlightening, and edifying all of our Heavenly Father's children in his kingdom.<br><br>Maybe these strong sympathetic feelings can be explained through the fact that my native country, Holland, was from 1940 until 1945 occupied by Nazi Germany. When I finished my high school education in July 1942, it so happened that at that time a new rule was established that someone could from then on only register for classes in the Dutch universities if willing to sign a so-called "declaration of loyalty" to the occupying German forces.<br><br>This rule was initiated to oppress the ever-growing underground student activities against the Germans in Holland as part of the struggle for world peace by the Allied forces. Needless to say, the majority of Dutch students simply refused to sign such a humiliating political document and stayed away from the campuses, whether freshmen or graduate students.<br><br>In everyday life there remained only two alternatives for all young men between 18 and 30 years of age: to leave home, change names, use a faked I.D. card, and go "underground" somewhere in the country or to run the very real risk to be arrested anywhere at any moment and to be deported to Germany for slave labor in the war industry with the hundreds of thousands already there from other European nations.<br><br>How lucky I was that I managed to stay in Holland from November 1942 until V.E. Day--which is the Victory in Europe Day of the Allied forces--in May 1945 because I was able to obtain false identification papers! Most of my time during those years was used studying foreign languages through self-study and in small peer groups living under similar circumstances in the same location.<br><br>The reason that I mention these facts to you who are assembled here today as students is mainly to make you aware of your blessing to be able to receive a higher education in this great land of freedom and your personal fortune to be able to attend a university that is founded, supported, and guided by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.<br><h2><b>Five Blessings</b></h2><br>I have asked to sing together as part of this program one verse of the hymn 202, "When upon Life's Billows You Are Tempest Tossed" with the chorus "Count your many blessings, name them one by one" for a very good reason. I want, at this time, to count for you five of your blessings, and I will name them one by one. That I restrict myself to only five is merely a matter of the time that is allotted to me rather than a personal mathematical deficiency. So let me count for you the five blessings that I have in mind.<br><br>Blessing number 1: Brigham Young University, as I have mentioned before, is founded, supported, and guided by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. The Board of Trustees, consisting of experienced, inspired, wise Church leaders, is headed by a living prophet who repeatedly admonishes all of us to develop the moral values which characterize the life and teachings of the Son of God. This guarantees that, besides secular learning, you will here be taught rules and principles of behavior that will build your personality, that will increase your spirituality, preparing you to go the eleventh mile when asked to serve in the kingdom. On purpose I did not say "to go the<i>extra</i>mile" because I know there will be much more expected of you, and that's why I threw in another 10 miles for you.<br><br>Also, the great American statesman and founding father of the Constitution, Benjamin Franklin, recognized the tremendous importance of education in general and of good teachers in particular when he said:<br><br><i>I think ... that general virtue is more probably to be expected and obtained from the</i>education<i>of youth than from the</i>exhortation<i>of adult persons; bad habits and vices of the mind being, like diseases of the body, more easily prevented</i>[in youth]<i>than cured</i>[in adults]<i>.</i><br><br>And he continued:<br><br><i>I think, moreover, that talents for the education of youth are the gift of God; and that he on whom they are bestowed, whenever a way is opened for the use of them, is as strongly called as if he heard a voice from heaven.</i>[Letter to Samuel Johnson, Philadelphia, August 23, 1750. Quoted in Adrienne Koch (ed.),<i>The American Enlightenment</i>(New York: George Braziller, 1965), p. 77; emphasis added]<br><br>I know this to be true with all my heart.<br><br>Blessing number 2: Yours is the privilege in an era of limited enrollment at BYU to have that golden opportunity for intensive learning in a place where full commitment is expected at all times, where you really can work on the realization of your potential and make a contribution to academic excellence.<br><br>Who will<i>not</i>see this as a great blessing when it is realized that this year, because of the "no-growth" policy of BYU, 4,500 students had to be denied admission? And even more so if we think of a country like mainland China, where more than 1,000 million people live, where 34 percent of the population is between 1 and 14 years old. This means there are 340 million children younger than 14, of whom, by the beginning of the 1980 school year, only 146,180,000 were actually registered in some form of primitive village school system. When we look at the Chinese youth in the next age group, we see that 20 percent of the population, or 200 million, are between 15 and 24 years old. For them were available at the end of 1980 only 41,500 secondary schools and 462 universities, at which almost a generation of teachers and college professors were lost because of the "Cultural Revolution" from 1966 until 1976. Let us all daily be mindful of these facts and therefore perform the very, very best we can.<br><br>The words of the late Elder Richard L. Evans almost become prophetic in this respect:<i>Sooner or later in life there comes a time when it is performance that counts--not promises, not possibilities, not potentialities--but performance.</i>[<i>From the Crossroads</i>(New York: Harper and Brothers, 1955), p. 158]<br><br>And President Holland in a recent interview phrased it well by saying: "We cannot do everything, but what we choose to do we will do superbly well."<br><br>Blessing number 3: Your stay on campus will not only prepare each and every one of you to meet personal challenges and change but will also bring strength to others in your future family relations and Church service. For these reasons there is simply no room for nonperformance and incorrect behavior.<br><br>Blessing number 4: Now I get a little personal. You have a loving, compassionate, understanding university president who is unceasingly trying in speech and in writing to make all of us understand that this place here, so beautifully situated in the mountains, and of which we are so proud, is a university, or by definition an institution of higher learning. Therefore, it is more than a location for an ongoing missionary reunion and more than a well-run, computer-equipped dating bureau where the female candidates start the day by singing hymn 206 out of the hymnbook. (You don't know what hymn 206 is, but you will look it up later.) Because this is an institution of higher learning, students who come to BYU and who stay at BYU will be those who love learning, who love Christian living, and who want to make a constructive contribution to their world as responsible, selfdirecting individuals.<br><br>I say "Responsible, self-directing individuals" because you as students can take these responsibilities upon you and direct your lives toward certain goals of your own making. Each and every one of us can make some contribution to improve the system. I often hear, "The American educational system is in trouble. Schools are running out of money. Teachers can't spell."<br><br>I answer, "How come?" Why do children refuse to take their studies seriously? Why do they say to their teachers: "This stuff won't do me any good because I'll never need to use it"?<br><br>It is often a matter of the wrong attitude based on an unwillingness to take the time and effort to study seriously. It is also a common misconception that if a person is "gifted" or "bright" or "talented," wonderful ideas will flash spontaneously into his mind. Unfortunately the intellect does not work that way. Even Albert Einstein had to study hard and think for months before he announced his theory of relativity to the world.<br><br>And so, those of us who are less intelligent than Einstein find it a struggle to conceive even a moderately good idea, let alone a brilliant one. But it is worth the effort. If we are to survive as free people in the free world, we have to take some course of action that will lead to ideas from which all will benefit in the long run, because, regardless of what some advertisers have led us to believe, this country does not run on oil. It runs on ideas--ideas coming from the minds of well-trained thinkers of which we desire to have 26,000-plus on this campus today.<br><br>Blessing number 5: To know through divine revelation that "the glory of God is intelligence, or, in other words, light and truth" (D&amp;amp;C 93:36). President Hugh B. Brown, then a counselor in the First Presidency of the Church, in a conference address in October 1962 gave the following explanation of this great and often quoted line in the Doctrine and Covenants:<i>Man's standing before God will depend upon his knowledge, his education, his understanding of the gospel of Christ--in short, his intelligence, ... for, as God's glory is intelligence, only to the degree that we achieve intelligence will we be able to stand His glory</i>. [<i>CR</i>, October 1962, p. 84]<br><br>Can you as students find a better place to receive this knowledge, education, and understanding than right here on campus, where all our doings can and should be focused on light and truth, with the best available equipment, manpower, expertise, and continuous revelation?<br><br>I plead with you not to be like Bill, the overweight mountain climber who had trained himself so well and so long to develop arm muscles that would support his obese body while trying to make it to the top. When the great day came to bring all his skills into practice, he climbed a steep granite mountain; but halfway up he saw at a certain moment, much to his consternation, that the rope on which he was hanging was fraying and in a short while certainly would break. He looked down and saw there was no ledge or bush to break his fall. He made, however, a quick decision: he decided to use a heavier rope next time! Bill's decision was right; only his timing was wrong. I think there is a great lesson in this for all of us. Bill had indeed practiced and prepared for the climb but had overlooked his most important need.<br><br>Therefore, on this campus, we must see to it that students weave their own enduring ropes that will support them in their ascent, even long after they have left school and have come to the realization that the most important need that was fulfilled in this great university was the Spirit of God to support them in their ascent through life.<br><br>Through personal observation in various parts of the world, I have seen BYU alumni reach heights in their careers, in their communities, and in their family life that can only be explained through their exemplary life as Latter-day Saints and their work ethics. For this reason I count also this blessing today.<br><h2><b>Much Can Be Said about BYU</b></h2><br>But besides counting the blessings of attending, much can be said and has been said about this great university. Five big volumes of documentation on the first one hundred years of its existence have been written by very knowledgeable and competent people. So I asked myself, while preparing this talk, what contribution I could make. The answer came strongly: First, testify of the seal of approval of our Father in Heaven on what is performed in righteousness on this campus to make young people grow in all aspects of life. Second, make a personal statement based on your observations during the ten-year period that you have been regularly coming to this campus. May I, therefore, phrase my feelings as follows:<br><br>Loyalty, hard work, and dedication of BYU's faculty, staff, students, and administrators during its 107 years of existence have made Brigham Young University a respected name all over the world.<br><br>I recognize that quality has been, is, and always will be the key to the success and the honorable mentions of BYU--quality of education, quality of committee work, quality of campus activities, quality of athletic teams, quality of performing groups, quality of all people on campus, and quality of all alumni off campus. I feel we have to continue to think and act constructively to improve this quality whenever and wherever possible. In so doing we will build to the fullest extent toward academic excellence and the continuity thereof.<br><br>I have witnessed repeatedly that BYU promotes self-respect and gives maximum opportunity to each man and woman to develop to his or her fullest potential; also, that people at all levels are enabled to win proper recognition for work well done.<br><br>It is my personal conviction that the following criteria have to continue to be the guiding force on this campus:<br><br>1. Confidence and dignity in our relationships founded on the truth of the restored gospel.<br><br>2. Capability and alertness in our work and our study through inner motivation.<br><br>3. Team spirit in our common pursuit of excellence.<br><h2><b>Harmony with Basic Mission of the Church</b></h2><br>As a convert to the Church, I know and testify with all my heart that our aim must be to think and act at all times in harmony with the basic mission of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints as outlined by President Spencer W. Kimball in his April 1981 general conference address and also with the recent mission statement of Brigham Young University made by President Jeffrey R. Holland, as printed in the December 1981 issue of the alumni newspaper<i>BYU Today.</i><br><br>This is very important to me. The basic mission of the Church and the basic mission of this university go hand in hand. Last night in preparation I looked them up again, and I'd like to quote here because it is so important that we all realize these things and how they dovetail, as you say in your language. The basic mission of the Church is threefold. First, to preach the gospel to every nation. Second, to perfect the Saints by preparing them to receive all the saving ordinances of the gospel. Third, to redeem our dead by performing these ordinances vicariously (see Spencer W. Kimball, "A Report of My Stewardship,"<i>Ensign,</i>May 1981, p. 5).<br><br>Now let's compare this with the mission statement of Brigham Young University. I have the page here from the alumni newspaper<i>BYU Today,</i>in which it was printed. Here you see is the mission statement of the university. What is the first line?<br><br><i>The mission of Brigham Young University ... is to assist individuals in their quest for perfection and eternal life.</i><br><br>In your language you also have a very special saying that is kind of a fad today. When I am in a meeting I sometimes hear that expression: "What is the bottom line?" You hear that so often, "What is the bottom line?" I sometimes wonder, "What do they mean by that?" What is the bottom line of the statement of the mission of the university? Let me read out the bottom line.<br><br><i>We believe the earnest pursuit of this institutional mission can have a strong effect on the course of higher education and will ... enlarge Brigham Young University's influence in a world we wish toimprove.</i><br><br>For all of us<i>this</i>is the bottom line!<br><h2><b>Nephi's Challenge</b></h2><br>When I turn to the scriptures I see that Nephi, speaking to the people in his time, told them to follow Christ as we read it in 2 Nephi, chapter 31, verse 15, and following. Nephi's words contain two challenges. 1. For those who are not yet members in the kingdom of God to be baptized. 2. For those who are members of the Church to press forward with steadfastness in Christ to obtain eternal life. I'd like to quote this from the Book of Mormon because it is such beautiful language and it has so much truth in it.<i></i><br><br><i>And I heard a voice from the Father, saying: Yea, the words of my Beloved are true and faithful. He that endureth to the end, the same shall be saved.</i>And then in verses 17 and 18:<i></i><br><br><i>Wherefore, do the things which I have told you I have seen that your Lord and your Redeemer should do; for, for this cause have they been shown unto me, that ye might know the gate by which ye should enter. For the gate by which ye should enter is repentance and baptism by water; and then cometh a remission of your sins by fire and by the Holy Ghost.</i><i></i><br><br><i>And then are ye in this strait and narrow path which leads to eternal life; yea, ye have entered in by the gate; ye have done according to the commandments of the Father and the Son; and ye have received the Holy Ghost, which witnesses of the Father and the Son, unto the fulfilling</i><i>of the promise which he hath made, that if ye entered in by the way ye should receive.</i>And then comes a very interesting statement by Nephi:<i></i><br><br><i>And now, my beloved brethren, after ye have gotten into this strait and narrow path, I would askif all is done? Behold, I say unto you, Nay.</i>I like that part because here Nephi starts talking Dutch. (In Holland,<i>no</i>is<i>nay</i>and<i>yes</i>is<i>ja!</i>) But he says, "Is all done now we are on the straight and narrow?" He says, "Nay,"<i>for ye have not come thus far save it were by the word of Christ with unshaken faith in him, relying wholly upon the merits of him who is mighty to save.</i><i></i><br><br><i>Wherefore, ye must press forward with a steadfastness in Christ, having a perfect brightness of hope, and a love of God and of all men. Wherefore, if ye shall press forward, feasting upon the word of Christ, and endure to the end, behold, thus saith the Father: Ye shall have eternal life</i>. [2 Nephi 31:19–20]<br><br>I could not think of a better scripture passage than what we have just discussed: to press forward, to know that this is a place where all the opportunities are given unto us, that we are really blessed today.<br><h2><b>Testimony</b></h2><br>In closing, I want you to know that I am grateful for the privilege of being among you today with my eternal companion, and also with my son, my daughter, and my son-in-law, who enjoy the blessings of receiving an education on this campus.<br><br>Although I am not a citizen of the United States, as a General Authority of the Church and as a private person, I pledge my allegiance to the Church Educational System, to this great university, and to what they stand for, and I will continue to give my wholehearted support to these institutions in word, deed, and prayer.<br><br>That all who are under the sound of my voice this day may feel and act accordingly, I humbly pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Jacob de Jager was a member of the First Quorum of the Seventy of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when this devotional address was given on 19 January 1982.</i></i><br><br><i>© Intellectual Reserve, Inc.

<h1>hreads - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I thank President Condie for that generous introduction. It was so flattering that it reminds me of an experience I had recently with President Marion G. Romney. I walked into the Church Office Building, stepped on the elevator, and he was there. He looked a little bit weary, so I thought I would cheer him up. I asked him how he was.<br><br>He said, "Oh, about average."<br><br>I said, "Well, President, average for you is superior for most of us."<br><br>He smiled, looked at me, and said, "Boy, you are very kind, but you are not the least bit honest."<br><br>President Condie mentioned that I am somewhat at ease on a basketball court, or at least I used to be. When I left the University of Utah years ago, I tried very hard to stay in shape. I continued to play basketball in an effort to retain my skills. But I sustained an injury and was forced to undergo a back operation. The operation was torture, and the long period of convalescence much the same. Finally, when the doctor was ready to give me release, I asked him if I could play basketball again. He looked at me, smiled a little bit, and said, "Carlos, you go home, and you read 1 Corinthians 13:11."<br><br>I returned home, opened my Bible, and read:<br><br><i>When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child: but when I became a man, I put away childish things.</i><br><br>That was enough to retire me.<br><br>It is a pleasure and a distinct honor, my brothers and sisters, to be in your presence this evening; and I hope and pray that the Spirit of the Lord will help me deliver the message I have in mind.<br><h2><b>Bound with Flaxen Thread</b></h2><br>I have invited two young men, Elder Brockman and Elder Robey, to help me introduce my subject. Will you two please step forward. You will note that both have their wrists bound together. Though you may not be able to see the material that I have used in binding my friends, it is the same for each--flaxen thread.<br><br>Elder Robey's wrists are tied with only one strand of the flaxen material. I will now invite him to muster all his strength and courage and break free. (Pause) Did you notice how easy and effortless that was?<br><br>Elder Brockman's wrists are tied with twenty strands of the flaxen thread. I now ask him to do what Elder Robey did. (Pause) If you were close to the pulpit, you would see that my captive is really trying to break his cords. You would also observe that, as he strains to break the thread, it is beginning to make indentations in his wrists, and, if he were to continue much further, I think it would cut and draw blood. Thank you very much.<br><h2><b>Bound by Habits</b></h2><br>I have engaged you in this simple demonstration to make a point. Suppose each strand of thread used in binding these young men represented one bad habit. From the demonstration, we might conclude that a single bad habit has limited restricting power. A number of bad habits, however, has great power--almost limitless power.<br><br>"The chains of habit," said one man, "are too small to be felt until they are too strong to be broken" (Samuel Johnson).<br><br>Plato, it is said, once rebuked a person for engaging in a gambling game. When the person protested that he had only played for a trifle, Plato replied, "The habit is not a trifle" (<i>Home Book of Quotations</i>, Burton Stevenson (ed.) [New York: Dodd, Mead, 1956], p. 845).<br><br>When I taught at this institution, I worked with students who<i>fitted</i>,<i>floated</i>, or<i>failed</i>. Those who fitted came with purpose, high resolve, and good work habits. Those who floated appeared on the scene for a semester or two and faded away to something less challenging when their grades finally caught up with them. Those who failed lacked the commitment and discipline required of a person in an institution of higher learning.<br><br>It seemed to me that most of the failures were shackled by poor habits. Some were not in the habit of attending class regularly; some were not in the habit of reading required texts; some were habitually late in submitting assignments; some were not in the habit of budgeting time and energies; and some were not even conditioned to work. In all too many cases, so it seemed to me, one weakness seemed to breed upon another, and what appeared at first to be a flaxen habit proved to be a strong inhibiting cord.<br><br>A Spanish proverb reads: "Habits are at first cobwebs, then cables." I suspect that most students come here with pure intent. They register, select their courses of study, and attend their classes with high hopes of attaining declared goals. But, when one becomes careless, when one permits resolve to sag, slouchy habits appear, and academic anemia sets in. This malady comes web by web until learning and growing are choked off by the cables of intellectual inactivity.<br><br>More than a decade ago, a young man wrote President Ernest L. Wilkinson of this institution and asked what he should do to become a successful leader. President Wilkinson responded with some wise counsel. He included in his counsel this quote from the philosopher and psychologist William James:<br><br><i>The hell to be endured hereafter, of which theology tells, is no worse than the hell we make for ourselves in this world by habitually fashioning our characters in the wrong way. Could the young but realize how soon they will become mere walking bundles of habits, they would give more heed to their conduct while in the plastic state. We are spinning our fates, good or evil, and never to be undone. Every smallest stroke of virtue or of vice leaves its never so little scar. The drunken Rip Van Winkle, in Jefferson's play, excuses himself for every fresh dereliction by saying, "I won't count this time!" Well! He may not count it, and a kind Heaven may not count it; but it is being counted none the less. Down among his nerve-cells and fibers the molecules are counting it, registering and storing it up to be used against him when the next temptation comes. Nothing we ever do is, in strict scientific literalness, wiped out. Of course this has its good side as well as its bad one. As we become permanent drunkards by so many separate drinks, so we become saints in the moral, and authorities and experts in the practical and scientific spheres, by so many separate acts and hours of work. Let no youth have any anxiety about the upshot of his education, whatever the line of it may be. If he keeps faithfully busy each hour of the working-day, he may safely leave the final result to itself. He can with perfect certainty count on waking up some fine morning, to find himself one of the competent ones of his generation, in whatever pursuit he may have singled out.</i>[Letter from Ernest L. Wilkinson to Bryce V. Redd, 2 Mar. 1971, pp. 2-3. Quoted from James, William,<i>The Principles of Psychology</i>, Great Books of the Western World, vol. 53. Chicago: Encyclopedia Britannica, 1952]<br><br>I would remind you "walking bundles of habits" that there is a relationship between thoughts, actions, habits, and characters. After the language of the Bible we might well say: "Thought begat Action; and Action took unto himself Habit; and Character was born of Habit; and Character was expressed through Personality. And, Character and Personality lived after the manner of their parents."<br><br>A more conventional way of linking the above concepts is found in the words of C. A. Hill: "We sow our thoughts, and we reap our actions; we sow our actions, and we reap our habits; we sow our habits, and we reap our characters; we sow our characters, and we reap our destiny" (<i>Home Book of Quotations</i>, p. 845).<br><h2><b>Missionary Character Born of Habit</b></h2><br>I have often referred to and preached of a "missionary character"--one of the most desired character of all, in my opinion. This character, I feel, is the sum of all the good habits acquired through selfless day-by-day service and obedient living. It is molded slowly, as the ambassador of righteousness shares the gospel of Jesus Christ and seeks to save souls.<br><br>As missionaries completed their work in the Texas North Mission, where I served, I would invited them to sit down, to reflect, and to list all of the habits which they felt they had acquired during their terms of service. Most lists would include phrases like this:<br><br>*The habit of rising and retiring early.<br><br>*The habit of praying frequently.<br><br>*The habit of studying the scriptures regularly.<br><br>*The habit of exercising daily.<br><br>*The habit of working hard, consistently--and on and on it would go.<br><br>When the list was complete, I would ask the missionary to identify those habits which he felt he should break and discard upon his return home and his subsequent release. Nearly every missionary would eye his list carefully and respond something like this: "President, I can see only one habit which I can afford to place aside."<br><br>"What is that?" I would ask.<br><br>Invariably the missionary would conclude, "I can drop my daily tracting."<br><br>If character is truly born of habit--and it is--it is vital that all of us understand the process of habit formation. Not only will this process, if applied, enable us to refine character, but it will also assure us success in our missions in the mission field, at home, at school, or wherever.<br><h2><b>Steps to Good Habits</b></h2><br>Now, I am no expert on the subject of habit. Nevertheless, I would like to share with you some steps which I feel are involved in the cultivation of a desirable habit.<br><br>First, you must<i>define the desired habit</i>. You must identify it, verbalize it, and write it down. You should be as specific as possible. For example, you might write: "I shall attend all of my classes this semester and arrive on time." Or, "I shall attend Church worship services every Sunday without fail this year." Chances of successfully acquiring the new habit depend much upon how clearly you plant it in your mind and in your heart. Fuzzy or vague resolves are usually short lived. You know that as well as I. A firm and definite declaration of intent has staying power. Joshua did not say to the children of Israel: "Choose, if you like, within the next month or so, whom ye will serve. But as for me and my house, we may, if all goes well, serve the Lord." With firm resolve and clarity of purpose he declared:<br><br><i>Choose you this day whom ye will serve. . . but as for me and my house, we will serve the Lord</i>. [Joshua 24:15]<br><br>Second, you must<i>bind yourself to act</i>and to honor your declared resolve. Through the Prophet Joseph Smith, the Lord taught the Saints how to benefit from meetings and conferences. He instructed that the Saints meet together and instruct and edify one another; and, so that the instruction would not be spent and lost, he asked that we bind ourselves to act. The Lord's words are: "And ye shall bind yourselves to act in all holiness before me" (D&amp;amp;C 43:9). I feel that one binds himself best to a desired action by sharing his resolve with a friend, with a wife, with a husband, with a bishop, or with someone else who can monitor his progress. I also feel that one finds strength as he shares his desires with God and begs for divine assistance.<br><br>Third, you must<i>put the new mode of conduct into operation.</i>Just thinking about church or class attendance is not sufficient. Thoughts must be supported by action. The old adage "Practice makes perfect" certainly applies in this case. And with each planned and proper action, one repetition after another, comes added strength. President Heber J. Grant often quoted this statement from Emerson:<br><br><i>That which we try to do, and persist in doing, becomes easy to do, not because its nature is changed, but because our power to do is developed.</i>[Josiah Gilbert Holland (Timothy Titcomb, pseud.),<i>Gold-Foil: Hammered from Popular Proverbs</i>(New York: Charles Scribner, 1859), 291]<br><br>President Grant practiced what he preached. He tells this story of how he attempted to polish some singing skills:<br><br><i>Upon my recent trip to Arizona, I asked Elders Rudger Clawson and J. Golden Kimball if they had any objections to my singing one hundred hymns that day. They took it as a joke and assured me that they would be delighted. We were on the way from Holbrook to St. Johns, a distance of about sixty miles. After I had sung about forty tunes, they assured me that if I sang the remaining sixty they would be sure to have nervous prostration. I paid (check)no attention whatever to their appeal, but held them to their bargain and sang the full one hundred. One hundred and fifteen songs in one day, and four hundred in four days, is the largest amount of practicing I ever did.</i><br><br><i>Today</i>[1900]<i>my musical deafness is disappearing, and by sitting down to a piano and playing the lead notes, I can learn a song in less that one-tenth the time required when I first commenced to practice.</i>[<i>GS</i>, p. 354]<br><br>Fourth, you must<i>bolster your will or desire</i>by riveting your mind upon the virtues of the desired habit. A man does not lick the smoking habit by relishing the pleasure of a cigarette. But rather, he gains resolve by thinking about the added health and vitality and money savings which he will realize when free of the habit. Motivation to lose weight comes by anticipating the increased good looks and vitality, not by savoring caloric foods and exotic dishes.<br><br>In the scriptures, we read of good desires and wills. Alma taught:<br><br><i>I know that he</i>[God]<i>granteth unto men according to their desire, . . . yea, I know that he alloteth unto men. . . according to their wills.</i>[Alma 29:4]<br><br>So, when you have made your resolve, build your case, and build your will. Gather data, identify reasons, and do whatever you can to justify your struggle in acquiring the new habit.<br><br>Fifth, you must<i>not look back or permit exceptions to occur</i>once you have embarked upon your new course of action. No exceptions! Famous last words for the alcoholic are: "Just one more sip. I'll drink only this one, and then it's back on the wagon." Can't you just hear Lot's wife saying, as they raced away from Sodom, "Hold up for a minute; let me take one more look at the city." That was a fatal and very salty mistake (see Genesis 19:15–26).<br><br>Once we have determined the new habit or the improved pattern of living, we must guard against any inclination to deviate. No exceptions must be tolerated and no excuses invented. For every breach of our new resolution returns us to point zero, or below, and adds strength to the behavior we are trying to conquer.<br><br>"Look not behind thee" (Genesis 19:17), were the Lord's words to Lot and his company, and those words apply to you and to me as we seek to improve our lot.<br><br>Sixth, you must<i>plunge wholeheartedly into the new program of conduct.</i>Wholeheartedly: You do not let go of old habits gradually and move into new ones slowly. You do not taper off from the old, because that only prolongs the struggle. It also provides opportunities for the old habit to increase its hold. The new habit, if it is to survive, must be favored in every possible way and repeated in its complete form as often as possible.<br><br>I have suggested to you six steps which may assist you in cultivating new habits. Let me review the process quickly: (1)<i>Define</i>the desired habit, (2)<i>bind</i>yourself to act, (3)<i>put</i>the new conduct into operation, (4)<i>bolster</i>your will or desire, (5)<i>do not look back</i>, and (6)<i>plunge</i>wholeheartedly into the new conduct.<br><h2><b>Take One Small Step at a Time</b></h2><br>As you follow these steps, please bear in mind the need to take one resolve at a time. The big problem with most of our New Year's resolutions is that the list is generally too long and too ambitious. It seems that our tendency to forsake resolves increases as the list grows. I believe that one resolve made and kept is better than a dozen made and abandoned. Therefore, move forward in your progress one step, one habit at a time.<br><br>I find wisdom and inspiration in the lyrics of a song written in honor of some United States astronauts. You may recognize these words:<br><br><i>One small step for man,</i><br><i>One giant leap for mankind.</i><br><i>There isn't a thing that man cannot do,</i><br><i>If he takes one small step at a time.</i><br>[R. Harris, "One Small Step," sung by Mormon Tabernacle Choir, Columbia MS 7399]<br><br>You should also bear in mind the need to take advantage of your rather "plastic" state. Please understand that everyone becomes more and more fixed in his habits as he becomes older. While you are younger and relatively malleable, form habits that will work to your advantage rather than habits that will enslave. Make every effort to maintain the tendency to grow and to improve.<br><br>I like the words of Hubbard:<br><br><i>It may not be out of place to say that every man (and [every] woman) is controlled by Habit. When Habits are young they are like lion cubs, easily managed, but later there comes a time when they manage you. Bad Habits may put you on the Avernus Jerkwater, No. 23, with a one way to Nowhere. Good Habits are mentors, guardian angels, and servants that regulate your sleep, your work, your thought</i>. [<i>Selected Writings of Elbert Hubbard</i>(New York: William H. Wise, 1922), vol. 2., p. 195]<br><h2><b>Sin, Brother of Bad Habits</b></h2><br>At the beginning of this presentation, I conducted a simple demonstration. I used a flaxen thread in handcuffing two young men. The thread was used to illustrate the binding powers of bad habits. Permit me now to turn your minds to sin, the older and the uglier brother of bad habits.<br><br>Sin, much like habit, can enter one's life in a seemingly innocuous way. It can begin small and occupy only a corner of our lives. Yet, if left unattended, countenanced, and allowed to flourish, it can consume one's soul.<br><br>An ancient American prophet understood perfectly well this concept of which I speak. He referred to the devil as the founder of sin and works of darkness and warned: "He [the devil] leadeth them by the neck with a flaxen cord, until he bindeth them with his strong cords forever" (2 Nephi 26:22).<br><br>Those who become followers of the evil one do not generally reach their captive state with one misdeed. They lose their freedom one sin at a time--one error after another--until almost all is lost. Flaxen cords are transformed into awful chains of steel as one allows oneself to follow the downward course. Each easy step away from the line of goodness and truth makes it more and more difficult to recover.<br><br>More than 2500 years ago, the prophet Nephi predicted the conditions of our day. Among other things he said,<br><br><i>There shall be many which shall say: Eat, drink, and be merry, for tomorrow we die; and it shall be well with us</i>.<br><br><i>And there shall also be many which shall say: Eat, drink, and be merry; nevertheless, fear God--he will justify in committing a little sin; yea, lie a little, take the advantage of one because of his words, dig a pit for thy neighbor; there is no harm in this; and do all these things, for tomorrow we die; and if it so be that we are guilty, God will beat us with a few stripes, and at last we shall be saved in the kingdom of God.</i>[2 Nephi 28:7–8]<br><br>Nephi labeled such teachings as "false and vain and foolish doctrines" (2 Nephi 28:9), and stated further:<br><br><i>The devil will grasp them with his everlasting chains. . . .</i><br><br><i>And others he will pacify, and lull them away into carnal security, that they will say: All is well in Zion; yea, Zion prospereth, all is well--and thus the devil cheateth their souls, and leadeth them away carefully down to hell.</i><br><br><i>And behold, others he flattereth away, and telleth them there is no hell; and he saith unto them: I am no devil, for there is none--and thus he whispereth in their ears, until he grasps them with his awful chains, from whence there is no deliverance</i>. [2 Nephi 28:19, 21–22]<br><br>Several years ago, in a large city, my wife and I saw a sign in front of a church with this notice with this notice on the bulletin board: "Sunday Worship Services, 10:00 a.m." And below that, "Sunday Sermon Topic: Nice Sins for Good People." Though I did not attend these services, I have wondered ever since about the flattering and the pacifying and the lulling and the ear tickling that must have taken place in that setting.<br><br>Do not be deceived! There are no niceties, no goodnesses associated with sin, however small or large the transgression may appear. King David's flaxen-thread glance at Bathsheba resulted in the strong cords of adultery and death. The little murmurs of Laman and Lemuel led to the big breakup of a family and the splitting of a nation. Moreover, the little errors which you and I commit can become very binding if not checked--if not checked. It is written,<br><br><i>His inquiries shall take the wicked himself, and he shall be holden with the cords of his sins</i>. [Proverbs 5:22]<br><br>I suggest that you make a careful assessment of your life and determine your own state of affairs. Are you encumbered with so-called "nice" sins? Do you lie a little? Are you reckless with the truth? Are you perfectly honest with others? Do you gossip, do you dig verbal pits for your friends? Can you see any evidences of flaxen cords in your young lives? If so, be very careful.<br><h2><b>Repentance like Cultivating Good Habits</b></h2><br>I would also suggest to you, in the spirit of helpfulness, that the process of repentance is the means of escape from the clutches of sin and is not unlike the process of cultivating a desirable habit. Permit me to make the comparison:<br><br>Step one in habit formation, I said, was to define the habit. Equivalent action in repentance is<i>recognition of error.</i><br><br>Step two in habit formation is to bind yourself to action. This step is repentance is<i>resolve to do better</i>.<br><br>Step three in habit formation is to put the new conduct into operation. In repenting, we<i>reform our living pattern</i>.<br><br>Step four in habit formation is to bolster will or desire. In repenting, we<i>reflect seriously upon the forgiving nature of God and Christ's atonement.</i><br><br>Step five in habit formation is do not look back. In repentance, we<i>refrain from committing the error again.</i><br><br>Step six in habit formation is to plunge wholeheartedly into the new conduct. This action in repentance is<i>complete faith and reliance in the new direction one is taking</i>.<br><br>One Church leader describes repentance as<br><br><i>the process whereby a mortal soul--unclean and stained with the guilt of sin--is enabled to cast off the burden of guilt, wash away the filth of iniquity, and become clean every whit, entirely free from the bondage of sin</i>. [<i>MD</i>, p. 630]<br><br>Without the hopes and prospects embodied in the principle of repentance, it is doubtful that many of us would be able to retain our balance and sanity. We do err frequently; we do fall short of the mark; we often disappoint ourselves and those around us. If a means of escape and relief through repentance were not extended us, we would probably not be strong enough to cope with life.<br><br>One sagging spirit, fettered by remorse for sin, cried out:<br><br><i>I wish that there were some wonderful place</i><br><i>Called the Land of Beginning Again,</i><br><i>Where all our mistakes and all our heartaches</i><br><i>And all of our poor selfish grief</i><br><i>Could be dropped like a shabby old coat at the door,</i><br><i>And never be put on again.</i><br>[Louisa Fletcher, "The Land of Beginning Again,"<i>Best Loved Poems of the American People</i>, selected by Hazel Felleman (Garden City, NY: Garden City Publishing, 1936), p. 101]<br><br>How blessed we are to know that there is a "land of beginning again"! This land is the gospel of Jesus Christ, and the door to it is that blessed principle of repentance. When we apply this principle in the Lord's way, cords and chains are removed, and we are freed from the enemies of our soul.<br><h2><b>A Bad Beginning Not the End</b></h2><br>Some years ago, on this very campus, Elder Robert L. Simpson, one of my beloved quorum associates, spoke about new beginnings and the principle of repentance. I would like to share with you just a portion of his inspired message. He said, speaking to a group much like you:<br><br><i>I can almost hear some of you saying at this very moment, It's all so futile. Here I am only</i>[<i>38 days into the new year</i>]<i>, and already I've goofed twice.</i><br><br><i>Young people, I want to assure you that you're not too far from par for the course. Just about everybody has had a bad start sometime or another. As I was watching the Rose Bowl game on television the other day, I had a flashback of something that happened to me many years ago on a high school football field not too far from that Rose Bowl. Speaking of getting off to a bad start, I think I hold the record. It was my first year in high school football. I'd been playing second string all through the practice games, and this was the first big league game. Six thousand cheering people were in the stands. As we were breaking after our halftime pep talk, the coach suddenly said, "Simpson, you start the second half."</i><br><br><i>The old adrenaline came rushing, and I went charging out onto the field. This was my chance. Just about that time the coach said, "Oh, and by the way, I want you to kick off, Simpson."</i><br><br><i>I determined right then and there that I was going to kick that ball farther than any football had ever been kicked in history. I really wanted to make a good showing on my first chance on the first string. Well, the referee waved his arm and blew his whistle. I could hear those six thousand people. I looked at that ball and came charging down the field. I felt everything tingling in my body; the excitement was so high.</i><br><br><i>Well, you have probably already guessed it. I missed the ball. . . . But that isn't half of it. This was back in the days when the quarterback held the ball with his finger. I broke the quarterback's finger.</i><br><br><i>Now, if you think that you're off to a bad start, I just want to set your mind at ease and let you know that it could be worse. I also want you to know that I had a coach that had confidence</i>[in me]<i>because he left me in. I don't know why, but he did, and I played the rest of the game. If I weren't so modest, I might also tell you that I made all-league that year.</i>["Your 1975 Game Plan,"<i>BYU Speeches of the Year 1975</i>(Provo, Utah: Brigham Young University Press, 1976), pp. 319–20; also<i>Ensign</i>, January 1977, p. 83]<br><br>I love that lesson that is taught in Elder Simpson's experience. A young man of less determination might have been bound to failure by missing that ball. And, if not by that, certainly by breaking the quarterback's finger. However, Elder Simpson had "plasticity" and confidence and resolve, and he repented of his error and made all-league.<br><br>Just one week ago I heard a young man in California at a stake conference talk about repentance, or the "land of beginning again." He shared with us the sequence of actions which, over the course of years, has taught him to respect the advice and direction of his parents. This is the way he outlined it: one, Dan decides to do something; two, Dan talks to his parents; three, parents suggest to Dan that he not do it, and explain why; four, Dan does it anyway; five, Dan winds up in trouble; six, Dan doesn't do that any more. Well, that's the spirit of repentance. That's the spirit of the "land of beginning again," that glorious principle of repentance which is afforded to all of us.<br><h2><b>You Can Avoid the Chains of Satan</b></h2><br>As you give further thought to what I have said about bad habits and sin, I would hope that you would retain foremost in your minds a scene which Enoch was privileged to see. He saw in his vision the coming of the Son of Man, the restoration of the gospel, and many other things. He may even have seen in vision this institution. Then he heard a voice saying,<br><br><i>Wo, wo be unto the inhabitants of the earth.</i><br><br><i>And he beheld Satan; and he had a great chain in his hand, and it veiled the whole face of the earth with darkness; and he looked up and laughed, and his angels rejoiced.</i>[Moses 7:25–26]<br><br>The chain held by Satan is referred to in the scriptures as "the chains of hell" (Alma 12:11), "the bands of iniquity" (Mosiah 23:12), "chains of darkness" (2 Peter 2:4), and "the everlasting chains of death" (Alma 36:18). Such chains are used in making us captives of the evil one. Normally, they are not thrown over a man or a woman suddenly or in one single act. They start as flaxen threads and encumber a person habit by habit, sin by sin, and strand by strand. And if not cut and cast off through the process of repentance, they can become heavy chains and the awful "snare of the devil" (2 Timothy 2:26).<br><br>So, be very careful. While you are here at this institution, while you are in your "plastic" years, identify your weaknesses, replace bad habits with good ones, and avoid any and every appearance of evil. I have one desire for all of you, and that desire is that you will succeed in your academic and religious lives. Please be careful. Do not allow the chains of Satan to fall upon you. Do not allow those little threads to encircle you about. Throw them off. Cut them loose. Do not allow him to make you his. Satan is very uncomfortable, he is very miserable, and he seeks to make you and me miserable like unto himself.<br><br>God bless you, my friends. I bear testimony to you that the gospel of Jesus Christ has been restored to the earth. I have perfect confidence in the principle of repentance. I know that Christ did atone for your sins and mine, if we will but repent. May we take advantage of that which he has provided us and use his grace in moving ourselves forward on the important path which leads to eternal life. This is my prayer this evening in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Carlos E.

<h1>or Such a Time as This” - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
As a member of the Board of Trustees, I recently received a framed mission statement of the Brigham Young University prepared by President Holland. I could see embodied in that document the decisions of the board made over the past few years that I have been a part of that body. We've discussed curricula, faculty members, finances, activities, even such things as the enlargement of the seating capacity of Cougar Stadium. And this morning I want to assure you that providing you with the very best educational opportunities is the basis of every decision made by that group of dedicated leaders. They want you to be prepared to meet every challenge that awaits you, knowing that schooling itself is a challenge, or one long series of them. With midterms soon approaching, you will be required to measure how well you are doing in your classes. In a very real sense, you do not know what you have learned until you put it to a test.<br><h2><b>Situations Reveal Inner Person</b></h2><br>A way of life can be designed to create saints, but it is difficult to measure their progress until a situation arises which reveals the inner person. C. S. Lewis gives an example of this kind of examination when he suggests that a crisis does not cause a person to be charitable or ill tempered; it simply reveals the ill-tempered or charitable person he is.<br><br>We are continually preparing for such tests, great or small, planned or unintended, as the circumstances disclose our strengths or our shortcomings.<br><br>Such is the account of Esther as we find it in the Bible. The young and lovely Esther had only recently been made queen, and the king, not aware that she was Jewish, had allowed a proclamation to be sent throughout the kingdom that all the Jewish people should be killed on a particular day. Mordecai, her foster father, realized that Esther might be able to save her people. He sent word for her to go before the king and plead with him to spare the Jews. It was a difficult task for Esther, who, although she was queen, did not have the right to go to the king unless he called for her.<br><br>If she were to go, and he refused to acknowledge her, she would be put to death, and yet she was probably the only one in a position to help. It was a moment of great decision for young Queen Esther. She was being asked to risk her life for her people.<br><br>Mordecai helped her to see, beyond her own peril, the opportunity she was being given when he counseled,<br><br><i>Who knoweth whether thou art come to the kingdom for such a time as this?</i>[Esther 4:14]<br><br>In one of the greatest demonstrations of courage found in the Old Testament, Esther did go, and she won the king's favor. Confronting the king at the risk of her life did not make Esther courageous; rather, it revealed the courage that was within her--the courage, the compassion, the devotion to her people.<br><br>I am deeply touched by her response:<br><br><i>Go, gather together all the Jews that are present in Shushan, and fast ye for me, and neither eat nor drink three days, night or day: I also and my maidens will fast likewise: and so will I go.</i>[Esther 4:16]<br><br>Few of us will have the opportunity to plead before a king, but all of us will find out at some time whether we can respond "greatly" when faced with an unexpected challenge.<br><br>We have no reason to believe that Esther had prepared specifically for the role she had to play, and yet all her life was preparation, as mine is and as yours is.<br><br>Preparation may be conscious and skillful or casual and undirected, but, in either case, it is cumulative. As the late Richard L. Evans reminds us:<br><br><i>What is going to happen is happening.</i><br><br>We may not realize it at the moment of choice, but our response is an infallible index of what we have become.<br><br>One of our favorite Church stories is that of President McKay when he was a young man loading stock for market with his brothers.<br><br>The McKay brothers, unlike many of their neighbors, did not dress in overalls and heavy boots when they were working. By rural standards they were elegantly turned out as they loaded calves, sheep, and hogs into the waiting wagons with speed and grace before an admiring crowd of small boys. Nearing the end of their labor, young David O. decided he would hoist the last hog aboard all by himself. As he started the mighty heave it would take, he slipped--and ended with the hog on top of him and both of them deep in the loading corral mud. The boys on, and peering through, the fence waited expectantly.<br><br>Slowly, David extricated himself, wiped futilely at the muck that now almost covered him, and then said to the assembled youngsters, "No use waiting, boys; I'm not going to swear!"<br><br>His decision not to swear on this occasion was the same as it had been on many occasions. The control of his tongue, in a moment of stress and humiliation, was reinforced by the countless other times when he had resisted the easy and insecure recourse of profanity.<br><br>We rarely succumb to temptation in one overpowering moment. The strength of living by a principle is built line upon line, time upon time, of facing a moment of challenge and responding appropriately. Every important choice is the inevitable result of a hundred earlier choices. And so it was that Esther, who had been reared in a home of faith and obedience, was prepared for her great test of courage. She not only determined to go in to the king unbidden but was ready to accept the full consequence of her act, saying,<br><br><i>[I will] go in unto the king, which is not according to the law: and if I perish, I perish.</i>[Esther 4:16]<br><br>I thought of Esther when I learned of a young soldier who, upon returning from Vietnam, bore his testimony. His job was to go ahead of his company as they moved into a new area of battle, checking the fields for mines and testing the enemy fire. He said, "Although I knew I might get shot in the head at any moment, I also knew that the next moment would be better than anything I had ever known."<br><br>Maxwell Anderson, in revealing young Joan of Arc, another who had lived so that she could respond magnificently to great challenges, wrote lines that might describe the feelings of any young person who must consider giving her life or his life for a righteous cause:<br><br><i>Every man gives his life for what he believes. Every woman gives her life for what she believes. Sometimes people believe in little or nothing, nevertheless, they give up their lives to that little or nothing. One life is all we have, and we live it as we believe in living it, and then it's gone. But to surrender what you are, and live without belief--that's more terrible than dying--more terrible than dying young.</i>[<i>Joan of Lorraine</i>, a play in two acts (Washington, D.C.: Anderson House, 1947), p.127]<br><h2><b>Ability to Adjust Is Crucial</b></h2><br>In most lives, however, there will not come the dramatic either/or of live or die, but there may come the necessity to adjust, to alter our expectations. Most of us will have the chance to learn the meaning of "Thy will, not mine, be done."<br><br>The Lord has let us see the problem Jonah had with this kind of adaptation, and it can be instructive to us. Jonah was not quick to respond when the Lord asked him to go and preach against Ninevah. Only after his experience in the whale did he accept this call. Then, when the people of Ninevah unexpectedly repented, one and all (even their cattle wore sackcloth) and the Lord did not destroy them as Jonah had promised, once again he could not adjust, but went off to himself, sat under a booth, and pouted.<br><br>He was experiencing what many of you would recognize as cognitive dissonance--the inability to accept something that is in conflict with what you think it should be. Professor Terry Warner's small child said it charmingly: "It's when you know what you want to do and what's right to do, and you get a fuss in your mind."<br><br>I think we have all experienced the frustration or the feeling of loss, verging on abandonment, when plans we have counted on seem to go very wrong. But to see someone who can accept deep disappointment and adjust or even triumph is profoundly moving. It is especially so for parents who would, on the one hand, wish to spare their children any sorrow or pain and, on the other, desire nothing more than to have them become strong and able to withstand trials.<br><br>Let me share with you the love story of our high school basketball star--at least he was a star to me and to my beautiful blond coed who, as a pep club member, always chose to decorate his room, to make him treats like cupcakes or cookies, and to letter him clever posters during the state tournaments. It didn't take too many of those experiences before they started to date. She loved to watch him play. She would keep the game statistics privately so that she could discuss them with him, encouraging him when he especially needed it and keeping him from becoming too proud if he had an exceptionally good night. Their casual, fun dating turned into genuine courtship with marriage plans--in the future, because he had a mission to complete. Both of those things happened as they hoped they would. Then came their temple marriage. Many guests at their wedding reception would comment on the fact that they were a perfect couple. The bride was radiant and beautiful. The groom was considered handsome. Frequently I would hear the comment, "I can't wait to see your children. They will be knockouts!"<br><br>They, too, dreamed and planned for the happy day when they would have lovely children, and they openly declared that they wanted to have a basketball team of their very own sons. The day arrived when they were to welcome their firstborn child into the world. We went to the hospital to be with them. Each moment seemed long, and it was filled with excitement and anticipation and that constant hope that it would be the beginning of their basketball team. Their star was about to be born.<br><br>When they wheeled the mother out of the delivery room, we asked expectantly, "Well, was it a boy or a girl?"<br><br>"It's a boy!" said the proud new father, and we rejoiced together. Then, they uncovered his legs, and we saw that he had twisted, malformed feet.<br><br>Quickly his brave little mother said, "My mother said my foot was crooked when I was born; perhaps they will straighten themselves out." But the doctor confirmed the fact that only surgery could give him normal use of his feet.<br><br>He had surgery. He wore casts, then braces. We laughed when a neighbor boy said, "Why can't I wear shoes like Davy?" By the way, he was a knockout. He had red hair and a sweet, happy disposition. And he was given a name that connotes a special love, but the basketball dreams and plans of those two people were shattered. They had to begin anew to think about what they really wanted for him. That little boy was taught to walk and play and run, and he can handle a ball about as well as any boy his age, but he will never excel in basketball the way that they had planned.<br><br>An even more sobering account is that of my friend whose husband was one of the top ten medical students at Temple University. On the night before his graduation, he fell and severely fractured his skull. He was in a coma for six weeks. After recovering he had many hard decisions to make--like whether to continue his training for surgery, or if it would be better to become a dermatologist. He and his sweetheart carefully considered the extent of his injury and the demanding field he had chosen, and it was decided that there would be less strain, and probably greater success, if he changed his specialty. Another difficult decision was whether to marry. He asked himself if he would be well enough and capable of caring for a wife and children. After hours and hours of discussion and planning they finally determined that, perhaps if he had plenty of rest and good care, he could continue to heal, and he could assume the responsibilities of a husband and father. Other than the constant pain in his head, he led a somewhat normal life and had a good practice for thirteen years. Three children were born to him and his wife during that time, and then all their fears came to pass. The pain was so constant and so intense, and he became so forgetful, that upon the best medical advice he underwent surgery to remove the adhesions that filled his head. They were successfully removed, but he contracted meningitis with the accompanying high fever. He lost control of his bodily functions. His memory was irreparably damaged, and his wife could no longer give him the complete care he needed at home. He would have to be hospitalized for as long as he lived. Brokenheartedly, she faced the reality that this special chapter of their lives together had to be closed. A new one was opening. It was one of faith, love, devotion, and further adaption.<br><br>For 22 years this courageous woman has worked to support herself and their children, but during this time, through her determined effort, she has made their father a very special part of their lives. She has taken their family activities to his hospital room as often as possible although many times he couldn't even remember that family had been there.<br><br>Many have said to the wife, "There isn't a court in the land that wouldn't give you a divorce."<br><br>She smiles and says, "At another time and in another place we want to be together honoring the commitments we have made to each other. He won't have the encumbrance of a broken body then, and we will be able to live abundantly and everlastingly together."<br><br>Making long-range plans brings us the pleasure that comes with expectation and progress that is the result of purpose. But other essential growth and a more profound joy can often come from adjusting our hopes to an altered and perhaps eternal plan.<br><h2><b>Character Is Built Day by Day</b></h2><br>This is an important time for you to be thinking ahead and determining objectives, but while you have future goals clearly projected, don't fail to appreciate the present. Your objective is not more important than how you reach it. We might focus so totally upon a goal that we fail to realize that our life is being spent on our way to achieving it. Santayana philosophized,<br><br><i>Life is what happens while we are planning for something else.</i><br><br>Graduation is important, but the direction your life takes may be more greatly influenced by the things you experience while you are earning your degree. If for some of you the desire for marriage is your reason for being here, don't fail to realize that the quality of your married life will be affected by those things you are learning, and the time you look forward to is no more important than your life each day while here in your classes.<br><br>Someone has remarked that the trouble with life is that it is so daily. But it is our reactions to that day-by-day demand that determines the stature of our lives. How you react when the apple machine eats your quarter or what you do when the ticket window you have waited three hours to reach closes three persons in front of you--these make a difference; they are building experiences. The everyday prices and not the seasonal sales determine a store's character and clientele. Similarly, the consistent careful choices, the daily decisions, shape the nature of a man or woman. Esther's great contribution to her people was made not as a climactic achievement of a long-pursued goal but as an indication of her readiness to respond to a current crisis.<br><h2><b>Decisions Reach beyond Self</b></h2><br>Esther's heroic stand in a time of great peril has given others courage to encounter the problems of life. Her selfless allegiance to her people, the people of the Lord, inspires our dedication and loyalty today. In this way her life was not for one time only but a legacy to succeeding generations and peoples.<br><br>Great lives have enduring imprint.<br><br>Joshua could say that he and his house would serve the Lord because, in choosing for himself, he established a new way of life for his family, and, while he could not control their every action, he provided a model that was their legacy.<br><br>In our more recent history, too, we find people who lived as examples. Sarah Melissa Granger was just fifteen years old when she went to Nauvoo to join the Saints. It was the Nauvoo of the 1840 period, with the persecution beginning and the Saints pushing to complete the temple, for they knew that when the temple was finished they would become a covenant people.<br><br>Sarah was very much interested in the doctrine and revelations of her newfound faith. She attended the School of the Prophets and discussed the principles she learned there with her father. In later years she referred to her attendance at the School of the Prophets to underscore the emphasis she placed upon doctrinal study among Latter-day Saint women.<br><br>When she was about twenty-two, she married Hiram Kimball. Sarah was a member of the Church. Hiram was not. He was later baptized, but, when their first baby was born, the Nauvoo Temple walls were only about three feet above their foundation. The Saints needed money to complete the building. Sarah wanted to make a contribution to the temple project, but she wanted it to be her contribution, not her husband's. Even though he was well off financially and could afford to give generously to the Church, that didn't meet her needs as she saw them. She thought a great deal about how she could fulfill her responsibility. Then, she came up with an idea. She had a new baby boy just three days old. When her husband came to her bedside to admire the baby, she asked, "What is the boy worth?"<br><br>"Oh, I don't know," he said. "He's worth a great deal."<br><br>"Is he worth a thousand dollars?"<br><br>"Yes, more than that if he lives and does well."<br><br>"Then," she said, "half of him is mine, is it not?"<br><br>"Yes, I suppose so."<br><br>"I have something then to help on the temple," she said.<br><br>"Have you?" questioned her husband.<br><br>"Yes, I think I'll turn my share (of the baby) in as tithing."<br><br>"Well, I'll see about that," said her husband.<br><br>Soon after that conversation, her husband, who was a major in the Nauvoo Legion, met with the Prophet. Her Hiram said, "Sarah proposes to turn the boy out as Church property," and then he related their entire discussion.<br><br>President Joseph Smith seemed pleased with the joke. "I accept all such donations," was his reply, "and from this day the boy shall stand recorded as Church property." He turned to Willard Richards and directed, "Make a record of this, and you are my witness."<br><br>Then he turned back to the father and said,<br><br>"Major, you now have the privilege of paying $500 and retaining possession, or receiving $500 and giving possession."<br><br>To which the new father responded, "Will you accept the reserve block of property north of the temple (as payment)?"<br><br>"It is just what we want," said the Prophet.<br><br>The deed was made out. Later the Prophet said to Sarah, "You have consecrated your firstborn son; for this you are blessed of the Lord. . . . Your name shall be handed down in honorable remembrance from generation to generation,"<br><br>Sarah Kimball could translate her vision of the eternal truths into daily living. Perhaps her life was best described by a woman who knew her well who said, "The name<i>Sarah M. Kimball</i>is synonymous with charity."<br><h2><b>Live for the Legacy You Leave</b></h2><br>But what of you in your time? You find yourselves in years of expectation and growth unsure of the opportunities and difficulties which life in your future will provide for you. And yet you are here to prepare, and prepare you must. You must develop the intellectual integrity and spiritual strength which will be a reservoir sufficient to meet each challenge with knowledge and testimony. Just as we store food against uncertain need, we must treasure up wisdom and truth that will enable us and future generations to meet each day's certain need with confidence independent of the circumstances in which it is manifest.<br><br>A story told by Elder Vaughn J. Featherstone reminds us "that one life is all we have." The way we live it can influence others endlessly. Let me tell you the story.<br><br>At the height of the gangster era in Chicago there was an attorney who was renowned for his ability to keep his mobster clients out of jail. Few have been as adept at manipulating legal procedures to protect their criminal clients. As his reputation grew, so did his wealth, and after a time he had acquired a large estate in the suburbs of Chicago and had married well.<br><br>Shortly after his marriage, however, he and his wife had their first child, a son. As this young attorney reflected on the legacy that he would leave his son, he quickly saw that the wealth and reputation as an attorney for the underworld were worth little when compared to a legacy of honor, courage, and truth.<br><br>The attorney determined that, although it might cost him his life, he would go to the police and reveal the knowledge that he had of criminal activities of the mob in Chicago. When he approached the police, they cautioned him, saying they could never provide sufficient protection to ensure his safety, but despite their caution he gave them information which led to the convictions of several leading members of the mob.<br><br>Less than a year after his testimony the young attorney was gunned down by associates of those he had helped convict. And yet he had left his son the legacy of honor, truth, and courage that he had hoped to leave.<br><br>In another story of heroism a young man called Butch O'Hare, while serving as an aviator in the Pacific during World War II, was forced on an occasion to return from his squadron to the aircraft carrier because of mechanical difficulties with his fighter plane.<br><br>While returning he spotted a squadron of Japanese Zeros preparing to attack his carrier. Although far outnumbered and handicapped by a partially disabled plane, Butch O'Hare attacked the squadron of Zeros, and through his heroism saved the lives of many of his comrades as he demonstrated his courage and skill by disabling plane after plane of the Japanese squadron.<br><br>For his courage young Butch O'Hare received numerous citations and awards including the honor of having the airport in his home town of Chicago named after him, "O'Hare International."<br><br>These two stories of courage are more than geographically related because, you see, the father of the World War II flying ace Butch O'Hare was the young attorney who had given his life so that he could leave his young son a legacy of courage and honor.<br><br>Let me conclude by telling you that at eighty years of age my father had to have his leg amputated, and because of that operation the last year of his life was particularly difficult. At his funeral Elder Thomas S. Monson spoke. He said:<br><br><i>I suppose his greatest battle has occurred in the last few months, but he rose to the occasion, and he demonstrated to each one of us that he is the man that we knew him to be. I've seen courage many times--in the navy, in life. I've read about courage. But I don't know when I've seen courage to excel that of my friend as he overcame the handicap of his lost limb and, to the amazement of the doctors, at his age developed the ability to use his artificial limb in such a way that he could be proud of his accomplishment and could do many things that other people felt he never again would do.</i><br><br>These words and my father's example have been a rich legacy of continuing strength for me and for my family, far more important than the earthly treasures of wealth or position he probably would like to have left us, but didn't.<br><br>The queen, a prophet in embryo, the athlete, the medical student, the wife, the soldier, the pilot, the attorney, the Relief Society leader--all were surrounded by difficult circumstances not of their choosing, but the decisions they had earlier made prepared them to respond courageously.<br><br>It was so also with Jesus. Day by day he made decisions so that he could be the great example of courage. Do you remember when he said to his mother after she had been anxious and sought him for three days,<br><br><i>Wist ye not that I must be about my father's business?</i>[Luke 2:49]<br><br>And then it was that he went with his parents back to Nazareth and because of that decision grew in wisdom and in stature and in favor with God and man.<br><br>His character was crucial because, as he was there on that cross, we could see it evidenced as he said,<br><br><i>Father forgive them; for they know not what they do.</i>[Luke 23:34]<br><br>May each of us prepare daily so that we may have the strength and the courage to make those decisions that will be ours for such times of challenge as they come to us, I humbly pray in the name of Jesus Christ.

<h1>nvenient Messiah -Jeffrey R. Holland - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Henry Adams once said that any succession of American presidents that could start with George Washington and lead to Ulysses S. Grant disproved forever the theory of evolution. I may well be striking it another fatal blow by inserting myself into an otherwise outstanding devotional calendar. But one of the advantages of being president of the university is that when you ask to be the speaker, they have to let you. Let me tell you why I'm intruding.<br><br>I have been a little frustrated that the only real chance I get to address you is in our opening President's Assembly the first week of the school year. As you well know, the atmosphere that day is a cross somewhere between Disneyworld and a Jamaican pep rally. I love that first hour with you, but neither the time restraints we face there nor the frame of mind you are in is very conducive to much of a presidential message. So after thinking about it for awhile, Sister Holland and I have determined to continue being chief animal tamers at the fall welcoming assembly and then sometime early in the winter semester--like now--we will have a slightly more serious moment with you about things we feel deeply and hope you will enjoy. So in that spirit I wish to ask Sister Holland to greet you and take a few moments to share her thoughts and testimony with you.<br><h2><b>Patricia Holland</b></h2><br>As my husband said, this is a little different setting than the opening assembly. There you are bright eyed and bushy tailed, ready to set the world on fire, or at least one of the kitchens in Heritage Halls. Now as I watch you on campus, I think I detect a terminal case of the mid-winter blahs. Your roommate probably has mono, your grades have switched from Fahrenheit to centigrade as they approach absolute zero, your holiday menu consisted of no real date and lots of very real turkey, and you're broke. Other than that it's probably been a great winter.<br><br>I've come to you today in kind of a motherly way, if you'll indulge me, to speak to those of you who feel a little bit disappointed at this point, and thus, a little bit discouraged. May I just share with you a personal disappointment we've had in our home recently. A few months ago our daughter, Mary, decided to run for president of her seventh-grade class. She was encouraged by a teacher who felt she could win, and so she began to campaign with lots of enthusiasm and a great deal of confidence. Both her parents and her brothers rallied behind and gave her all the support and help we could.<br><br>Well, she lost. Now I was told this earlier in the day before Mary got home from school, and you know mothers. I was totally devastated for her, and I just churned with emotions all day and most of the day hoped for something that I could say that might comfort her. When I heard her footsteps at the door, my heart and my feet leaped to the rescue, and all the words of comfort I could think of came tumbling out.<br><br>And you know, she just looked at me for a few minutes and then with sad little brown eyes she said, "Mother, will you just pray with me?"<br><br>As we knelt in prayer, she said, "Heavenly Father, I promised you I'd do anything if I could win, and now I know I must show how to be a good loser." And then she said, "I don't want you to be my servant anymore. I just want to be yours."<br><br>You see, it was because of her pain and disappointment that she was given to say in a twelve-year-old way, "Maybe what I wanted would not be the best thing to serve you at all."<br><br>I guess what I've come to you today to say is that God uses broken things--and I quote:<br><br><i>It takes broken soil to produce a crop, broken clouds to give rain, broken grain to give bread, broken bread to give strength. It is the broken alabaster box that gives forth perfume. ... it is Peter, weeping bitterly, who returns to greater power than ever.</i>["Broken Things," an excerpt from Vance Havner,<i>The Still Water</i>(Old Tappan, NJ: Flemming H. Revell, 1934). Quoted in<i>Guideposts</i>, October 1981, p. 5]<br><br>Our Father in Heaven sometimes uses our pain as a megaphone for very significant instruction as he did with Joseph Smith, with Spencer W. Kimball, with Mary Holland. And as he did with Peter who, weeping bitterly, returned to greater power and service than ever.<br><br>I want you, all of you, to know of my testimony of the divinity of the Savior and of his church to which this university is ancillary. It too is a servant. I also have a firm conviction that, if you trust in him, the growth and development and challenges you experience here at this university will be part of his design and ministry. And of this I bear testimony in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><h2><b>President Holland</b></h2><br>Many of you are aware, and all of you ought to be, that Elder Bruce R. McConkie has been writing and publishing a series of books on the Savior, tracing his role in the eternal plan from the councils in heaven through his earthly life to his exaltation in eternity. That series of books, entitled in several volumes as<i>The Promised Messiah, The Mortal Messiah</i>, and the soon-to-be-published<i>Millennial Messiah</i>, has been a part of my personal study material over these past several months of their publication.<br><br>For my purposes today, and with reasonable assurance that I won't infringe on Elder McConkie's series, I have labeled my remarks "The Inconvenient Messiah." I wish to speak this morning of the demands of discipline and discipleship, of the responsibilities we have to face when we choose to follow Jesus Christ. In the Savior's life and in ours, Satan counters such discipline with temptations of an easier way, with an offer of "convenient Christianity." It is a temptation Jesus resisted, and so must we. Life was very inconvenient for him, and, unless I miss my guess, it will often be so for you and for me when we take upon us his name.<br><br>Frankly I would prefer to speak with you individually about such temptations. I would be thrilled if at this very large university there were a way to have that kind of personal moment with you. Because that doesn't seem possible, let me generalize as best<i>I</i>can and let you make some application in your life the best<i>you</i>can.<br><h2><b>Open Rebellion</b></h2><br>Probably the most easily recognizable kind of evil is that which simply rebels openly against heaven, as Satan rebelled before the world was--willful, wanton opposition to God and his angels. From Cain through Caligula down to today's domestic and international hostilities, Satan has attempted to lure children of promise into violent, destructive rejection of the gospel and its teachings. These are harsh sins which the world has known only too well but from which, in large measure, we are protected at this university nestled safely near the everlasting hills. We are, for the most part, untouched by wars and tyranny and terror. Indeed when measured against this world's history where, to quote Nephi, Satan does "<i>rage</i>in the hearts of ... men" (2 Nephi 28:20), this truly is Happy Valley. We have very few ragers between Payson and Lehi.<br><h2><b>More Subtle Temptations</b></h2><br>But there is another, more subtle tactic used by the primeval turncoat which is not so violent, not so vengeful, and at first glance not so vicious. But, ah, there's the rub. Because Christ and his disciples--Satan's most important and necessary targets--would never seem to be attracted by flagrant, raging wrongdoing, this second approach becomes all the more sinister. It comes in the siren's song of convenience. It is, in the parlance of your day, "laid back." It says to every would-be Messiah--"Enjoy!" Its anthem might well be from Diana Ross--"Ease on Down the Road." Surely fluttering somewhere over the highway to hell is the local chamber of horrors banner reading, "Welcome to the ethics of ease."<br><br><i>Then Jesus was led up of the Spirit, into the wilderness, to be with God.</i><br><br><i>And when he had fasted forty days and forty nights, and had communed with God, he was afterwards an hungered, and was left to be tempted of the devil,</i><br><br><i>And when the tempter came to him, he said, If thou be the Son of God, command that these stones be made bread.</i><br><br><i>But Jesus answered and said, It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.</i><br><br><i>Then Jesus was taken up into the holy city, and the Spirit setteth him on the pinnacle of the temple.</i><br><br><i>Then the devil came unto him and said, If thou be the Son of God, cast thyself down, for it is written, He shall give his angels charge concerning thee, and in their hands they shall bear thee up, lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone.</i><br><br><i>And Jesus said unto him, It is written again, Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God.</i><br><br><i>And again Jesus was in the Spirit, and it taketh him up into an exceeding high mountain, and showeth him all the kingdoms of the world, and the glory of them.</i><br><br><i>And the devil came unto him again, and said, All these things will I give unto thee, if thou wilt fall down and worship me.</i><br><br><i>Then said Jesus unto him, Get thee hence, Satan; for it is written, thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve.</i><br><br><i>Then the devil leaveth him, and, behold, angels came and ministered unto him.</i>[JST Matthew 4:1–10, KJV Matthew 4:11]<br><br>One new convert to Christianity wrote of this moment:<br><br><i>Christ withdrew alone to the desert to fast and pray in preparation for a dialogue with the Devil. Such a dialogue was inescapable; every virtue has to be cleared with the Devil, as every vice is torn with anguish out of God's heart.</i>[Malcom Muggeridge,<i>Jesus Rediscovered</i>(Garden City, NY: Doubleday, 1969), p. 26]<br><br>Because I believe such dialogues are entertained day after day, hour after hour, right here on the Brigham Young University campus--Happy Valley, USA--and because for us, like Christ, these temptations are far more tantalizing in their nature than the more hostile versions pursued by barbarians, let me comment briefly on the three. Each of them deserves a sermon on its own, and we will be limited by the clock to only a sentence or two.<br><h2><b>Appeals to the Appetites</b></h2><br><i>"If thou be the Son of God, command that these stones be made bread."</i><br><br>Whatever else Satan may do, he will certainly appeal to our appetites. Far better to play on natural, acknowledged needs than struggle to plant in us artificial ones. Here Jesus experiences the real and very understandable hunger for food by which he must sustain his mortal life. We would not deny anyone this relief; certainly we would not deny the Son of Man. Israel had its manna in the wilderness. This is Israel's God. He has fasted for forty days and forty nights. Why not eat? He seems ready to break his fast, or surely must soon. Why not simply turn the stones to bread and eat?<br><br>The temptation is<i>not</i>in the eating. He has eaten before, he will soon eat again, and he must eat for the rest of his mortal life. The temptation, at least the part I wish to focus on, is to do it<i>this way</i>, to get his bread--his physical satisfaction, relief for his human appetite--the easy way, by abuse of power and without a willingness to wait for the right time and the right way. It is the temptation to be the convenient Messiah. Why do things the hard way? Why walk to the shop--or bakery? Why travel all the way home? Why deny yourself satisfaction when with ever such a slight compromise you might enjoy this much-needed nourishment? But Christ will not ask selfishly for unearned bread. He will postpone gratification, indefinitely if necessary, rather than appease appetite--even ravenous appetite--with what is not his.<br><br>There is too much sexual transgression on this campus.<i>Any</i>is too much, and we have<i>much</i>too much. This highest of all physical gratifications you were designed and created to enjoy. It is as natural as it is appealing. It is given of God to make us like God. And Satan has certainly capitalized on a divinely ordained appeal. But it is not yours without price. Not instantly. Not conveniently. Not with cozy corruption of eternal powers. It is to be earned, over time and with discipline. It, like every good thing, is God's right to bestow, not Satan's. When faced with that inherent appetite, a disciple of Christ<i>must</i>be willing to say, "Yes, but<i>not this way</i>." In time, with love, after marriage. The right and proper and sanctified physical relationship of a man and a woman is as much a part--indeed more a part--of God's plan for us as is the eating of our daily bread. But there is no convenient Messiah. Salvation comes only through discipline and sacrifice. Listen to the historians who wrote this after a lifetime of studying the story of civilization:<br><br><i>No one man, however brilliant or well-informed, can come in one lifetime to such fullness of understanding as to safely judge and dismiss the customs or institutions of his society, for these are the wisdom of generations after centuries of experiment in the laboratory of history. A youth boiling with hormones will wonder why he should not give full freedom to his sexual desires; and if he is unchecked by custom, morals, or laws, he may ruin his life before he matures sufficiently to understand that sex is a river of fire that must be banked and cooled by a hundred restraints if it is not to consume in chaos both the individual and the group.</i>[Will and Ariel Durant,<i>The Lessons of History</i>(New York: Simon and Schuster, 1968), pp. 35–36]<br><br>And we have purposes the Durants never dreamed of, "promises to keep, and miles to go before we sleep" (Robert Frost, "Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening"). I plead with you not to yield to what one has called the "glandular stench" of our times. In your hours of temptation and vulnerability I ask you not, in your case, to turn bread into stone with that fire that has gone unbanked and uncooled. Those loaves will be millstones--bogus bread--weighted with heartache and despair and pain. Care more. It is too easy today with movies you can see and the magazines you can read. It is all tragically, painfully, cunningly convenient. In our time the only restraint left is self-restraint. I ask you to say of this highest, most intimate, most sacred physical expression, "Yes, but<i>not this way</i>." I ask you to be inconvenienced until you've earned the right and paid the divine price to know the body and the soul of the one you love. Excuse me for speaking boldly, but this must be said. Perhaps another time we can say even more.<br><h2><b>Temptations of the Spirit</b></h2><br><i>"If thou be the Son of God, cast thyself down from the pinnacle of this temple."</i><br><br>Satan knows this holy scripture is the center of religious life for Israel's people. It is the edifice to which the promised Messiah must come. Many are even now coming and going from their worship, many of who through their traditions and disbelief will never accept Jesus as their Redeemer. Why not cast yourself down in a dramatic way and then, when the angels bear you up, as the scriptures say they must, legions will follow you and believe? They need you. You need them--to save their souls. These are covenant people. How better to help them see than to cast yourself off this holy temple unharmed and unafraid? The Messiah has indeed come.<br><br>The temptation here is even more subtle than the first. It is a temptation of the spirit, of a private hunger more real than the need for bread. Would God save him? Would he? Is Jesus to have divine companionship in this awesome ministry he now begins? He knows that among the children of men only suffering, denunciation, betrayal, and rejection lie ahead. But what about heaven? How alone does a Messiah have to be? Perhaps before venturing forth he ought to get final reassurance. And shouldn't Satan be silenced with his insidious "If, if, if"? Why not get spiritual confirmation, a loyal congregation, and an answer to this imp who heckles--all with one appeal to God's power? Right now. The easy way. Off the temple spire.<br><br>But Jesus refuses the temptation of the spirit. Denial and restraint there are also part of divine preparation. He will gain followers, and he will receive reassurance. But<i>not this way</i>. Neither the converts nor the comforts he will so richly deserve have been earned yet. His ministry has hardly begun. The rewards will come by and by. But even the Son of God must wait. The Redeemer who would never bestow cheap grace on others was not likely to ask for any himself.<br><br>And so I ask you to be patient in things of the spirit. Perhaps your life has been different from mine, but I doubt it. I have had to struggle to know my standing before God. As a teenager I found it hard to pray and harder to fast. My mission was not easy. I struggled as a student only to find that I had to struggle afterwards, too. In this present assignment I have wept and ached for guidance. It seems no worthy accomplishment has ever come easily for me, and maybe it won't for you--but I'm living long enough to be grateful for that.<br><br>It is ordained that we come to know our worth as children of God<i>without</i>something as dramatic as a leap from the pinnacle of the temple. All but a prophetic few must go about God's work in very quiet, very unspectacular ways. And as you labor to know him, and to know that he knows you; as you invest your time--and your convenience--in quiet, unassuming service, you will indeed find that "he shall give his angels charge concerning thee: and in their hands they shall bear thee up" (Matthew 4:6). It may not come quickly. It probably won't come quickly, but there is purpose in the time it takes. Cherish your spiritual burdens because God will converse with you through them and will use you to do his work if you carry them well. Do you recognize this struggle? The date is 14 July 1943.<br><br><i>No peace had yet come, though I had prayed for it almost unceasingly. ... I turned toward the hills. I had no objective. I wanted only to be alone. I had begun a fast....</i><br><br><i>My weakness overcame me again. Hot tears came flooding down my cheeks as I made no effort to mop them up. I was accusing myself, and condemning myself and upbraiding myself. I was praying aloud for special blessings from the Lord. I was telling him that I had not asked for this position, that I was incapable of doing the work, that I was imperfect and weak and human, that I was unworthy of so noble a calling, though I had tried hard and my heart had been right. I knew that I must have been at least partly responsible for offenses and misunderstandings which a few people fancied they had suffered at my hands. I realized that I had been petty and small many times. I did not spare myself. A thousand things passed through my mind. Was I called by revelation?...</i><br><br><i>If I could only have the assurance that my call had been inspired most of my other worries would be dissipated. ...I knew that I must have His acceptance before I could go on. I stumbled up the hill and onto the mountain, as the way became rough. I faltered some as the way became steep. No paths were there to follow; I climbed on and on. Never had I prayed before as I now prayed. What I wanted and felt I must have was an assurance that I was acceptable to the Lord. I told Him that I neither wanted nor was worthy of a vision or appearance of angels or any special manifestation. I wanted only the calm peaceful assurance that my offering was accepted. Never before had I been tortured as I was now being tortured. And the assurance did not come....</i><br><br><i>I mentally beat myself and chastised myself and accused myself. As the sun came up and moved in the sky I moved with it, lying in the sun, and still I received no relief. I sat up on the cliff and strange thoughts came to me: all this anguish and suffering could be ended so easily from this high cliff and then came to my mind the temptations of the Master when he was tempted to cast Himself down--then I was ashamed for having placed myself in a comparable position and trying to be dramatic. ... I was filled with remorse because I had permitted myself to place myself ... in a position comparable, in a small degree, to the position the Saviour found Himself in when He was tempted, and ... I felt I had cheapened the experiences of the Lord, having compared mine with His. Again I challenged myself and told myself that I was only trying to be dramatic and sorry for myself.</i><br><br><i>... I lay on the cool earth. The thought came that I might take cold, but what did it matter now. There was one great desire, to get a testimony of my calling, to know that it was not human and inspired by ulterior motives, kindly as they might be. How I prayed! How I suffered! How I wept! How I struggled!</i>[Edward L. Kimball and Andrew E. Kimball, Jr.,<i>Spencer W. Kimball</i>(Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1977), p. 192–95]<br><br>Now at this very hour 38 years and a mountain of tumors and troubles later, this sweet and godly man clings to life<i>not</i>because that life has been convenient but because he feels there might be one more mountain to climb, one more obstacle of body or spirit that needs to be overcome. The spiritual odyssey of Andrew Kimball's son has been anything but easy. And maybe that of your father's son or your mother's daughter will require patience and perseverance too.<br><br>So if your prayers don't always seem answered, take heart. One greater than you or President Kimball cried, "Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani? My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?" (Matthew 27:46). If for a while the harder you try, the harder it gets, take heart. So it has been with the best people who ever lived.<br><h2><b>"Name Your Price."</b></h2><br>Now in some frustration Satan moves right to the point. If he cannot tempt physically and cannot tempt spiritually, he will simply make an outright proposition. From a high mountain where they might overlook the kingdoms of the world and the glory of them, Satan says,<i>"All these things will I give thee, if thou wilt fall down and worship me."</i><br><br>Satan makes up for lack of subtlety here with the grandeur of his offer. Never mind that these kingdoms are not ultimately his to give. He simply asks of the great Jehovah, God of heaven and earth, "What is your price? Cheap bread you resist. Tawdry messianic drama you resist, but no man can resist this world's wealth.<i>Name your price</i>." Satan is proceeding under his first article of faithlessness--the unequivocal belief that you can buy anything in this world for money.<br><h2><b>Not This Way</b></h2><br>Jesus will one day rule the world. He will govern every principality and power in it. He will be King of kings and Lord of lords.<i>But not this way</i>. Indeed to arrive at the point at all, he has to follow a most inconvenient course. Nothing so simple as worshiping Satan or for that matter nothing so simple as worshiping God. At least not in the way some of us think worshiping is simple. His arrival at the throne of grace is to lead through travail and sorrow and sacrifice. Some seven centuries earlier Isaiah had prophesied of him,<br><br><i>He is despised and rejected of men; a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief: and we hid as it were our faces from him; he was despised, and we esteemed him not....</i><br><br><i>... He was wounded for our transgression, he was bruised for our iniquities. ...</i><br><br><i>He was oppressed, and he was afflicted, yet he opened not his mouth: he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter, and ... openeth not his mouth.</i>[Isaiah 53:3, 5, 7]<br><br>Should earning our place in the kingdom of God be so difficult as that? Surely there is an easier way? Can't we buy our way in? Every man or woman does have a price, don't they? Can't you buy anything in this world for money? Sometimes we wonder. I offer one sobering fact about our lives together.<i>BYU is not here to help you make money</i>. Any university in this land can do that. We hope your education brings income sufficient for your needs, but we have no mission at all if we are simply turning you out into the best current job market, whatever and wherever that may be. BYU has been established to extend to you the very glory of God, his intelligence, his light, and his truth. And that light and truth, by scriptural promise, is to forsake the evil one, your tempter. No, not everyone<i>does</i>have a price. Some things<i>can't</i>be purchased. Money and fame and earthly glory are not our eternal standard. Indeed these can, if we are not careful, lead to eternal torment.<br><br>Emerson said once,<br><br><i>Things are in the saddle,</i><br><i>And ride mankind.</i><br>["Ode Inscribed to W. H. Channing,"<i>Poems</i>]<br><br>Well, at BYU we refuse to be ridden. As much as this university and this Church and you and I as individuals need the wherewithal to feed and clothe ourselves and further the work of the kingdom, we do not need to sell our souls to get them. And here again, we are tempted to think there is an easy way, a fast buck, that in the world's goods and the glories of men's kingdoms, we may ride through reaping, as the very convenient Messiah. But why do we think it when it was never so for Him? What do we do with a stable for birthplace and a borrowed tomb at his death? And in his lifetime? Not one single mention of earthly possessions.<br><br><i>The foxes have holes and the birds ... have nests; but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head.</i>[Matthew 8:20]<br><br>Forgive me if I go on. Just three weeks ago I was working with President Elliot Cameron on the BYU-Hawaii Campus only to open the Sunday edition of the<i>Honolulu Advertiser</i>to read this headline: "Mormon Utah Called a Test Market for Scams." May I quote a few lines:<br><br><i>Utah's large Mormon population has become a prime target for con artists and swindlers who annually gyp the state's residents out of hundreds of millions of dollars. ... Federal prosecutors say the state has gained a national reputation as "test market for scams. If it works here, they take it on the road...."</i><br><br><i>"It has happened time and time again. ... --It's very easy for people to bridge the gap from unbelievability to believability if church affiliation is used."...</i><br><br><i>The investor lists were drawn up on genealogy sheets used by church members to trace their ancestry. ... Mormon leaders denounced the scheme in a stinging editorial which asked, "Why do people take chances like this? Why do people gamble?" One answer: "Their greed gland gets stuck. ...</i>[I]<i>n this culture, financial success is often equated with righteousness."</i>[Peter Gillins,<i>Sunday Star Bulletin and Advertiser</i>, Honolulu, January 10, 1982]<br><br>Note this from Elder Marvin J. Ashton in our last general conference:<br><br><i>In today's marketplace--yes, in your own neighborhood, town, and cities--scheming, deceiving promoters are making available to gullible purchasers all kinds of enticing offers. We are sorry to report thousands within our ranks are being duped by the glib tongues of those who offer and solicit in whispers: "Once in a lifetime opportunities" and "Just for you" approaches</i>. [<i>Ensign</i>, November 1981, p. 90]<br><br>We can get our share of the earth's bounties but<i>not this way.</i><br><br>Speaking to this issue several years ago Professor Hugh Nibley wrote:<br><br><i>Why should we labor this unpleasant point? Because the Book of Mormon labors it, for our special benefit. Wealth is a jealous master who will not be served halfheartedly and will suffer no rival--not even God: "Ye</i>cannot<i>serve God and Mammon." (Matthew 6:24) In return for unquestioning obedience wealth promises security, power, position, and honors, in fact anything in this world. Above all, the Nephites like the Romans saw in it a mark of superiority and would do anything to get hold of it, for to them "money answereth all things." (Ecclesiastes 10:19) "Ye do always remember your riches," cried Samuel the Lamanite, "... unto great swelling, envyings, strifes, malice, persecutions, and murders, and all manner of iniquities." (Helaman 13:22) Along with this, of course, everyone dresses in the height of fashion, the main point being always that the proper clothes are expensive--the expression "costly apparel" occurs 14 times in the Book of Mormon. The more important wealth is, the less important it is how one gets it.</i>[<i>Since Cumorah</i>(Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1970), pp. 393–94]<br><h2><b>Cost Sometimes Very High</b></h2><br>As with appropriate, necessary income, so too with studies at school or any other honest endeavor. To the king who wondered if there weren't an easier way to learn, Euclid said, "Your Highness, there is no royal road to geometry"--nor any other aspect of godly knowledge. Plan right now to work hard and earn your achievements. Postpone your gratification so you don't have to postpone your graduation. You may feel school will never end and that your bills will never get paid. It will and they will. To work hard and to try earnestly and to deserve good things to happen is worth the effort and worth the wait. And they will happen, often sooner than you think. But it won't be easy, and it won't be convenient. An easy education is a contradiction in terms.<br><br>May I close with a story of inconvenience, now well known to you. Two weeks ago Air Florida's Flight 90 to Tampa, a Boeing 737 with 74 passengers aboard, began rolling down the runway at Washington's National Airport. Nothing seemed very different about this; hundreds of planes leave that airport every day. But you all know what happened next. The plane slammed into the 14th Street Bridge, smashed five cars and a truck, and then skidded into the ice-clogged river. To quote one source:<br><br><i>For a moment, there was silence, and then pandemonium. Commuters watched helplessly as the plane quickly sank... A few passengers bobbed to the surface; some clung numbly to pieces of debris while others screamed desperately for help. Scattered across the ice were pieces of green upholstery, twisted chunks of metal, luggage, a tennis racquet, a child's shoe....</i><br><br><i>Within minutes, sirens began to wail as fire trucks, ambulances and police cars rushed to the scene. A U.S. Park Police helicopter hovered overhead to pluck survivors out of the water. Six were clinging to the plane's tail. Dangling a life preserving ring to them, the chopper began ferrying them to shore. One woman had injured her right arm, so [the] pilot ... lowered the copter until its skids touched the water; his partner [then leaned out and] scooped her up in his arms. Then [a young woman] grabbed the preserver, but as she was being helped out of the ... river by [a] fellow passenger ... she lost her grip. ... A clerk for the Congressional Budget Office who was watching from the shore, plunged into the water and dragged her to land. But the most notable act of heroism was performed by [another] of the passengers, a balding man in his early 50s. Each time the ring was lowered, he grabbed it and passed it along to a comrade; when the helicopter finally returned to pick him up, he had disappeared beneath the ice.</i>[James Kelly, "We're Not Going to Make It,"<i>Time</i>, 25 January 1982, pp. 16–17]<br><br>I quote from an essay entitled simply "The Man in the Water":<br><br><i>His selflessness [is] one reason the story held national attention; his anonymity another. The fact that he [has gone] unidentified invests him with a universal character. For a while he was Every man, and thus proof (as if one needed it) that no man is ordinary.</i><br><br><i>Still, he could never have imagined such a capacity in himself. Only minutes before his character was tested, he was sitting in the ordinary plane among the ordinary passengers, dutifully listening to the stewardess telling him to fasten his seat belt and saying something about the "no smoking sign." So our man relaxed with the others, some of whom would owe their lives to him. Perhaps he started to read, or to doze, or to regret some harsh remark made in the office that morning. Then suddenly he knew that the trip would not be ordinary. Like every other person on that flight, he was desperate to live, which makes his final act so stunning.</i><br><br><i>For at some moment in the water he must have realized that he would not live if he continued to hand over the rope and ring to others. He</i>had<i>to know it, no matter how gradual the effect of the cold. In his judgment he had no choice. When the helicopter took off with what was to be the last survivor, he watched</i>everything in [his] world<i>move away from him, and he deliberately let it [go]....</i><br><br><i>The odd thing is that we do not ... really believe that the man in the water lost his fight. ... He could not, [like Nature], make ice storms, or freeze the water until it froze the blood. But he could hand life over to a stranger, and that is a power of nature too. The man in the water pitted himself against an implacable, impersonal enemy; he fought it with charity; and he [won]</i>. [Roger Rosenblatt,<i>Time,</i>25 January 1982, p. 86]<br><br>In this world we are all, you and I, the man or the woman in the water. We often, like this man and Hamlet, must "take arms against a sea of troubles, and by opposing end them" (Act 3, scene 1, ll. 59–60). And sometimes the cost is very high. It was for Christ, it was for Joseph Smith, and it was for this lone man who counted the cost there in the Potomac--and paid it. It is not easy to go without--without physical gratifications or spiritual assurances or material possessions--but sometimes we must since there is no guarantee of convenience written into our Christian covenant. We must work hard and do right, as Abraham Lincoln said, and sometimes our chance will come. And when we've tried, really tried, and waited for what seemed never to be ours,<i>then</i>"the angels came and ministered unto him." For that ministration in your life I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Jeffrey R.

<h1>tionship with the Lord - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I shall speak of our relationship with the Lord and of the true fellowship all Saints should have with the Father. I shall set forth what we must believe relative to the Father and the Son in order to gain eternal life.<br><br>I shall expound the doctrine of the Church relative to what our relationship should be to all members of the Godhead and do so in plainness and simplicity so that none need misunderstand or be led astray by other voices.<br><br>I shall express the view of the Brethren, of the prophets and apostles of old, and of all those who understand the scriptures and are in tune with the Holy Spirit.<br><br>These matters lie at the very foundation of revealed religion. In presenting them I am on my own ground and am at home with my subject. I shall not stoop to petty wranglings about semantics but shall stay with matters of substance. I shall simply go back to basics and set forth fundamental doctrines of the kingdom, knowing that everyone who is sound spiritually and who has the guidance of the Holy Spirit will believe my words and follow my counsel.<br><br>Please do not put too much stock in some of the current views and vagaries that are afloat, but rather, turn to the revealed word, get a sound understanding of the doctrines, and keep yourselves in the mainstream of the Church.<br><br>Now, it is no secret that many false and vain and foolish things are being taught in the sectarian world and even among us about our need to gain a special relationship with the Lord Jesus. I shall summarize the true doctrine in this field and invite erring teachers and beguiled students to repent and believe the accepted gospel verities as I shall set them forth.<br><br>There is no salvation in believing any false doctrine, particularly a false or unwise view about the Godhead or any of its members. Eternal life is reserved for those who know God and the One whom he sent to work out the infinite and eternal atonement.<br><br>True and saving worship is found only among those who know the truth about God and the Godhead and who understand the true relationship men should have with each member of that Eternal Presidency.<br><br>It follows that the devil would rather spread false doctrine about God and the Godhead, and induce false feelings with reference to any one of them, than almost any other thing he could do. The creeds of Christendom illustrate perfectly what Lucifer wants so-called Christian people to believe about Deity in order to be damned.<br><br>These creeds codify what Jeremiah calls the lies about God (see Jeremiah 16:19; 23: 14–32). They say he is unknown, uncreated, and incomprehensible. They say he is a spirit, without body, parts, or passions. They say he is everywhere and nowhere in particular present, that he fills the immensity of space and yet dwells in the hearts of men, and that he is an immaterial, incorporeal nothingness. They say he is one-god-in-three, and three-gods-in-one who neither hears, nor sees, nor speaks. Some even say he is dead, which he might as well be if their descriptions identify his being.<br><br>These concepts summarize the chief and greatest heresy of Christendom. Truly the most grievous and evil heresy ever imposed on an erring and wayward Christianity is their creedal concept about God and the Godhead! But none of this troubles us very much. God has revealed himself to us in this day even as he did to the prophets of old.<br><br>We know thereby that he is a personal Being in whose image man was made. We know that he has a body of flesh and bones as tangible as man's; that he is a resurrected, glorified, and perfected Being; and that he lives in the family unit. We know that we are his spirit children; that he endowed us with the divine gift of agency; and that he ordained the laws whereby we might advance and progress and become like him.<br><br>We know that God is the only supreme and independent Being in whom all fullness and perfection dwell and that he is omnipotent, omniscient, and, by the power of his Spirit, omnipresent.<br><br>We know "the Almighty God gave his Only Begotten Son" (D&amp;amp;C 20:21), as the scriptures attest, to ransom man from the temporal and spiritual death brought into the world by the fall of Adam and to put into operation all of the terms and conditions of the Father's plan.<br><br>We know that the Holy Ghost, as a "personage of Spirit," is both a Revelator and a Sanctifier and that his chief mission is to bear record of the Father and the Son.<br><br>Thus there are, in the Eternal Godhead, three persons--God the first, the Creator; God the second, the Redeemer; and God the third, the Testator. These three are one--one God if you will--in purposes, in powers, and in perfections. But each has his own severable work to perform, and mankind has a defined and known and specific relationship to each one of them. It is of these relationships that we shall now speak.<br><h2><b>Doctrines of Eternal Life</b></h2><br>Let us set forth those doctrines and concepts that a gracious God has given to us in this day and which must be understood in order to gain eternal life. They are:<br><h2><b>1. We worship the Father and him only and no one else.</b></h2><br>We do not worship the Son, and we do not worship the Holy Ghost. I know perfectly well what the scriptures say about worshipping Christ and Jehovah, but they are speaking in an entirely different sense--the sense of standing in awe and being reverentially grateful to him who has redeemed us. Worship in the true and saving sense is reserved for God the first, the Creator.<br><br>Our revelations say that the Father "is infinite and eternal," that he created "man, male and female,"<br><br><i>And gave unto them commandments that they should love and serve him, the only living and true God, and that he should be the only being whom they should worship.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 20:17–19]<br><br>Jesus said:<br><br><i>True worshippers shall</i>[note that this is mandatory]<i>worship the Father in spirit and in truth; for the Father seeketh such to worship him.</i><br><br><i>For unto such hath God promised his Spirit. And they who worship him, must worship in spirit and in truth</i>. [JST John 4:25–26]<br><br>There is no other way, no other approved system of worship.<br><h2><b>2. We love and serve both the Father and the Son.</b></h2><br>In the full, final, and ultimate sense of the word the divine decree is:<br><br><i>Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, with all thy might, mind, and strength; and in the name of Jesus Christ thou shalt serve him</i>. [D&amp;amp;C 59:5]<br><br>And Jesus also said:<br><br><i>If ye love me, keep my commandments</i>. [John 14:15]<br><br>These, then, are the commandments of commandments. They tie the Father and the Son together, as one, so that both receive our love and service.<br><h2><b>3. Christ himself loves, serves, and worships the Father.</b></h2><br>Though Christ is God, yet there is a Deity above him, a Deity whom he worships. That God is the Father. To Mary Magdalene, the first mortal to see a resurrected person, Jesus said:<br><br><i>I ascend unto my Father, and your Father; and to my God, and your God</i>. [John 20:17]<br><br>All of us, Christ included, are the spirit children of the Father; all of us, Christ included, seek to become like the Father. In this sense the Firstborn, our Elder Brother, goes forward as we do.<br><h2><b>4. The plan of salvation is the gospel of the Father</b></h2><br>The plan of salvation originated with the Father; he is the Author and Finisher of our faith in the final sense; he ordained the laws by obedience to which both we and Christ can become like him.<br><br>The Father did<i>not</i>ask for volunteers to propose a plan whereby man might be saved. What he did was ask whom he should send to be the Redeemer in the plan he devised. Christ and Lucifer both volunteered, and the Lord chose his Firstborn and rejected the amendatory offer of the son of the morning.<br><br>Thus Paul spoke of "the gospel of God, . . . concerning his Son Jesus Christ our Lord, which was made of the seed of David according to the flesh" (Romans 1:1–3). It is the Father's gospel, it became the gospel of the Son by adoption, and we call it after Christ's name because his atoning sacrifice put all of its terms and conditions into operation.<br><h2><b>5. Christ worked out his own salvation by worshiping the Father.</b></h2><br>After the Firstborn of the Father, while yet a spirit being, had gained power and<br><br>intelligence that made him like unto God; after he had become, under the Father, the Creator of worlds without number; after he had reigned on the throne of eternal power as the Lord Omnipotent--after all this he yet had to gain a mortal and then an immortal body.<br><br>After the Son of God "made flesh" his "tabernacle," and while he "dwelt among the sons of men"; after he left his preexistent glory as we all do at birth; after he was born of Mary in Bethlehem of Judea--after all this he was called upon to work out his own salvation.<br><br>Of our Lord's life while in this mortal probation the scripture says:<br><br><i>He received not of the fulness at the first, but received grace for grace;</i><br><br><i>And he received not of the fulness at first, but continued from grace to grace, until he received a fulness.</i><br><br>Finally, after his resurrection,<br><br><i>he received a fulness of the glory of the Father;</i><br><br><i>And he received all power, both in heaven and on earth, and the glory of the Father was with him, for he dwelt in him.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 93:12–14, 16–17]<br><br>Note it, please, the Lord Jesus worked out his own salvation while in this mortal probation by going from grace to grace, until, having overcome the world and being raised in immortal glory, he became like the Father in the full, complete, and eternal sense.<br><h2><b>6. All men must worship the Father in the same way Christ did in order to gain salvation.</b></h2><br>Thus spake the Lord: "I give unto you these sayings"--those we have just quoted which tell how Christ gained his salvation by worshipping the Father--<br><br><i>I give unto you these sayings that you may understand and know</i>how<i>to worship, and know</i>what<i>you worship, that you may come unto the Father in my name, and in due time receive of his fulness.</i><br><br>What a wondrous concept this is! We too can become like the Father,<br><br><i>For if you keep my commandments</i>, the Lord continued,<i>you shall receive of his fulness, and be glorified in me as I am in the Father; therefore, I say unto you, you shall receive grace for grace.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 93:19–20; emphasis added]<br><h2><b>7. The Father sent the Son to work out the infinite and eternal atonement.</b></h2><br>As temporal and spiritual death came by the fall of Adam, so immortality and eternal life come by the atonement of Christ. Such was and is and ever shall be the plan of the Father. Adam was sent to earth to fall, and Christ came to ransom men from the fall.<br><br>Thus the Father sent forth this call in the councils of eternity: "Whom shall I send to be my Son, to ransom all people from temporal and spiritual death, to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man, to put into full operation all the terms and conditions of my eternal plan of redemption and salvation?"<br><br>Christ is the Redeemer of men and the Savior of the world because his Father sent him and gave him power to do the assigned work. He said he had power to lay down his life and to take it again because he had been so commanded by the Father. Lehi said he rose from the dead "by the power of the Spirit" (2 Nephi 2:8).<br><br>The great and eternal redemption, in all its phases, was wrought by Christ using the power of the Father.<br><h2><b>8. The Son came to do the will of the Father in all things.</b></h2><br>Jesus said:<br><br><i>I came down from heaven, not to do mine own will, but the will of him that sent me.</i>[John 6:38]<br><br>Also:<br><br><i>I came into the world to do the will of my Father, because my Father sent me. And my Father sent me that I might be lifted up upon the cross.</i>[3 Nephi 27:13–14]<br><br>And Paul said of him that he<br><br><i>made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men:</i><br><br><i>And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross</i>. [Philippians 2:7–8]<br><br>How better could his relationship with his Father be stated?<br><h2><b>9. God, through Christ, is reconciling men to himself.</b></h2><br>Fallen man is carnal, sensual, and devilish by nature; he is spiritually dead; he is out of harmony with the Father.<br><br>Thus, as Paul said,<br><br><i>All things are of God, who hath reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ, and hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation;</i><br><br><i>To wit, that God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself.</i><br><br>We have the "word of reconciliation," which is the gospel, and our preaching is, "Be ye reconciled to God," that is, to the Father (2 Corinthians 5:18–20).<br><h2><b>10. Christ is the Mediator between God and man.</b></h2><br>Because all people must be reconciled to God in order to be saved, he, in his goodness and grace, has provided a Mediator for them.<br><br>Paul told us:<br><br><i>There is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus;</i><br><br><i>Who gave himself a ransom for all, to be testified in due time</i>. [1 Timothy 2:5–6]<br><br>To this we add: If there were no Mediator, we could never be reconciled to the Father, and hence there would be no salvation.<br><h2><b>11. Christ is our Intercessor with the Father, our Advocate in the courts above.</b></h2><br>In the process of mediating between us and our Maker, in the process of reconciling sin-ridden men with a sin-free God, Christ makes intercession for all who repent. He advocates the cause of those who believe in him. "Father," he pleads,<br><br><i>spare these my brethren that believe on my name, that they may come unto me and have everlasting life</i>. [D&amp;amp;C 45:5]<br><h2><b>12. Our eternal fellowship is with the Father and the Son.</b></h2><br>John wrote:<br><br><i>Our fellowship is with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ.</i>[1 John 1:3]<br><br>If we keep the commandments, "we have fellowship" with the Father--which is the object and end of our existence And in the very nature of things we also have eternal fellowship with Christ, because he walked in the light and became and is one with the Father. (see 1 John 1:4–7).<br><h2><b>13. God was in Christ manifesting himself to the world.</b></h2><br>The Son, Paul told us, is in "the express image of his [Father's] person" (Hebrews 1:3). "I and my Father are one," Jesus said (John 10:30). Thus in his appearance, in his person, and in his attributes, the Son is the image and likeness of the Father. "He that hath seen me hath seen the Father," Jesus said (John 14:9). The four gospels are a treasure house of knowledge concerning the Father because they set forth what the Son is like, and he is like his Father.<br><h2><b>14. Christ is the Revealer of the Father</b></h2><br>God is and can be known only by revelation; he stands revealed or he remains forever unknown. Jesus said:<br><br><i>No man knoweth . . . who the Father is, but the Son, and he to whom the Son will reveal him</i>. [Luke 10:22]<br><h2><b>15. Christ is the Way to the Father.</b></h2><br>"I am the way," he said. "No man cometh unto the Father, but by me" (John 14:6).<br><br>Who can doubt that Christ's mission is to reveal the Father, to lead us to the Father, to teach us how to worship the Father, to reconciles us to the Father?<br><h2><b>16. Christ proclaims the gospel of the Father.</b></h2><br>In the ultimate sense the word of salvation comes from the Father. Said Paul,<br><br><i>God, who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in time past unto the fathers by the prophets,</i><br><br><i>Hath in these last days spoken unto us by his Son</i>. [Hebrews 1:1]<br><br>The Father sent the prophets; they represented him; and they spoke his word. When Jesus quoted the Old Testament prophets to the Nephites, he attributed their words to the Father.<br><br>Though the revelations came from the Son, yet in the ultimate sense the truths taught were those of the Father. We are also aware of many instances in which Jesus, acting by divine investiture of authority, speaks in the first person as though he were the Father.<br><br>Thus Jesus said:<br><br><i>My doctrine is not mine, but his that sent me. If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I speak of myself</i>. [John 7:16–17]<br><h2><b>17. Christ glorifies the Father and so must we.</b></h2><br>"Glorify thy Son," Jesus prayed to the Father,<br><br><i>that thy Son also may glorify thee. . . .</i><br><br><i>I have glorified thee on the earth: I have finished the work which thou gavest me to do.</i>[John 17:1, 4]<br><br>As Christ our Pattern, by obedience and by doing his appointed labors, glorified the Father, so must we. Acting in his Father's name, Jesus ascribed the honor and glory in all things to the Father. The very pattern of prayer that he gave us directs that we go and do likewise.<br><br>Now, we might continue on and list added concepts, all of which would bear the same witness and accord with what we have said. Let us instead, on the basis of these present concepts, discuss the problem at hand and draw some conclusions.<br><h2><b>Our Relationship to Members of the Godhead</b></h2><br>What is and should be our relationship to the members of the Godhead?<br><br>First, be it remembered that most scriptures that speak of God or of the Lord do not even bother to distinguish the Father from the Son, simply because it doesn't make any difference which God is involved. They are one. The words or deeds of either of them would be the words and deeds of the other in the same circumstance.<br><br>Further, if a revelation comes from, or by the power of the Holy Ghost, ordinarily the words will be those of the Son, though what the Son says will be what the Father would say, and the words may thus be considered as the Father's. Thus any feelings of love, praise, awe, or worship that may fill our hearts when we receive the divine words will be the same no matter who is thought or known to be the author of them.<br><br>And yet we do have a proper relationship to each member of the Godhead, in part at least because there are separate and severable functions which each performs, and also because of what they as one Godhead have done for us.<br><br>Our relationship with the Father is supreme, paramount, and preeminent over all others. He is the God we worship. It is his gospel that saves and exalts. He ordained and established the plan of salvation. He is the one who was once as we are now. The life he lives is eternal life, and if we are to gain this greatest of all the gifts of God, it will be because we become like him.<br><br>Our relationship with the Father is one of parent and child. He is the one who gave us our agency. It was his plan that provided for a fall and an atonement. And it is to him that we must be reconciled if we are to gain salvation. He is the one to whom we have direct access by prayer, and if there were some need--which there is not!--to single out one member of the Godhead for a special relationship, the Father, not the Son, would be the one to choose.<br><br>Our relationship with the Son is one of brother or sister in the premortal life and one of being led to the Father by him while in this mortal sphere. He is the Lord Jehovah who championed our cause before the foundations of the earth were laid. He is the God of Israel, the promised Messiah, and the Redeemer of the world.<br><br>By faith we are adopted into his family and become his children. We take upon ourselves his name, keep his commandments, and rejoice in the cleansing power of his blood. Salvation comes by him. From Creation's dawn, as long as eternity endures, there neither has been nor will be another act of such transcendent power and import as his atoning sacrifice.<br><br>We do not have a fraction of the power we need to properly praise his holy name and ascribe unto him the honor and power and might and glory and dominion that is his. He is our Lord, our God, and our King.<br><br>Our relationship with the Holy Spirit is quite another thing. This holy personage is a Revelator and a Sanctifier. He bears record of the Father and the Son. He dispenses spiritual gifts to the faithful. Those of us who have received the gift of the Holy Ghost have the right to his constant companionship.<br><br>And again, if it were proper--and I repeat, it is not!--to single out one member of the Godhead for some special attention, we might well conclude that member should be the Holy Ghost. We might well adopt as a slogan: Seek the Spirit. The reason of course is that the sanctifying power of the Spirit would assure us of reconciliation with the Father. And any person who enjoys the constant companionship of the Holy Spirit will be in complete harmony with the divine will in all things.<br><h2><b>Heresies among Us</b></h2><br>Now, in spite of all these truths, which ought to be obvious to every spiritually<br><br>enlightened person, heresies rear their ugly heads among us from time to time.<br><br>There are those deluded cultists, and others who, unless they repent, are on the road to becoming cultists, who choose to believe we should worship Adam. They have found or should find their way out of the Church.<br><br>There are others--in the main they are intellectuals without strong testimonies--who postulate that God does not know all things but is progressing in truth and knowledge and will do so everlastingly. These, unless they repent, will live and die weak in the faith and will fall short of inheriting what might have been theirs in eternity.<br><br>There are yet others who have an excessive zeal which causes them to go beyond the mark. Their desire for excellence is inordinate. In an effort to be truer than true they devote themselves to gaining a special, personal relationship with Christ that is both improper and perilous.<br><br>I say perilous because this course, particularly in the lives of some who are spiritually immature, is a gospel hobby which creates an unwholesome holier-than-thou attitude. In other instances it leads to despondency because the seeker after perfection knows he is not living the way he supposes he should.<br><br>Another peril is that those so involved often begin to pray directly to Christ because of some special friendship they feel has been developed. In this connection a current and unwise book, which advocates gaining a special relationship with Jesus, contains this sentence:<br><br><i>Because the Savior is our mediator, our prayers go through Christ to the Father, and the Father answers our prayers through his Son.</i><br><br>This is plain sectarian nonsense. Our prayers are addressed to the Father, and to him only. They do not go through Christ, or the Blessed Virgin, or St. Genevieve or along the beads of a rosary. We are entitled to "come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need" (Hebrews 4:16).<br><br>And I rather suppose that he who sitteth upon the throne will choose his own ways to answer his children, and that they are numerous. Perfect prayer is addressed to the Father, in the name of the Son; and it is uttered by the power of the Holy Ghost; and it is answered in whatever way seems proper by him whose ear is attuned to the needs of his children.<br><h2><b>The Mainstream of the Church</b></h2><br>Now I know that some may be offended at the counsel that they should not strive for a special and personal relationship with Christ. It will seem to them as though I am speaking out against mother love, or Americanism, or the little red schoolhouse. But I am not. There is a fine line here over which true worshipers will not step.<br><br>It is true that there may, with propriety, be a special relationship with a wife, with children, with friends, with teachers, with the beasts of the field and the fowls of the sky and the lilies of the valley. But the very moment anyone singles out one member of the Godhead as the almost sole recipient of his devotion, to the exclusion of the others, that is the moment when spiritual instability begins to replace sense and reason.<br><br>The proper course for all of us is to stay in the mainstream of the Church. This is the Lord's Church, and it is led by the spirit of inspiration, and the practice of the Church constitutes the interpretation of the scripture.<br><br>And you have never heard one of the First Presidency or the Twelve, who hold the keys of the kingdom, and who are appointed to see that we are not "tossed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine" (Ephesians 4:14)--you have never heard one of them advocate this excessive zeal that calls for gaining a so-called special and personal relationship with Christ.<br><br>You have heard them teach and testify of the ministry and mission of the Lord Jesus, using the most persuasive and powerful language at their command. But never, never at any time have they taught or endorsed the inordinate or intemperate zeal that encourages endless, sometimes day-long prayers, in order to gain a personal relationship with the Savior.<br><br>Those who truly love the Lord and who worship the Father in the name of the Son by the power of the Spirit, according to the approved patterns, maintain a reverential barrier between themselves and all the members of the Godhead.<br><br>I am well aware that some who have prayed for endless hours feel they have a special and personal relationship with Christ that they never had before. I wonder if this is any or so much different, however, from the feelings of fanatical sectarians who with glassy eyes and fiery tongues assure us they have been saved by grace and are assured of a place with the Lord in a heavenly abode, when in fact they have never even received the fullness of the gospel.<br><br>I wonder if it is not part of Lucifer's system to make people feel they are special friends of Jesus when in fact they are not following the normal and usual pattern of worship found in the true Church.<br><br>Let me remind you to stay in the course chartered by the Church. It is the Lord's Church, and he will not permit it to be led astray. If we take the counsel that comes from the prophets and seers, we will pursue the course that is pleasing to the Lord.<br><br>Would it be amiss if I reminded you that Jesus maintained a reserve between him and his disciples and that he did not allow them the same intimacy with him that they had with each other? This was particularly true after his resurrection.<br><br>For instance, when Mary Magdalene, in a great outpouring of love and devotion, sought to embrace the risen Lord, her hands were stayed. "Touch me not," he said. Between her and him, no matter what the degree of their love, there was a line over which she could not pass. And yet, almost immediately thereafter, a whole group of faithful women held that same Lord by the feet, and, we cannot doubt, bathed his wounded feet with their tears.<br><br>It is a fine and sacred line, but clearly there is a difference between a personal and intimate relationship with the Lord, which is improper, and one of worshipful adoration, which yet maintains the required reserve between us and him who has bought us with his blood.<br><h2><b>Conclusion</b></h2><br>Now I sincerely hope that no one will imagine that I have in the slightest degree downgraded the Lord Jesus in the scheme of things. I have not done so. As far as I know there is not a man on earth who thinks more highly of him than I do. It just may be that I have preached more sermons, taught more doctrine, and written more words about the Lord Jesus Christ than any other man now living. I have ten large volumes in print, seven of which deal almost entirely with Christ, and the other three with him and his doctrines.<br><br>I do not suppose that what I have here said will be an end to controversy or to the spread of false views and doctrines. The devil is not dead, and he delights in controversy. But you have been warned, and you have heard the true doctrine taught. Those who need to study the matter further would do well to get and study a copy of what I have said when it is published by Brigham Young University.<br><br>Let us then end on the note of testimony and of prayer. I bear record of the divine sonship of him whom we have this day spoken. He is or should be our best Friend through whom we can be reconciled to God.<br><br>And I pray that the true doctrine of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost, who, as the Book of Mormon says, are one God, may be found in the hearts and souls of all of us. In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Bruce R.

<br>
Looking over those missionaries, I suppose that I am here like a good example of all the problems that you will have with the language if you are going to a foreign country.<br><br>When Solomon received his calling and with it the responsibility of the kingdom, he became apprehensive and somewhat insecure because of the tremendous load and responsibility which confronted him. In words very explicit he expressed his sentiments, as we read in 1 Kings, chapter 3, verse 7: "I know not how to go out or come in." I must tell you that, personally, I prefer the Spanish version of that verse because therein the order is reversed. Translated literally, it reads, "I know not how to come in or go out." In this case the order is very important because "I come in," and, after seeing so many of you here today, I would like to find the way "to go out."<br><br>I am certain that I will find my way out when I have completed my assignment here tonight. But first I would like to share with you some thoughts that might be of help to you in your lives. So during the course of this discussion, I would ask of the Lord that he grant me that which he gave to Solomon upon hearing his fears and misgivings--the wisdom necessary to carry out my commitment.<br><br>Very possibly I will not impart to you anything original tonight. However, the many hours I have spent interviewing and visiting with young people of varying degrees of knowledge, faith, and objectives and goals in life, and of different cultures cause me to realize I have gained experience and a certain degree of knowledge and understanding which will allow me to analyze some the most common problems evident among young people today.<br><br>If this night I can stimulate you to think creatively, if I can help you to act upon correct principles, then I believe the worries of finding the way "to go out" will have been well compensated.<br><h2><b>The Scientist and the Boatman</b></h2><br>Perhaps if we begin with a story, it might help us to better understand the theme of this discussion, and at the same time, help to introduce it.<br><br>There once was a man of science and of great knowledge, but with a small degree of humility, and therefore of very great self-esteem, who set out to see the world and enjoy its many wonders.<br><br>One clear night, when the stars were shining in all their splendor, he came to the banks of a river in a region almost uninhabited. His intention was to cross to the other side of the river, but he found that there was no other way to cross except by a rowboat there which was run by a humble boatman.<br><br>He decided to engage the services of the boatman to take him across the river. Of course, it was not the safest way to cross, but for lack of a better way, it was the only thing he could do.<br><br>He hired the boatman and began crossing. Perhaps because he was impressed by the serenity and beauty of the starlit night, the man of science felt inclined to start a conversation with the simple boatman. Looking at the beautiful sky he asked the boatman, "Tell me, my good man, what do you know about the stars and the moon which are now shedding their light on us?"<br><br>Meek and somewhat ashamed, the boatman answered, "Well, nothing. Only that they are up there."<br><br>With a little personal satisfaction he continued asking, "And tell me, what do you know about the constellations and the solar system?"<br><br>Very humiliated, the boatman reluctantly answered, "Nothing. No, I know nothing about these things."<br><br>The man of science, with obvious pride, said to the boatman, "My dear boatman, you have lost half of your life by not knowing about all of these things."<br><br>With a feeling of resignation the humble boatman continued rowing the boat toward the opposite shore, carrying the overly confident man.<br><br>Suddenly a great wind came up--a common occurrence in that part of the country--which made the boat rock violently, even to the point that it threw the boatman and the man of science overboard, into the churning water. The boatman surfaced and began swimming to shore. He looked back at the scientist who appeared to be drowning and called, "Do you know how to swim?"<br><br>With terror in his eyes the scientist replied, "No," whereupon the boatman replied, "I'm sorry! You've lost<i>all</i>of your life."<br><br>What is the lesson that this little story is attempting to illustrate? What is the point that I wish to emphasize in relating this story of the proud scientist?<br><h2><b>Priorities</b></h2><br>Many times a number of you young people have had moments in your life when you have felt mixed feelings and confusion, with your priorities out of order, or, in other words, times of being all mixed up. This confusion is a result of a mind that has not set its thoughts in proper perspective. It generally follows that you confront life by reaching out for confused and diversified goals. In some cases you find yourselves overcome after having pursued goals which are out of proper priority. At other times you have, perhaps, experienced merely a feeling of spinning your wheels.<br><br>To put it another way, we could illustrate it by saying that some young people, in their search for goals and objectives in life, remind me of some of those persons seen mainly in the larger cities who run desperately to catch a bus and, after they get on, ask, "Where is this bus going?" The same thing happens to many of our young people in establishing their life goals--they confuse the objectives. They are confused on how to obtain them. They confuse the causes and effects, and then they end up at that same point and ask, "Where am I going?"<br><br>In such cases as these, it is the initial action that generally fails, or to put it in football terms, the kickoff.<br><h2><b>A Creative Mind</b></h2><br>At times I wonder if we know how to think, if we are developing a creative mind, because that is where all good works and all important accomplishments begin. It is in the mind where the goals to be reached in this life are fostered. We read in Proverbs, chapter 23, verse 7, "For as he thinketh in his heart, so is he." Or we can say that we are definitely in a continuous state of creation through our mental process.<br><br>Ezra J. Poulsen relates an experience he had as a student at this university. The English professor and poet was the late Alfred Osmond, and the incident, I believe, adequately reflects that which I would like to explain.<br><br><i>In a college English class years ago, we were assigned to write several rhymed couplets in the style of Alexander Pope. The professor required the trembling authors to read their verses aloud for criticism and review.</i><br><br><i>One of the boys refused to take part. "I'm not a poet," he said.</i><br><br><i>The professor, a large man with bushy eyebrows and a voice of thunder, pointed a blunt finger at the student and roared, "Young man, I want you to understand you're not a finished product. You're still in the process of being created."</i><br><br><i>This dramatic ten-second speech startled the entire class into a state of intense receptivity, and I doubt if anyone present ever forgot it. It was a master stroke of teaching.</i><br><br>Brother Poulsen continues,<br><br><i>For me, this remark has become a fixed belief. I am not a finished product. I am still in the process of creation. In moments of idleness, retreat, or discouragement, I seem to hear the old professor's challenge in my ears. And I rise to do battle with my daily problems.</i><br><br><i>Quickly, new avenues of constructive effort seem to open up. Old plateaus of mediocrity are left behind. I find ever-widening horizons, because growth is the natural law of life</i>. [<i>This Week Magazine</i>, 16 September 1962]<br><br>Yes, we are continually in the process of creation, and the greater our efforts, the greater the results we will obtain in this life. But in reality, what is a creative mind?<br><br>The creative mind is dynamic and always in action. The efficient manner in which we put it to work will determine just what the creative mind will produce.<br><br>To create means to project, to imagine, to discover, to invent something new or innovative in any field of action or study. Creation is also the sole act of having initiative even in the most routine tasks. The simplicity of the task doesn't matter, as long as the final outcome results in a better and more efficient way of achieving it, for in that way a person is being creative.<br><h2><b>To Be Creative Requires Discipline</b></h2><br>To be creative, contrary to popular belief, one must be disciplined. There is a popular conception that "free thinking" without guidance or direction is being creative. However, this view is false. An example right at home for you students, something that you all had to learn the hard way, is that the fields of music, art, and literature all have their techniques which you must master in order to become creative in those areas.<br><br>In this respect, everyone in his own field, according to his own possibilities and talents, should be creative--not only in the arts or sciences. This concept applies universally to all persons in all of their activities.<br><br>Our personal lives in themselves are a constant creative process. The selection of our goals, the methods we use to obtain them, the determination we exert in our plan of action--all are the fruits of a creative mind which is well trained and disciplined.<br><br>Let's see how we achieve this kind of thinking. What is the methodical path that leads us to a creative and disciplined mind?<br><h2><b>Steps to a Creative Mind</b></h2><br>The steps to follow are these: To observe, to ponder and to pray, to simplify and to organize, to decide and to act, and to control and to diligently pursue.<br><br>Each of these steps is indispensable to the one that follows. Let's take a look at them separately.<br><h2><b>To Observe</b></h2><br>The first essential step is<b>to observe</b>. This is to say, not just to look, but to see. We might even say to perceive, to become informed through observation.<br><br>How many times have our eyes looked over the page of a book without actually seeing it? How many times have we gazed at a ray of sunshine without seeing it, without perceiving the beautiful message of the work of the Lord?<br><br>Perhaps we could say that to observe, to see in depth, is an attitude that is essential for the creative achiever. A good example to illustrate what it means to see in depth is found in the Lord's words to Samuel,<br><br><i>For the Lord seeth; for man looketh on the outward appearance, but the Lord looketh on the heart</i>. [1 Samuel 16:7]<br><br>Over the years I have been impressed each time that the Lord refers to those who walk in darkness or in paths of error, as he did when speaking to the people of Jerusalem through the prophet Jeremiah. He proclaimed,<br><br><i>Hear now this, O foolish people, and without understanding; which have eyes, and see not.</i>[Jeremiah 5:21]<br><h2><b>To Ponder and to Pray</b></h2><br>One of the most important parts of the process is the second step,<b>to ponder and to pray.</b>These are the acts which actually initiate the action process toward creativity or achievement of worthy goals. Through this mental and spiritual process, we study, analyze, and reason with the information gathered through our observation. In a sense it is a spiritual preparation for making correct decisions, decisions which we must then carry out.<br><br>To ponder is to evaluate that which we have observed, to make it a part of ourselves, and then to receive a conviction of it through prayer. Let's take as an example when Jesus was teaching the Nephite people and ministering to them. He turned to the multitude and spoke, saying,<br><br><i>Behold, my time is at hand.</i><br><br><i>I perceive that ye are weak, that ye cannot understand all my words which I am commanded of the Father to speak unto you at this time.</i><br><br><i>Therefore, go ye unto your homes, and ponder upon the things which I have said, and ask of the Father, in my name, that ye may understand, and prepare your minds for the morrow, and I come unto you again</i>. [3 Nephi 17:1–3]<br><br>These words vividly portray the steps we have analyzed thus far. Please note that Jesus perceived, not just looked but rather observed profoundly, that which was happening. The multitude was not able to understand him, so he decided to send them home so that they might ponder and pray and prepare themselves for the next occasion.<br><br>Let us also note the counsel Paul gave to the young Timothy:<br><br><i>Meditate upon these things; give thyself wholly to them; that thy profiting may appear to all.</i>[1 Timothy 4:15]<br><br>President McKay said on one occasion,<br><br><i>I think we pay too little attention to the value of meditation, a principle of devotion. . . . Meditation is one of the most secret, most sacred doors through which we pass into the presence of the Lord.</i>[<i>CR</i>, April 1967, p. 85]<br><h2><b>To Simplify and to Organize</b></h2><br>After having reasoned, meditated, and prayed, the next step which follows is to<b>simplify and to organize</b>all that which has emerged from this process with the objective of separating the fundamental from the accessory, and to arrange and give direction to the ideas.<br><br>There is often a tendency among young people to complicate matters because it somehow seems that simple things and simple ideas lack importance and validity. However, we find an example in the scriptures which demonstrates the importance of simple things. While speaking of the manner in which the gospel should be taught, the Lord revealed the following to Joseph Smith,<br><br><i>And for this cause, that men might be made partakers of the glories, which were to be revealed, the Lord sent forth the fullness of his gospel, his everlasting covenant, reasoning in plainness and simplicity</i>. [D&amp;amp;C 133:57]<br><br>It was so important that men be partakers of his glory that the Lord sent the fullness of the gospel, reasoning in simplicity and clarity. The results of our reasoning should be of the same manner.<br><h2><b>To Decide and to Act</b></h2><br>After simplifying and organizing all of the ideas, the next logical step is<b>to decide and to act</b>. At this point it is necessary to make the decision and to eliminate any uncertainties or nonessentials. Following this comes the second part of it--the action, the climax of all the other steps. He who does not take action after the preceding process has exerted great efforts in vain; it avails him and his fellowman nothing, and he remains halfway on the road to his desired objective.<br><br>I believe that one of the most commonly used citations from the scriptures, especially among young people, is what Nephi said when his father Lehi asked him and his brothers to return to Jerusalem to the house of Laban and bring the brass plates back into the wilderness with them. Nephi answered,<br><br><i>I will go and do the things which the Lord hath commanded, for I know that the Lord giveth no commandments unto the children of men, save he shall prepare a way for them that they may accomplish the thing which he commandeth them</i>. [1 Nephi 3:7]<br><br>While this is one of the most often quoted passages of the scriptures, we do not always grasp the full depth of the wisdom therein. If we read the previous chapter, we find that Nephi relates the important act of making a valuable decision when he said,<br><br><i>And it came to pass that I, Nephi, . . . having great desires to know of the mysteries of God, wherefore, I did cry unto the Lord; and behold he did visit me, and did soften my heart that I did believe all the words which had been spoken by my father; wherefore, I did not rebel against him like unto my brothers.</i>[1 Nephi 2:16]<br><br>The key words that I want to emphasize in this verse are, "He . . . did soften my heart." The message that Nephi teaches us with these words is that the Spirit manifested unto him that which he wanted to know. It made him understand and see in depth. Alma once described this process as having the soul "illuminated by the light" (Alma 5:7). This spiritual manifestation that Nephi received is what caused him to believe what his father had said.<br><br>And because of it, what happened next? The Lord then spoke to Nephi saying,<br><br><i>Blessed art thou, Nephi, because of thy faith, for thou hast sought me diligently, with lowliness of heart.</i>[1 Nephi 2:19]<br><br>Because of Nephi's great faith and confidence, he was promised by the Lord that, if he would keep His commandments, he would prosper and be guided to the promised land, and there would become a "ruler and a teacher over thy brethren" (1 Nephi 2:22).<br><br>Through his faithfulness and efforts, Nephi was blessed with these marvelous spiritual experiences, and at this point, as a result of his experiences, his knowledge and conviction had literally become a part of him. He internalized it.<br><br>Therefore, we see from this that, when his father approached him, he did not say, "I will go and see what happens," or "I will go and look over the situation and then decide what to do." But rather, his words were, "I will go and do the things which the Lord hath commanded, for I know. . . ."<br><br>Correct decisions based on correct principles lead to correct actions. And while we are on this subject, let me say, young people, that once certain decisions in life are made, it is not necessary to start over with the mental and spiritual processes each time the circumstances arise. This saves effort, time, and problems. Let's see if we can demonstrate this with an example.<br><br>In the year 1968, when I was president of a stake in Buenos Aires, Argentina, I received a phone call from a young lady, a member of the Church, who wanted to talk with me as soon as possible. We made an appointment, and during the interview she said something to this effect, "President, as you know, I have a boyfriend who is not a member of the Church, but who is a very fine person. He loves me very much and I love him, and I tell him that often, but now I am confused because on our last date he asked me to prove my love to him."<br><br>Well, you probably understand the test of love that the young man wanted. She continued, saying, "I am confused, President."<br><br>I am sure you know what my counsel was to her, but that which worried me the most, what really concerned me, was her last statement, "I am confused, President."<br><br>How could she be confused? How could she doubt, not knowing what to do or how to act? This type of decision, once made, constitutes the foundation on which we continue to build throughout life. Once you make the decision to live a clean life, once you decide to be chaste, you act accordingly, and you always live a pure life.<br><br>The changing circumstances of life are not important. Once the decision is made, on the basis of correct principles proceeding forth from an unchanging God, then that determines our course of action without the necessity of going through the entire process each time temptation or sin appears.<br><h2><b>To Control and to Diligently Pursue</b></h2><br>Now let us consider the fifth and final step,<b>to control and to diligently pursue</b>. To control and diligently pursue each action taken is fundamental in assuring that what we are doing is being done properly. It is also necessary to control each decision and identify any deviations from our original decision, to determine if the selected course of action is being followed and will thereby obtain the desired results. It requires constant attention and a continuous process of learning, which feeds back to the original decisions, and in that manner each decision becomes easier to make and more automatic.<br><br>I am sure that most of you have had experience driving a car with a manual transmission. If you will think back to the first time you tried to drive such a car, you will remember how hard it was to coordinate the use of the accelerator, the clutch, and the gearshift lever. It required a lot of concentration and control. Nevertheless, with a little practice and repetition, it became an automatic process that could be done without even thinking about it.<br><br>In the same way, by exercising control of and concentration on decisions, they, too, will become automatic and sure. We should constantly strive to insure that the goal of our decision is achieved.<br><br>Little is accomplished without a struggle. This is especially true for the so-called "gifted," for it was Edison who said that in all of the accomplishments of mankind, 5 percent come from inspiration and 95 percent from perspiration. That means that the more talented and gifted a person is, the more he must work and struggle to accomplish all that he has the potential to do and develop within himself--even more than those who are less gifted. Without a struggle there can be no accomplishment.<br><br>I have witnessed complete failures among some of our young people with brilliant minds, superior ideas, and exceptional ability. This failure was the result of little, or practically no, willpower to carry through and accomplish the results. These young people remind me of the partridge, a bird that exists in great abundance in Argentina. When they begin their flights, it appears that they are going to rise to great heights, but, after going a short distance, they flutter to the ground.<br><br>Therefore, upon accomplishing each task we should be able to enjoy a peace within ourselves, a peace that comes with knowing that all possible had been done, that all talents have been exercised to the maximum, and in the same manner that Paul expressed to Timothy,<br><br><i>I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith</i>. [2 Timothy 4:7]<br><br>And now that we have reviewed the steps to a creative mind, I would like to add a few elements that must also be present to complete and give harmony to the picture. In order to hasten the proper solution of an accomplishment, each of the steps should be completed promptly, without delay. In other words, apply the well-known saying, "Never put off until tomorrow that which you can do today." If something must be done, do it.<br><br>When we talk about doing something as a result of a firm decision to act, it brings to mind the words of Joshua when, with firmness, he placed before the people that dramatic alternative of deciding which way they would follow, saying that they should do it without delay.<br><br><i>And if it seem evil unto you to serve the Lord, choose you this day whom ye will serve. . . but as for me and my house, we will serve the Lord</i>. [Joshua 24:15]<br><br>It is interesting to note that Joshua demonstrated to the people through example what his decision was, and he made that decision at once. Once the decision is made, do it.<br><h2><b>Faith, Courage, and Humility</b></h2><br>In connection with taking decisive action, there are three more elements which form a fundamental part of the creative process that concerns us. They are, faith, courage, and humility.<br><br>Without undaunted faith, all of our efforts would be useless. We remember that the Lord admonished Oliver Cowdery through Joseph Smith thus: "Remember that without faith you can do nothing" (D&amp;amp;C 8:10).<br><br>The Prophet Joseph Smith himself defined faith in the following manner:<br><br><i>Faith is . . . the moving cause of all action in . . . intelligent beings. And as faith is the moving cause of all action in temporal concerns, so it is in spiritual. . . . But faith is not only the principle of action, but of power also, in all intelligent beings, whether in heaven or on earth.</i>[13, "Lecture First,"<i>Lectures on Faith</i>, Doctrine and Covenants, 1891, p. 3]<br><br>We need courage to push forward, even against the pessimists and defeatists, to achieve or attain that which our faith has caused us to envision and to emblazon on our souls. What else besides courage did the Lord ask Joshua when he was called to initiate the task of preparing Israel to enter the land of Canaan?<br><br><i>Have not I commanded thee? Be strong and of a good courage; be not afraid, neither be thou dismayed: for the Lord thy God is with thee whithersoever thou goest.</i>[Joshua 1:9]<br><br>And why humility? Love of self in acceptable amounts is a tool of progress. But when it surpasses that amount in the smallest degree, it has a negative effect. When anyone supposes that all he thinks or does is totally his own, that is when he lacks humility. For example, in the field of art, generally the things which are done today can be done because the basics have been learned from others. There is a subconscious repeating and transforming, even though there is no chance that they could have copied. Musicians can testify to the same thing.<br><br>Even Sir Isaac Newton confessed that he was indebted to past generations when he said that he had risen to height by "standing upon ye shoulders of Giants." (Letter to Robert Hooke, 5 February 1675/6).<br><br>From these examples it can be inferred that lack of humility is generally caused from an excess of self-esteem. It is not only unjustified, but it is damaging as it does not allow one to objectively analyze true values. There cannot be reasoning. Reasoning becomes obscured and sometimes goes to a point that it is not recognizable as a fundamental part, and one may forget that the powers of heaven are essential in the process of achievement.<br><br>And to demonstrate that what I am saying is not anything new on this particular subject, I will read that which Alma said to his son Shiblon 73 years before Christ:<br><br><i>And I would that ye would be diligent and temperate in all things.</i><br><br><i>See that ye are not lifted up unto pride; yea, see that ye do not boast in your own wisdom, nor of your much strength.</i><br><br><i>Use boldness, but not overbearance; and also see that ye bridle all your passions, that ye may be filled with love; see that ye refrain from idleness</i>. [Alma 38:10–12]<br><br>If we were to amplify the definition of humility as an accurate determination of one's own value, then we can consider low self-esteem just as dangerous as overly high self-esteem.<br><br>I can assure you, for example, that one of the factors which makes progress most difficult among young people is their tendency to consider themselves unequal to the task or incapable of handling the problems and challenges that they must face. This is particularly true oftentimes with missionaries. In cases such as these I remind them of the parable of the talents, placing special emphasis on the words of the Savior, "To every man according to his . . . ability" (Matthew 25:15).<br><h2><b>Summary</b></h2><br>I believe the time has come to summarize all that we have considered thus far so that a conclusion can be reached. In other words, we want to impress upon our minds the process that will help us achieve, or, to say it in the words we used in the beginning, to help us develop a creative mind.<br><br>Let us see if the summary can be effective while utilizing the words of Joseph Smith found in his beautiful story wherein he was led to the transcendent experience of this last dispensation.<br><br>You will remember that Joseph Smith began by telling where he was born, naming the members of his family, and then portraying the situation of the religious world in which he lived as a 14-year-old boy. He tells of the contentions, the divisions, and the terrible confusion that existed at that time.<br><br>Then, as he expressed it in his own words:<br><br><i>During this time of great excitement my mind was called up to serious reflection and great uneasiness; . . .</i><br><br><i>My mind at times was greatly excited, the cry and tumult were so great and incessant.</i>[Joseph Smith--History 1:8, 9]<br><br>How many other persons were experiencing this same feeling? How many had "eyes to see, but did not see"? How many had actually observed? How many actually saw the conditions the way Joseph Smith saw them? This situation certainly describes the first step in the process.<br><br>Further in the story we read,<br><br><i>In the midst of this war of words and tumult of opinions, I often said to myself: What is to be done? Who of all these parties are right; or, are they all wrong together? If any one of them be right, which is it? And how shall I know it?</i><br><br><i>While I was laboring under the extreme difficulties caused by the contests of these parties of religionists, I was one day reading the Epistle of James, first chapter and fifth verse, which reads: If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.</i><br><br><i>Never did any passage of scripture come with more power to the heart of man than this did at this time to mine. It seemed to enter with great force into every feeling of my heart. I reflected on it again and again, knowing that if any person needed wisdom from God, I did; for how to act I did not know, and unless I could get more wisdom than I then had, I would never know; for the teachers of religion of the different sects understood the same passages of scripture so differently as to destroy all confidence in setting the question by an appeal to the Bible.</i>[Joseph Smith--History 1:10-12]<br><br>Don't these words seem to be a beautiful example of reasoning, of deep pondering and meditation, considering all the facts that his observation, anxiety, and fervent desire to know and to experience brought to his mind? Then, of course, he found himself at the door of a glorious experience which the Lord had in store for him, but nevertheless he was carefully and perfectly doing his part.<br><br>Joseph Smith then told us how he proceeded to simplify and organize his ideas, the conclusions of which had led him to his reasoning and meditation--he studied the alternatives before making any decision. Obviously, without alternatives there can be no decision.<br><br><i>At length I came to the conclusion that I must either remain in darkness and confusion, or else I must do as James directs, that is, ask of God.</i><br><br>Doesn't that seem to be a beautiful simplification and a perfect organization of ideas for a 14-year-old youth?<br><br>To continue, Joseph said,<br><br><i>I at length came to the determination to "ask of God," concluding that if he gave wisdom to them that lacked wisdom, and would give liberally and not upbraid, I might venture.</i>[Joseph Smith--History 1:13]<br><br>The decision was made--again, correct decisions, based on correct principles.<br><br>And then what next did young Joseph do after making his decision? Well, he took the step that gave form to all the preceding process--he acted on it and did it promptly.<br><br>We read his narration:<br><br><i>So, in accordance with this, my determination to ask of God, I retired to the woods to make the attempt.</i>[Joseph Smith--History 1:14]<br><br>Here we have Joseph Smith taking action, or, in other words, praying in order to gain wisdom. But the process did not stop there.<br><br>Do you remember that we said we should strive diligently to achieve the goals we had decided to pursue? We see that the same thing happened to Joseph Smith the instant he began to pray.<br><br><i>After I had retired to the place where I had previously designed to go, having looked around me, and finding myself alone, I kneeled down and began to offer up the desires of my heart to God. I had scarcely done so, when immediately I was seized upon by some power which entirely overcame me. . . .</i><br><br><i>But, exerting all my powers to call upon God to deliver me out of the power of this enemy, . . . just at this moment of great alarm, I saw a pillar of light exactly over my head.</i>[Joseph Smith--History 1:15–16]<br><br>What a vivid example of struggle and effort to reach a desired goal! And the promise in the epistle of James was fulfilled by the words of our Father in Heaven: "This is My Beloved Son. Hear Him" (Joseph Smith--History 1:17).<br><br>The other elements we spoke of--faith, courage, and humility--are reflected in all of the incidents of his story. There is no doubt that faith was evident in each of young Joseph's words, but as a final example, let's read those which to me appear to reflect the perfect example of courage, humility, and above all, peace.<br><br><i>I had actually seen a light, and in the midst of that light I saw two Personages, and they did in reality speak to me; and though I was hated and persecuted for saying that I had seen a vision, yet it was true; and while they were persecuting me, reviling me, and speaking all manner of evil against me falsely for so saying, I was led to say in my heart: Why persecute me for telling the truth? I have actually seen a vision; and who am I that I can withstand God, or why does the world think to make me deny what I have actually seen? For I had seen a vision; I knew it, and I knew that God knew it, and I could not deny it, neither dared I do it; at least I knew that by so doing I would offend God, and come under condemnation.</i><br><br><i>I had now got my mind satisfied so far as the sectarian world was concerned.</i>[Joseph Smith--History 1:25–26]<br><br>I pray that the time we have spent together this evening shall be of some benefit in improving our lives, in improving our reasoning, and in developing better thoughts, and above all, in becoming better Saints. As Paul said:<br><br><i>Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report; if there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think on these things</i>. [Philippians 4:8]<br><br>May the Lord bless us to this end, I say, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Angel Abrea was a member of the First Quorum of the Seventy of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when this fireside address was given at Brigham Young University on 7 March 1982.</i></i><br><br><i>©Intellectual Reserve, Inc.

<h1>s: A Law of Increasing Returns - Henry B. Eyring - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I'm grateful to be with you tonight. And I appreciate what it means for you to have decided to spend your time with me. I watched you take your seats and wait. I'd like to talk with you tonight about those two things: about time. And about waiting.<br><h2><b>A Time to Every Purpose</b></h2><br>I was riding in a car with a wise man a few years ago. We talked about some tragedies in lives of people we knew. Some had waited too long, missing the chance to act. And some had waited not long enough. He said quietly, more to himself than to me, "Timing is everything."<br><br>Ecclesiastes said, with an elegance that goes beyond poetry to frame our problem:<br><br><i>To every thing there is a season, and a time to every purpose under the heaven:</i><br><br><i>A time to be born, and a time to die; a time to plant, and a time to pluck up that which is planted.</i><br><br>And then later:<br><br><i>A time to get, and a time to lose; a time to keep, and a time to cast away.</i>[Ecclesiastes 3:1–2, 6]<br><br>Waiting for a harvest takes more judgment in life than it does in gardening. In your garden, you can tell if the seed sprouts. And even an amateur can tell when the corn or carrots are ready. But I remember a story told to me long ago, far from here, by a sad voice. I remember it not because it was unique but because I have heard the same story told, again and again, about waiting or failing to wait. The details vary, but not the feeling of drama.<br><br>She said it happened on a summer Saturday afternoon. She was tired. Tired of being single. Tired of trying to be a faithful Latter-day Saint. Not so much tired of being kind and virtuous as tired of nothing good seeming to come of it. She'd not had a date in months.<br><br>She saw no prospect of even becoming friends with, let alone marrying, a man who shared her faith and ideals. In frustration she found herself deciding something. She decided that afternoon, consciously, that years of good works and restraint had produced too little and promised no more. She said to herself almost aloud, "Oh, what's the use?"<br><br>The phone rang. It was a man's voice, a man she knew. He lived in the same apartment building. He'd asked her out before. She'd refused because she was sure he'd expect her to compromise her standards she'd preserved at great effort. But, almost as if directed by a scriptwriter, he called at that instant.<br><br>She didn't say, "Yes." She said, "I'll think about it." She thought about it. He called again. And finally, she repeated to herself, "Oh, what's the use?" She went. She found she had been right about his intentions. And in a choice about time and about waiting or not waiting, her life changed. So, she will never know what might have been ahead on the path she decided wasn't worth the price; she knew quickly the other one was uphill, and a hard climb.<br><br>All of us make decisions every day, almost every hour, about whether it's worth it to wait. The hardest ones are where the waiting includes working. Does it make sense to keep working, to keep sacrificing, when nothing seems to be coming from the effort?<br><br>There's a young man in the mission field who's made that choice in the last month. I heard his story, but there must have been thousands of such choices made last month. His companion would have made Job's critical friends seem like the Three Nephites. Just living and working with his companion required more contribution than the young missionary had dreamed he was going to have to make. The mission president authorized them to stay in their apartment because wind brought the effective temperature to 80 degrees below zero. So, the young man had to decide, "Shall we go out? We've been tracting and it's produced nothing. For what it would cost us, what would we get? We haven't got a contact, so we'd be just hitting doors." Well, he went--that's an odd investment decision, but he went. What he got was to meet one man, behind one of a hundred doors. In his letter about the man's baptism, he said, "I've never been more happy in mylife."<br><h2><b>The Law of the Harvest</b></h2><br>We're talking about an application of the law of the harvest. Common sense tells you there is such a law, and so did the Savior and so have the prophets. Remember how Paul said it:<br><br><i>Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth, thatshall he also reap.</i><br><br><i>For he that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption; but he that soweth to the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting.</i>[Galatians 6:7–8]<br><br>Tonight we're talking just about sowing to the Spirit. We're concerned with that long list of requirements and commandments you already know are essential along the way to eternal life. Tonight we're going to try to understand one universal challenge: How to keep waiting and working when the harvest seems delayed.<br><br>The most important fact to note is that crops,even the spiritual ones, are not all of one kind. There are early maturing varieties and late varieties. Maybe you've noticed in seed catalogues that one corn can be harvested in less, sometimes nearly half, the time it takes for another to be ready. You may not pay attention to that, but I do because I've lived in Rexburg, Idaho. It freezes there just before the Fourth of July, and sometimes just after.<br><br>Efforts, spiritual or practical, don't all bear fruit in the same length of time. You know that, but you may not have noticed something about your behavior that makes sense only if most of your experience is with early crops. Those are the ones where effort produces fast results. What happens after the early harvest? Would you expect an intelligent person to keep cultivating a field that had already produced its crop and been cleared? No, at least not in the hope ofgetting more harvest.<br><br>Now, one trouble with most of our strugglesis that you can't see the seeds and the crops clearly. And you may not know as much about maturation time. So, you have to make this decision frequently: "Has this effort yielded about all it's going to, or shall I keep working and waiting?"<br><br>Without even watching you at the library orin your rooms, I can guess you've usually assumed you were working with early crops. Think of the last set of math problems you worked. For some of you that may be very difficult, but think about it. Think of the last paper you submitted. How many times did you rework the problems? Did you try another attack on the problem after you found that your answer agreed with the one in the back ofthe book? Did you work extra problems, beyond those assigned? How many drafts did you write of that last paper? Two? Three? Ten?<br><h2><b>Diminishing Returns</b></h2><br>The answers will vary, but not much. For most of you, the best bet is that you stopped early. Why? Because you understand something called "the law of diminishing returns." Most of you use it when you cut a lawn. You cut it in one direction, then may cut it in the other, to get it smoother. But not many of you would cut it a third time. Why? Because you'd say, "It isn't worth it. I've gotten about all the smoothness I'm going to get. And more than that, cutting it the third time will take nearly as much time as it did the first."<br><br>Most of us believe in the law of conservation of energy, particularly our own. We treat most of our effort like planting and harvesting an early crop. We expect early results with little more to come from keeping up the effort after the first rush of rewards.<br><br>That makes good sense for cutting lawns. And it makes good sense for many other things. In fact, it makes sense for so many that Ithink you may find it easy to say in your mind, "I pity some of those people who just seem like losers, always working and always waiting." Something going on in the world around you encourages, almost demands that attitude.<br><h2><b>The Late Crops</b></h2><br>Husbands, wives, parents, and even children are familiar with deciding, "Shall I keep giving when I'm getting so little?" Families may be the best place to find out how the world feels about working and waiting for late crops. Families require some of the toughest investment decisions of all. Statistics show clearly which way the decisions are going in this country. In 1945, half the people in America thought four or more children was theideal number for a family to have. By 1980, only 16 percent thought so. From 1960 to 1977, it's estimated that the number of unmarried people living together doubled, from half a million to a million. That's a million people who are unwilling even to start the investment process in a family.<br><br>Most of you know what investments--and patience--are required to maintain virtue, serve an effective mission, or build an eternal family. But perhaps many of you haven't given enough attention to how much the world is moving away from the idea of delaying gratification long enough to do those things.<br><br>Here's some grim arithmetic to let you see it. An economist named Henry Kaufmann has added up the wealth in America and subtracted all the debt. In 1964, that showed us about $400 million in the hole. By 1980, the hole had increased, or, since it's a hole, I should say sunk, to $3 trillion. Even if his figures overstate the problem, they make clear the direction we've chosen. That tells you something about how much more we're demanding to have our future now. One farmer heard those numbers and said, "Why, we've been eating our seed corn."<br><br>You shouldn't really be surprised to have arrived in an "I want it now" generation. A prophet, Peter, saw it long ago. He said,<br><br><i>Knowing this first, that there shall come in the last days scoffers, walking after their own lusts,</i><br><br><i>And saying, Where is the promise of his coming? for since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation.</i>[2Peter 3:3–4]<br><br>You are believers, not scoffers. Yet the scoffers can be helpful, because they encourage you to get an answer to this question: "What am I willing to keep giving heart and soul for, when neither I nor the scoffers may see returns for a long, long time?" And when we decide there are potential rewards worth that commitment, you'll want answers to another question: "How can I keep myself working and waiting if the scoffers are loud and the delay long?"<br><br>There are spiritual crops that require months, years, and sometimes a lifetime of cultivation before the harvest. Among them are spiritual rewards you want most. That shouldn't surprise you. Common sense tells you that what matters most won't come easily. But there is another reason suggested in the scriptures. Remember this from the Book of Mormon?<br><br><i>And now, I, Moroni, would speak somewhat concerning these things; Iwould show unto the world that faith is things which are hoped for and not seen; wherefore, dispute not because ye see not, for ye receive no witness until after the trial of your faith.</i>[Ether 12:6]<br><br>And from the Doctrine and Covenants:<br><br><i>Ye cannot behold with your natural eyes, for the present time, the design of your God concerning those things which shall come hereafter, and the glory which shall follow after much tribulation.</i><i>For after much tribulation come the blessings. Wherefore the day cometh that ye shall be crowned with much glory; the hour is not yet, but is nigh at hand.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 58:3–4]<br><h2><b>The Law of Increasing Returns</b></h2><br>If you wanted to give this idea a name, you could call it "the law of increasing returns." The simple fact is that there is a God who wants us to have faith in him. He knows that tostrengthen faith we must use it. And so he gives us the chance to use it by letting some of the spiritual rewards we want most be delayed. Instead of first effort yielding returns, with a steady decline, it's the reverse. First efforts, and even second efforts, seem to yield little. And then the rewards begin, perhaps much later, togrow and grow.<br><br>Most of us need encouragement to workand wait for rewards. But not everybody. I knew one man who lived his life pretty much as if everything he did was working on a late crop. He was my father. He died this Christmas after a life filled with getting rewards, from the National Medal of Science in this country to the Wolff Prize in Israel. But if you'd watched him in private, you would have seen some unusual behavior.<br><br>I remember him wrestling my Aunt Rose once. She was visiting us in New Jersey, and we'd driven to the ice cream store. You'll know how old I am when I say a cone cost a dime. Aunt Rose tried to pay for our cones. Dad wrestled her for it. I remember being afraid he'd break her arm. He was determined he'd give, not receive. And she was going to receive a broken arm if that's what it took. They laughed, but Dad won.<br><br>He won that fight all his life, giving more than he got. He taught every term in his yearsat the University of Utah, including summers. There was no extra pay. It wasn't even required as part of the job. Iremember his trading a first-class ticket for tourist and sending the difference to the company that had provided the ticket. His life was to give first class but always take the tourist. Why? I've got an idea. He believed in the law of increasing returns. Give more than you take; invest in the future; cast your bread upon the waters.<br><br>You might think he was extreme. He probably was. My guess is that he left more of everything of this world's goods than he consumed in a lifetime, despite all the awards heaped on him. I don't recommend that to you, partly because it might drive your spouse slightly bonkers. But there is a scripture about behavior like that. It'sin Matthew 6:1–4:<br><br><i>Take heed that ye do not your alms before men, to be seen of them: otherwise ye have no reward of your Father which is in heaven.</i><i>Therefore when thou doest thine alms, do not sound a trumpet before thee, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may have glory of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.</i><i>But when thou doest alms, let not thy left hand know what they right hand doeth:</i><i>That thine alms may be in secret: and thy Father which seeth in secret himself shall reward thee openly.</i><br><br>I wouldn't suggest Dad fought to buy the ice cream because he wanted a reward in heaven. He just had a general bias toward putting in hard work up front and letting the rewards take a long time tocome, even forever.<br><br>Even in the confusion of the last night Ispent with him, he gave me some advice. Iwashelping him walk. I'm not even sure he knew Iwas there. But very clearly, almost with a booming voice, he said, "Well, let's just do the homework tonight, and we'll see how the exam goes in the morning." He's getting the grade now, and he spent a life doing as much homework as he could. Most of us could move profitably toward a little more homework and leave the grades for tomorrow.<br><br>My guess is that all of us want to be better at working and waiting. Let me give you some advice about how to do it. It all follows from what we've said about the law of increasing returns, about planting and tending late crops. But it's not just theory. I got these hints from watching people who are the best I've seen at working and waiting on late crops. As the ads say, "This product has been proven in clinical tests."<br><br>All these hints have to do with where you focus your eyes. Two are things you ought to notice about the present, while you're working and waiting and not getting much yet in return. And the last two are ways to look at the glorious future you're working and waiting for.<br><h2><b>Present Humor</b></h2><br>First, keep your eyes open for humor in the present. The people I know who are good for the long haul all seem to smile easily. It's not hard for me to understand, for instance, that the Prophet Joseph Smith, who marched triumphantly through trouble, would describe himself as having a "cheerful disposition." You can't just get yourself a cheerful disposition, but you could keep your eyes open for something to smile at.<br><br>It's not hard. That's because the best humor springs from seeing the incongruity in your own predicament. Who's got more predicament than someone giving lots with small result? And who's more apt to laugh easily at himself than someone who has ultimate faith that the predicament will end? So look for the chance to smile.<br><br>I've had some experience in the chain-saw business. One joke keeps reappearing with new variations. The father of them all goes like this. A customer bought his first chain saw. He was told how many trees he'd be able to cut an hour. He came back to the dealer complaining. He couldn't cut a tenth that many trees. The saw was checked and found perfect. He was reassured that practice and time would solve the problem. He kept coming back as many times as you want to extend the story to make it funny.<br><br>Finally, in desperation, the dealer said, "Let me take you out to the forest and show you." They got there, the dealer pulled the cord, the engine roared, and the customer said, "What's that?"<br><br>Now, you laughed slowly or not at all. But try that story on a woodcutter. He pictures quickly that poor man sawing on a tree with a chain saw with the motor not running. You've got to know how heavy they are. You need to have cut down a tree. If you have, you roar. Why? Because it's funny to think of yourself flailing away. They even have an expression forit, when they're trying to persuade you of something and failing: "Well, I'm swinging the axe, but no chips areflying."<br><br>Most returned missionaries and most married couples here tonight have swung the axe and seen no chips flying. You could top, those of you who have been there, any funny story I'd try to tell. And if we were in a small group, you'd try. That's not because we are humorists. And it's not because missions or marriage or dedicated service are not serious. But, the incongruities of giving more than you seem to get guarantee the chance to smile at yourself. Ihope you will. All it will take is to keep your eyes open. And I think it's a key toendurance.<br><h2><b>Present Blessings</b></h2><br>The second place to focus your eyes is on theblessings you are getting, now while you wait. When you are trying hard to give, knowing the rewards will be delayed, it's terribly easy to overlook other blessings. Not all blessings are delayed. The early harvest is all around you. King Benjamin suggested you start by noticing that you arebreathing. He also said, as you likely remember:<br><br><i>And secondly, he doth require that ye should do as he hath commanded you; for which if ye do, he doth immediately bless you; and thereafter he hath paid you.</i>[Mosiah 2:24]<br><br>Some results may be delayed to allow you to strengthen your faith. But other blessings come immediately. And King Benjamin valued those so highly compared to what we give that he said, "Mark your whole bill 'Paid in full.'" Iknow that's hard to do if you are struggling under a heavy load. It's easy to see your load and to pine for the delayed rewards. But King Benjamin taught us that we're already abundantly paid, both with free gifts--such as life, for which we gave nothing--and with other blessings which have followed immediately upon our faithful service.<br><br>Just that focus of the eyes might save your marriage someday. I'll guarantee you one thing. You won't contract a great marriage; you'll build one. Now that's not saying that some contracts to build aren't a lot better than others. But it will take effort and time. Maybe alot of time. And millions of men and women every year, or day, or hour must mutter, "What am I getting out of this? If it weren't for the children--" Hold it right there: "The children."<br><br>The other day, Elizabeth, age two, saw the picture of her father in the paper. She said, "That's Dad. He wants to change with me." That doesn't mean much to you. In fact, it might even confuse you because you might notknow she means help her father change, not get changed herself. It means a lot to me because I'm the guy who sits on the floor when she says, "You sit here." I'll tell you something. All she has to do is hand me those shoe trees one time and then say, "Let me kiss your head" (which, as you can see, is easy to hit), and you can mark anything owed me on the marriage account "Paid in full."<br><br>I recognize that's easy for a father to say. Mothers invest so much more in children that akiss from a little girl still leaves a lot for the future. Men and women working outside the home deal mostly with early crops and with the law of diminishing returns. In the home, they spend far more on late crops and the law of increasing returns. It's important to remember that. It could help a woman understand why arguments for a career and little time spent rearing children are so tempting. And it might help a man understand why a child trampling on the teachings of the home may tear at his wife even more than at him. His paycheck comes often. Hers may come a few times in her life. And now perhaps, because of the choice of a child, one check may not come at all.<br><br>But for men and women, obsessed as they should be with the eternal results that take solong, it helps to see the blessings already inhand. The prettiest flowers I've ever seen were among rocks near the tops of mountains. That must have been partly because I worked sohard to get there, for something else. And then, suddenly, there they were. By forcing yourself to look at them, at the blessings around you, it will be easy to do what King Benjamin suggested: "O how you ought to thank your heavenly King!" (Mosiah 2:19).<br><br>Among the reasons we ought to be thankful is that it will improve our vision. And with an eye on today's blessings you'll have more staying power for the distant goal.<br><h2><b>The Distant Goal</b></h2><br>Now, let me suggest how to keep your eye on the distant goal. What will a successful mission look like? How can I picture a great marriage? That's hard to see before you get there. And it's hard to persevere without some picture.<br><br>I've never forgotten the sacrament talk of an Englishman who had spent four years in a Japanese prison camp. Two missionaries had found and baptized him just before the capture of Singapore. He lost all his possessions save a photograph of the two missionaries. And that he kept hidden from his captors. He survived, he said, largely by finding moments, sometimes hidden under a blanket, when he could look at the picture and imagine himself talking to the elders again. So vivid is that evening sacrament meeting to me that I remember now, thirty-five years later, that he finished his testimony and sang "The Holy City."<br><br>You rarely can have a photograph of that future for which you now sacrifice, but you can get pictures. Years ago, near the time of that sacrament meeting, it occurred to me that I would sometime perhaps have a family. I evenjoked about them, calling them "the red heads." My mother's hair had been red when she was young. I certainly didn't think the idea of red heads was inspiration, just an idea. But more than once that picture was enough to make me work, and wait.<br><br>If all my four sons were here tonight, you would see two blond heads and two red ones. In a kitchen chat one evening, one of them said to me he'd not mind exchanging red hair for beach-boy blond. I just smiled. All dads may think their sons are handsome, but I would not exchange his red hair, nor my early vision of it, for spun gold.<br><br>It's not wise to daydream, and I'm not recommending it. If you girls dream too much about a house or a car, some poor man will someday have to get it for you. But I recommend a little thought, not about things or places but about people. All the late crops, all the assignments God will reward in the long run that I can think of, involve serving someone else.<br><br>For example, now and then I try to think ofmy children as parents, perhaps older than Iam now, perhaps at the end of life.<br><br>I learned something about the end of life from watching my father at the end of his. He talked a lot about his father. His father was kind. His father believed in him. His father liked to be with him so much that he got him ahorse to ride the range with him before my dad could walk. That's what he talked about at the end, when priorities got very clear. Perhaps much of what he did, in science, in serving God, was possible because of what his father did.<br><br>Just that little vision of the future makes me eager when the younger boys ask, "Dad, can we go to the Deseret Gym tonight?" and the older ones say, "Let's hit a few tennis balls." It's not quite the same as riding with your son on the Piedras Verdes, the way Grandpa did. But Ihope it has just half the results.<br><br>I suppose those pictures are really visions. And you'd have to pray for them, or take them as gifts. But at least watch for them. You may catch glimmers. I have had a few. And they help.<br><h2><b>Delayed Blessings</b></h2><br>Now, finally, it's important to look carefully at those delayed blessings to notice that they are of at least two kinds. Some you can see and touch, and maybe even spend. You remember them:<br><br>For keeping the Sabbath day, long enough, the promise is:<br><br><i>Verily I say, that inasmuch as ye do this, the fulness of the earth is yours, the beasts of the field and the fowls of the air, and that which climbeth upon the trees and walketh upon the earth.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 59:16]<br><br>There are many promises of tangible things. And you and I know of instances where faithful performance seems not to have yet produced the blessings. But for all sacred performances in serving God, there is another promised blessing. You couldn't touch it or spend it, and you can only see it with special vision. But I commend developing the skill to see it.<br><br>A man named Helaman had such skill. He was struggling, under great uncertainty about what was ahead. He was working and waiting. Here's what he said happened:<br><br><i>Yea, and it came to pass that the Lord our God did visit us with assurances that he would deliver us; yea, insomuch that he did speak peace toour souls, and did grant unto us great faith, and did cause us that we should hope for our deliverance in him.</i>[Alma 58:11]<br><br>If you learn how to see it, you can know that many people have had that peace spoken to their souls. There are men and women undergoing trials and tests of faith that might lead you to say, "Their faith will break." But it doesn't break, and they do take it. And if you will look carefully, you will soon realize that peace has been spoken to their souls and faith in deliverance increased. If you notice that, it will make it more likely that you will feel that peace. I bear you my testimony that you can.<br><br>I pray that you won't let the world nudge you toward spending your futures now. There are some things you should work for and expect results now. But along with getting early harvests, I hope you'll work and waitfor the late ones. That will take seeing the law of increasing returns as an opportunity, not just a test. Delayed blessings will build your faith in God to work, and wait, for him. The scriptures aren't demeaning when they command, "Wait upon the Lord." That means both service and patience. And that will build yourfaith.<br><br>It may help you to watch both for the chance to smile and the blessings around you on the way. And it may help to picture both the future of the people whom you serve for God and his promise ofpeace in this life.<br><br>I bear testimony that there is a God, that the chance to serve and be blessed by him is vastly multiplied by the restoration of the gospel, and that faith exercised is strengthened, and finally rewarded. And I bear you my testimony that to his faithful servants God speaks peace to their souls, builds their faith, and gives them hope for rewards glorious enough to wait for. I bear you that testimony and pray God's blessings upon you in your working and your waiting. In the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Henry B.

<h1>s No Fun Being Poor - Marvin J. Ashton - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I think, when I announce the title of my remarks, it is reasonable to assume many of you could nudge the one next to you and say, "So what else is new?" or "I know that is true. Where does the line form for those to stand who want to bear witness to the fact?"<br><br>Well, with just that much to arouse your interest, my topic is, "It's No Fun Being Poor."<br><br>Despite some thoughts to the contrary, the great majority in attendance today are not poor. However, we can become victims of real poverty if we are not wise in our daily conduct. Fortunately, very few in attendance today are poor. The main question for every person to resolve is not what he would do if he had unlimited money, time, influence, or vast educational advantages, but how he will best use the means and assets he has and will yet have.<br><br>The purpose of my remarks is to try to help all of us avoid being poor. I hope that, if we are already poor, we will be wise enough to overcome it with corrective actions prompted by self-motivation. Brigham Young University does not exist to help you make money. It exists to make you rich.<br><br>"It's no fun being poor." Here are some truths for your consideration. I am going to identify them as ten commandments we should follow if we would avoid being poor. Doubtless there may be 10, 20, or 30 more, but for our purposes today, the following may be construed as perhaps a good start.<br><h2><b>I. Thou shalt not lose a friend or cease being one.</b></h2><br>A person is poor when his friendship inventory is depreciating. A person is poor when he is friendless. When friends, those closest to us, have cause to desert, to disbelieve, to lose confidence in us, we are poor. Very often friends are lost because we are unwilling to pay the price it takes to maintain them. It was Emerson who said, "The only way to have a friend is to be one" ("Friendship,"<i>Essays</i>). A friend is a person who will not only take the time to know us, but also take the time to be with us, and never leave us regardless of the circumstances. One of the finest presents each of us can give someone else is our best self. When we lose friends, our strength as well as our desire is ofttimes totally drained. In our personal balance sheets "minus friends" indicates a loss position. No man is useless while he has a friend. No man can declare personal bankruptcy if he has one friend.<br><br>Joseph Smith gave us a glimpse of his measure of friends when he said, "If my life is of no value to my friends, it is of none to myself" (<i>HC</i>6:549). The Savior said, "Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends" (John 15:13).<br><br>When Robert Louis Stevenson was asked the secret of his radiant, useful life, he responded simply, "I had a friend."<br><br>A friend in the true sense is not a person who passively nods approval of our conduct or encourages improper behavior. A friend is a person who cares. When we lose someone who cares about us, we lose one of our most valuable assets. An Arabian proverb helps us:<br><br><i>A friend is one to whom one may pour out all the contents of one's heart, chaff and grain together, knowing that the gentlest of hands will take and sift it, keep what is worth keeping, and with the breath of kindness blow the rest away.</i><br><br>A friend is a priceless possession because a true friend is one who is willing to take us the way we are but is able to leave us better than he found us. We are poor when we lose friends because generally they are willing to reprove, admonish, love, encourage, and guide for our best good. A friend lifts the heavy heart, says the encouraging word, and assists in supplying our daily needs. As friends we will make ourselves available without delay to those who need us.<br><br>It is hoped that in the days ahead more and more of us will free ourselves from expressions of, "If you need me, let me know," or, "If I can be of help, call me," and replace them with the development of a sixth sense that will let us know when and where our friendship is needed.<br><br>When Joseph Smith was in the Liberty Jail, he poured out his heart and soul with, "O God, where art thou?" (D&amp;amp;C 121:1).<br><br>Part of God's great declaration of love and encouragement to him at that time was,<br><br><i>My son, . . . thy friends do stand by thee, and they shall hail thee again with warm hearts and friendly hands.</i><br><br><i>Thou art not yet as Job; thy friends do not contend against thee, neither charge thee with transgression, as they did Job</i>. [D&amp;amp;C 121:7, 9, 10]<br><br>Joseph Smith was enduring much for God's own purposes, but he was rich because his friends were standing by him. A person is poor when he is friendless, but even poorer when he ceases being a friend. No matter what the conduct or negligence of others may be, we cannot afford to yield in our sincere pursuit to be a friend. When a person allows himself to feel he has no friends, he is poor; but he is doubly poor if he has to admit he is a friend to no one. Very often our family members and friends need our friendship most when they least deserve it.<br><h2><b>II. Thou shalt honor thy character and protect it from self-destruction.</b></h2><br>A person is poor when his character is honeycombed with greed and warped by dishonesty. When we yield to misconduct under pressure, we are poor. A person who has to beg for bread is not poor if he has not bent to expediency. An individual is headed for personal bankruptcy when he sells his character and reputation for cash, honor, or convenience. We are poor in character when we think getting by is a substitute for doing our best. Virtue, action, and truth properly blended in life make a person rich. Our character is determined by how we perform in meeting life's challenges. Thank God for students, faculty, and administration who have the courage to stand up and be counted on the side of truth and integrity. What a compliment it is to have someone say of you, "She will not yield her principles under pressure or distress."<br><h2><b>III. Thou shalt not deceive.</b></h2><br>Sir Walter Scott said:<br><br><i>Oh, what a tangled web we weave,</i><br><i>When first we practice to deceive!</i><br>[<i>Marmion</i>, canto 6, stanza 17]<br><br>A man of character considers what is right. A man of deceit considers, "What will partial truths bring me when I crowd the line of truth?"<br><br><i>And again, verily I say unto you, blessed is my servant Hyrum Smith; for I, the Lord, love him because of the integrity of his heart, and because he loveth that which is right before me, saith the Lord.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 124:15]<br><br>A favorite tool of the devil is deception. He would have us all become poor by living and promoting the lie. Whenever deception is encouraged, the promoter is the greatest loser. He must bear the responsibility for those he injures. Satan's skills win him the title of "the father of deceit."<br><h2><b>IV. Thou shalt not compromise thy principles.</b></h2><br>Students and others should constantly remind themselves that character is education properly applied. The sharing and encouraging of truth on a continuing basis shelters one from poverty. Nobility in character is one asset that will bring dividends regardless of the business climate. A quality person will not compromise his principles regardless of the size or intensity of the foe or the situation. A person who compromises in a sense advertises in the marketplace that a certain price or consideration will cause him to sell out. People of uncompromising principles are never poor. How rich are those who can live by worthy principles and manage the results!<br><h2><b>V. Thou shalt love thyself.</b></h2><br>Through an appropriate blend of self-pride and self-dignity, self-respect will surface. A person is poor when he personally labels himself as a "marked down" or a "close out" article.<br><br>A person is poor when he loses self-dignity, self-respect, and self-pride. How sad, how long the day when we become low on ourselves! The worst form of defeat is to be conquered by self. Defeat is not pleasant, but nothing is so painful and devastating as self-defeat. When we lose our self-dignity and self-respect, it is the worst form of poverty. When trust in friends and self are both lost, there is not much left in life. We should teach, particularly ourselves, that nobody is a nobody. We are someone, and with God's help we can accomplish all things. It is a sad day when a person finds it easier to be true to friends than to himself.How unwise, how unfair to sell ourselves short when God is our partner! Personal bankruptcy is impossible for a person of self-pride. A person is poor when he places despair over hope. A person is poor when he fails to remember who he really is and forgets his relationship to God, family, and self.<br><br>Many years ago on a hot summer day I was walking through the medium security division of the Utah State Prison. Most inmates were out of their cells. I mingled among them and visited with some. Most were dressed without shirts. I remember as though it were yesterday my talking to one who had tattooed across his chest in rather large letters "A Born Loser."<br><br>What self-pride, self-dignity, and self-respect! He had labeled himself poor, and his present environment indicated he was doing quite well with his personal image.<br><h2><b>VI. Thou shalt be honest.</b></h2><br>A person is poor when he thinks honesty is a policy instead of a proper way of life.Thomas Carlyle said, "Over the times thou hast no power, solely over one man thou hast quite absolute power. Him redeem and make honest." An honest conscience is worth more than it costs. Greatness is truly measured by honest self-appraisal. "What shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?" (Mark 8:36). How many times over the years have you heard the declaration that it is greater to be trusted than to be loved? Let me remind you that, regardless of the number of times, you haven't heard it enough. One of my greatest pleadings with the Lord on a daily basis is for Him to help me turn the hearts of the dishonest to repentance. Without honesty there is no foundation upon which to build. How can a person be helped when he insists on living the lie? Lying and living the lie keep us poor.<br><h2><b>VII. Thou shalt not wrongfully exploit others for personal advantage.</b></h2><br>A person is poor when he drops or uses the name of an individual or an institution to promote or sell his questionable wares. How unfair, unwise, and poor are those who would have us believe a "get rich" investment opportunity is desirable because of the ecclesiastical office the one holds who is making the proposition. Any person who allows his good name or image to be used to promote or encourage schemes of the unscrupulous is embracing dishonesty. A lie (dishonesty) is any communication given to another with the intent to deceive. An improper entry in one's personal ledger, flattery, failure to defend a truth or principle, failure to discipline, and the endorsement of a fallacy are a few of the other forms of exploiting for personal gain.<br><br>In today's marketplace--yes, in your own neighborhood, town, and cities--scheming, deceiving promoters are making available to gullible purchasers, including faculty and students, all kinds of enticing offers. We are sorry to report thousands within our ranks are being duped by the glib tongues of those who offer and solicit in whispers "once in a lifetime opportunities" and "just for you" approaches.<br><br>Those of us who give glib "pie in the sky" promoters even the time of day are moving in the direction of the classification of being poor.<br><h2><b>VIII. Thou shalt not believe repentance is an announcement.</b></h2><br>A person is poor when he lives by comparison rather than by principle. A person is poor when he fails to realize repentance is a process and not just a declaration. Every person has the challenge of recognizing and carrying his personal cross, and then going forth. Repentance is an action principle, not a self-declared holding pattern.<br><br>A person who is willing to repent will never have more liabilities than assets. Repentance makes it possible for the sinner to get back up when he falls. True repentance doesn't allow a person to stay poor.<br><br>When important happenings and decisions in life come our way and we feel we are at the very valley in our life's travels, we always have the choice of either repenting or rebelling. A person is poor only when he is unwilling to use and understand repentance. Repentance is a major stepping-stone in becoming rich. Repentance is not an announcement. It is improved conduct.<br><h2><b>IX. Thou shalt not stay poor.</b></h2><br>It's not fun being poor, but no one has to be. With friends, virtue, character, truth, integrity, repentance, and other God-given gifts and rights available, pearls of great price are ours for the seeking. Through prayer and action God helps us avoid being poor. He that has eternal life in its fulness is rich. It's no fun being poor. It is much more fun to be rich. We can be rich if life's ledger is filled with daily entries that show bottom-line totals including sound moral conduct, uprightness, and incorruptibility.<br><h2><b>X. Thou shalt not allow thyself to be managed by money.</b></h2><br>Remember the financially well-to-do are poor only when they allow their money to manage them instead of their managing their money.<br><br>There is one other very important ingredient for consideration when we talk about "It's No Fun Being Poor." Following the type of thinking I have promoted today, it would not be unusual--in fact, I think it would be quite likely--that, for example, four students who live in a dormitory together could experience this. One could be a little cynical or sarcastic, and, upon opening a cupboard door and looking inside at some of the bare shelves, say, "Don't forget, we're rich." Another might look in the refrigerator and freezer and, upon noting there is more cold than food, could say, "Don't forget, we're not poor; it just looks like we are!" Someone else who is convinced beyond reasonable doubt that she is entitled to a new dress or outfit after a long delay, but can't have them because of a lack of funds could murmur, "I must remember I'm rich."<br><br>A person who allows his money to manage him instead of his managing his money is poor. No matter how much or how little we have to live on each week or month, it needs to be used wisely. We need to work out a budget and live within it. Some claim living within a budget takes the fun out of life and is too restrictive. Those who avoid the inconvenience of budget regulations must suffer the pains of living outside it. Your Church operates within a budget. Brigham Young University functions within a budget. Each department in the school has a budget. The president of the university lives within a budget. Budget guidelines encourage better performance and management. It seems there will always be emergencies and crises in all of our lives that cause financial drain, but even these developments need not make us poor. Having friends, family, neighbors, bishops, stake presidents who care and share makes us rich. Financial disaster can be avoided if we learn with others how to help ourselves. Things generally turn up for those who keep digging. Through work, education, and commitment, personal satisfaction can be realized as we make appropriate use of the accumulation of this world's goods. No one needs to apologize for his success in financial achievement if the means of attainment have been honorable, and he knows how to wisely use what he has.<br><br>Conversely, when money and wealth become our goal and our god, we are poor. I personally applaud those who are honorably successful in achieving an abundance of this world's goods, but only if it is convincingly evident their money is being wisely used. I could hope and pray that in the future there will be more and more good men and women committed to having more of their money put to use helping some student and less in personal financial assets. No man should be respected just for his riches, but rather by his philanthropy. We do not judge the value of the sun by its height, but for its usefulness.<br><br>It is a worthy prayer to ask our Heavenly Father to bless us with this world's goods, but not with more than we can bear. Too much money can make us poor. Limited budgets can teach us sacrifice, self-reliance, restraint, and personal management. One of life's great lessons is to teach us that what we do with what we have is more important than what we have. Proper incentive and attitudes prevent us from ever classifying ourselves as poor.<br><br>I leave you these thoughts, my love, and my testimony. It's no fun being poor. Fortunately, none of us has to be. To this truth I leave my solemn witness in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Marvin J.

<h1>er Equipment - 1982 Commencement - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I am tempted to use this unique occasion to address my remarks, not to 15,000 people, but to one. I understand that your brilliant and handsome president, one of my dearest friends, has yet to become converted to the joys of jogging or the gospel according to Moody, Fisher, and Zimmerman. Even worse, of late his public pronouncements have been riddled with aerobic agnosticism. However, I have concluded that the problem of the Holland mitochondria being left under a bushel must be left for another occasion and perhaps another speaker.<br><br>At this great university you have been involved in learning. Learning is a process that has significance for not only your financial success but also your happiness for the next forty or fifty years. The extent to which your BYU experience will enrich your pocketbooks and your lives will depend to a considerable degree on how well you have mastered the process at this institution. It will depend even more on whether you have succeeded in making learning a part of your regimen for living.<br><br>Learning is also an eternal value. Indeed I know of nothing more central to eternal progress. Thus, we know that whatever degree of intelligence we attain in this life, "it will rise with us in the resurrection" (D&amp;amp;C 130:18). Note that the word is<i>intelligence</i>, which I submit is broader than either<i>information</i>or<i>knowledge</i>. In the eternal scheme of things it may or may not be important for you to know the rule in<i>Shelley's Case</i>or the second law of thermodynamics. But what is important is that you be able to use the tools by which you come to an understanding of the rule in<i>Shelley's Case</i>, the second law of thermodynamics, or any other piece of substantive information. Given an eternity in which to accomplish the task, I would assume that knowledge can be obtained by those who develop the proper equipment.<br><h2><b>Two Categories</b></h2><br>What, then, is the proper equipment? What are the tools we use to comply with the biblical injunction to gain understanding, the processes whose toughening and honing and enlarging constitute part of our eternal objective and will also make us happier persons in this life?<br><br>In my view, those processes can be divided into two categories. I will refer to them as the rational process and the extrarational process. The rational process is the one that you have used in your endeavors at this university. Its components should be familiar to all of you: reading, analysis, succinct written and oral expression, research, criticism, and skepticism.<br><br>In several senses, the extrarational process is different. Its methods are not the same. The results, when properly employed and properly interpreted, are much more sure. The process is not available to everyone. Neither is it as susceptible to individual human control. It is also, however, a superior process.<br><br>For centuries prior to 1820, human beings had debated about the nature of God. On occasion, hundreds of the world's best scholars had assembled for the purpose of resolving the issue by application of their combined intellectual talents. Out of centuries of rational effort, then, evolved the prevailing Christian concept of Deity. And yet in the space of just a few minutes, a boy of fourteen years learned more about the true nature of God than had come from centuries of the best rational effort of the world's finest minds. It did not result from debate, analysis, criticism, or human intellectual exchange. The process was extrarational. It came through revelation.<br><br>I would like to explore with you some of the relationships between these two great learning processes and the significance of those relationships to our happiness and progress in this life and the next. There are many such relationships. I will discuss three.<br><h2><b>Not Mutual Antagonists</b></h2><br>The first is that these two processes, properly understood, are not mutual antagonists. On the contrary, I believe that both the scriptures and human experience identify them as complementary and mutually supportive.<br><br>It should come, however, as no surprise to anyone that some people develop more proficiency with one of these processes than with the other. It is a predictable, but nonetheless unfortunate, consequence that those who feel more comfortable with one of them are frequently inclined to downplay or even be suspicious of the other. Worst of all, they may tend to ridicule or even stop using the method with which they feel less comfortable or are less proficient. Thus, we find some people completely rejecting understanding that is not rational in origin or rationally verifiable. Equally regrettable, on the other end of the spectrum, is the view that higher education and the tools that it employs are to be distrusted and avoided.<br><br>I submit that either of these attitudes is not only wrong but reflective of a fundamental misunderstanding of the scriptures and of the foundational eternal objective to pursue the acquisition of knowledge and understanding. Section 88 of the Doctrine and Covenants is explicit on this point. It does not enjoin us to seek learning "either by study or by faith." Neither does it admonish that "If ye have achieved learning by faith, ye are thereby permanently exempted from study." Rather, the commandment is to obtain learning and to obtain it both "by study and also by faith" (D&amp;amp;C 88:118). The plain message is that the two are companions, not antagonists--that no person is truly learned whose learning experiences exclude either the rational or the extrarational method.<br><br>Again, the experience of the Prophet is instructive. His was an experience that we would regard as classic extrarational learning, yet it was preceded by extensive rational effort. And the famous instruction given to Oliver Cowdery in section 9 of the Doctrine and Covenants also involves a combination of the two processes:<br><br><i>You must study it out in your mind; then you must ask me if it be right, and if it is right I will cause that your bosom shall burn within you; therefore, you shall feel that it is right.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 9:8]<br><br>To be sure, there are differences in the two processes. For one, the driving force is the spirit, and for the other, the mind. One is more reliable if it leads to divine sources; the other is more deliberate and more subject to human control.<br><br>But both are means to the same end. The true intellectual is one whose intellect is sufficiently developed that he recognizes not only the great potential, but also the limitations, of his intellectual capacity. Similarly, there is no need for the person who has acquired understanding through spiritual insights to be suspicious of those who acquire learning by study. The most learned people I know, and you have a number of role models seated on the stand before you, are people who find no inconsistency between study and faith and who have achieved proficiency in each. We should feel equally at home in the academy and in the temple. We should regard each as a center of learning. We know that the day will come when the lamb will lie down with the lion. We need not await the millennium for the scholar to be a patriarch, and the patriarch a scholar.<br><h2><b>Understanding a Differing Viewpoint</b></h2><br>I turn now to the second relationship. It is an inevitable consequence of free agency--of working things out for ourselves--that different people applying the rational process to the same issue will reach different conclusions. When this occurs, do not assume that your opponent has either failed to think the problem through or is being dishonest. Indeed, one of the surest marks of the intellectually mature person is a willingness to try to understand a point of view with which he or she disagrees.<br><br>John Stuart Mill said that he who knows only his own case knows little of that. From the narrow perspective of my own profession, Mill's advice is a cornerstone of good lawyering. The best lawyers are those who spend almost as much effort developing an understanding of the strengths of their opponents' cases as they do their own.<br><br>But the principle of which Mill spoke is a broader one, reaching far beyond the lawyering context. The truly learned person--of any profession--is one who is willing to try to understand to the best of his ability the opposing viewpoint, not just in the sense of being able to state what it is, but genuinely attempting to comprehend its merit. That kind of attitude about a position with which you disagree is, I believe, nothing more than a manifestation of the admonition stated in so many of the Savior's teachings that we should be concerned about others and not just ourselves. The true Samaritan, the person who is genuinely concerned about his neighbor, is sensitive not just for his neighbor's physical needs--food, clothing, and shelter--but for his thoughts as well.<br><br>For the lawyer, understanding a position with which you disagree will enhance your professional proficiency. For the citizen and the eternal being, it will advance you along the road to happiness and eternal perfection.<br><h2><b>What If Results Differ?</b></h2><br>The third and final relationship that I will discuss between these two great learning processes is perhaps the most important: What should you do when these two processes yield different results? It doesn't happen very often. For most of you it may never occur. But for some of you, during the course of your lives, there may occur instances in which your mental processes lead to a conclusion that you know is wrong because it is at odds with revealed truth. On those rare occasions when this happens, if it does, what should you do?<br><br>First, let me tell you what you do not do. You do not reject the value of intellectual effort--as the process that brought you to a conclusion that by definition has to be wrong.<br><br>It would be an erroneous and unfortunate oversimplification to say that intellectual effort--including such necessary components as skepticism and objectivity--is to be avoided because it can and sometimes does lead to conclusions that are at odds with eternal values. The reason that this would be both unfortunate and erroneous is that intellectual effort--including that which occasionally leads to error--is itself an eternal value. In the dispute that preceded the war in heaven, one thing that everyone appeared to recognize was that under the Lord's plan, some mistakes would be made. Indeed, the discretion to make choices, some of which by definition would be wrong, and then over the long run, in the event that we chose to do so, to work out those mistakes using our own resources, is<i>the</i>distinctive characteristic of the plan we chose.<br><br>How well I remember the words of a powerful lecture--given about forty years ago--by one of the elder members of my family to a then young man who had lost his testimony while attending college: "If I had a boy like you," he thundered, "I'd send him through the world in illiteracy rather than see him lose his eternal soul."<br><br>My brothers and sisters, if that were the choice, I would clearly make it the same way. But as I understand the gospel, that is not the choice. The choice is not between literacy and the eternal soul. The latter cannot exist without the former. It would be the gravest error, therefore, in the name of things eternal to say that careful, objective, critical, even skeptical intellectual effort is to be avoided because on occasion it can lead to disastrous results. That kind of rational effort is itself divinely ordained as the cornerstone of the plan we all chose when we kept our first estate.<br><br>I come, then, to what I believe is the correct answer to the question: What should we do when our rational processes lead to a conclusion inconsistent with revealed truth?<br><br>As in the case with many important principles, the answer to that question can be fairly simply stated. It is the following: Since the rational process is subject to human error, and revealed truth is not, over the interim period (which could extend beyond the term of this life), until we can confirm through our own intellectual faculties that which has come through a more sure source, we simply recognize that it is a more sure source and that our inability to reach a reconciliation is only another indication of the imperfection of the human intellect.<br><br>I want to caution that the principle is necessarily premised on the existence of a genuine conflict between the products of, on the one hand, rational processes that amount to revealed truth. My experience as a stake president on this campus taught me to be cautious in that respect. It is not uncommon for individuals to obtain what they perceive to be divine confirmation, when in fact, the process, while truly extrarational, involves only an emotional support for an answer that was based on nothing but emotion in the first place.<br><br>There is, of course, no problem in that respect where revealed truth, scriptural truth, is involved. In those instances, the challenge of this life does not include the need to rationalize whether the principles revealed by those processes are or are not true. Do your best, but, if you don't succeed, it's very clear which must prevail.<br><br>Let's start with an easy example. I don't smoke tobacco, and I don't drink alcohol. The question whether I would smoke or drink, even in moderation, or on isolated occasions, for the achievement of social or business objectives, or even when no one was watching, is simply not an open question. The answer to that question was definitively provided for me by God himself in a revelation given to Joseph Smith on 27 February 1833. Even if I should conclude, through the utilization of my reasoning powers, that I would be a happier person if I smoked, and that the delightful smell on my clothes, and the aura of distinction and dignity that surrounds smokers is more important than ten or fifteen years added on to my life, I still would not smoke. Similarly, I don't need to concern myself with whether eight years is the best age for baptism or whether there really ought to be seventeen apostles.<br><br>These, of course, are easy examples. And indeed, I will tell you that, for the person who has a testimony of the gospel of Jesus Christ, virtually all of the examples that you can hypothesize will be easy. For people who are convinced of the reality of the Restoration, conflicts between revealed truth and reasoned conclusions are so rare as to be virtually nonexistent. Most of you will probably go through an entire lifetime of thought and study without ever being bothered by such a conflict; if that is your happy lot, rejoice. You should conclude only that your rational processes are functioning properly because they are coming up with the right answers. But I am also telling you that it is no adverse reflection on you, on your mind, or on your soul or your values if on some occasion you are unable rationally to explain a principle of revealed truth. The seeming inconsistency is attributable only to the fallible nature of our rational capacity. It tells us nothing more than that there are some facts, some truths, some realities which our mortal minds are simply unable to comprehend.<br><br>Fortunately, the fact that some truths are beyond mortal comprehension is something that our minds can comprehend. This fact was impressed upon me early in life. As a young boy growing up on a sawmill, I would gaze out into the clear, starry night, puzzling over what was really out there. My Sunday School teacher told me that space is without end. My brain was unable then, and is unable still, to comprehend that the alternative is totally unacceptable. If there is some point out there where it all comes to an end, then the question is, What's on the other side? These questions concerning space and their equally perplexing counterpart relating to time (I can handle time having no end; I cannot handle time having no beginning), supply the most cogent examples of which I am aware demonstrating the limitations of the rational process.<br><br>Happily for us, our minds are good enough to recognize their own shortcomings. That ought to alert us that, in those rare instances where, if it ever occurs, our minds lead us to a conclusion inconsistent with truth that comes from a source not subject to those same shortcomings, there is no doubt which should prevail. That this may be our happy lot is my prayer in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Rex E.

<h1>itual Heritage - Loren C. Dunn - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I prepared a talk for you which I discarded this morning. You'll have to judge later as to whether I did the right thing. A comment that was made to me by a student here a few weeks ago caused me to reflect and think about something that perhaps I could talk about, and so I'll try to go in that direction and hope for the Spirit of the Lord to guide and inspire me so that I might say the right thing.<br><h2><b>Reflections on My Own Life</b></h2><br>I'd like to reflect a little about my own life. I was born and raised in Tooele. There are a few other General Authorities who have some relationship to Tooele. J. Reuben Clark was born and raised in Grantsville, which is about seven miles from Tooele. We really don't claim each other, but it's close enough so that the competition is strong. LeGrand Richards spent a number of his early years in Tooele. His father, as I recall, was a counselor in the stake presidency there before he was called into the Quorum of the Twelve. I like to talk to LeGrand Richards because he knew my grandfather and my grandmother, and I never had the opportunity of being acquainted with either of them. He recalls for me from time to time some experiences of my own heritage.<br><br>I would like to spend a few minutes talking about my own upbringing and some of the experiences I had in my hometown of Tooele. Some people say, and I think erroneously, that the blessings of the gospel and the inspiration and direction of the Spirit as they existed at the time of the restoration of the gospel are not among us today as much as they were at an earlier time. It has been my experience that, as the Church grows bigger, the blessings of the gospel and spiritual experiences are as available to us now as they ever were.<br><h2><b>My Father and His Mother's Experience</b></h2><br>My father was called as stake president when I was fairly young. In those days they were not called as stake president for only a few years. He served for twenty years as president of the Tooele Stake. He was called when I was six and released when I was twenty-six. He had some great experiences associated with that service. I think it was Joseph F. Merrill who called him. Brother Merrill was a member of the Quorum of Twelve. He told of going down the list of priesthood leaders in the stake and coming to the name of my father and feeling, as it were, an electric shock. This was before he had met him. Later, in telling this experience, he said he also heard a voice that indicated to him that this was the person who should be called as president of the Tooele Stake. He extended the call to him, and my father became the president of the Tooele Stake.<br><br>The whole story becomes, to our family anyway, a little more significant when we reflect on the fact that, before my father was born, his mother passed away. She told in her diary and to her children of passing through the veil and being met by her loved ones and family and having them tell her that it was not time for her to come there yet. They said she needed to bring another child into the world, a child who would play a significant role in the building of the kingdom. In this way she would fill the measure of her probation. She tells some interesting things associated with this experience. She was given the opportunity, of course, to come back. She was told that, if she did come back, she would not be without pain. She told of how peaceful it was to cross beyond the veil, how pleasant and peaceful an experience it was. On the other hand, she said that it was painful to come back. I've often reflected upon that. You know, sometimes we're prone, because of our love and anxiety for people, to anguish over them and maybe try to intercede on their behalf as they hover between life and death. How wise it is for us to allow the Lord to accomplish for a person what He will accomplish rather than ask that our loved one may be kept on or held in mortality. I know in some cases we keep them on in pain rather than allowing them to go in peace.<br><br>She also said that there were people a short distance from her who couldn't come to her, and she couldn't go to them. She recognized them from her native Scotland. They called to her when they knew that she was going to return from beyond the veil. "When you go back, please, please have someone do our work for us," they said. "Have someone do our temple work for us." Sometimes I think we look upon the programs of the church as duties that just keep us busy. We don't always realize that they are indeed a part of eternity, that specific things bring blessings to specific people, and that it is important for us to be involved in the work of the gospel. Very important.<br><br>Well, she came back, and my father came into the world (an event for which I am grateful), and my father fulfilled his destiny, to a large extent, when a member of the Twelve who did not know him received the specific prompting to call him as a stake president. I learn from that experience that, although we look on the face of things and we look on the faces of people, we don't always understand that a calling in this Church, no matter to whom or where it comes or where the person is to serve, is fundamentally and basically a divine matter. "We believe a man must be called of God, by prophecy" (Articles of Faith 1:5). We believe that this is the gospel of Jesus Christ and that the Savior directs His own Church. The reality of the divine nature of a person's call is very significant to me because of some of these experiences.<br><h2><b>Robbie Shields Was Faithful</b></h2><br>Let me tell you another experience about a friend of mine. His name was Robbie Shields. He'll never go down in the annals of history as one of the great men of the world--only a few people knew him in the Church. The thing that Robbie Shields had going for him was that the Lord loved him. Robbie Shields lived next door to me in his later life. As my brother and I were growing up, first he was my brother's senior home-teaching companion, and then he was mine, always faithful, always there, always with a word of prayer before we went out, always taking care of the duties of a home teacher with faithfulness and loyalty, always helping us to do our job as Aaronic Priesthood bearers and home teachers.<br><br>I can remember sitting in the Tooele First Ward on many occasions on fast Sunday and listening to Robbie, who would always sit on the north side halfway back, tell of the experience of how the Lord spoke to him. In his younger days he was teaching a Sunday School class, and they were looking for an answer to one of their questions. He prayed and searched and read and prayed and searched and read.<br><br>One day he was out hauling hay in Pine Canyon. He was by himself forking the hay onto the wagon when a voice spoke to him calling him by name.<br><br>He said to the voice, "Who are you?" and the voice said, "I am the Lord."<br><br>Robbie Shields said, "Why can't I see you?"<br><br>The voice said, "Because you don't have to." That was absolutely true for Brother Shields. Robbie Shields had the faith and testimony to keep him true whether he heard the Lord's voice or not. The Lord gave him the answer to the question he had as a Sunday School teacher. I heard, as many of us did, Brother Shields giving that testimony many times.<br><br>It taught me a number of lessons in my young life. One is that the Lord does speak to us. Sometimes He speaks to us the way that He spoke to Robbie Shields. More often than not He speaks to us the way He spoke to Enos, that is, He speaks to our mind and to our heart, but He does speak to us. It taught me another lesson in my young life, and that is that He doesn't usually speak to us in the classroom. I know He can speak to us anyplace. He wishes, but usually He doesn't speak to us in the classroom. He doesn't always immediately speak to us when we contemplate and study and look at a question. Maybe that's part of the preparation. I think of the Prophet Joseph Smith, who read that passage in James, chapter 1, verse 5. Yet the Restoration didn't start then. The Restoration began when Joseph was in the grove, when he was on his knees, and when the Father and the Son appeared to him.<br><br>The Lord didn't speak to Robbie Shields in the classroom. He spoke to him as he was out in the world performing his every day duties, carrying on his individual activities, doing that which was expected of him, earning his living, keeping the commandments. I have come to know that, if the Lord is going to speak to us, that is quite often how it happens.<br><h2><b>"If Any Man Will Do His Will ..."</b></h2><br>The Sanhedrin took great delight in counseling together and rejecting the simple and plain principles and teachings of the gospel of Jesus Christ. They sat together and theorized; they discussed one with another how wrong the teachings of the Savior were. Although their own scriptures predicted that He would come, they rejected Him because they stood with their traditions rather than with the word of God. This is the reason the Savior finally said to them and to His followers, on two occasions, "If any man will do his will" (John 7:17), if any man will do this, if any man will actually go out and apply these principles, he will know whether I speak of myself or whether this comes from God. On another occasion he said, "By their fruits you shall know them" (Matthew 7:20). He said, "You don't gather figs from thorns" (see Matthew 7:16). If any man will do the will of my Father, he will know. And then he went on to talk about the person who built his foundation on the firm, hard ground as compared to the person who built his house on the sand. When the winds of adversity and change came, they blew the house of sand away while the person who built upon the foundation of rock stood steady. The person who builds his faith by the process of living the commandments and building his testimony is on firm ground. The person who finds himself out in the field doing his duty is usually better off than the person who stands and theorizes and debates what is right and what is wrong.<br><br>And so it is with us. The lesson I learned from Robbie Shields was that the Lord usually speaks to us out in the field when we're about our business and when we're about our Father's business. Not a whole lot of revelation comes until we've applied the things that we've been taught in our lives.<br><h2><b>Bishops Anderson and Barrus</b></h2><br>I'd like to tell you another story about my growing up in Tooele. Bevan Anderson at the time was bishop of the Tooele Fifth Ward. Brother Anderson is a stalwart in the town, a faithful soul. When my father was stake president, he called Brother Anderson as a young bishop. Shortly after he was called, my father had the overwhelming feeling that he should release him. He couldn't understand this because you don't call bishops and then suddenly release them. But he had this terrible feeling that Bishop Anderson should be released, even though he was worthy, strong, and faithful, and as good a bishop as you'll find anyplace. But still there came the feeling that he should be released. My father fought this feeling; he didn't want to release him. As time went on, finally, Bevan Anderson came to him and said, "For some reason, I feel I should be released." And he was then released as bishop.<br><br>Called to take his place was O. T. Barrus. You've got to understand a little about Bishop Barrus's background. Going way back, he had a heritage of faithfulness in the Church. But, in recent years Brother Barrus had not been as active in the Church as he should have been. He was a good man, but the world had gotten in the way a little bit, and he wasn't active. The Barruses had a son by the name of Dean Barrus. Dean was one of those persons who was all-everything. In everything he did, he was outstanding. He wasn't cocky or proud. He was a humble, nice person that everybody loved. He played basketball well, he played football well, he was governor at Boys' State. In everything he touched, he was a leader. He was one of those special souls the Lord sends from heaven every once in a while.<br><br>About this same time World War II broke out, and young Dean Barrus found himself on Navy duty. As fate would have it, the ship he was on was sunk by a submarine and his life was taken. My father tells of a very sacred and personal experience after the release of Bishop Anderson. He said, "I was given to know that in the heavens young Dean Barrus, because his life was taken so early, was given the opportunity to have fulfilled a desire he had for his family." It was Dean Barrus's desire that his father might be called as bishop, that through this action, he might be drawn into Church activity and through this be put in a position where he could use his talents to serve other people in the kingdom. So it was, without anybody's being able to explain it, Bevan Anderson was released with a good feeling and the realization that is what the Lord wanted, and O. T. Barrus was called as bishop and later as stake president--a strong and faithful member of the Church and a person who did much good before the Lord called him home.<br><br>This sequence of events taught me some very significant lessons about a person's call and about a person's release. It also taught me something as a priesthood leader because there have been occasions in my own leadership duties when I felt that someone probably should be released. You see, a release is as providential as a call so it's no punishment. We serve because we're called, and we're released because we're called. I have on occasion felt the inspiration of the Spirit indicating that someone should be released at a particular time. I have fought it on the basis that I couldn't find any outward justification for it. I've said to myself, "Well, I can't recommend that to the brethren around me because I can't justify it." And then this experience has returned to my mind, and I've come to realize that it is indeed my responsibility to pass it on to those of my brethren who would make the final decision on these matters and who have the broader light or understanding; that if the Lord prompts me to act this way, then I have a responsibility to send it forward. For who knows under what circumstances a person might be released or a person might be called? Who knows the extent of the meaning of a man's release or a man's call?<br><h2><b>Raising Boys, Not Cows</b></h2><br>There is a little farm on the edge of Tooele where my father was born. My Aunt Jessie still lives there. She's in her nineties now, and she has so many grandchildren and great grandchildren that none of us can count them, but she knows them all. She's a remarkable person. It was on this farm, when we were teenagers, that my father decided my brother and I needed to learn how to work. He was running the newspaper in town and being president of a stake that covered a hundred square miles. He was pretty busy, but he had my brother and me working on that farm. We were in the 4-H program, and a bunch of the fathers of the boys in the 4-H program bought some purebred, registered Guernseys from the Northwest and brought them down, and we all got a cow. I should say my brother got a cow, and, since I was his little brother, it was mine by association. I don't know how many of you have had experience with cows, but our cow had heifer after heifer after heifer, and, when you get a heifer, you end up with another cow; and, when you end up with another cow, that's one more cow to milk. It was not very long until we were sort of in the business. We had a number of cows that we were milking, and it was quite an experience. We built a little reservoir on the farm so that we wouldn't have to get up at three o'clock in the morning to take the water. We could run the water in the reservoir and use it as we needed it.<br><br>We had some great experiences on the farm, my teenage brother and I, unsupervised. I think he was more steady than I was. We had some fruit trees and a lot of lucern, a lot of hay. We grew some corn; we grew a little wheat. We had a number of things on that farm. We weren't the best farmers in the world. We were doing the best we could, but we were not the best farmers. We were surrounded by other farms, and those farms were being farmed by people who knew what they were doing. One day one of the neighbors came to my father. He was a farmer, and he had a whole list of the things that my brother and I were doing wrong. I think I could have added more things to that list than he had. Anyway, he went down the list as he was talking to my father, and my father sat back and then he said, "Jim, you don't understand. You see, I'm raising boys, not cows." And Jim, a few years later after my father passed away, shared that experience with me. In looking back I was grateful for the fact that indeed my father decided that he was going to raise boys and now cows, and he did. That's become a very important lesson to me as a father. You know, when you raise boys and girls instead of cows, it doesn't make a whole lot of difference how much time you spend. I guess in one respect you can never spend enough time with your children. In another respect, if you don't have all the time in the world, it's where your priorities are that counts. It's whether your children know that they're first in your life, no matter what you're doing. The lesson of raising boys and girls instead of cows, for which I was personally grateful, has never left me. As a father and as a husband, it has helped me.<br><h2><b>The Carpenter Who Changed His Way</b></h2><br>I'd like to tell you another experience about a carpenter my father used to hire. He was a very fine man, a very sharp and astute individual. He collected quotations. I still have two or three of the books that he pulled together on the sayings of the Brethren on different subjects. He was a tremendous gospel scholar. This man not only served a good mission, but he had gained to a tremendous extent and ability in gospel scholarship. He knew the scriptures; he knew the gospel. He would go to Sunday School class and priesthood class, and he would disrupt everything because he was constantly correcting the teachers on the little issues or bringing up gospel dimensions of which the teachers were not aware. When he would get in a sort of cross fire with the teachers, he would usually win; he was usually right. It was not only frustrating to the teachers; it was disruptive to the class.<br><br>This friend of ours changed his way one day. He shared with us what happened to him. He said, "I suppose you could say that I had a revelation. For one thing, I heard heavenly choirs. Never in my entire life had I heard music like that. Oh, how I want to be there! It was a beautiful experience." Then he said, "Someone talked to me and scolded me. I was told that I must not disrupt the Sunday School and priesthood classes. 'You must not do it because you bring contention and that brings the spirit of the devil. You must not do it.'" So he became cooperative and helpful in his classes from that time forward. The lesson I learned from that is that a man who uses his knowledge of the gospel of Jesus Christ to contend, to demonstrate that he knows a bit more than someone else, a man who feeds controversy by virtue of his background or his understanding of an issue, is a man who will introduce the spirit of the adversary into a gathering where the Spirit of the Lord is expected to be. It not only damages him, but it damages the faith and the testimony of the people around him long, long after the issues are forgotten. I have a feeling that long after the issues and differences of opinion have been forgotten, we will be judged by how well we upheld the priesthood and how faithful we were at bringing harmony and the Spirit of the Lord into the meetings and classes that involved us: controversy in the Church setting invites the adversary and this always diminishes the spirit of light and truth.<br><br>Over the years I've remembered the experience of the carpenter, and I've seen that upholding the priesthood is greater, far greater, in working out our own individual salvation than any point of controversy or doctrine that we could make that causes contention and brings feelings of contrariness. Those kinds of things cause the influence of the adversary to affect a person's heart, and they are not according to the will and inspiration of the Lord. It's better that we keep the spirit of controversy out of our discussions, out of our teaching, than to feel that we are enlightening people when in reality all we're doing is destroying the faith and testimony of those who may not be as well founded as we are. In the final analysis our ability to be a peacemaker and be loyal to the priesthood might be the basic issues upon which we earn our salvation. It might be that they are far more important than the little nitty-gritty issues and tenets that come and go and will eventually be forgotten.<br><br>I believe that, as teachers and members of the Church, and as children of our Father in Heaven, we need to remember the lesson that my friend the carpenter learned when somebody spoke to him from the heavens and told him not to be so controversial because it introduced a spirit that was from the adversary. While it might not have affected him too much, it affected those who were listening and caused him to be in a position where he was not a builder, where he was not an example of the believer.<br><br>I'd like to finish by reading from 3 Nephi, chapter 22, verse 17. This is a chapter that talks about the last days; it talks about Zion; it talks about stakes. It is comparable to chapter 54 of Isaiah. It says, "No weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper." And I like to think that it is directed not only to the Church, but to the members of the Church who will keep the faith and build their testimonies and live by the commandments the Lord has given them, who will in every sense of the word take upon them the name of Christ. Although that act is entered into at the time of baptism, the reality of it doesn't come until we begin to understand whether our everyday lives are in harmony with what we indeed said we would do and how we would act as far as the gospel of Christ is concerned.<br><br><i>No weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper; and every tongue that shall rise against thee in judgment thou shalt condemn. This is the heritage of the servants of the Lord, and their righteousness is of me, saith the Lord</i>. [Isaiah 54:17; 3 Nephi 22:17]<br><br>Now, I've talked today about my heritage and about the heritage of my community. It's not so different from your heritage because, when we embrace the gospel of Jesus Christ, we have a common heritage. It is a doctrinal heritage; it is a spiritual heritage, and what is shared by one is shared by all. We are all a party to the Father and the Son's appearing to the Prophet Joseph Smith. We are all a party to Brigham Young's standing and supporting and sustaining the Prophet Joseph Smith through some terribly difficult times. We are all a party to the heritage of the gospel, the spiritual heritage of the gospel, the blessings of the gospel, the blessings that are promised to those who believe in the kingdom of God.<br><br>Have they stopped since Joseph Smith and Brigham Young and Wilford Woodruff? I submit to you that they are here today in their fullness, and I say to you that the Lord speaks to you and me. The fact that he speaks is not unusual, but it does little good unless we are listening, unless we reach back into our common heritage, unless we keep the commandments. The promptings of the Holy Spirit need to become a part of our lives so we're willing to accept them and be inspired by them and live by them.<br><br>This is our common heritage. May the Lord bless us that no controversy, no doctrines as taught by the principles of men, no personal disagreement, no unrepented sin will become so big and so powerful that it will take away from us our spiritual heritage. May our spiritual heritage last long after issues are forgotten and men are dead. May the Lord bless us to this end. I bear you my witness that the work is true. I testify to you that I know that God lives. I know He lives; I know that Jesus is the Christ, the Savior of the world, the Author of this work. I know that Joseph Smith saw what he said he saw. I know Spencer W. Kimball is a prophet of God today. This is the gospel of Jesus Christ; this is His holy work; this is His way. May the Lord bless us that we may honor our heritage and stand firm for that which is true, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Loren C.

My wife and I have returned only within hours from Jerusalem--the old Jerusalem which is now rapidly becoming new. Heavy on our hearts, therefore, is what we experienced there, and I would like to share with you tonight in an ambling fashion, if you will permit, some of those impressions.<br><br>A prophecy uttered by the Prophet Joseph Smith in 1842 is in fact being fulfilled before our very eyes: to wit, "Jerusalem must be rebuilt, and the temple, and water come out from under the temple, and the waters of the Dead Sea be healed, . . . and all this must be done before the Son of Man will make His appearance" (<i>Teachings,</i> p. 286).<br><br>On first touching that ground with our feet more than a decade ago, I think I had a prejudice that the setting of the Savior's life really was not significant, that the meaning of his life and his words was what mattered, and that the events in the environment and circumstances of the time were not crucial. After many visits since, for we have both visited and lived there, I am of the contrary opinion: that he cared very much about the setting and that meaning is lodged, still, in the very rocks, in the very mountains, in the very trees of Israel.<br><br>On an earlier trip a woman past 82 traveled with us. She had to prepare at length, exercise, and get constant reassurances from her physician that she could endure the rigors. We were touched that, as we turned our backs on a church that has been built near--and some say over--the ancient site of Gethsemane, she who had come so far and had lived so long was on her knees near the place where tradition says Jesus knelt.<br><h2><b>Significance of Setting</b></h2><br>North of Jerusalem is the Galilee. And I am struck that the location of Caesarea Philippi is at the mount called Hermon. It may be the Mount of Transfiguration. It is, in any case, at the headwaters of the Jordan, which then feeds the Galilee and in turn flows south and is literally the nourishment of all Israel. It was there, and I think he chose the place carefully, that the Savior announced to Peter, after Peter's confession, that he would build his church as on a rock. I think it is significant that there is there still a huge, faced rock. Below it and in it is a cave, and out of that cave, at the time Jesus stood there, flowed water. Not so since--an earthquake changed all that. But was he, therefore, saying to Peter, who he knew by revelation was to be his presiding apostle, and of Peter, who by revelation had recognized him, "Upon this flowing rock I will build my church"? Well, such are the suggestions of the setting. Is it also, one may ask, only happenstance that he chose to be baptized near the waters called dead at the lowest point of the earth--it's 1200 feet below sea level--descending thus even physically below all things?<br><h2><b>Symbolism of Trees</b></h2><br>There are trees in Israel, and we are taught from the record that each in a way was significant in his ministry: palm trees, fig trees, oak trees, but most of all, olive trees. To this day the process of planting, cultivating, pruning, and harvesting from olive trees is a laborious one. The olives are at first bitter and useless. Hard labor and pressure are required to produce ripe, mellow olive oil. That, too, is done today. The recognition that, in the time of the Master, olives and olive oil and the olive mash that resulted from the crushing were the very essence of life comes to mind as one stands there.<br><h3><b><i>The Tree of Life</i></b></h3><br>Indulge me for a few moments further on the background of the every idea of trees. Religious literature is singularly impressed with the notion that somehow there is a tree of life representative of eternal life and love that is somehow planted in a goodly land, some traditions say on the very navel of the earth, the highest point of the earth which symbolically at least is the temple mount in Jerusalem, a tree planted and watered by the waters of life whose fruit is the most precious.<br><br>Our own Book of Mormon says further of that fruit that is sweet, that is pure, even that it is white. Even now, incidentally, in Hebron, in Israel, there are ripe, magnificent vineyards where the grapes are white, almost transparent. These happen to be the sweetest and the purest of the grapes. The imagery that it was so precious impressed Nephi after he was given the blessing of recapitulating the vision of his own father, Lehi. He said, "I behold. . . the tree . . . precious above all." But even that superlative didn't satisfy the angel, narrator of the vision, who said, "Yea, and the most joyous to the soul" (1 Nephi 11:9, 23).<br><br>The tree of life has been utilized through sacred history as the symbol both of Israel and of the Redeemer of Israel. There are traditions that in due time that tree, from which the branches had been ripped off and dispersed, would somehow be planted anew, and there would be graftings and gatherings anew until the tree was again productive.<br><h3><b><i>The Olive Tree</i></b></h3><br>There is more to know about olive culture. It is interesting that the tree is not really a deciduous one. Its leaves never fall off; they are rejuvenated and stay. It is in that sense evergreen, or ever olive. It can be a wild thing without cultivation, but after long and patient culturing, usually eight to ten years, it becomes productive. More than that it continues to be, with age. There are trees today--for new shoots come forth from apparently dead roots--that are known by actual horticultural study to be 1800 years old. There may be trees on the Mount of Olives older than that. One could even say of the olive tree, "It is immortal."<br><br>As for the product of the processes: not just olives to be eaten, not just olive oil used by many today in the Middle East simply as a condiment for salads or as a cooking device. Olive oil was the substance of light and heat in Israel. Olive lamps, into which one poured the pure oil and then lighted it at one end, provided, even in a darkened room, light, enough light. Moreover, the mash, as I have spoken of it, provided fuel and burned long. Not only all this, but the balming influence, the soothing, salving influence of oil, was well known in their midst. The traditions about the olive branch and of the pouring of oil, was well known in Jesus' own day. We speak today of the olive leaf as a symbol of peace and of forgiveness (see D&amp;amp;C 88). Paul referred to it as the oil of gladness, and it is in that sense also symbolic of joy.<br><br>Did Jesus know all this? Surely he did. Was there something then significant in his choice of the mount known as the Mount of Olives? And was it true then, as now, that Mount Olivet was symbolic and sacred, all of it?<br><h2><b>Four Holinesses</b></h2><br>On that mount four holinesses came together. First, the place. It was eastward from the temple, the temple which by now had been desecrated, the temple which he first called on a day of cleansing, "my Father's house," but which later he spoke of as "my house." In that house was a Holy of Holies with two olivewood pillars that stood there as entrances. They were, in turn, connected to the menorah, the perpetual lamp, and from them came two kinds of corridors, or tubes, into which were poured olive oil; then the tree burned.<br><br>A Jewish tradition says that, when Adam was about to die, he sent Eve and his son Seth back to the garden for healing oil. At the threshold they were met by an angel who said, "there will be no oil again until the meridian of time when the Messiah comes, and then the oil will be from the olive tree."<br><br>Moses was commanded to teach the children of Israel "that they bring thee pure oil olive beaten for the light, to cause the lamp to burn always" (Exodus 27:20). Such oil was burning in the time of Jesus, but it had lost its sacred significance, or had not yet received its full consecration.<br><h3><b><i>The Place and Time</i></b></h3><br>He went on the mount overlooking the temple mount, as, says the scripture, "he was wont." Luke says in the last days of his life he lodged there, he "abode there," day and night. On that hill was a garden-orchard. More properly the word is<i>vineyard</i>. A vineyard of olive trees? Yes, precisely that same word is used in the parable or allegory in the book of Jacob, of the tame and wild olive tree. The lord of the vineyard, Dr. Sidney B. Sperry believed, was the Father of us all. The servant in the vineyard was the Messiah. The task, the weightiest in all history.<br><br>It is called Gethsemane.<i>Geth</i>or<i>gat</i>means<i>press</i>, and<i>shemen</i>in Hebrew means<i>oil</i>. The place of the olive press. You can see presses still in Israel, for, after the processes of salt and vinegar and pressure, the olives are gathered, placed in a bag, and then with a huge crushing rock--to push it usually requires an animal--crushed until the oil flows. "The place of the olive press."<br><br>The time was holy. It was the hour, the week, of Pessach, Passover. We've been privileged to attend that sacrosanct celebration, Passover. Since the destruction of the temple it has been modified, but at the time of Jesus that was the day when they brought the lamb, the faultless lamb, down that very mount--to the altar, or if Passover was celebrated in some homes, to the home, and it was roasted and the blood sprinkled on the altar or, in the homes, on the doorposts. That was the season, the time.<br><h3><b><i>The Person and the Name</i></b></h3><br>Another holiness was the person. It was ha Yeshua Massiach, Jesus the Messiah, a stem, so Isaiah prophesied, of Jesse from the stump or the root of the house of David--he who had been the Revealer to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, he who had not only approached, but sat upon Jacob's well, so the tradition says, and to a despised woman for the first time announced, "I am he." I am he from whom shall flow living waters. It was he who had been prophesied. The word<i>messiah,</i> as it appears today in the King James Version of Daniel, has roots meaning the "anointed one," with connotations of coronation and ordination. Now came the night when he would become the anoint<i>ing</i>one.<br><br>The word<i>messias,</i> as it is used by John in the Gospel of John, has another root,<i>tsahar,</i> meaning to glow with light as one glistens when one is anointed. To earn the name, the holiness of the name, he had to tread the press. The image of the press permeates Isaiah, as it does modern revelation (see Isaiah 63:3; D&amp;amp;C 76:107, 88:106). One day he will say, "I have trodden the press" (in this case the wine press, but the two merge) "I have trodden the wine press alone; I have trodden the wine press of the fierceness of the wrath of Almighty God."<br><h2><b>Gethsemane</b></h2><br>Now that we have spoken of the holy place, the holy time, the holy person, and the holy name, a glimpse of what must have gone through him and of what he must have gone through. "Mine hour," he had said often, "has not yet come," but now it had. After the Last Supper one episode ended, "And it was night." That's an explanation--I think we need no other--for why the three, even though he pled, couldn't stay awake. Somewhere, somewhere on that mountain, he knelt.<br><br>We have witnessed the effort of pious Jews as they stand--they do not kneel--at the place that is but a remnant of the wall below the ancient walls of the temple mount. Rhythmically, they throw their whole bodies into their prayer. They respond to ridicule: "We are fighting distraction. We want to concentrate. Movement helps." The motions of that night, I suggest to you, were both internal and external. Somehow the bitterness, as bitter as gall, of iniquity entered him. It was the comprehension of the spiritual death, not just of the family of our Father who dwell upon this earth, but, we have been taught by the Prophet Joseph Smith, of other earths also. (So the atonement of Jesus Christ is, as Brother Maxwell has testified, intergalactic.) That burden, that bitterness, he vicariously took within him.<br><br>"How?" we cry out, but a child can understand. Pain, even the presence of it to those of us who merely stand detached and observe, hurts. He who did not and will not take a backward step from the will of the Father, supersensitive, could and did feel for and with us. The pressure worked upon him. Somewhere on the road between the north and south, he cried out anticipating, "Father, save me from this hour." We don't know how long the interim between that sentence and prayer and the next, but then he cried out, "But for this cause came I unto this hour. Father, glorify thy name." And the voice said, "I have both glorified it, and will glorify it again" (John 12:27–28).<br><br>Luke, perhaps a physician, is the one who says that great drops of blood came from his pores. The bitterness oozed. It is not a spectacle one wishes to recall, but we have been commanded, and weekly we memorialize it in an ordinance called the sacrament. All his preparation and all that he could summon from his own strength was not sufficient. "More earnestly," says the record, he cried out. An angel came, strengthening him--strengthening but not delivering. What is it like to have the power, to have been promised the power, to summon legions of angels, to end the ordeal--and not to summon them?<br><br>He was, during that same night, betrayed. He was, after it, taken prisoner. He was broken into, pierced, by scourging. And the merciful reading of Pilate's motives in permitting that is that he hoped it would suffice for those who were crying out against him. It did not. The weight, I submit to you, had begun there on the mount, much greater a weight than the weight of the cross that he was then to bear.<br><br>Sitting on the stand tonight is your Regional Representative, Dr. Russell M. Nelson, who once permitted me to put my ear down to a man who had just undergone surgery and who was now suffering radical internal bleeding. He wanted me to hear what he whispered. What he whispered was, "I am thirsty." "I thirst," Jesus said, and in response--was it an act of appeasement or one of mockery?--a sponge of vinegar was put to his lips. According to the Joseph Smith Translation, his last words were not just, 'it is finished," but "My father's will is done" (see JST Matthew 27:54).<br><h2><b>Conclusions</b></h2><br>Now, brothers and sisters, what conclusions from all this? Let me say first that I pray that hereafter, when you speak or hear the words, "I anoint you with this consecrated oil," you will remember what the consecration cost.<br><br>I pray that, as you sit (but in our spirits as we kneel) at the sacrament table, and you are asked to remember his body and blood, you will recall that he is the veritable tree and olive beaten for the light, and that there flows from him unto this whole earth, and beyond, the redemptive power of healing and soothing and ministering to the needy.<br><br>I pray that in hours of gladness, should your cup run o'er, you will remember that, to make that possible, a cup, the bitterest of cups, was drunk.<br><br>I pray that when your life, the life of attempted faithfulness, is bludgeoned and becomes wearing and wearying, you will remember that no great and good fruit comes easily, that you are the olive plants who were supposedly planted anew in him, and that only time and suffering and endurance can produce the peaceable and perfect fruit which he yearns for you to have.<br><br>And finally I pray that, as we seek to be what he said he was, the light of the world, we will endure the days of affliction and be prepared for the day of joyous reunion. All the prophets have promised that both are ahead. One day he will honor the Mount of Olives again. This time he will descend in triumph. When his foot touches it, the mount itself shall separate, be shaken, and an earthquake will follow. The earth will be purged and cleansed and will eventually shine with celestial light. We are promised we may share in those culminations to descend with him or to ascend to meet him. And either of those is glorious.<br><br>Over and over, he spoke of himself as the Bridegroom preparing his own for a feast, the feast we have been promised in our own Doctrine and Covenants, when all worthies who have been made worthy will gather. In the beginning of this dispensation, the Master counseled, "Wherefore, be faithful, praying always, having your lamps trimmed" (that means full) "and burning" (that means alight and afire) "and oil with you, that you may be ready at the coming of the Bridegroom" (D&amp;amp;C 33:17)--and still later "that you may abide the day" (D&amp;amp;C 61:39).<br><br>Brothers and sisters, my testimony: I bear witness that Jesus is the Messiah and that he could not have known, according to the flesh, how to succor his people according to their infirmities unless in Gethsemane he had gone through what he went through (Alma 7). I bear testimony that his compassion for us, what one of the prophets calls "the bowels of mercy," reaches out to the Father, who grieves that any tree in his vineyard should be lost. And that the Master pleads even now for more time for you and for me, until we, too, have been purged and can sing the song of redeeming love. I bear my testimony that he lives, that he came to bring life, and life more abundantly, and that he is our Redeemer. In the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Truman G.

I have spent a lot of pleasant moments in this same auditorium that we're in today as I was here as a student. I also spent some times when I was awake. I remember sitting down on about the sixth row right here fifteen years ago, and I was holding hands with my wife before she was my wife. We left in the middle of that concert and went over to the Wilkinson Center and got engaged. It was very romantic. It was probably the smartest thing I ever did actually, but it wasn't easy. Margaret was a very popular young lady on campus. I'll tell you how popular she was. I saw her at a dance my first week on campus, and I found out where she lived and went to her apartment to introduce myself. As I was walking up to the door, I noticed that there was this little ticket machine kind of like the ones you see at Baskin-Robbins, you know. So I took a ticket--apparently the landlord had placed it there to cut down on the confusion--and was about to knock on the door when another fellow came out, a nice-looking guy. I said, "Say, what number are you?" He said, "I'm number nine." I looked at my ticket and it said 340. So, it took me two and one half years from that time to get my date, but I did it, and I love her very much. She is the mother of our children and my sweetheart and my companion.<br><br>President Ballif mentioned that my undergraduate studies here at BYU were in chemistry, and I ended up with a Ph.D. in business. I did have the blessing of the Chemistry Department to make that switch. I'll tell you why. As a senior I needed one credit to graduate, and so I asked Professor Hawkins, who was my organic professor, if I could do a special project for him, and he said yes. I worked in the lab that was in his private office. He had a hood there, and I set up my experiment, and it went along week after week. One day, as we heated it up to as high a temperature as it ought to go to make it work, he was seated at his desk grading papers, and I was working at the lab behind him. I heard a little rumbling sound in there, and I said, "You know, Professor Hawkins, I think we might have a problem here." The next minute the whole thing blew up--just a tremendous explosion that shook the walls, and people came running down the hall and stuck their heads in to see what was going on. It nearly blew Professor Hawkins right out of his chair. Whereupon, after we cleaned up the mess, he put his arm around my shoulder and said, "About going into business administration, I think it's a wonderful idea." Now, that's true; it really happened.<br><br>One of the great blessings of my life has been the opportunity to work with young people in the Church, both as a director of the MBA program and, perhaps even more importantly, as a bishop. I appreciate the opportunity to address a religious theme today. I'd like to talk to you about a principle that I have observed in the last few years as I have read the scriptures.<br><h2><b>Scriptural Accounts of Leprosy</b></h2><br>I can remember being interested in the many accounts in both the Old and New Testaments that describe the plight of those with the disease of leprosy. Among those accounts there are two that stand out in my mind. The first is found in the Old Testament in 2 Kings and is about Naaman, the captain of the Syrian army who was himself a leper. I'm sure you are familiar with the story. Naaman's wife had an Israelite handmaiden who suggested that, if Naaman were to go see the prophet in Israel, he could be cured of his leprosy. So the king of Syria sent a letter to the king of Israel, saying, and I quote from 2 Kings 5:6–7,<br><br><i>I have therewith sent Naaman my servant to thee, that thou mayest recover him of his leprosy.</i><br><br><i>And it came to pass, when the king of Israel had read the letter, that he rent his clothes, and said, Am I God, to kill and to make alive, that his man doth send unto me to recover a man of his leprosy? Wherefore consider, I pray you, and see how he seeketh a quarrel against me.</i><br><br>As you can see, the king of Israel thought that this was just a sneaky way to start a fight. But Elisha the prophet heard about the letter and sent to the king saying,<br><br><i>Let him</i>[Naaman]<i>come now to me, and he shall know that there is a prophet in Israel.</i><br><br><i>So Naaman came with his horses and with his chariot, and stood at the door of the house of Elisha.</i>[2 Kings 5:8–9]<br><br>You remember, at this point Elisha didn't even bother to come to the door but sent a messenger to Naaman telling him to go wash seven times in the River Jordan. Naaman replied much the way some of us do when counseled by the prophet (and I'm paraphrasing), "You mean I came all the way from Syria, and I don't even get to see the main man! And you send out a servant who tells me to wash seven times in an irrigation canal" (apparently their Jordan River looked a lot like our Jordan River).<br><br>Well, Naaman listened to some wise friends, as we often do, and was humbled by the sweet Spirit of the Lord. The scriptures tell us,<br><br><i>Then went he down, and dipped himself seven times in Jordan, according to the saying of the man of God: and his flesh came again like unto the flesh of a little child, and he was clean.</i>[2 Kings 5:14]<br><br>If you want to know, as Paul Harvey would say, "the rest of the story," you may wish to read the remainder of chapter 5 of 2 Kings to find out what happened to the servant of Elisha.<br><br>The second account is found in the New Testament and should be equally familiar to you. Let me quote briefly from Luke 17, beginning with verse 12:<br><br><i>And as he entered into a certain village, there met him ten men that were lepers, which stood afar off:</i><br><br><i>And they lifted up their voices, and said, Jesus, Master, have mercy on us.</i><br><br><i>And when he saw them, he said unto them, Go shew yourselves unto the priests. And it came to pass, that, as they went, they were cleansed.</i><br><br><i>And one of them, when he saw that he was healed, turned back, and with a loud voice glorified God,</i><br><br><i>And fell down on his face at his feet, giving him thanks: and he was a Samaritan.</i><br><br><i>And Jesus answering said, Were there not ten cleansed? But where are the nine?</i><br><br><i>There are not found that returned to give glory to God, save this stranger.</i><br><br><i>And he said unto him, Arise, go thy way: thy faith hath made thee whole.</i>[Luke 17:12–19]<br><br>There are many interesting aspects to these two accounts concerning leprosy, but I would like to focus for a moment on the disease itself. One feature of leprosy that comes through clearly in the scriptures is its lack of subtlety. If you had it, everyone knew it. In fact, there was no need to ask about the condition of a hapless victim. The victim himself was required to announce in a loud voice to everyone, "Unclean, unclean."<br><br>The second feature, and to me the more interesting, relates to a specific medical aspect of the disease: Leprosy causes a progressive loss of feeling in the affected parts of the body. At some point the disease so seriously affects the nerves that there is no longer any feeling in, say, a hand or a foot. Our immediate reaction might be that no feeling means no pain and perhaps less suffering for the victim. But this is not the case. Pain plays a very beneficial role in our welfare. It tells us in a loud voice (both figuratively and literally) when we place our hand on a hot stove. We know immediately if the hunting knife comes in contact with a leg or a foot. But we are warned only if the nerves are sending signals. We are warned if the signals have not been blocked by a disease like leprosy.<br><br>In fact, this loss of feeling is a very serious problem for someone with leprosy. The person may, for example, place a hand on a hot stove and not know it until the hand is burned so severely that it cannot be healed.<br><h2><b>Spiritual Leprosy</b></h2><br>Today we rarely see an actual case of leprosy. Indeed, most of us have never seen or heard of anyone having it. But there is a similar disease, a counterpart, an analogue to leprosy that is very much with us. I speak of a condition I would like to refer to as<i>spiritual</i>leprosy.<br><br>The distinctive feature of spiritual leprosy, like its physical counterpart, is a<i>progressive loss of feeling</i>. It is a progressive loss of feeling that takes place not in our nerves but in our sensitivity to the Spirit and to its promptings. This progressive loss of contact with the Holy Ghost makes spiritual leprosy as threatening to our souls as the physical disease is to our bodies.<br><br>But how do we get it? What causes the onset of the disease? Spiritual leprosy, like any disease, results from the combination of an environment and a response. We create the environment anytime we do something that offends the Spirit of the Lord. We have all been in such a position. It may be unkind words we have spoken to a roommate or a spouse; it may be the R-rated movie just seen, the seedy magazine or book read, an act of dishonesty, or maybe our conduct on a date. In any case what we have done is wrong, and we know it, often because we "feel bad." It's interesting, isn't it, that we use exactly the same words to describe a spiritual condition that we might use to describe a physical condition?<br><br>When we say we "feel bad" about something we have done, I suppose we are experiencing a kind of spiritual pain. Now, a very critical point in the whole issue is how we respond to the spiritual pain. As I have thought about it, there seem to be as many different kinds of responses to spiritual pain as there are to physical pain. Sometimes we just try to ignore it and hope it will go away. Or we may simply try to relieve the symptoms without getting at the root cause. For example, for physical pain we take a pain killer such as aspirin, which typically doesn't solve our problem, but at least it doesn't hurt for awhile.<br><br>My wife teases me by saying that, anytime I feel sick, my response is that I need exercise like basketball. Several weeks ago my brother-in-law, who is a medical doctor, was sick so I called him to see how he was feeling. I told him that I had had the same thing the week before, and I knew just what to do for it. There I was telling a medical doctor what to do. He said, "Oh, good, tell me what to do." You see, I had him right there. I'd been waiting for ten years to have him ask me what to do for something. I told him to take two gym shoes, play thirty minutes of basketball, and call me in the morning.<br><br>Unfortunately, we sometimes respond with similar physical approaches to cure the symptoms of spiritual pain. We get drunk on alcohol or high on drugs; we try to escape, to run away. The pain may be so intense we contemplate suicide.<br><br>Of course, the persistence of spiritual pain is a sure sign that there is something wrong. The reasonable response to persistent physical pain is to seek medical attention from a doctor. But what is the reasonable response for spiritual pain? As students of the gospel, we know it is to recognize our mistake and with humility and sincerity to seek forgiveness. The unmistakable invitation of our Lord is found in Matthew 11:28–30, where he said:<br><br><i>Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.</i><br><br><i>Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls.</i><br><br><i>For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.</i><br><br>If our immediate response were to go to our Heavenly Father and ask forgiveness, our spirits would be whole and in tune and free from disease. But, my young brothers and sisters, when we know we've done wrong and we delay or we fail altogether to seek forgiveness, at that point some of our spiritual nerves quit working. When that happens, we have contracted spiritual leprosy. The more we offend the Spirit and the longer we offend the Spirit, the worse the disease gets. The spiritual pain that is a signal to us to change our behavior is more and more blocked out until our spirits can be accosted by the red hot fire of serious sin, and we cannot know when to draw back our hand!<br><h2><b>A Major Handicap</b></h2><br>This is a serious problem for persons of any age. We all need to be able to receive inspiration. There are serious spiritual challenges that must be met at every stage in life. But there are two reasons why this deadening of the spiritual senses is a major handicap to young people of your age. The first reason is that this is the time in your life when many important decisions must be made. Let me remind you specifically of two. First, you must choose a career. A decision that will affect 40 percent of your waking hours for the next forty years is not one to be taken lightly. I don't mean to increase the anxiety you may already feel at the prospect of sorting out the answer to the problem. The point is that this is no time to be without inspiration and guidance from the Lord.<br><br>Besides choosing a career, you must also choose a mate. Some of you are already suffering from analysis paralysis over that issue. You need spiritual insight at this time in your life more than at any other. There are, in addition to these two decisions, many others of importance that you will grapple with in the next several years to come. What does it mean to have integrity? Am I really committed to the Church and the gospel? Do I truly want to honor my parents? Am I willing to serve others, or would I rather be selfish with my time and money?<br><br>As you already know, the list of life's issues is long, and you will not have all your problems solved at age 27, or 37, or 47. That's the second reason that you cannot allow yourself to be afflicted by the deadening of your spiritual nerve endings. Right now, as you struggle with career decisions and marriage decisions and the others I've spoken of, you are developing a pattern of decision making that will affect the way you make decisions for many years to come. You need to practice now how to incorporate the Spirit into your decision-making process. You cannot practice well if you are handicapped by spiritual leprosy any more than you can practice football while you have a broken leg.<br><br>If you would be in a position to be in tune and receive the guidance you desire and need, your spirits must be as healthy as you can possibly make them. But it is not easy to take the steps necessary to heal our spirits. We feel embarrassed by our mistakes. We are ashamed to face our family. We are afraid to talk to our bishop, afraid we'll lose his respect or fearful of the consequences. All these feelings contribute to the continued disability of our spirits and keep us from achieving spiritual health.<br><h2><b>Key Is Courage</b></h2><br>However, unlike our physical bodies, which are sometimes crippled and diseased beyond repair, our spirits can be healed. The key is courage. It takes a lot of courage. We must deal with our spiritual afflictions with the same courage that we observe in those around us who have physical afflictions. Perhaps because the physical afflictions are more readily apparent, we are more alert to the courage displayed by those who do battle with them.<br><br>I will never forget the example of Paul Taylor who had the office next to mine at the University of California at Berkeley. Paul was in his seventies, and I'm convinced he was the model for the comedian Tim Conway's portrayal of the old man who takes tiny, slow steps wherever he goes. Paul walked so slowly that he couldn't get out of the elevator before the door closed on him. It was obviously not easy for him to get around, but he still came to the office every day. I didn't think much of it until I noticed one day that he had a Band-Aid on each eye. One end of each Band-Aid was hooked onto his eyelid, and the other end went up over his eyebrow and was stuck on his forehead. I chuckled at that for a minute until I realized that, without the Band-Aids, Paul's eyelids wouldn't stay open. Paul could have stayed home, and at age 75 he had every right, but that wasn't getting him anywhere. You see, even though he could only take tiny little steps, with the Band-Aids on his eyelids, he could see and move forward and make progress.<br><br>Or what about the young man I saw one day in Berkeley as I was going to the university? I was driving along daydreaming a little about making a slam dunk over the top of Julius Erving and was about to turn right at an intersection. I noticed out of the corner of my eye a young man maybe sixteen or seventeen walking fast and about to cross where I was turning. He wasn't slowing down, and about twenty feet before he got to the intersection, he went like this: "YAAAH!" Did that scare you? It scared me. I about jumped right out of my driver's seat. He went right across the street without breaking stride, and I said to myself, "that kid is a bona fide, card-carrying crazy!" I went on to work and didn't think much of it, but about three or four days later I saw the same boy again. This time he was in the middle of the block, and I slowed down to get a good look at him. You know what I realized? The boy was blind. He also had a big Band-Aid across the middle of his forehead, and I can imagine how it probably got there.<br><br>Can you see the determination this young man had? He walked fast, yelled at cars. He was not about to let a little thing like being blind slow him down in life.<br><br>The courage of Paul Taylor and the determination of the blind boy were obvious as they confronted their physical afflictions. We need that same kind of courage and determination as we grapple with our spiritual afflictions. Fortunately, none of us is ever totally blind spiritually. But maybe we have a few Band-Aids on our foreheads from running into things when our spiritual eyes have been closed. We need to have the courage to put Band-Aids on our spiritual eyelids and begin the process of healing our spirits.<br><br>Let me tell you about David Brenner. David is in a wheelchair and has limited use of his hands as a result of a diving accident suffered many years ago. David signed up for a 400 level financial management course I was teaching during spring term about two years ago. I remember that David, in spite of being in a wheelchair, made it to every lecture, handed in all assignments, and did very well in the class. But there was one small, very quiet incident that left an indelible impression on my mind. For the final exam I required that the students use a blue book for their answers, and I happened to look over at David just as he was attempting to turn a page in his blue book so he could continue writing down the answers. He struggled and struggled and struggled. Finally, after what was easily five agonizing minutes, he managed to turn the page. You and I worry about studying and about the answers. David had to worry about just turning the pages. Do your spirits sometimes struggle just to turn the pages? Some of us are confronted each day with spiritual problems whose solutions others take for granted in much the same way that you or I take for granted our ability to turn pages. Life's really great battles are fought as we labor each day to muster the quiet courage it takes to get our spirits just to "turn the pages."<br><br>You know, I am well into my thirties--in fact, about as well into them as you can get and still be in them--and I have never spent a day in a hospital since I was born. My friend Dee Ann Hoffer will be 22 in a few months. She has spent fourteen years in a hospital--not fourteen days, fourteen years. In other words, 5000 of the roughly 8000 days she's been alive have been spent in the hospital. She has one of those motorized wheelchairs. Hers has only two speeds--fast and move over, General Lee. I've only heard Dee Ann complain once. It was at a ward dance. She asked me to dance one of the fast dances with her. I thought she was teasing, but I walked a little way onto the dance floor with her, whereupon she reared her wheelchair back into a full "wheeley" position and did the neatest little two-step--or should I say "two-wheel"?--that you have ever seen. You want to know what her complaint was? It was that, for a guy with two good feet, I didn't dance too well!<br><br>I think Dee Ann would admit that her body is pretty much a wreck, but her spirit is whole and healthy and alive. She talks to her Heavenly Father, and he listens, and she has the courage to get up each day and continue that fight. Perhaps you've made a mistake that makes you feel that your spirit has spent 5000 days in the hospital. It takes courage to fix that kind of wreck, but if Dee Ann can do it physically, you can do it spiritually.<br><br>Just one more example, and then I'll conclude. I was serving as bishop of the BYU 36th Ward several years ago about this time as spring term was beginning. At the conclusion of our first Sunday meetings, a young lady came up to introduce herself to me. She walked with difficulty and with an accentuated stagger. Her facial features were somewhat distorted, and her speech was obviously impaired. I later learned Carol had had cerebral palsy as a child and had been left with a severe physical handicap. We visited for a minute, and then she left. You know what I, as her good bishop, did? I thought to myself, "Here is a girl who is probably going to need a lot of special attention, take up a lot of my time, probably be a burden on us and her roommates." You know, that may just possibly be the most inaccurate, knee-jerk reaction I've ever had. Let me tell you why.<br><br>Several days later our ward had an opening social on the lawn by the King Henry swimming pool. One of our new ward members, who was a big handsome six feet of tan body and solid muscle (like me when I was his age), dove off the diving board and bumped his head on the bottom of the pool. He didn't seem to bump it very hard, but nevertheless he got out of the pool and went over and lay underneath a tree and moaned a little. Whether he was really injured or not was hard to tell, but it doesn't matter. What matters is that I sat and watched as Carol struggled over to the table where the food was and somehow managed to get some food on a plate and struggled back to the tree where the six-foot mass of moaning muscle was lying. She helped him eat, she stayed with him, and she took care of him.<br><br>And, you see, I had worried about Carol's being a burden on someone. Carol baked cookies for people, she took them places in her car, and she took care of them when they were sick. When she bore her testimony, it was so quiet you could hear a pin drop. Her spirit was well, and she had great courage and great faith.<br><br>One Sunday I announced that the combined stakes were planning a five-mile fun run and that, since we old men in the bishopric were planning to run, everyone else ought to run too. Carol decided that, if old men could run, she could run. Now, honestly, to watch Carol, you would not think she could walk a block, let alone run anyplace. But she developed a kind of shuffling gait and worked out until she said she was sure she could cover five miles.<br><br>The day of the run came, and there were about fifty or sixty of us from the ward that showed up--and there was Carol. We decided that we would assign some ward members to stay with her until she got tired, and then they could go back and get the car and pick her up. So the race began. There were several thousand runners, and after a few blocks I lost track of Carol and most of the other ward members. We ended by running into an entrance on the southeast side of the football stadium and around the track to the finish line at about the middle of the west side.<br><br>The race had ended, and nearly all the runners had crossed the finish line and were standing in small groups or sitting in the stadium chairs. There were a bunch of us from the ward congratulating ourselves on surviving, and then we remembered Carol. No one could remember seeing her, and it was now almost a half an hour since the last runner had come in. We were worried, and so eight or ten of us decided to run back along the course to see if we could find her. As we got back to the other side of the track, we could see her in her staggering walk coming down the street toward the entrance to the stadium. She made it through the entrance and onto the track and then began her jogging shuffle because she wanted to end the race in style.<br><br>Well, we all jogged along with her and shouted encouragement. We got around the track to the west stands, and everyone stood up and started cheering and shouting. She crossed the finish line, and we all threw our arms around her and hugged her and jumped up and down with her for joy.<br><br>Carol had class and style and courage. Her spirit was healthy. My young brothers and sisters, it is not easy to overcome our spiritual shortcomings, to cure our spiritual leprosy. It takes determination and courage. But I know there are roommates and family members and Church leaders who wait with their arms open to throw them around you as you exhibit the kind of spiritual courage that we saw in Carol that day when we threw our arms around her.<br><br>Remember Naaman? Naaman followed the counsel of the prophet, and his leprosy was cured. We have a prophet today, and, if we will follow his counsel, we can cure our spiritual leprosy. The ten lepers went to the Savior and were cured. The message is clear: we need seek no other response to our spiritual afflictions. The Savior has bidden us to come unto him, for his yoke is easy and his burden is light.<br><br>I so testify to you in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Stephen D.

<br>
&amp;nbsp;<br><h2><b>A Sad Case</b></h2><br>A number of years ago, as a counselor in a bishopric, I was assigned to home teach some of the less active members of our ward. One of my families was a lone man who lived in a rented room. He was very hard to find at home. And try as I might to be Christian about it all, I was often glad when he was out and I missed him. He was an alcoholic.<br><br>One evening I found him home and very sober. He was sick with a liver disease which threatened his very life. His illness had scared him away from his passion for drink for a short while. As he sobered up, the painful memories of his life crowded him, and he sought relief. Usually his relief came through drink. This time I was there.<br><br>He opened up to me and told of his happy first marriage. His successes early in his life, his lovely wife, his children--his face beamed as he talked about this marvelous time of his life. And then his face clouded as he spoke of how the pressure to get ahead at work became hard for him to deal with, and he began to drink. And he drank, and he drank, and one by one his successes turned to failures. He lost his job, his wife, and his family.<br><br>Then again his face cleared and he told of a short interlude in his dissolute life during which he married again. He also destroyed that marriage through his drinking. The tears came. He sobbed that he was dying alone, dejected, unproductive, unhappy--the personification of one brand of human failure.<br><br>I did not visit him again before he died. It was only a short time after our conversation that his death came. I was saddened by it. Then came the shock. His first wife called and asked if I would speak at his funeral. I was to be the only speaker! What could I say? Oh, what could I say that would comfort his former wives and family?<br><br>I worried about that funeral sermon about as much as I have worried about today's blessing.<br><br>A song, a prayer, my sermon, a song, a prayer, the trip to the cemetery, the brief ceremony there, and the dedication of the grave: It was all a blur to me. But at the end of it all one of his children came and thanked me. The words were something like, "As I listened to your sermon, a flood of memories came back--most of them bad. Yet some of them were sweet. My dad failed. He was weak. But he loved me. He was kind to me. Even when he was drunk, he wasn't mean to me. It was so sad. I hope that from him I can learn to avoid his mistakes while emulating his good characteristics."<br><br>I suppose that the last sentence, as hopeful at it is, would not be your choice of how you would like others to think of you, whether in life or in death. While it is true that most of us embody both good and bad, we rather hope that the good so far outweighs the bad that the speakers at our last rites will have much to speak about.<br><h2><b>People Represent Characteristics</b></h2><br>Now, I don't want to be any more morbid than I've already been, but it is true that people can come to represent characteristics of great righteousness or evil to us because of the lives they have lead or are leading. Some people's names come to be synonymous with one or several characteristics. What character traits come to your minds when I say these names: Abraham Lincoln? Judas Iscariot? Joseph Smith? Richard Nixon? Adolph Hitler? Jesus Christ? David O. McKay? Are there names in that set which mean something to you? Not all good, I suspect, but clearly they mean something to you. I have some other names which won't mean much to you, but which mean a great deal to me.<br><br>Adrian Slotboom--my maternal grandfather. He was tall for his generation, about six foot three. Strong. Even his moustache and short cropped white hair were wiry and strong. But he was also loving and kind. Oh, so kind. Through him I came to believe that real men were strong and kind, had real reverence for life, loved all living things.<br><br>We lived in a basement apartment under him when I was growing up. I saw him almost every day. Oma, my grandmother, would call him to kill a spider in the house, and my strong but kind grandfather would pick the spider up and carry it out to the garden rather than kill it.<br><br>Once my brother Gerald and I raised rabbits. This was part of our "war effort," along with our "victory garden." You may not remember victory gardens, but most of us were enjoined to have one--a little bit like the counsel we receive today from the Brethren. It seemed the bugs and neglect always won over our carrots and radishes, but at least our rabbits flourished. We spent happy hours harvesting clover and grass from the vacant lots of our neighborhood to feed our rabbits. They grew and fattened, and finally the day of the harvest came. Gerald couldn't kill and clean them. I couldn't either. Strong Opa, our grandfather, would. At least so we believed. He finally did because it needed to be done. But kind, loving Opa cried all the time he worked. Needless to say, we didn't raise any more rabbits.<br><br>David O. McKay--I mentioned his name earlier. He was the prophet for most of my growing-up years. I heard so many stories of his love for Emma that I vowed to myself I would always try to be kind and considerate to my wife when I got married. My lovely wife is here today. I've tried to live up to that resolve. She is the best judge of how well I've succeeded. If I have to any degree which has enhanced our marriage, David O. McKay had something to do with it.<br><br>I could name others: Miss Green and Adele Davis, two teachers who taught me that I could learn, that it took effort, and that they cared. To me they personify the characteristics of a good teacher. Roy A. Welker, whose manual on the Old Testament was used for several years in the Church, came to personify a successful Church member to me even more than the General Authorities--not because he was better, but because he was closer. He lived just down the street from me. He looked as if he should work in the temple, he had his year's supply, he read the scriptures every day, and he influenced us young men in the ward for good. He wrote us on our missions. He prayed for us, and we knew it.<br><br>Rose Floyd, his sister-in-law. When I was around sixteen and cars and girls were very important to me, she called me in from the street one day. She was so excited that I could hardly wait to see what she wanted to show me. It was a painting--it cost as much as a new car! Arnold Friberg had painted it. She had me sit in a chair and just look at it. I did for awhile. I returned on several subsequent occasions. I came to conclude that the painting was worth it, worth even more than a new car. She helped me to understand much more about the real priorities in life.<br><br>Many more people mean particular character traits to me. They are still living so I hesitate to preach their funeral sermons here. However, I will briefly mention my mom--though she's worth whole books of mention. She's tough. Widowed with three young children, an immigrant to this country, she raised us alone working day and night. To me she means that a person of quality can take any thing life can dish out and conquer it. She taught me that<i>poor</i>is an attitude of mind, not a state of being. I never doubted that I would go on a mission, graduate from college, marry in the temple. What could stop me?<br><h2><b>Develop Good Characteristics</b></h2><br>Now to the point! When you say your own name to yourself, what traits of character spring to your consciousness? Are you clearly progressing toward strong character traits, becoming something good? Are you developing habits and attitudes which mean you are regressing toward something bad? Are you like Charlie Brown--just wishy-washy?<br><br>If you had a choice, would you become something good? I would certainly prefer becoming something good to becoming something bad. Would you? Or should we have as a goal to remain in a wishy-washy state--out of focus, not even useful as a bad example?<br><br>Well, I believe that you do have a choice! You can by conscious choices and acts of will become the type of man or woman you choose to be. Dream big, but understand clearly that those laws "irrevocably decreed in heaven before the foundations of this world, upon which all blessings are predicated" control this too. "And when we obtain any blessing from God, it is by obedience to that law upon which it is predicated" (D&amp;amp;C 130:20–21).<br><br>What principles of righteousness will we strive to live by? What choices do we have? Are there many? Is it not just like so much else in the gospel--at first blush it looks overwhelming? Then comes the bad logic we so often use on ourselves: "I want to be all things good. There are too many even to number. Therefore, I won't start." Can't you see Satan smile? Try other logic. Start somewhere. For each good thing you would become, the pattern goes about like this:<br><br><b>Step 1.</b>Learn what the characteristic you desire to develop really is. Read about it in the scriptures. Ponder. Pray. Ask for understanding. Study the conditions under which it applies, what acts it has inspired.<br><br><b>Step 2.</b>Make the commitment to do it. Become, over time, the embodiment of the character trait you desire. Once you have made the commitment, be stalwart, not easily discouraged. Do not make excuses for your failures. Events don't<i>cause</i>you to be anything. They simply trigger reactions. If you will to act differently than your first reaction, then by force of will you can. If you fall, repent! Know that the price of backing off your commitment is that, unless you repent, recommit, and live up to it, you are<i>not</i>what you wanted to be.<br><br><b>Step 3.</b>Be willing to pay the price. Ultimately, Christ's "yoke is easy, and [his] burden is light" (Matthew 11:30). But in the meantime not all will be sweetness and light. Remember this also: "Everyone that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved" (John 3:20). There will be distracters. You may end up as the butt of jokes, the object of vicious gossip, or even the victim of physical abuse. Is it worth it?<br><br><i>For what is a man profited, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?</i>[Matthew 16:26]<br><br>You are making the choices. You will have to decide for yourself. But opposition is real.<br><br>One teenager I know had a "boyfriend" who wanted her to lower her standards. She refused--not because she did not like him or because she thought she was better than he, but because it was the right thing to do. Her own heart told her so. His reaction was to speak negatively about her, to influence his friends to be unkind, to abuse her with coarse language, and to even write in her yearbook that he was tired of her high standards and hated her. What was at issue here? It was not even necking or petting; it was "bear hugging" at school dances that started it all. Does it sound silly to you? I'm afraid it is not.<br><br>If you hold to high standards and try diligently to build your life on principles, you may well be labeled as a prude, a do-gooder, unsophisticated, square--<i>a straight arrow</i>. If they don't want you to be a straight arrow, then what would they have you be--lascivious, a do-badder, sinful, shapeless--<i>a crooked arrow</i>? Can you imagine anything as useless as a crooked arrow? If you wanted to hit a target, reach a goal, predict a course of flight, which arrow would you pick? In working out his plans, do you imagine God picks<i>crooked arrows</i>?<br><h2><b>First Principles</b></h2><br>With these steps in mind, learn about the characteristic, commit yourself to it, and pay the price. What principle should we start on? You decide for yourself. I remind you that the first principles of the gospel are "first, faith in the Lord Jesus Christ; second, repentance." We know it from the Fourth Article of Faith.<br><br>To me, these two principles are worthy principles to start on.<br><h3><em><b>Faith</b></em></h3><br>Of faith, Joseph Smith wrote that it is "the first principle in revealed religion, and the<i>foundation</i>of all<i>righteousness</i>" ("Lecture First,"<i>Lectures on Faith</i>, Doctrine and Covenants, 1891, p. 1). True religion is not just another do-it-yourself book based on man's current best guess as to what is worthwhile and how you acquire it. True religion and the development of true character must be based on truth, righteousness,<i>all</i>the good things in the universe. God is their source. Christ is their champion. Our faith should center on them.<br><br>Much has been written by the prophets on faith, I'll leave it to you to search it out and strive to understand it. That's step one. Alma 32 would be a good place to start. Once you know what it would mean to have faith, you can choose whether you would rather have faith or be faithless. I think you'll choose to be faithful. Commit to your choice. Then pay the price. Study, pray, act in righteousness so that the foundation of your life conforms to having faith, and faith will come. What will you give up--what is the price? You have to give up doubt, and sin, and put away idle things as you faithfully pursue God's directions to you. Now, God's directions aren't always perfectly clear as perhaps sometimes you've noticed. Not because he doesn't say things clearly, but because we see through a glass darkly.<br><br>I remember, when I was working at Purdue, having the opportunity to make a trip to Brigham Young University, and then a second trip, and then a third trip, and then a fourth trip. The object was that I would consider coming here. My wife and I, each time after I had been out here, would fast and pray about it and then feel quite relieved that we were not required to come here at that time. We enjoyed our life at Purdue, and I felt we were making good progress both in our personal lives and in my professional life. Very quickly at Purdue I became an associate professor and even entertained thoughts of becoming a full professor while yet in my early years. But the fourth time we came out and fasted and prayed about it, we received clearly the indication that we were to come. So early in the academic year, well before Christmas, my wife and I decided that we would resign from Purdue University and make a commitment to Brigham Young University while finishing out the contract year.<br><br>They tried many things to get us to stay, including offering a full professorship, but we had made our minds up, and we came. My first year here was difficult. I had been here many months before I even had furniture. While at Purdue I could go to nearly any convention I could present a paper at; at Brigham Young University I ended up paying. When I handed out papers, it was at my Xeroxing cost in those days, and it seemed my career was coming quickly to a dead end. I wanted to be released. Yes, I felt I had been called here in the sense that the Lord had indicated he wanted me here at that time. But I had been here for a year. Wasn't that long enough? And so I fasted and prayed again, asking for a release. Then I prayed again and then again. Finally came into my heart the words, "You came here to serve and not to be served." Suddenly whatever was happening to my personal career seemed second place to whatever service I might be called upon to render. From that point onward, I've tried to live by that simple sentence, "You came here to serve and not to be served."<br><h3><b>Rep<em>entance</em></b></h3><br>Alma cried:<br><br><i>O that I were an angel, and could have the wish of mine heart, that I might go forth and speak with the trump of God, with a voice to shake the earth, and cry</i>repentance<i>unto every people</i>!<br><br><i>Yea, I would declare unto every soul, as with the voice of thunder, repentance and the plan of redemption, that they should repent and come unto our God, that there might not be more sorrow upon all the face of the earth.</i>[Alma 29:1–2; emphasis added]<br><br>I think all who have faith in Christ could feel as Alma did. The Atonement makes it possible for us to repent and overcome our past sins. In my analysis of the benefits of being a man or woman of principle, one of the greatest is that repentance comes clearly into focus for me as a great gift from a merciful God and the process of true growth. If you have committed yourself to live by a particular principle, what errors can you make? What sins in that realm can you perform? I can think of only two:<br><br>1. You can fall short of your commitment. I think if you do, you'll feel sorrow. If your desire was real to begin with, you will desire again to live the principle in the future and to not have your failure this once brand you for all eternity. If you desire to be honest and you lie once, for whatever reason, however justified you may feel it is, you are a liar. Do you want to remain a liar forever, never able to enter heaven, subject to the father of lies? Of course not; you'll repent if your desire is real.<br><br>Remember, if you are not honest, you are dishonest; if not chaste, the lascivious and carnal minded; if not charitable, then mean and unloving. You don't want to be characterized by any of those negative statements, do you?<br><br>2. A second kind of sin is that you do not understand a principle fully enough so you apply it incorrectly or under the wrong circumstances. Sometimes you may be just when you ought to be merciful. If you err because you do not know enough, you will view the discovery that there is more to learn as a challenge, your mistake will be lamented, but not hidden or harbored up until it cankers your soul. You will want to make things right; you will want to share your new understanding. All this will be so because you intended to do right. How much easier it is to repent when you err while intending to do right than when you are caught while intending to do evil.<br><br>Is it possible to err while intending to do right? Of course; that is why we need the constant companionship of the Holy Ghost to guide us in doing right.<br><br>Once a well-intentioned teacher set out to teach a class of youth a lesson in charity. After class instruction the class was to go home, secure cans and boxes of food, and bring them to a party. At the party the class would wrap the food, with a prize going to the best and most creative wrapping. The class members ate, drank, talked, and had a good time in general. Once all the food was wrapped, they placed the brightly wrapped packages in boxes and piled into cars to deliver them to a poor family to brighten their Christmas.<br><br>The boxes were placed on the porch. The students retired to the background, and the teacher pushed the doorbell. One child came to the door and looked out. When he saw the boxes, he was very excited. He called out, and his mother and the rest of the children came with great expectations--presents, lots of gorgeous presents! One of the children reached out for a package, hurriedly ripped the paper from it before his mother could stop him. It was a can of beans. "Ugh, it's beans!" he cried. I was in that class. That is what I remember most of the evening: "Ugh, it's beans!" It rang through my heart and soul. "Ugh, it's beans!" It registered in my head and stuck there until I had to do something about it.<br><br>Where were the fulfillment and joy that charity should bring? I went to the teacher. I was the only one. I asked why I felt so sorrowful when I should feel something else. Finally, whether out of desperation or inspiration, the teacher blurted out: "If you feel that way, why don't you do something about it?"<br><br>I did. I read about the principle of charity. It is the love of Christ. I didn't do my part of the activity out of love. I gave something that was not mine. I suppose that many of the parents who earned the food which we gave were not even aware that<i>they</i>were being "charitable." I decided, finally, that I would test the principle of charity.<br><br>I thought and prayed about it until I was blessed to understand that some neighbors of mine had a real need. They were old. They could not keep their house clean. It was not messy, but wallpaper needed cleaning, walls and woodwork needed washing, and floors needed real scrubbing and new wax. The man of the family had helped us with some home repairs years before. I do not think he charged all he could have. While old people scared me, I determined that I would approach them. They were skeptical.<br><br>I worked; I scrubbed, waxed, and rubbed. I sweated and got stiff and tired. When I was finished, things actually looked better. They were grateful and wanted to pay me for my efforts.<br><br>I took my pay in the fresh understanding that acts of love which cost you real effort reap you real rewards! Charity is a true principle. I knew it then. I know it still. I am grateful for the force of "Ugh, it's beans" in my life. I repented of my shallow experience and sought out a deeper one so that I would know the principle of charity is true and good. Surely the Lord is the best paymaster.<br><h2><b>The Way You Do Things</b></h2><br>One experience with a principle, however, is not sufficient to recreate you into its embodiment. You might come to know it is true and good, but you do not<i>become</i>it until you practice it over and over until it becomes the way you do things, naturally. Or should I say, unnaturally, since you will have to put off the natural man, and become a spiritual man, to embody the principles of truth.<br><br>Well, what do you want to be? Do you young men want to have real power in the priesthood? Listen to the conditions:<br><br><i>No power or influence can or ought to be maintained by virtue of the priesthood, only by persuasion, by long-suffering, by gentleness and meekness, and by love unfeigned;</i><br><br><i>By kindness, and pure knowledge, which shall greatly enlarge the soul without hypocrisy, and without guile--</i><br><br><i>Reproving betimes with sharpness, when moved upon by the Holy Ghost; and then showing forth afterwards an increase of love toward him whom thou hast reproved, lest he esteem thee to be his enemy;</i><br><br><i>That he may know that thy faithfulness is stronger than the cords of death.</i><br><br><i>Let thy bowels also be full of charity towards all men, and to the household of faith, and let virtue garnish thy thoughts unceasingly; then shall thy confidence wax strong in the presence of God; and the doctrine of the priesthood shall distil upon thy soul as the dews from heaven.</i><br><br><i>The Holy Ghost shall be thy constant companion, and they scepter an unchanging scepter of righteousness and truth; and thy dominion shall be an everlasting dominion, and without compulsory means it shall flow unto thee forever and ever.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 121:41–46]<br><br>Note that definition of what characterizes the real brethren of the priesthood: persuasion, long-suffering, gentleness, meekness, kindness, pure knowledge, sensitivity to the Holy Ghost, love, faithfulness, charity, and so on.<br><br>Do you want to serve God well? Listen to the conditions:<br><br><i>Therefore, O ye that embark in the service of God, see that ye serve him with all your heart, might, mind and strength, that ye may stand blameless before God at the last day.</i><br><br><i>Therefore, if ye have desires to serve God ye are called to the work; . . .</i><br><br><i>And faith, hope, charity and love, with an eye single to the glory of God, qualify him for the work.</i><br><br><i>Remember faith, virtue, knowledge, temperance, patience, brotherly kindness, godliness, charity, humility, diligence</i>. [D&amp;amp;C 4:2–3, 5–6]<br><br>Those are formulas as surely as formulas in a chemistry class are formulas. As we develop the characteristics named in the scriptures, we become men with power in the priesthood. We become servants who have the power to serve God and to have that service come to the benefit of others.<br><br>I pray that I will finish out my days as a man of principle; that I will increasingly become the man I profess to be: that God will not at the last day call out, "Thou hypocrite!" I once was given the invitation to write my own epitaph in a Sunday School class. It fell out of my scriptures while I was preparing this talk; so here it is.<br><br><i>Adrian Van Mondfrans: He was born, lived out his years on this earth, and died. He loved his wife and children. In all his weakness and with all his faults, he tried to serve the Lord. He was blessed with many opportunities to serve in the organizations of the Lord's Church. He also privately worshiped God and his Son and the Holy Ghost. His children respect him and are following in his footsteps in that they too are striving to serve the Lord.</i><br><br>What will people for generations to come say of you? What do they say now? What do you think of yourself? Through faith and repentance you can become what you wish to be. Of you, my brothers and sisters, the Lord could make straight arrows to help him reach his purposes true to the mark. May you not come to the last judgment to hear, "Thou hypocrite!" May your good intentions be matched with real understanding and correct actions so that "Ugh, it's beans" won't have to echo in your heart and soul. Rather, you'll learn that God is the best paymaster. In the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Adrian Van Mondfrans was associate dean of the College of Education at BYU when this devotional address was given on 1 June 1982.</i></i><br><br><i>© Brigham Young University.

<h1>g for Eternity - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
My dear brothers and sisters, BYU means a lot to our family. When our oldest daughter recently graduated from here, she became the fifth consecutive generation to hold a degree from BYU, joining her mother and father, her grandmother, her great-grandmother, and her great-great-grandfather who served for many years as the president of BYU. I love and appreciate this institution and hope you do as well.<br><br>I ask for your faith and prayers that what is said today will be spiritually edifying to all.<br><h2><b>Wise Investing</b></h2><br>This morning I would like to speak about the importance of wise investing. I remember hearing that one wise investment is worth a lifetime of work. In terms of dollar returns I'm sure that could be proven true. Who hasn't heard of putting $1000 in IBM many years ago and coming out with a million dollars of value some years later? Who hasn't had their financial salivary glands whetted by such thoughts or similar stories of getting into another Xerox "on the ground floor"? Why don't we do it? Well, we don't know or we don't act or more likely the company we choose goes bankrupt and we lose it all. I have often heard the joke (and sometimes feel it's true) that, if you want to make a lot of money in the stock market, just watch what I do and then do just the opposite.<br><br>Sometimes we don't listen to others or don't trust them. I remember a man once telling me to buy a certain stock. I ignored him, and it tripled in a few months. But then there is the other side. How many bought silver at $30 or $40 or $50, and it's now selling at $6, or gold at $800, and it's now at $300? We all know of the uncertainties of the commodities market.<br><br>Some say, "But there is well-located real estate. It is always a sure investment." Yes, unless the zoning changes or the taxes increase or the neighborhood shifts or growth stops or floods or wars come. I remember many years ago hearing that Beirut, Lebanon, was the best and safest place in the world to invest in real estate. How would you like to have some there today?<br><br>I am sure you get the point that, although there is a place for wise investment in terms of physical things, generally any investment of this nature is largely at the mercy of forces beyond our control--for example, the death or defection of a key executive or salesman, the patenting of a new invention that replaces our company's product, the sudden increase in the price of oil, the unexpected shift in interest rates, the fraud or embezzlement of a trusted partner, or the precipitous rise or fall of the stock market.<br><br>With this much uncertainty in investing in physical things, why are we even talking about it? Well, obviously I have not come here to visit with you about investing in physical things. I use it merely by way of contrast. You have a great business school and many experienced professors to teach you the correct principles of this type of investing; but, along with all the preparation they give you, they will always add, "Remember, there is a certain degree of risk in all investments"--all physical investments, that is.<br><h2><b>No-Risk Investments</b></h2><br>What would you say, then, if I told you I know of some investments that have no risk whatsoever and pay handsome returns on a continuing basis? You would say, "Well, they can't be physical investments," and you would be right. I speak, of course, of investments of time--spiritual investments--investments in character, investments in obedience, investments in service, investments in kindness, and so forth.<br><br>The Lord has told us,<br><br><i>Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal:</i><br><br><i>But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor steal.</i>[Matthew 6:19-20]<br><br>We live in a day of great uncertainty as far as physical investments go, but I am convinced that that uncertainty will continue to increase. Remember the statement in the Book of Mormon that says, "And behold, the time cometh that he curseth your riches, that they become slippery, that ye cannot hold them" (Helaman 13:31).<br><br>I remember, when I attended business school at BYU many years ago, one of my professors gave three rules he felt were valid for good investing. He said, "First, you should invest in things that you know something about or have had some experience in so you can tell if the promises or prospects are reasonable or way out of line. Second, you should invest in things close to home where you can see them. And, third, you should invest with people you personally know and with whom you have had experience and whom you trust."<br><br>I am not sure if all of those rules still apply today, but they have been good guides in my life. They particularly apply perfectly to the investments of time--or spiritual investments--that I'm talking about. We know what we are dealing with and with whom we are working, and we can trust Him fully.<br><br>Naturally, you will want to do well in school and very carefully make the most prudent physical investments possible; but, with the prospects of increasing uncertainty in this field, the stark contrast of the absolute certainty of spiritual investments comes into even more clear focus.<br><br>All of us are limited to the dollars we have to make physical investments with. Some, of course, have much more than others; but all are limited to some degree. On the other hand, we all have an equal amount of time. Twenty-four hours each day is allotted to every person. How we invest that time is up to us and is of utmost importance to our happiness now and forever.<br><br>Let me give two specific examples--first, investing in service and second, investing in kindness. To do so I will use two separate missionary experiences.<br><h2><b>Brother Vea's Investment in Service</b></h2><br>Come with me for a moment to the small island of Lifuka in the South Pacific. The time is 1956. I was serving as a young missionary in Tonga and had recently been appointed district president of the Ha'apai District, with headquarters in Pangai on this island of Lifuka. The district covered seventeen islands. Because our only means of transportation was by sailboat, I needed some experienced, sea-worthy counselors. As always, the Lord provided, and two fine local men were chosen as counselors.<br><br>I will mention just one at this point. His name was Brother Vea. He had a beautifully kept thatched home, a lovely, clean yard, and a beautiful family. He had a nice garden to provide food for him and his family, and in addition he grew a lot of peanuts. To earn money he was a peanut vendor, and most evenings one would see him out with his cart, selling peanuts and a few other items his wife had made. The best days and evenings for business were when there were shows or rugby games or fairs or other forms of entertainment in town.<br><br>I don't know how many times we would have presidency meetings on the night of a big dance or social, but never was I aware of his saying, "I can't come tonight," even though selling peanuts was his main source of income.<br><br>Very often our schedule called for us to go to another island for a conference or for tracting or some other Church business which would take us away from Pangai right during a main rugby match or other large gathering. But never once did I hear Brother Vea complain or suggest we change our schedule. He was committed to serving to the best of his ability in the position to which he was called. He chose to invest in obedience and in service to others--often at the seeming expense of some worldly gain.<br><br>Now, let's follow that particular investment through. About fifteen years later, as a Regional Representative, I was given a special assignment to the South Pacific. I had the responsibility of holding some meetings in California and then moving on to Honolulu and to the islands farther south. We had two meetings scheduled in California--one in the evening and one the next morning--involving a few stake presidents there. As we went through the agenda that evening, I found myself feeling that we ought to finish all our business that night and not stay on the next morning. Partway through the agenda I announced that we would do so, and, of course, the presidents asked, "Why?"<br><br>I said, "I don't really know why, but that's the way it's going to be." (Most stake presidents are pretty submissive when someone else is in charge.) We completed the entire agenda that evening, even though it was late. Then I began to wonder why myself.<br><br>I didn't have a reservation out the next day until the early afternoon because we had originally scheduled to meet until noon. I wondered, "What am I going to do with these extra several hours I have?"<br><br>I got up early the next morning and, as all of you would do, prayed fervently to know if there was something I ought to do. I didn't have any especially strong feelings, but I thought, "Well, I'd better check." So I called the airport and said, "I have a reservation on this particular plane. Do you have anything leaving before then?"<br><br>The man said, "Well, we have one leaving in forty-five minutes. Where are you?"<br><br>I said, "I'm here at the hotel."<br><br>He said, "Oh, you'll never be able to make it."<br><br>I asked, "Do you have space?"<br><br>He said, "Yes."<br><br>I said, "Let me give it a try." So I quickly gathered up everything, threw it in the suitcase, and charged off to the airport. As it turned out, I went straight to the gate and was the last person on the plane, but I did get on.<br><br>I arrived in Honolulu four or five hours later, and then I thought, "Well, now you've really blown it." The meetings I had were in Laie, and here I was in Honolulu with no one to pick me up for many hours. What should I do now?<br><br>In just a few minutes I ran into a young man whom I had known in the mission field. He asked, "What are you doing right now?"<br><br>I said, "I'm just sort of waiting around."<br><br>He replied, "I'm on my way up to the hospital. Did you hear that the other night Brother Vea was flown in from Tonga? He has some kind of disease, and he is over at the Queen's Hospital. I was just going to visit him. If you have a few moments, would you like to come?"<br><br>I said, "Sure."<br><br>Together we went to the hospital to visit Brother Vea. (This was the same man who had served as the very faithful and helpful counselor to me when I was district president those many years before.)<br><br>When we got to the hospital, the nurse wouldn't let us in. She said, "He is in very serious condition, and only family members can visit him."<br><br>I knew that I had to get in. This was the first time I began to feel for sure that this was what I ought to be doing. I said to the nurse, "Look, I've come several thousand miles to visit him. He asked me to come and visit him. Would you let me in?" I showed her my ticket.<br><br>She said, "If you have gone to all that effort, I guess I will let you see him."<br><br>We went in. He was writhing in pain. His whole body was yellow with a very jaundiced condition because of a serious kidney problem. His eyes were closed. One could tell he was really hurting.<br><br>I went over to him and said, "Brother Vea, I've come to visit you."<br><br>He suddenly stopped writhing and opened his eyes. They were about as yellow as anything I had ever seen. Then he said, "Oh, thank you for coming. I knew that you were scheduled for a conference in Tonga, and I knew that the only way to get there was by coming through Honolulu." He then proceeded, "All last night I prayed as fervently as I could that some way or another you would come and visit me. As you know, I don't have much family here. I don't have a bishop here. I don't have home teachers here. I don't have many friends here. I really need a blessing. I'm in a bad way. Would you please bless me?"<br><br>We administered to him. As I began to seal the anointing, I thought that everything would be just fine. With his kind of faith, how could it be otherwise? But, as is so often the case, that wasn't what the Lord had in mind.<br><br>I won't go into detail, but basically I had the opportunity of telling him what the Lord had in mind for him, of actually specifying what he would be doing in just a short period of time. I was able to tell him that very shortly he would be performing a certain service on the other side that was badly needed. In a way it was a shock to me, but the Spirit was so strong there was no question as to the Lord's will. When we concluded, he looked up at me and simply said, "Thank you, thank you very much. I really wanted to live here, but more than that I want to do my Heavenly Father's will. I appreciate knowing what it is."<br><br>We left. Hours before the plane I was originally scheduled to come on even arrived, Brother Vea was transferred from this sphere of existence to his next assignment, and he went with a great peace and calm in his heart. What a return on investment!<br><br>I wrote to my wife about the experience. I remember receiving a letter from her saying, "The folks dropped in tonight, and I shared the letter about Brother Vea with them. I told them I had been thinking that we so often try to figure out why things happen when and how they do and analyze and give reasons--the ins and outs of pressures and politics, and so forth, in the busy schedules and assignments of the Brethren. At the time all seemed to be playing their roles in determining when you needed to hurry and get away on this trip. And yet, with all due respect to the Brethren and their heavy responsibilities, I guess the Lord even uses such things to get His real purposes accomplished. A humble, faithful servant, unknown to most of the world, or to the Church for that matter, needed a blessing and a confirmation and calling from his Father, and our Father saw that he received it when the time was right."<br><br>A fifteen-year investment paid off in a quiet, yet stunningly impressive way. And his service paid dividends of joy all through those years and will continue to pay increasing dividends throughout all eternity.<br><br>Invest in service? What greater, what surer investment can we make?<br><h2><b>An Investment in Kindness</b></h2><br>Let me talk about investments in kindness now. I will relate an incident that happened earlier on this same mission to demonstrate how investing in kindness--that is, being kind to other people and not expressing anger or judgment--goes into an eternal realm, an eternal help-bank, if you will, to be drawn upon by ourselves and by others when the need is there. We have blood banks and financial banks that we put into and draw out of. We understand these types of banks and how they work. I would suggest that just by being kind to other people and by eliminating anger, we move that kindness into a bank--a kindness bank, which is available to help and to save us and other people.<br><br>Now the story:<br><br>My first assignment as a missionary was with a native companion to a very small island of only about 700 people. We were extremely frustrated in tracting as no one seemed to want to let us in. And I didn't yet have the language well as we had no MTC at that time. Some people would invite us to eat something with them, but they would say, "We'll let you eat something as long as you don't talk about your church or talk religion to us." We were grateful for the food and their hospitality, and we would ask if we could at least say a blessing. Sometimes we would say a ten-minute blessing to get a few points of doctrine in. It was hard. Mostly they were very kind but very strong in their own churches. They simply did not want to visit with us about our church.<br><br>One particular village seemed very anti-Mormon to us. Many days we would tract all day and not get into a single home. Then one day we did get into a home in this village. It was the only one in the village we ever got into. They seemed nice and invited us back. I guess the ministers and the people there were upset with that family and upset with us, but we went back and back. When we gave them the fourth discussion, they and lots of questions; and it was quite late at night before we got through. The family said, "We'd like to have you stay here tonight."<br><br>"Thank you, but we must go to our home," we replied. We lived about two miles away, but there was a section of jungle or bush between their village and ours. Their house was right on the edge of this bush area, and our house was on the other side of it. There was a small trail through the bush that we usually took on our way home.<br><br>They persisted, "We'd really like you to stay tonight."<br><br>But we said, "No, we can't."<br><br>They appealed to us two or three times, and I began to sense that maybe something was wrong. However, since nothing was definite, we didn't think much about it and left for our house.<br><br>We had gone about a hundred feet from the door to where the bush started when all of a sudden from behind the trees emerged a group of eight or ten real tough young Tongan men. They were drunk. They had clubs, stones, and broken bottles. They formed a sort of semicircle and started to tighten it and move in closer to us. We could see that we were in trouble, for they were obviously bent on hurting us. As they moved closer, my native companion--just like a mother hen--pushed me behind him and said, "Now, here's what we'll do. I'm going to count to three. When I say, 'three,' I'm going to yell as loud as I can and charge right in the middle of them. As soon as I do, I want you to turn and run as fast as you can through the bush toward home. It is dark, and they won't be able to know whether it is both of us or just me because I'll be swinging my fists and yelling; and by the time they find out it is just me, you'll be halfway to Vaipoa. You'll be safe. They won't come after you."<br><br>"I can't do that," I said (even though I wanted to.)<br><br>He replied, "Look, I'm the senior companion. You do what I say. There is no sense in both of us getting hurt." Then he started, "One ... ,two..."<br><br>Fortunately, he didn't get to three, and I didn't have to make that decision. For on the count of "two" there came a huge crash from behind us, and out of the bush from where the trail began came the man that everyone in the island feared more than anyone else. He was the toughest of them all.<br><br>My first impression was, "We've had it now--sealed off from in front and behind."<br><br>But he walked right past us and stood in front of us and stopped. (He was a little tipsy himself.) He glared at those eight or ten young men and said, "No one is going to touch the Mormon missionaries. They are under my protection. Anyone that touches them or even says anything bad about them will answer to me."<br><br>Have you ever watched a cube of butter put into a hot frying pan? It just melts away. Well, that's what happened. That crowd just melted away. In no time at all they had filtered into the darkness as quietly as they had appeared from it.<br><br>As we walked to our home with him and finally realized we were safe, we asked him, "Why did you do that? Why did you help us?"<br><br>"Well," he explained, "someone [another minister, I presumed] called us together, gave us some free home brew, and suggested that we take care of the Mormon missionaries and see that they didn't come back to town. I attended that meeting," he said, "and when I heard the name 'Mormon," something started to stir deep down inside me. I got pretty soused, but I didn't go completely under. Something kept bothering me."<br><br>He then unfolded the following story: "I didn't know my real parents. I was reared by some relatives. I guess you would call me an orphan. When I was about ten, I went down to Vava'u. I was picked on a lot. It seemed that no one really wanted me. When I got to Vava'u, I met two young men who were teaching a school in English. They wore white shirts and ties. Everyone else kicked me around, but they didn't. They asked me if I would like to come to their school. I said, 'Sure.' They had a feeling of love and concern for me, something I hadn't felt much in my life before.<br><br>"After I had gone to school for two or three weeks, they took me out in the ocean and baptized me--put me under the water--and said, 'Now you are a Mormon.' I didn't know fully what that meant, but I felt good about it. I realized that I was a Mormon.<br><br>"Just shortly after that I had to come back up to this island. I got back here and had no further association with the Church. There weren't any missionaries here, nor were there any members that I knew of. So, over a period of years I seemed to forget about it. But when the minister said, 'You are going to take care of the Mormon missionaries and see that they don't come back,' it all came back to me: 'I am a Mormon. Mormon missionaries aren't bad people; they are good people. They loved me. They helped me. They were kind to me.' I wondered what to do. Then I thought, 'I'll just sit by the house and protect them. I'll help them.'" And that is what he did. When it got to that critical point, he jumped out, and we didn't have any more problems with any of those people because they knew we were under his protection.<br><br>Now, I want to ask, "What would have happened had those two missionaries twenty years earlier not been kind?" I don't even know who they were. I don't even know their names or anything about them other than that they showed love and kindness to a little orphan boy who was kicked around by others. I know that the love and kindness they showed him went into the eternal kindness bank and came out later--twenty years later--to help us, to save us from harm, and, I suppose without too much stretch of the imagination, to save our lives.<br><br>Who was the most grateful--my companion and I that we were not harmed or the young man that he had helped us or the several young men that they had not harmed us or the early-day missionaries that had been kind to him? Who kept track of that act of kindness for all those years?<br><br>Can you see the place of the investment in kindness? Can you see how the doing of a kind deed continues on forever and pays eternal dividends and blesses countless people?<br><h2><b>Our Need for This Kind of Bank</b></h2><br>Oh, how we need to draw on this bank--and how we need to put into it also, for us and for countless others. No act of kindness is ever lost. It is always there and always available. Let us invest in kindness and service.<br><br>Now you might ask, "Yes, but there are so many things to do, how do we know where the best place is to invest our time?" Obviously we will want to invest it in the general area of helping others as opposed to helping ourselves--to being kind rather than selfish. But what about specifics? How can we tell? We will want to follow the promptings of the Spirit of the Lord as opposed to the spirit of the world or the evil one. Now, you've all heard of the advertisement, "When such-and-such a company speaks, everyone listens." We need to adopt that--and listen when the Lord speaks.<br><br>The following is a short list (probably prepared by some of our seminary people) of some ways we have of discerning the Spirit. Let me read briefly how we will feel when we have the Spirit of the Lord and how we will feel when we have the spirit of the world or the evil one:<br><h2><b>Howto Discern the Influence of the Spirit</b></h2><br><h3><em><b>When You Have the Spirit When You Do Not Have the Spirit, or When Satan is Prompting You:</b></em></h3><br>1. You feel happy and calm. You feel unhappy, depressed, confused, frustrated.<br><br>2. You feel full of light. You feel heavy, full of darkness.<br><br>3. Your mind is clear. Your mind is muddled.<br><br>4. Your bosom burns with love for the Lord and for others. You feel empty, hollow, cold inside.<br><br>5. You feel generous. You feel selfish, possessive, self-centered.<br><br>6. Nobody can offend you. Everything anyone does bothers you.<br><br>7. You are very forgiving and kind. You are always on the defensive.<br><br>8. You feel confident in what you do. You become discouraged easily.<br><br>9. You don't mind anyone seeing what you are doing. You become secretive, evasive.<br><br>10. You feel outgoing, anxious to be with others -- You want to be alone. You avoid others -- especially family members.<br><br>11. You are glad when others succeed. You are envious of what others do and what they have.<br><br>12. You want to make others happy, even those opposed to you. You want to get even and show others up.<br><br>13. You bring out the best and say the best about others. You are critical of others, especially family members and those in authority.<br><br>14. You gladly and willingly perform Church work. You feel hesitant, unworthy, and unwilling to perform Church ordinances.<br><br>15. You feel like praying and reading the scriptures. You don't want to pray or read scriptures.<br><br>16. You wish you could keep all the Lord's commandments. You find the commandments of God and rules of the family bothersome, restricting, or senseless.<br><br>17. You feel you have control of your appetites and emotions: food and sleep in moderation, sexual restraint, recreation that is wholesome and moderate; you are calm and control your speech; you feel no anger. You become a slave to your appetites; your emotions become passionate; over indulgence in food, sleep, sex, stimulating entertainment, loud music, strong anger, outspokenness all become part of your character.<br><br>18. You feel a deep desire to help others--usually in a way no one else will know about. You want to make sure all the help you give others is duly noted by them and the world.<br><br>19. You speak and think only good about others. You look for and find evil in others and broadcast it.<br><br>20. You feel sorrow when others have problems and sincerely desire to help them. You question others' motives and secretly delight in their problems, and say, "I'm glad I'm not that way."<br><br><i>You realize that your thoughts and your actions are open to God. You feel that what you do and think is only your business and no one else knows or cares.</i><br><br>I think that if we will listen to those types of spirits, we will have a clear understanding of when we're being guided by the Spirit of the Lord, by the Spirit of light and of truth, and when we're being guided by the spirit of the world. Investing in things that the spirit of the world guides us in creates uncertainty and will not pay off well. But investing in things that the Lord guides us in creates certainty and assurance and will pay off handsomely.<br><br>I plead with all of us, then, to invest our time in those things, in those areas, with those people, that the Spirit of the Lord prompts us to do.<br><h2><b>Much Need Exists</b></h2><br>The opportunities are all around us, but we must listen for them and then act upon them.<br><br>President Kimball has said, "God does notice us, and he watches over us. But it is usually through another person that he meets our needs" ("The Abundant Life,"<i>Ensign,</i>July 1978, p. 4). And that is, of course, to give us the opportunity to serve.<br><br>Just stop and think for a moment of the whole world, the whole universe, literally filled with cries and pleas for help. Let us compare it to a radio. Most of you have had experience with regular radios and some with powerful short-wave radios. If your only experience with a radio has been in automatically going to the nearest rock station or to one or two predetermined stations that you're familiar with, you should really try sometime to experiment with a powerful short-wave radio. It's amazing what can happen.<br><br>While most of us live with the close-range familiar FM bands, when we switch to the powerful short-wave band, a remarkable thing happens. Instead of the bright, clear, familiar stereo sounds that lull us into a sense of moodiness with no effort on our own, we suddenly find static and distant voices, fading music, foreign tongues, strange sounds, dots and dashes, low-pitched hums, and high-pitched squeals. We can no longer relax with the effortless familiarity of the big sound, but must painstakingly tune the dial and carefully, and even strainingly, attune our hearing to and rivet our attention on a combination of sound and touch and feel and understanding.<br><br>Where are these sounds coming from? Why do they fade in and out? What is the meaning of the high-pitched hums and the low buzzes, and what is the interpretation of the foreign sounding words? Is the music coming from Mexico or the Canary Islands or maybe far-off Africa? It's a fascinating experience, but we soon tire of it unless we get some meaning out of what is coming through. If we have no meaning, we find ourselves falling back into the familiarity of the big sound with its no-effort vibrations filling our rooms and dominating our moods. But we must make the effort. We must hear the cry of others--those unborn, those untaught, those unhappy, those unbaptized, those unmissioned, those unwell, those unsealed.<br><br>It seems to be our nature to try to shield ourselves from things different. How desperately we attempt to move in the circles of familiarity, of little or no effort, lulled into the security of sensing no need for change as the big sound we are used to comes through so clearly.<br><h2><b>We Must Respond</b></h2><br>But we must change. We must extend our efforts. We must begin to suffer the discomfort of the short-wave radio. We must attempt to understand those unclear sounds and unfamiliar languages. We must even strain to gain comprehension of what is being requested, what is needed, and how we can best fill that need. We must, in fact, move into the unknown, become a full partner with God, and attune our souls to the hearing and answering of the pleas and needs of others. It will always present a challenge. All growth requires effort; all growth requires overcoming.<br><h2><b>Conclusions</b></h2><br>I don't know what your test or challenge will be--postponing marriage or children or a haircut or a mission--but I testify from personal experience and deep assurance that the best possible investment of your time will be in being obedient to the promptings of the Spirit, doing what you know is right. It may have been more comfortable to stay in the hotel room in California, or it may have been less bother to not have taken the little orphan boy in--just as it may be more trouble to rear additional children or do without certain niceties, or it may be less interesting to go to a presidency meeting than to a movie. But again I testify that in all situations and at all times, the best investment we can make will be to do what we know is right and to follow the promptings of the Spirit.<br><br>My brothers and sisters, let's make wise investments! Let's serve willingly, let's forgive readily, let's be kind consistently. God will help us. We can eliminate anger from our lives. We can substitute love. We can develop love in our hearts. We can be kind to one another. I testify to you that our Father in Heaven loves us with all his heart. Jesus loves us with all his heart. They are kind to us. They live and are available to help us. They are the greatest investment counselors anywhere, and the price is right!<br><br>God lives! Jesus lives and is the head of this church! Joseph Smith is a prophet of God. The Book of Mormon with its priceless teachings is true. Spencer W. Kimball is the Lord's living prophet today. To this I testify in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>John H.

<h1>We Trust” - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Brothers and sisters, this really is a great privilege for me, and I pray that you and I might be united by the Spirit, that together we might be uplifted and rejoice in the beautiful things of the gospel. To begin my comments let me show you something I have here in my hand. It's a silver dollar from Las Vegas, Nevada, where I was born and raised. At the age of fourteen I used to carry thousands of these up and down Fremont Street to the various casinos there. In fact, at the age of fourteen, I was so important in the banking industry in Las Vegas that I had the key to the front door of every bank in the entire valley--both of them! The city has grown a lot since that time.<br><h2><b>Trust in the Lord</b></h2><br>On this silver dollar it says, "In God We Trust," and that is the theme that I would like to follow for my comments. In God we trust, and indeed we do. In fact, we must. Our salvation depends upon it. We trust Him even when we do not understand all of the things that may be happening about us or happening in our lives. One of the classic stories of the scriptures is the one about the woman of Canaan. She had a daughter seriously ill, and she approached the Savior asking that he would bless and heal her daughter. He did not respond. She then went to the apostles and pleaded with them. They apparently felt that she was bothering them because they went to the Savior and said, "Send her away for she crieth after us." She must have insisted again. This time the Savior answered, "I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel." She did not accept the negative response; she insisted some more. She worshiped Him, and the scriptures say she pleaded with Him, "Lord, help me." This time He answered, "It is not meet to take the children's bread and cast it to the dogs." She could have been offended at that. In fact, I imagine that she may have been. She may not have understood. It may have hurt her deeply. Yet, she trusted in the Lord so much that she replied, "Truth, Lord: yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their masters' table." The Savior answered, "O woman, great is thy faith. Be it unto thee even as thou wilt" (Matthew 15:21–28). And her daughter was healed from that very hour. But imagine the trust that she had in Him even when she did not understand why at first He was apparently not willing to help her.<br><br>I know a man in Bucaramanga, Columbia. Now if you don't know where Bucaramanga is, it's close to Barrancabermeja. He joined the Church about ten years ago, and, the first time the mission president came through that city, the mission president had the difficult job of telling his brother that he would not be able to occupy certain positions in the Church, nor would he be able to perform the ordinances of the Church. This good black brother was hurt, was offended, just like the sister of Canaan, yet he trusted in the Lord. Even not understanding, he remained faithful. Some eight years later the revelation (to give priesthood to all) was received. Last December I was assigned to go to Bucaramanga to form the first stake in that city. I was thrilled, I was inspired, I enjoyed that stake conference as few other spiritual occasions because, as I interviewed the various priesthood leaders of that stake, there was that moment of inspiration when I saw the mantle of the Lord descend upon Brother Insignares, that handsome black man, and he was called as the new stake president. It was a moment of great rejoicing to place my hands on his head and with that special authority ordain him a high priest and set him apart as the first stake president in Bucaramanga. He is a man whom I honor and respect highly. For many long years he trusted in the Lord even though he did not understand.<br><br>We should trust in the Lord even in disappointment, in discouragement, in moments when things seem to be going against us, in defeat. I think long ago we learned that the Lord does not answer all our prayers, and I think we learned that he does not answer all the prayers that we offer for athletic events, for victory in this, or to win that scholarship, or to get the job that we've been interviewing for. In these circumstances, where we have been praying and yet our dreams have not been fulfilled, we need to learn to trust in the Lord.<br><br>I think the most classical account illustrating this point is the great story of President Hugh B. Brown and the currant bush. There are several versions of this story, but let me tell it the way that I remember it from the time I translated it for President Brown in South America. He said that, when he was a young married man, he lived in a humble home, but he had a garden in front of the home that he was very proud of. This garden had a lawn and flowers; it had some shrubs and fruit bushes, and it had some trees, large trees for shade. One day he noticed the currant bush, which he had pruned to a certain shape in order to keep the majority of the strength of the tree in the roots and to produce good fruit, had lost its shape. Apparently several months had gone by without due attention to it, and it was sprouting irregular branches. He got the pruning shears and proceeded to cut back the branches of that currant bush. As he cut them, he seemed to hear the bush say to him, "Oh, don't do that, don't do that to me! Don't cut me back. I want to be tall and big like the shade trees. Let me grow!"<br><br>And he said, "No, my little bush, I'm the gardener here, and I want to prune you back to the size that I have decided is right for you."<br><br>A number of years later President Brown was a colonel in the British Forces in World War I in France. He was the ranking colonel of the Canadian forces. He had decided to make the military career his life's profession. He had studied hard; he had worked hard. He had had great success; he had been promoted and advanced. He was now colonel, and the next position would be general. In fact, he dreamed of being perhaps the first Mormon general since Book of Mormon days. A sudden vacancy occurred, and it was his turn to be promoted. He knew it, and yet they called him in and advised him that someone else was being promoted over his head. He wondered if it was because they had never had a Mormon general and probably were now deciding that they would not have a Mormon in that position of rank and authority. He returned to his tent, knelt by his cot, and cried to the Lord, "Why couldn't my prayers have been answered? I've been faithful to my covenants. I've been active in the Church. I've done all the things I should do to merit this promotion. It's been my ambition. There's no reason why I should have been denied this. Why couldst Thou not have answered my prayers?"<br><br>And then he seemed to hear a voice saying, "I'm the gardener here, and I'm going to prune you to the size that I want you to be in my garden."<br><br>Do we have the trust in the Lord that we can see His purposes fulfilled even in disappointment and in discouragement? Not to say anything against the military profession, of course, which is noble and honorable and much needed, but had President Brown followed that particular career, I doubt that he would have developed those characteristics, qualities, attributes, and skills which made him one of our greatest apostles, one of our greatest counselors in the First Presidency, one of the most eloquent orators that we ever have had in the Church.<br><h2><b>Trust in Leaders</b></h2><br>Another element of trust: trust in your leaders. There are many ways to illustrate this, but a story comes to my mind that I'm particularly close to. It appeals to me because it involves my dear wife's father. Brother Walser was one of the Mormon colonists in Mexico when this incident happened, and afterwards he was one of the witnesses, having spoken with one of the men who was with Pancho Villa at the time this little miracle occurred. Pancho was very much incensed at the intervention of the United States in internal Mexican political affairs. I'll not go into all of the details, but in retaliation he took his army across the border into Texas and proceeded to harass and burn and murder and so on. And then on returning into Mexico, he found the Mormon colonies directly in his path. He was angry; he was going to cause more trouble. The Mormon colonists knew that his army was approaching them, and they sensed the threat of danger, and so they met together. The bishop who was there with this particular group called all of the priesthood leaders together, and they discussed what they should do. Some said, "Well, we have our deer rifles and our shotguns. Let's defend ourselves." Another said, "No, let's take our wives and families and flee to the mountains." Another said, "Well, let's set up an ambush for them," or "Let's put dynamite in certain places" or let's do this, or let's do the other. There were different options. The bishop, a wise, humble man, facing several options that he felt he really was not competent to decide among, finally said, "I think we ought to go home, have prayers, turn out the lights, go to bed, and leave it in the hands of the Lord." Immediately there were some other discussions: "No, let's do this," and "No, let's do the other," and so on. Then one of the brethren stood up and said, "I'm going to follow the example of the bishop." Then another one did the same thing, and pretty soon they all went home, had prayers, turned out their lanterns, went to bed, and left it in the hands of the Lord.<br><br>Late that night Pancho Villa and his army arrived at the border of that little farming valley. He held up his hand, stopped the troops, and said, "Wait, there's an ambush. I can see the faint glimmers of fires all throughout the valley. The other army must have arrived here before we did." Others who were with him said, "No, we can't see anything." He disagreed strenuously with them and instructed the army to go around the valley and off in another direction. One of his guides was known to my father-in-law, who happened also to have been a guide for some of Pancho Villa's army in another case in which he was taken as a hostage and threatened with his life unless he led them through a pass which he knew because of his deer hunting experiences. He was one of several witnesses to that incident where the men around Pancho Villa said, "We can't see anything." The colonists had done nothing but Pancho Villa himself could see remains of fires in the valley, and he was certain there was an ambush there threatening him.<br><br>Let us trust in our leaders. Trust in our leaders can be lost very easily. In fact, let me illustrate how easily it can be lost with another situation. There was a young man with whom I grew up in a Mormon community. He was active the same way I was. His parents were active and strong, but there was a situation that developed in that home. After every Church meeting on the way home and at home in that little farming community, the parents played one of their favorite indoor games:<br><br>He would say, "Honey, did you notice that the bishop made a mistake? He had to be corrected by his counselor in that announcement."<br><br>And he would say, "Yes, and did you notice that the Sunday School superintendent made a mistake and announced the wrong hymn?"<br><br>And she would say, "Yes, and did you notice that the Sunday School teacher could have used better scriptures, and also got a little bit off the subject?"<br><br>Then she would say, "Did you notice so-and-so's hat?"<br><br>In the process they diminished the efforts of the people who were there. It didn't affect them. He went on to be called into the stake presidency. In fact, after that, I don't think they commented very much about other people's personal failings and weaknesses because they were then on the other side of the line. They later became temple workers. But that son--hearing the human frailties of the leaders--when he went into the service, when he continued his life, strayed far from the paths of the Church because he had not developed a full trust and respect for the leaders of the Church in spite of their human frailties.<br><br>Trust in your leaders. They are called by inspiration. None of them sought the positions which they hold. Not a one of them went through an ambitious process of progress through the ranks, trying to become a bishop or a stake president or a mission president. Trust in your leaders because in this Church no one has actually sought the position to which he or she was called, and all of them are doing the very best that they can.<br><h2><b>The Lord's Ways Not Ours</b></h2><br>Trust in the Lord even in the death of a loved one, parent, brother or sister, companion, child. We are not the ones to decide when it's the right time to pass through the veil to the next part of our eternal existence. We are the ones, though, who must trust in the Lord. The Holy Ghost really cannot accompany us, cannot give us consolation, cannot buoy us up in those times of difficulty if we are rebellious, and if we are disagreeing with the Lord. True it hurts; true there are the deep wounds, and we don't understand. Yet, our ways are not the ways of the Lord.<br><br>There's a story from Islam that I would like to repeat. I do not remember exactly where this story came from or how it was told originally. I heard it at a funeral many, many years ago. But I like the feeling that it gives to me in understanding the ways of the Lord. So without pretending to quote it exactly, let me tell you what I remember of that little story or parable. It seems that Moses wanted to accompany an angel who was being sent to the earth on an errand. Moses wanted to see what ministering angels do, and so he insisted that he ought to be allowed to accompany this angel. The angel said, "Thou couldst not stand what thou wouldst see." Moses insisted, and the angel, perhaps outranked (we don't know in this story), finally said, "As long as thou wilt remain silent no matter what thou seest." Moses agreed to that.<br><br>The angel led Moses down to earth and out over the ocean, where there was a small boat filled with humble fisherfolk. The angel broke the boards on the bottom of the keel, the boat sank, and they all drowned. Moses said, "Good heavens, what are you doing? What terrible thing is this!"<br><br>The angel said, "Did I not say thou couldst not stand what thou wouldst see?"<br><br>They went on further. The angel saw an Arab boy walking across the sands. He breathed upon him, his blood froze cold, and he fell to the earth lifeless. Moses said, "What foul deed is this?" He complained, objecting.<br><br>And the angel said, "Did I not tell you thou couldst not stand what thou wouldst see?"<br><br>They went on to another place where a humble widow and her two sons lived. The only thing they really had to survive on was a small garden of melons and cucumbers and various vegetables surrounded by an adobe wall. The angel pushed the wall over, smothering the vines and plants. Moses really exploded at this, complaining, objecting: "How terrible can these deeds be? What hire hast thou for this?"<br><br>And the angel said, "Thou couldst not stand with me; thou canst go no longer with me." Then he explained what he was doing lest Moses not understand the purposes of the Lord. He said, "There was a pirate coming from over the horizon who would have made those fishermen slaves, would have tortured them and stolen their boat, anyway. This way they went quickly and easily. With regard to the Arab boy, soon he would have killed a mother's son. This way he died guiltless, and the other son lives. The father of that little family, before his death, hid a treasure at the base of that wall. Now, as his wife and sons build it up again, they will find the hidden wealth and will prosper. But thou, thou couldst not stand the things which thou didst see. Thou canst go with me no longer."<br><br>Can we trust the Lord in all things, in all circumstances? Can we trust Him in matters of tithing, in doctrinal subjects that we do not yet understand, in history which perhaps is not totally explained and we do not see the other side of things? Can we trust Him in our patriarchal blessings? Can we trust Him in our mission calls, no matter what the destination? It may not be a romantic place to which we are sent, far away over the sea. It may not be a mission call which we are really anticipating, about which we are excited. Wherever the Lord sends you, you have a date with destiny. Someday you will know why you were sent to that mission, to those people, to that mission president, to those companions. The day will come. I'm remembering a case in South America where a missionary was sent from Sweden. To his surprise he found that he was assigned to a missionary, a local Chilean missionary, who was sending letters to the same city in Sweden where the Swedish missionary's parents lived. The two missionaries began comparing notes, and the Chilean missionary's parents were not members of the Church. They were exiled for political reasons, working in Sweden. The Swedish missionary's parents were members of the Church, active. The two missionaries combined their efforts so that the Swedish parents visited the Chilean parents and converted them. There was no indication anywhere when that missionary application came through that there would be a Chilean missionary whose parents were from the same city. Imagine the inspiration it required for the prophet to send him to Chile. Imagine that mission president's surprise when asked, "Why did you put them together?"<br><br>He replied, "Well, the Swedish companion needed a local Chilean's Spanish in order to develop his language ability."<br><br>There are many such circumstances. I don't have time to tell all the beautiful stories that illustrate that there is date with destiny for you in the mission field in the mission to which you are called.<br><h2><b>Character, Capacity, Capital</b></h2><br>I wish that this coin in my pocket--the one with "In God We Trust" on one side--had on the other side, "Can God Trust Me?" I spent almost twenty years in a profession learning how to trust people with money. Bankers develop a formula. One basic, simple formula we use to decide whether we can trust people with money consists of the three C's of credit: character, capacity, and capital.<br><br><i>Character</i>is pretty much the same in banking as it is in whatever formula the Lord would have. It's that decision about whether you can trust a person. If things are difficult for him when his loan comes due, will he do everything in his power to pay off the loan or will he hide, will he flee, will he declare bankruptcy unnecessarily?<br><br>I think part of our test here on the earth is for the Lord to decide if He can trust us with regard to all of the commandments. You have all probably heard the little story of the two young men from Utah studying at an eastern university. One of them noticed and mentioned to his companion, "These other fellows break all the commandments. They don't do the things we're doing, and yet their grades seem to be just about the same as our grades. I think I'll go out and do the things they're doing."<br><br>His companion said, "You can't do it."<br><br>His friend asked, "Why can't I?"<br><br>He replied "Because you know better. To do so, to break the commandments would be to break your character. It would be a character flaw in you to do so. That's why we can't do it; we know better."<br><br>President McKay said once,<br><br><i>Man's chief concern in life should not be the acquiring of gold or of fame or of material possessions. It should not be the development of physical prowess nor of intellectual strength, but his aim--the highest in life--should be the development of Christlike character.</i><br><br><i>Capacity</i>, the second of the three C's: We know that the Lord expects us to develop all our talents, to magnify them, to become instruments in His hands to do His work, to do all the things that can really enable us to serve Him better. Of course, a banker is not going to loan money to someone who is inexperienced, who does not have the ability to manage, to supervise. I never loaned money to anyone who could not show me a track record of financial success. Here is what I think the Lord is saying to us when we're talking about developing capacity. He says, "Be instructed more perfectly in theory, in principle, in doctrine," skipping a little bit in section 88 of the Doctrine and Covenants, verses 78 and 79:<br><br><i>Be instructed . . . in . . . things both in heaven and in the earth, and under the earth; things which have been, things which are, things which must shortly come to pass; things which are at home, things which are abroad; the wars and the perplexities of the nations, and the judgments which are on the land; and a knowledge also of countries and of kingdoms.</i><br><br>Why study all these things? Why study the disciplines that you are involved in? Here is the answer:<br><br><i>That ye may be prepared in all things when I shall send you . . . to magnify the calling whereunto I have called you, and the mission with which I have commissioned you.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 88:80]<br><br>Now, there are many skills which the Lord expects us to develop and in which He expects us to have great expertise. I think He expects us--in one of the greatest assignments of this mortal existence--to learn companionship--to be a great eternal companion to a wife or a husband. I think He expects us to learn all we can about proper fatherhood and motherhood. I think He expects us to understand everything that we can about homemaking, how to make a spiritual celestial existence in a home even in times of adversity, difficulty, rebellion of different members of the family as they go through the difficult teenage years--all of these things. I think the Lord expects us to learn to be a proper provider, to take care of ourselves and our family. I think the Lord expects us to learn missionary skills and to be able to preach the gospel all our lives. I think the Lord expects us to develop skills of management which would serve us in Church callings as well as in whatever our profession may be. People management, money management, delegation, the differences of administration, the diversities of operations, as the scriptures say--I think there are many, many things that the Lord expects us to develop as talents and gifts so that we might have the capacity which would enable him to trust us in any calling in life, any calling in the Church, or any circumstance.<br><br>I think the Lord expects us to develop<i>capital</i>. A banker does not loan to a client unless there is enough capital in reserve that, no matter what happens, the loan is relatively safe, and there are additional assets which can be used to satisfy the legal position of the banker. Now I think that the Lord looks at us in the same way and expects us to have a legal reserve in order to meet any circumstance, any crisis in life, any situation, without an emotional collapse that weakens us, without hiding, without running away.<br><br>One of my favorite stories about the attitude toward having a spiritual reserve to meet crises occurred in Salt Lake City. A number of years ago we came back to Salt Lake to live for a few years. I had almost always had my own aircraft in Latin America, but working for the Church one does not afford airplanes. So I was grounded for a while until a friend offered me his Cessna 320, a beautiful twin-engine aircraft with all the extras on it. At first I turned him down, and then he insisted and gave me the keys. I finally gave in. "Great," he said, "but on one condition: You have to pass the check ride that is necessary for the insurance." So I had to make an appointment with an authorized instructor to take this check ride. I tried to impress the instructor the first time I met him there at the side of the aircraft. I had my log books, and I explained all the hours of flying across the jungles of South America and the Andes--the experience I had in that type aircraft.<br><br>He said, "Wells, I've heard of you. I understand you have flown quite a bit in Latin America and that you did learn to fly in the navy and so on." But he said, "In my position"--and this is the important point of the whole story--"I have to assume that all those hours of flight occurred when nothing went wrong. Now you and I are going to fly this aircraft, and we'll see how well you can fly it when everything goes wrong!"<br><br>For the next hour and a half or so, we did a check ride in which he turned things off that should be on and turned things on that should be off. He distracted me, made me look over there and then cut the left engine. Or he'd look at something over here and say, "This engine is on fire. What are you going to do?" He would cover up the instruments and try to confuse me. At the end he made a statement that I took as a grudging compliment. He said, "All right, I'd let my wife and kids fly with you." He signed my log book, and I was accepted. In other words, he came to trust me because he could see the things I could do in an emergency situation.<br><br>Think of the trials of Job. I presume the Lord wanted to know how well Job could fly when everything went wrong. Do you and I have that kind of strength of spiritual reserve that we are emotionally self-sufficient? The Church preaches welfare self-sufficiency. Are we emotionally self-sufficient in all of the matters that occur in our lives so that we don't, as they say in Spanish, perder los estribos--we don't lose our stirrups, or "ride off in all directions at once"?<br><h2><b>Peace in Our Hearts</b></h2><br>I believe that the feeling that we have when our circumstances are in control, when we have so performed that the Lord can trust us, will be peace in our hearts. That's the promise of the Savior. He said, "These things I have spoken unto you, that in me ye might have peace. In the world ye shall have tribulation: but . . . I have overcome the world" (John 16:33). Do you remember the great scripture in John? It's much better in Spanish. "La paz os dejo, mi paz os doy. No como el mundo la da, yo os la doy." In English it goes, "Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, give I unto you" (John 14:27).<br><br>I believe that, as the Prince of Peace, He was not talking about the peace that you achieve with armies in the Falkland Islands or with air forces in Palestine. I think He was talking about the peace that we get when we live His commandments to the point that He can trust us in any circumstance. I believe fully that the relationship that needs to develop between ourselves and our Heavenly Father, between ourselves and our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, is that which can give us the kind of peace the early Christians had in their afflictions and tribulations, going across the sands of the arena when the lions were turned out on them. They went to their deaths singing hymns of praise to their Lord because they had peace in their hearts, knowing that their treasures were in heaven. They had so lived their lives that not only would the Lord trust them here, but He would have treasures in heaven for them when they arrived there.<br><br>Brothers and sisters, may we trust in God; may He be able to trust in each one of us. I testify to you that our Heavenly Father lives and loves us. He is in His heaven; He hears our prayers and He answers them. I also testify that Jesus the Christ is much more than the child, the infant in the manger, much more than that body nailed on the cross with the hand-wrought Roman nails. He lives, He is resurrected, He is glorified, He is exalted, He stand physically at the head of this church which bears His name. His spokesman here on the earth is our prophet, President Kimball. And everything that we're preaching, everything that we're teaching from Joseph Smith to President Kimball, from the preexistence to the life to come, all of the ordinances, all of the doctrines, is true. I pray most humbly that the Lord will bless each and every one of us that our lives will please Him above, doing so humbly in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Robert E.

<h1>e of Love - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
It's wonderful that no one ever recites your faults and failures when making an introduction. If they did, we might be here for some time. The music provided us this morning certainly would repay you all for coming here, whatever I may say. It was a marvelous performance. I compliment Sister Gneiting and Brother Staheli.<br><br>It's quite a feeling to stand at the devotional pulpit at BYU. I have sat where you sit, listened to my heroes, and thought about all the heroes who have stood here, Karl G. Maeser, Brigham Young, Spencer W. Kimball, and the other great people who have stood here. It cannot be anything but humbling to try to occupy a position which they have filled so well and so nobly. I do not flatter myself that I'm called by the Lord to stand here, but at least he did not prevent me from coming.<br><br>It's good you don't have to be perfect to talk about perfection, nor be Christlike to speak about Christ, or we would have few sermons from this pulpit.<br><h2><b>Sacrifice and Love</b></h2><br>I wanted to talk today about the relationship between sacrifice and love. At first I thought I'd call this talk "Sacrifice Is the Proof of Love." Then I thought, "Wait a minute. Maybe sacrifice produces love, so I ought to call it 'Sacrifice Is the Source of Love.'" I'm still not certain of the precise relationship, but I can tell you this: You can't have love without sacrifice. I don't mean someone's sacrificing for you so that you will love them. I mean you cannot love someone else or the Lord unless you pay the price. We find this truth in many scriptures--I'm not going to give you all of them--"God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son" (John 3:16), "If ye love me, keep my commandments" (John 14:15), "Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends" (John 15:13). You see how sacrifice and love are tied together here. "Whosoever . . . forsaketh not all that he hath, he cannot be my disciple" (Luke 14:33).<br><br>Let's think about the story of the young ruler, rich, accomplished, who came to the Savior, knelt at his feet, and said, "Master, what shall I do to become perfect?"<br><br>The Master replied, "Keep the commandments. Thou shalt not kill. Thou shall not commit adultery. Thou shalt not steal."<br><br>The young man said, "These have I kept from my youth up." Then the scripture says the Savior loved him, and he said, "If thou wouldst be perfect, go and sell all thou hath and come and follow me." The young man went away sorrowing "for he was very rich" (Luke 18:23; see Luke 18:18–23).<br><h2><b>Lincoln's Letter</b></h2><br>President Lincoln was informed by the Secretary of War that a certain Mrs. Bixby had lost five sons in the Civil War. He was moved and troubled by this immense, enormous loss that had come into her life. He wrote several drafts of a letter to her. Some of them are still in existence, and we can see the interlineations and changes. Finally, we have it as it was printed later:<br><br><i>I feel how weak and fruitless must be any words of mine which should attempt to beguile you from the grief of a loss so overwhelming. But I cannot refrain from tendering to you the consolation that may be found in the thanks of the Republic they died to save. I pray that our heavenly Father may assuage the anguish of your bereavement, and leave you only the cherished memory of the loved and lost, and the solemn pride that must be yours to have laid so costly a sacrifice upon the altar of freedom.</i>[Carl Van Doren, editor,<i>The Literary Works of Abraham Lincoln</i>(New York: Press of the Readers Club, 1942), p. 272]<br><br>Sacrifice. . . .He could see what we ought to see when we look at America: That it wasn't built up only out of resources and timber and coal and people that came here to escape their oppressive governments. It was built on the individual sacrifices of millions of people. When de Tocqueville came here to make his memorable tour and wrote about it, he was able to say, "America is great because she is good."<br><br>One wonders, as one looks around, "How long can this greatness last when so few seem to be willing to pay the price of sacrifice?" when 10 to 20 percent of the young men will not even fill out a registration for the draft, and they justify their refusal on grounds of conscience. I don't mean to be critical of those who choose not to fight because of the sincere conviction that fighting is morally wrong. I believe the American system can embrace diversities of belief on this subject, as on all others. But we need to ask ourselves, "How can we survive if we do not love . . . if we do not love our country, if we do not love one another, if we do not strive upwardly and pay whatever price it may cost to advance our society, our family, our religion?"<br><h2><b>Lark Mine</b></h2><br>I finished at BYU in the spring of 1955, at the end of the Winter Quarter (we had quarters then). I was not going into the Air Force for about three months so I looked around for something to do. I saw an ad in the paper that said they wanted people to work in the Lark Mine. I drove out there. The Lark Mine is underneath one of the mountains that surround the Kennecott Copper Mine. I was hired. I went into this mine, got on the little train with a bunch of other people who had hats with little lights on them and big heavy boots, and we went into the mountain for a long time. It must have been two, three, four miles. Then we got out and came to the shaft. The shaft had a little car in it that accommodated nine people if you scrunched up. It was on a cable, and it dropped you down that shaft at what seemed like a terrific rate of speed. We went down 4.000 feet below where we went into the mountain, and the car stopped--fortunately. We climbed out and onto another little train that took us out to what they called "the face," where the mining was being done. We got our shovels, and we shoveled all the ore that was lying there into cars, and the cars left. We started drilling holes in the face, and, when we got that done, we sat down and had a little bite to eat. After lunch, we pushed dynamite, several sticks, into each one of the holes we had drilled, and someone who knew what he was doing came around and put fuses in all of the holes so that it would blow the middle out first and then the sides so that it would work properly. Then we lit the fuses, got on the train, and headed back for the tunnel. All the fuses were lit at the same time at all the various faces, and, when we got back to where we were to go up the shaft, we could hear the explosions.<br><br>Now, that's not too important, I guess, except what I learned there. I met people there, men with five, six, seven, fourteen children, who were going every day into this black hole. I knew I was going to get out--into the Air Force, to fly a plane in the sun. But they, day after day, five days a week, year after year, suffered danger, unremitting toil, boredom, and for what? For those kids and that wife at home, to keep them out of the black hole.<br><br>That is sacrifice. Sacrifice is not paying your tithing or going to church on Sunday or filling a temple assignment, although those things are important. It's being somewhere you're needed, where you've got to serve when you'd rather be elsewhere or do something else. Don't you think those men would just as soon have sat on a mountain top playing a guitar and singing a few happy songs and not worrying about where the next meal was coming from or whether Johnny could get braces on his teeth? How about the wives? What sacrifice were they making? Do you think women choose as the highest of all intellectual accomplishment to take a master's degree in physics and go home and change a dirty diaper, cook a meal, sweep the floor, make the beds? You don't think that's sacrifice? Then you don't know what sacrifice is.<br><h2><b>Sacrifice, Love, and Faith</b></h2><br>In the thirteenth chapter of Hebrews and also in James, the second chapter, there are discourses about faith and how our forefathers proved they had faith. Some of the examples are the same in each chapter: Rahab the harlot, Abraham sacrificing Isaac, and Moses giving up all the riches of Egypt to be with his people. The scriptures list all the actions that prove these were sacrifices of faith. By their actions they proved that they loved the Lord, that there was nothing they would withhold from him.<br><br>I'd like to look at the sacrifice of Abraham for a minute. It seems easy when we read it on the page, you know. The Lord came and said to Abraham, "You've done all that I've asked you to do, and now I've got just one more thing I want you to do. Take your son Isaac, your only son, whom you love, and offer him as a sacrifice."<br><br>Can you imagine what Abraham felt? How long had he waited for Isaac to be born? The Lord promised him when he left his home in Ur, when he left Haran, when he came into the land of Israel, when he did each of the things the Lord asked--the Lord said, "You are going to have a posterity that will be numerous as the sands of the sea, and they will bless all nations, and through your lineage the Savior will come."<br><br>After a hundred years of waiting, finally the angel came to Abraham and said, "You're going to have a son." Even Sarah couldn't believe it because she was too old, long past the age of childbearing. After all these miracles and everything was fulfilled, and life was good--Abraham loved this boy with all his heart--the Lord came and said, "I'm going to take the thing you love the most."<br><br>Abraham gathered some wood and took his servants and his son (whom I take to have been either a teenager or in his early twenties). They went to the foot of the mount. He told the servants to remain, loaded the wood for the sacrifice on his son's back, and they began to ascend. Eventually, his son asked, "Dad, where's the animal for the sacrifice?"<br><br>Abraham couldn't answer. He said, "The Lord will provide the sacrifice."<br><br>They continued to ascend. Can you imagine the sacrifice that Isaac was willing to make? His father explained it to him. He didn't konk this hundred-year-old man on the head and say, "You're crazy; I'm going down the hill." He allowed himself to be bound and placed on the altar. He was willing to give the sacrifice of love as well and obey his father though it cost him his life. Finally, as the knife was upraised and started its decent, only then did the Lord say, "It's enough. You haven't withheld from me even your son."<br><br>It is hard in words to explain our deepest feelings. I've found sometimes in song and poetry we can get closer to the heart of meaning than we can express with words. I'd like to sing a song for you. This song is from the musical<i>Lost in the Stars</i>by Maxwell Anderson and Kurt Weill. It's based on the book,<i>Cry, the Beloved Country</i>by Alan Paton. This song is sung by an old black minister--Stephen Kumalo. He has gone to Johannesburg to try to find his son Absalom, who went to Johannesburg to work in the mines and hasn't returned. Stephen searches over the city for his son. As he is searching, he begins to hear about a crime. A white man has been murdered by some intruders. Irrationally, his anxiety about his son begins to be coupled with the fear that somehow his son is involved with this murder. His heart is full of prayers as he continues his search. Finally, he finds Absalom in prison, accused of the murder. His son says, "Father, I was wrong. I'm going to do no more evil. I'm not going to lie anymore." The father has been told that if his son doesn't join in a lie concocted by his accomplices, if he tells the truth, he will be hanged. And so the father, who has served the Lord all his days, finds himself in Abraham's dilemma. If he persists in the path of righteousness, his son will die. He walks out alone and calls upon the Lord, using the name that he has used since childhood, an African word for God,<i>Tixo</i>.<br><br>And so this song is called, "Oh Tixo, Tixo, Help Me." I will be accompanied by Carol Crist, who has very kindly volunteered to interrupt her day to help perform this music.<br><br><i>What have I come to here,</i><br><i>At this crossing of paths?</i><br><i>Must he tell a lie and live--</i><br><i>Or speak truth and die?</i><br><i>And, if this is so,</i><br><i>What can I say to my son?</i><br><i>O</i>Tixo, Tixo,<i>help me!</i><br><br><i>Often when he was young</i><br><i>I have come to him and said,</i><br><i>"Speak truly, evade nothing, what you have done</i><br><i>Let it be on your head."</i><br><br><i>And he heeded me not at all,</i><br><i>Like rain he ran through my hands,</i><br><i>Concealing, as a boy will, taking what was not his,</i><br><i>Evading commands.</i><br><br><i>For he seemed to hear none of my words;</i><br><i>Turning, shifting, he ran</i><br><i>Through a tangle of nights and days,</i><br><i>Till he was lost to my sight, and ran far into evil--</i><br><i>And evil ways,</i><br><i>And he was stricken--</i><br><i>And struck back,</i><br><i>And he loved, and he was desperate with love and fear and anger,</i><br><i>And at last he came</i><br><i>To this--</i><br><i>O God of the humble and the broken--</i><br><i>O God of those who have nothing, nothing, nothing--</i><br><i>To this--</i><br><i>To the death of a man!</i><br><i>To the death of a man!</i><br><br><i>A man he had given to death.</i><br><i>Then my words came back to him,</i><br><i>And he said, "I shall do no more evil, tell no more untruth;</i><br><i>I shall keep my father's ways, and remember them."</i><br><br><i>And can I go to him now</i><br><i>And say, "My son, take care,</i><br><i>Tell no truth in this court, lest it go ill with you here;</i><br><i>Keep to the rules, beware"?</i><br><i>And yet if I say again,</i><br><i>"It shall not profit a man</i><br><i>If he gain the whole world and lose his own soul,"</i><br><i>I shall lose Absalom then.</i><br><i>I shall lose Absalom then.</i><br><i>O</i>Tixo, Tixo,<i>help me!</i><br><i>O</i>Tixo, Tixo,<i>help me!</i><br><i>O</i>Tixo, Tixo,<i>help me!</i><br>["The Soliloquy,"<i>Lost in the Stars</i>(New York: William Morrow and Company, 1950). Reprinted in<i>The Great Musicals of the American Theatre</i>, vol. 2 (Philadelphia: Chilton)]<br><h2><b>Our Modern World</b></h2><br>Having talked briefly about the quality of sacrifice, the payment for love, I want to look at something of our modern world, where we're going, to see if we can find our way a little bit. It ought to be obvious that a young man who pretends to love in an effort to seduce cannot really love because, if he truly did, he would sacrifice what he wants for the good of the person beloved.<br><br>It follows that when we take an infant as, for example, I first took Jennifer, our oldest, helpless, unable to feed herself, clothe herself, clean herself, and work and spend all of our time for this child, moving her up from infancy, clothing her, working for her, with her, striving through a thousand different individual, family, and Church meetings, it follows that we will love her. It has to be so. And it turns out often that the most difficult child in the family is the most loved because the family has made the greater sacrifice for that child.<br><br>Of course, the child has to learn to love, too. And when he doesn't pay the price, doesn't serve, he doesn't learn to love. It seems that when we make an investment in something, we value it, we care for it. You remember old bromide, "When you've made a bad bargain, hug it all the tighter." We do that.<br><br>The first time I knew how my father felt about me was when I took my baby Jennifer in my arms, and I said to myself, "Dad held me like this. Dad felt the feelings I feel." Then I thought, "Why, why didn't I know this? Why didn't I tell him how much it meant to me?"<br><br>There was a recent court case called "Infant Doe." It took place in a midwestern state. Infant Doe--you notice how lawyers tend to divorce all passion, all emotion and meaning from things--calling him "Infant Doe." This little child had parents with names. I guess he himself never got a name, though. He was born a mongoloid child, retarded, but no one knows how severely. You do not find out the degree of severity until the child gets older.<br><br>Infant Doe also had a correctable physical defect. His esophagus was not connected to his stomach, and he couldn't eat. So the doctor said, "We'll go in, do an operation, and connect the esophagus to the stomach. It's a serious operation, but it can be done."<br><br>The parents said, "Wait a minute. This child is retarded. It would be better if he didn't live, so we don't want you to perform this operation." And, of course, the doctor could not operate without their consent.<br><br>Some well-meaning people said, "We'll go to court and get an order that forces them to let the child have the operation." They went to court, and, to the disgrace of the American judicial system, the court said, "We cannot order this."<br><br>So Infant Doe died. What was his crime to deserve capital punishment? He was retarded. What was it his parents didn't want? "It would have been inconvenient," their lawyer said. "It would have been inconvenient to raise this child. This child wouldn't have the same quality of life others have." What do we know about quality of life? Does a bird have no quality of life because it doesn't think like a man? No, it is a finished work as the God of heaven intended and its life has all the quality God assigned to it.<br><br>What do we know about a retarded child's quality of life unless we can be that child? Many retarded children are happier and more loving than the so-called "normal child."<br><br>We cannot know what Infant Doe's quality of life might have been, but we do know the difference between life and death. So his parents never made the sacrifice that would have taught them to love Infant Doe. Thoreau said that every deed goes into the great sea of cause and effect and remains there throughout eternity. Who knows what effect that one death has on the quality of life of all the people in this generation and those to come?<br><br>It's like Ray Bradbury's story of the time traveler who goes back to the Paleolithic era, blunders off the path, and steps on a butterfly. When the traveler returns to his own time, everything is changed for the worse because that one insect life was terminated prematurely.<br><br>I read an interview with a lady who was suing her doctor because he did not tell her about amniocentesis, and therefore, she was not able to learn in advance that her baby was a mongoloid child and destroy the child through abortion. In the interview she said, "I'm happy that I know Tommy, but I would also have been happy if I hadn't known him." I wonder if that is true. I wonder how long the reverberations of destroying that life might have followed her, had she done it. There comes a time when you must pay the price, the sacrifice of love. How lucky she was to get the chance to pay it.<br><br>I was looking at an article in the<i>Wall Street Journal</i>about something called "values clarification" that's been taught in our schools for about ten years. I don't mean in Provo schools, but in schools throughout the country. Values clarification says that there really is not any right or wrong or good or bad. Values are what we say they are. And, therefore, we should not be imposing on children our moral standards and beliefs. They ought to invent their own moral standards and beliefs. They ought to experiment. They are saying that society should not tell you whether premarital sex is wrong or right or whether you ought to use drugs. You make up your mind after you have examined it for yourself. And so some thirteen-, fourteen-, fifteen-year-old child, not having the benefit of the experience of older and, hopefully, wiser heads, is making up a set of values and acting on those values. Whenever their parents say, "What you're doing is wrong," he or she will say, "You can't tell me that. That's your value judgment, not mine." No wonder John Taylor gave us such cautions about the kind of people we would choose to educate our children. Without sacrifice of desires and appetites for a higher good, what will our society consist of? What character or quality can result from self-indulgence and sloth?<br><br>A book could be written on the subject of sacrifice and love, probably has been.<br><br>I would like to encourage us to see the joy of love and sacrifice, to find in the things that come to hand--the work that must be done--the things that apparently the Lord assigns us whether we want them or not--situations where we can create love.<br><h2><b>"Vaunteth Not Itself"</b></h2><br>True love is not what the world calls love. The word has been cheapened and destroyed along with many other once-beautiful words. When the world talks of love, it means living together without benefit of marriage or extra-marital sex or something equal far from the love born of sacrifice. That's not what the Lord means by love. Maybe that's why the word<i>charity</i>was selected by the translators of the King James Version in the book of Corinthians. Remember what it says about love--charity, the perfect love of Christ--the love Christ has for us: "Charity suffereth long and is kind. . . . Charity vaunteth not itself" (in other words, doesn't advertise itself). Charity "is not puffed up" (1 Corinthians 13:4). (Charity isn't pride because pride is a love of self, not of others!) All these qualities of love come through paying the price, through service, through sacrifice.<br><br>When Oliver Wendell Holmes was invited to address the fiftieth reunion of his Harvard class of 1861, he thought back to the days when he was in the Twentieth Massachusetts Volunteers, a child soldier serving in the Civil War. He told his class what he learned from that service.<br><br><i>I learned in the regiment and in the class the conclusion, at least, of what I think the best service we can do for our country and for ourselves: To see so far as one may and to feel the great forces that are behind every detail . . . to hammer out as compact and solid a piece of work as one can, to try to make it first rate, and to leave it unadvertised</i>. [Irving Dilliard, Introduction to<i>The Spirit of Liberty</i>by Learned Hand (New York: Knopf, 1960), p. v]<br><br>If we would just pay those prices, we would learn to love BYU and we would make something of ourselves. Every time I see one of the athletes, particularly professional athletes, who does something really sensational then leads the cheering as he goes around the stands, jumping and leaping, I think about Oliver Wendell Holmes and his doing a compact job of work and leaving it unadvertised. Sacrifice of pride will inevitably create character. "Charity vaunteth not itself.'<br><br>I don't want to leave the impression, however, that I think life ought to be a dismal surrender of every good thing to the Lord. The Lord doesn't need our things. He doesn't need even our service. In fact, he told the Jews on one occasion, when they were boasting about being children of Abraham, that he could make children of Abraham out of the rocks on the ground. He doesn't need what we give. We need to give.<br><br>When President Joseph F. Smith wrote to one of his boys on a mission, he pointed out the joy of sacrifice.<br><br>"You speak, my precious boy"--I wish I could talk to my boys like that. My boys would really think I had flipped my lid if I called them "precious," "darling," or something like that, but he writes to them that way--<br><br><i>You speak, my precious boy, of the "sacrifice" I am making in providing for my boys and for my family. Do you know what "sacrifice" means? Let me tell you. If after all I am doing or can do for the welfare and happiness of my loved ones, they should turn their backs upon me, should deny the Faith, go to the bad, or bring disgrace or sorrow upon themselves or me or my family, then indeed would my labor of love become a sacrifice. But if my children will continue to love me, be true to themselves and therefore to me and to our God, O! then there is no sacrifice tho' it cost all my worldly things and my life to boot. It will be all gain, all profit</i>. [Hyrum M. Smith III and Scott G. Kennedy, editors,<i>From Prophet to Son: Advice from Joseph F. Smith to His Missionary Sons</i>(Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1981), p. 98]<br><br>I pray the Lord of heaven will give us the opportunity to profit in that way and through our sacrifices learn to love as he does. May we, through our sacrifices learn happiness, joy, and love, I ask in Jesus' name. Amen.<br><br><i><i>H.

<h1>ces . . . “Allow All Men the Same Privilege” - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
<h2><b>Differences in People</b></h2><br>One of my earliest childhood memories is of my father, who was a blessed peacemaker, settling disputes in our family by using a Samoan saying he had learned on his mission in the South Seas a few years before: "Asi, asi paco", he would say (I'm sure my mother and my brother remember it), which he said meant literally, "Ducks are different" or in other words, "Each of us is unique; be tolerant. People<i>are</i>different but that's not necessarily bad." I feel certain that this oft-repeated experience with my father was the beginning of my understanding about differences in people.<br><br>A learned truth is like a magnet, pulling related ideas to itself. Our lives become collections of such ideas which solidify into principles we live by. Eventually those earliest ideas become responses. The genuine responses of our lives reflect our souls' growth.<br><h2><b>Responses to Criticism</b></h2><br>Recently I listened to President Gordon B. Hinckley apply the same principle my father had taught, and the magnet in me responded. He said:<br><br><i>We live in a society that feeds on criticism. Faultfinding is the substance of columnists and commentators, and there is too much of this among our own people. It is so easy to find fault, and to resist doing so requires much of discipline . . . .</i><br><br>He went on to say:<br><br><i>The enemy of truth would divide us and cultivate within us attitudes of criticism which, if permitted to prevail, will only deter us in the pursuit of our great, divinely given goal. We can not afford to permit it to happen.</i>["Five Million Members--a Milestone and Not a Summit,"<i>Ensign,</i>May 1982, p. 46]<br><br>How should we respond in these ambiguous times as we are faced with such daily criticism and hostility in the world? And, how should we respond to the everyday frictions and failings in our own lives?<br><br>I would like to suggest that part of the answer can be found in two phrases in our own Articles of Faith. The title for my remarks today was taken from the eleventh article of faith and is, I'm sure, familiar to you:<br><br><i>We claim the privilege of worshiping Almighty God according to the dictates of our own conscience, and</i>allow all men the same privilege,<i>let them worship how, where, or what they may.</i><br><br>"We allow all men the same privilege". We could define that as<i>tolerance</i>or the idea that my father wanted me to understand.<br><br>The second phrase inspires me, lifts me, and is related to the first. I wonder how many of you have ever thought of it by itself, tucked away as it is in the lofty thirteenth article of faith:<br><br>"We believe . . . in doing good to<i>all</i>men." We could define this as<i>compassion</i>, or the Savior's kind of love. I see "doing good to all men" a step beyond "allowing all men the same privilege." My contention is that tolerance leads to compassion and that there are no shortcuts to Christlike love which can bypass tolerance.<br><h2><b>Differences May Separate Us</b></h2><br>Our common problem could be defined as<i>intolerance</i>or<i>self-righteousness,</i>other words for the faultfinding and criticism President Hinckley described. Why<i>are</i>you and I critical and intolerant of those around us? Let's be honest. Sometimes we're jealous. They have what we want. Do the following critical statements sound familiar?<br><br>"He's boring, always in the books, gets in the nineties on every exam."<br><br>or<br><br>"She's engaged. What a flirt! I wonder if she'll really make it to the altar!"<br><br>or<br><br>"He's just a big dumb athlete. He's broken a few records, but I bet he doesn't ever show up for class."<br><br>But we're not always jealous when we're critical. So why do we find fault? I suggest it's because of those differences my father pointed out to me. We separate ourselves by the differences we see. We feel comfortable with those who dress the way we do, think the way we do, act the way we do; and uncomfortable with those who are different. Physical differences are one example of our discomfort. How do you feel around a person with a conspicuous birthmark, a missing limb, a spastic condition which causes jerky muscle movement, a blind person, or someone confined to a wheelchair? Of course, you'd never criticize such a person, but would you put forth the effort to get past the difference to establish a warm relationship? The gospel teaches us that the eternal in our natures provides kinship that no physical differences, including age, should undermine. How well I remember, when I was 35, the tender moment when a lovely 82-year-old woman whom I had idealized told me she prized me as her friend. Foolishly I had never seen friendship bridging the so-called age barrier in that way.<br><h2><b>Differences That Don't Matter</b></h2><br>Some differences, like the physical ones I've just noted, don't matter at all and should never divide us. Cultural differences also fall into this category. We are a worldwide church and represent many different cultures. We cannot afford lapses into provincialism.<br><br>Much of what I know I have learned from watching and listening to those older and wiser and<i>younger and wiser</i>than myself whom I have lived near enough to see and hear up close. As a young bride, newly arrived in Cambridge, Massachusetts, I was experiencing some cultural shock. In those days Boston billed itself as<i>the</i>hub of culture which included the Cabots and Lodges and their associates. That dates me just a little bit if you know when those people had any influence in Boston. My husband suggested that I not keep mentioning how old I am, but I'm fifty years old. I'd like you to know that right to begin with. I think that lends some credence to my experiences. In our first Relief Society meeting in a little old house on Brattle Street, I listened as a strong, faithful, wise woman (a long-time resident) implored us:<br><br><i>Now don't you Utah girls come here and hold your noses for four years wishing you were back in the only true West where things are done right! Absorb this wonderful culture. Learn New England cookery, get to know your Yankee neighbors; that may take some patience, but it's well worth it. Catholics are people. Take the subway over to the Esplanade and hear the Boston Symphony, free, this summer. Do it; then you, as well as your husbands, will have something to take home.</i><br><br>I believed her. It changed my responses. It has changed my life. When our four years were over, my husband brought home a Ph.D., and I came back loving New England: speech patterns, seafood, Catholics, and all. She taught me about differences and a most impressive lesson on tolerance. I learned that tolerance can lead to love--a lesson I was able to apply recently living among the Jews in Israel.<br><h2><b>From Tolerance to Love</b></h2><br>Tolerance leads to love. Most of our 30,000 missionaries serving throughout the world would bear testimony of that. As would the thousands who have returned. What an inspired program, sending us as missionaries all over the world where we confront personally different languages, often different dress, different customs, and different food. We arrive as strangers and foreigners, uncomfortable and very much aware of differences, but with a precious message of restored truth to deliver. That message motivates us to look beyond the differences, and, as we teach these strangers who they are, the children of our Heavenly Father, our own brothers and sisters in an eternal family, differences give way to kinship. Take for an example the last missionary you heard report--or the next one.<br><br>The positive effect of our worldwide commitment to missionary service is demonstrated in my own family. My father served three years in Samoa. I grew up loving the Samoan people, their customs, their food, and their language. My brother served in Alaska. Our son served in Germany. Our daughter served in Argentina. My husband and I served in New England. We've also spent much time in Israel and had extended visits to Yugoslavia, Taiwan, and Hong Kong. So in two generations my family has been all over the world, delivering a message but also bringing home a message of kinship and love for many peoples. Do you think Samoans, Alaskans, Germans, Argentines, Israelis, Yugoslavians, Chinese are welcome in our homes? I wish you could see in your mind's eye, as I can, dear Sini Salanoa, our Samoan brother, his first time away from his beloved islands, a half a world away, as he asked us in his broken English to "be his family" while he was stationed in Boston in 1953. Or beautiful, little, fourteen-year-old Julie Wang whom we met in K'Liao, a tiny fishing village in Taiwan. She described her encounters with our Heavenly Father, in her quiet Chinese manner. Her early prayers began, with sweet familiarity, "Hello, God, this is Julie Wang." When I heard her say that, I had the feeling that I was going to hear the response immediately. She taught me things about prayer that I had never known before. Or fine, spiritual, clear-eyed Gunther Mayer from Germany, who joined our family for scripture study on Sunday evenings all last year. They represent many who have enriched our lives. Somehow we see no divisive differences. Our commitment to the gospel becomes the great common denominator. We know whose we are, all of us.<br><h2><b>Differences That Do Matter</b></h2><br>That knowledge also helps us in relationships where there are differences that do matter. Some differences matter mightily. Such differences include those involving value, principle, truth, and the confirming religious experience which we call testimony. Truth demands our allegiance, but to accept and love others, we need neither adopt their ideas nor be condescending. We can be strong in testimony, shining with that light which cannot be hid. When others differ from us in these essential matters, we must learn to see with eyes that separate people from their traditions and/or sins. Mistaken beliefs may be held by good people. Joseph Smith said, "It does not prove that a man is a bad man because he errs in Doctrine" (Andrew F. Ehat and Lyndon W. Cook (eds.),<i>The Words of Joseph Smith</i>[Provo, Utah: Religious Studies Center, Brigham Young University, 1980], p. 184).<br><br>Our daughter Mindy has become an expert at seeing people separate from their worldly overlay. She sees the good in a person where no one else seems able to recognize it. We were moved when she wrote home from Argentina early in her mission, "What an interesting eye-opener to realize, as a missionary, that the people you teach are better than you are"--a far cry from the innocent young elder who served with us in New England who hesitated to teach a family because the father smoked. We must learn to separate people from their failings.<br><br>Having truth in our possession, the knowing of righteous and true principles, does not automatically make us better people. Just because we have the truth available to us, we must not make the mistake of believing ourselves more righteous than others. It could have that effect, but it is living what we know, not knowing alone, that makes us better. Joseph Smith taught us:<br><br><i>All the religious world is boasting of righteousness: it is the doctrine of the devil to retard the human mind, and hinder our progress, by filling us with self-righteousness. The nearer we get to our Heavenly Father, the more we are disposed to look with compassion on perishing souls; we feel that we want to take them upon our shoulders and cast their sins behind our backs. . . . If you would have God have mercy on you, have mercy on one another.</i>[<i>Teachings,</i>p. 241]<br><br>In another wise statement, the Prophet Joseph cautioned us, "The devil flatters us that we are very righteous, when we are feeding on the faults of others" (<i>Teachings,</i>p. 241). And in another place, "There is no salvation in believing an evil report against our neighbor" (Alma P. Burton (ed.),<i>Discourses of the Prophet Joseph Smith,</i>[Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1965], p. 203).<br><br>Are we strong enough in our own testimony and commitment to live the truths we know? Is it not sometimes our own weakness that frightens us into discounting others? Hugh Nibley has said with penetrating insight, "A shabby substitute for repentance is finding someone wickeder than oneself" (My notes on Hugh Nibley's Isaiah lecture, Sperry Symposium, January 1978). It's so true that it resonates.<br><br>Is it integrity to stand on a supposed height and play in our lives the game we played as children, "I am the man on Bunker Hill"--pushing and shoving down those around us--thinking in real life that somehow, if others are less, we are more?<br><br>What are we afraid of?<br><br>The truth is we are children of God, and our fellow beings in and out of the Church are our actual brothers and sisters. The gospel teaches us not to condemn those brothers and sisters for their weaknesses and sins but to show them by our lives how it is possible to escape sin through learning and living the truth, giving away our sins to know God.<br><br>We must secure our own testimonies by living the truths we have been given. Then we will not be frightened by our own lack of strength into prejudice and narrow-heartedness.<br><br>At the BYU Women's Conference this year, Commissioner Hal Eyring gave a keynote address entitled "The Rope." In it he suggested a powerful metaphor. We are like mountain climbers. We are bound to each other as children of God. I thought as he spoke how the devil must laugh as we push each other down by our fault-finding criticism, our name-calling, our labeling, when part of our purpose in coming here was to learn to lift each other up.<br><h2><b>Dangers in Negative Labeling</b></h2><br>The temptation to label is ever present. Labeling shrinks our capacity for genuine understanding of and love for the people involved.<br><br>It seems to me it is dangerous to negatively label any person. Such labels often become indelible and nearly impossible to remove. I often think of the eleven-year-old boy I taught in Primary many years ago. He had been labeled "troublemaker, incorrigible," but, as I came to know him, I found the labels were wrong. They should have been "bright, quick, ahead of everyone." He had been bored because he knew all the answers. He had only to be challenged. Do we allow a brother or sister to change, to repent, or do we keep the label firmly in place--after it has become meaningless?<br><br>Some negative labels which can seriously wound and estrange are as follows: fat/skinny, feminine (if it's a boy)/masculine (if it's a girl), worldly/naïve--you'll notice that some of these are exact opposites of each other. Yet, we label each other with opposites. If one is good, is the other bad? If one is bad, is the other good? Strange, isn't it?--liberal/conservative, Utah Mormon/California Mormon, non-Mormon (some Presbyterian friends once told us they hated being referred to as non-Mormons. Think of it. How would you feel to be a Presbyterian--and be labeled as a<i>non</i>-Mormon? I promised them then I'd take time to mention a denomination rather than to lump everyone as non-us from then on), jack-Mormon, out of the Church, almost out of the Church, druggie, gentile--another word for other than Mormon, a confusing label when we have Jewish friends. We are gentiles to them while they are gentiles to us. Most of them take that in very good spirits, but I can imagine that some would not because gentile to them is a much worse label than it is to us, partly, I suppose, because of what the gentiles have done to them historically--egghead/ business man, white collar/blue collar.<br><br>And then there are the kinds of labels that are a little insidious that are just found in phrases that we use about each other. For instance, about the couple in your ward who are childless or who have only one or two children: "They must be selfish--they don't have a large family." I suffered under that one a little bit. We could not have any more children after our third, and it always hurt me in meetings to hear people refer to their nine and ten children and then to ask me how many children I had with a look in their eye that told me they wondered why I didn't have more. I wondered why I didn't have more, too. No one ever prayed any harder or wanted children any more than I did. The label was difficult for me at times.<br><br>I'm sure that you could add to this list. This list could go on for pages and pages, but there isn't time for that. Think sometimes when you refer to other people in your life, "Am I labeling? Am I putting on them a burden that they don't deserve?"<br><br>Note how labels polarize and pull people apart. Each of these labels can be used as a put-down and will effectively block further understanding of the persons involved as related members of an eternal family.<br><br>Positive labeling may have its advantages, but let's try to look at people without negative labels, leaving everyone room to change and improve, even ourselves. Sometimes the labels we attach to ourselves are the hardest to remove: "I'm just shy, or dumb, or thoughtless, or forgetful, or hot-tempered, or useless." You can add to the list. It isn't hard to think of the negative things that you label yourself. It is a little harder sometimes to think of the positive that you can supply for your own strength.<br><br>Such put-downs make me my own worst enemy--when surely, as I seek salvation, I need all the help I can get, and I can't expect others to encourage me if I won't even encourage myself. Why not be your own best friend?<br><h2><b>Our need for Each Other</b></h2><br>We are like climbers. "Man must live on the summit to avoid the abyss," said Abraham Joshua Heschel (<i>The Prophets,</i>vol. 1 [New York, NY.: Harper and Row, 1969], p. 16). We must move ever higher but not stepping on others to get our footing. The moment we've found a handhold or foothold of truth, we must mark it well and reach out to those behind or below that they may find it, too. Remember what Joseph Smith said:<br><br><i>The nearer we get to our Heavenly Father, the more we are disposed to look with compassion on perishing souls; we feel that we want to take them upon our shoulders and cast their sins behind our backs.</i><br><br>That is the way of Christ. Can we learn His responses? Did He distance himself from sinners?<br><br>In addressing the Relief Society on June 9, 1842, Joseph Smith said:<br><br><i>Christ said he came to call sinners to repentance, to save them. Christ was condemned by the self-righteous Jews because He took sinners into His society: He took them upon the principle that they repented of their sins. It is the object of this society to reform persons, not to take those that are corrupt and foster them in their wickedness: But if they repent, we are bound to take them, and by kindness, sanctify and cleanse them from all unrighteousness by our influence in watching over them. . . . Nothing is so much calculated to lead people to forsake sin as to take them by the hand and watch over them with tenderness.</i>[<i>Teachings,</i>p. 240]<br><br>Recently I heard of an excommunicated man who stormed out of his Church court bitter and unrepentant. Many of us, if we had been in that court, would have said, "Good. He'll have time now to make his peace." And we would have thought, "Good riddance." One of the high councilors present that night spent three evenings a week for the next several years visiting this man until, mellowed, repentant, and regenerated, he was reinstated in the Church. As the Prophet Joseph Smith has said, "Nothing is so much calculated to lead people to forsake sin as to take them by the hand and watch over them with tenderness."<br><br>What should my response be to the excommunicant, recent or of long-standing? Or the young unwed mother? Or the Mormon boy, or any boy, of missionary age fighting a drug or alcohol problem? Interestingly enough, these examples are taken out of my own experience, and I am sure out of yours. You can all find people in each of these categories and many others. Why not this response from Isaiah 1:18–19?<br><br><i>Come now, and let us reason together, saith the Lord: though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow. . . .</i><br><br><i>If ye be willing and obedient, ye shall eat the good of the land.</i><br><br>It is one of the most beautiful messages of the gospel and sometimes a well-kept secret.<br><br>And what is your response upon meeting a Catholic, a Jew, a Moslem, a Hindu, a Jehovah's Witness? I just have to stop to say this. Two young, beautiful Jehovah's Witnesses knocked on our cabin door last week. You have to understand that our cabin is far off the beaten track. As I was preparing this address, they knocked on the door. And you'd be surprised what my response was--or maybe you wouldn't be surprised. I've learned a lot by thinking on these things. What would your response be on meeting an atheist brother or sister? Could we apply the counsel given to Lyman Sherman in D&amp;amp;C 108:7?<br><br><i>Therefore, strengthen your brethren in all your conversation, in all your prayers, in all your exhortations, and in all your doings.</i><br><br>It always amazes me how the scriptures and the prophets use the word<i>all</i>. It doesn't leave much room for exceptions.<br><h2><b>Our Enemies</b></h2><br>But lastly, what of those who define themselves our enemies? For example, those who wear away their lives publishing and promoting anti-Mormon materials? The scriptures are clear: we must pray for them. Do we instead, in the face of organized opposition, mount our high horse to return jab for jab, becoming (if you'll pardon the label) an anti-anti-Mormon, spending our strength jousting abroad while the cause of truth begs for champions and the positive work of the kingdom waits? Our charge is to teach the nations, and, even if they reject our teachings, the love we have extended should never be withdrawn. Our ultimate response to those who suppose themselves to be our enemies must be to love them. I remember at this point when the Savior said, "By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to another" (John 13:35). Otherwise, how will we be recognized by those not of our faith?<br><br>If we can learn patience, allowing all men the same privilege of seeking truth at their own pace, we will have moved measurably toward the compassion and love of the Savior, who saw no enemies among His crucifiers. His example stands for all time to teach us the tender path from tolerance to compassion and perfect love. With every provocation to rage against His adversaries, He said rather, "And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto me" (John 12:32), thus offering Himself on our behalf, that we might have room to repent.<br><br>Can we do less for our Father's farflung family?<br><br>It is my testimony that the people of the world are our brothers and sisters. Whether they understand what we believe, we can understand what they believe, and we can be a bright example of testimony, and they can, just by knowing us, feel the love that we have learned to give freely in the way that the Savior taught us. I pray that we may have the courage and the strength and the testimony to do that, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Ann N.

<h1>e Armor of God - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I am humbly grateful tonight to have the opportunity to stand before this great audience. I am subdued. The power of the spirit that comes forth from you humbles me. I am aware that without the Lord's help one really can't do anything. I've prayed that he bless me, and I've prayed that he bless you because much of what will happen here tonight will be dependent upon the spirit that comes through you and from you. I've found over the years that, when people come seeking, with their cups up, and the Lord's Spirit works through them, it's much easier to bring the message. So I hope there will be a prayer in your heart that the Lord will help us, that your time will not be wasted.<br><br>I am excited tonight to see these wonderful missionaries assembled here. There are about 1,800, President Christensen said. That's about the number that I supervise now in the eastern part of the United States, but I have never had them all together like this. I am aware of the special spirit they have as they are set apart. There are many returned missionaries here too, so it is a humbling experience to be here with you tonight.<br><h2><b>A Great Day</b></h2><br>I am grateful to have an opportunity to raise my voice as a witness for the Lord Jesus Christ. This is really a great day to live. It is exciting to know the things the Lord is doing. It is exciting to see him moving to establish his work in the earth. I don't know whether you are aware of it or not, but we're still a very small minority when you realize that there are between four and five billion people in the world, and we have just reached the five million mark, which means that we're one-tenth of one percent of the world's population. The odds would be against us if it were not for the fact that nothing is too hard for the Lord. But because he is there and nothing is too hard for him, with his help we can carry this message to the ends of the earth.<br><br>In the presence of you wonderful young people, I am reminded tonight that the Lord is now sending some of the finest spirits that have ever come to earth. As I go about and meet the missionaries and others across the earth, I find that they are superior to the generation that I was born in. I salute you. I would like you to know that we are proud of you. More than that I hope you feel our love and respect for you. We are grateful that you are here, and we are eager to do all we can to assist you and to help you in this task that the Lord has set before us.<br><br>This day we live in is really a great day. It is different from other days. Elias the prophet spoke about the restoration of all things. He meant not only the power and authority of the gospel, but also the restoration of all the evil that has been in the earth. Can you see what a challenge we have as we come now to the wind-up scene? The war in heaven was not won there. All that has been done is to change the location of the battlefield, and it has been transferred down here.<br><br>What an honor, what a privilege to you wonderful young people to think that the Lord had confidence enough in you that he would allow you to come in this day! This will be the only time in the history of the Church in the years that the earth has been in existence that it will not have been thrown down or given to another people. The Lord spoke through Daniel and said he would cut a little stone out of the mountain without hands, and it would roll forth until it filled the whole earth. And it would not be thrown down or given to another people (see Daniel 2:31–45). I feel, myself, with the help of the Lord and with those he is sending in this day, that is possible.<br><br>So you who are of the first team, you are the elect of God. I address you tonight and say that you have a heavy responsibility upon you. There are many who are counting on you not to fail. The Lord has said, "Of him unto whom much is given much is required" (D&amp;amp;C 82:3). Many have given much that we could be here and have what we have.<br><h2><b>Our Heritage</b></h2><br>This past week Sister Reeve and I have had the opportunity to spend some days where the Church was organized. We were back at the pageant. We were in the Sacred Grove. You can't be in that sacred place and not know that something special happened there. The feeling that's there, unless you're totally insensitive to the Spirit, lets you know that you are on holy ground, just as Moses must have felt when he approached the burning bush, when the Lord said to him, "Put off thy shoes from off thy feet, for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground" (Exodus 3:5).<br><br>I am glad that Joseph Smith did not fail. When I study the challenges he had to face, I'm grateful that he had the strength he did and that he had the trust he had in the Lord. How would we have felt about him if he had failed? How would we have felt if the pioneers had failed? I never fly from Salt Lake back across those plains but what I picture those men and women struggling across that 1,100 or 1,200-mile expanse, feet bleeding, short of food, not knowing for sure where they would be the next day, crossing rivers without a bridge. We have had a little taste of it. We know what it is to be in the desert. I have been in some of those areas where you don't have to irrigate. The water comes down automatically, and all you have to do is harvest the crop after you've planted it. I imagine there were those who had second thoughts when they came here where little grows unless you pour the water on it. I'm grateful that they didn't fail. Many noble men and women have made it possible for us to have the blessings we have.<br><br>Just three years ago the Prophet of God spoke to the Church and said, "The Church is at a point in its growth and maturity when we are at last ready to move forward in a major way" ("Let Us Move Forward and Upward,"<i>Ensign,</i>May 1979, p. 82). All those years before we have been trying to gather enough strength. It took a hundred years to get the first one hundred stakes. Joseph Smith, Brigham Young, John Taylor, Lorenzo Snow, Wilford Woodruff, Joseph F. Smith, and for part of the time Heber J. Grant never presided over more than one hundred stakes. In 1930 the hundredth stake was organized. During the time since President Kimball became the Prophet on 30 December 1973 and now, in 1982, there have been more than 722 stakes organized--in less than nine years. There were 630 when he became the Prophet.<br><h2><b>The Adversary's Power</b></h2><br>Can you just get a feel now that the kingdom is beginning to move out across the earth? When the kingdom of God begins to increase in power and strength and to move forth, the power of the adversary also increases. He is not asleep. I've learned that there is one good thing that I can say about him. He is not lazy. He works day and night, and he is always there. It is interesting, as some of the new temples are being placed, to see the attention that we are getting from some of his helpers. You can be aware that something important is happening there because of the attention we are getting from the opposition.<br><br>In this day, if we are going to do our part, we need to live better, we need to be closer to the Lord, we need to be more diligent than any group has ever been, confronted, as we are, with the fact that all the evil is being restored. When we talk about the restoration of the fulness of the gospel, we talk about a plan that made it possible for Enoch to establish a Zion, a place in which the scripture indicates, "They were of one heart and one mind, and dwelt in righteousness; and there was no poor among them" (Moses 7:18). "And it came to pass that Zion was not, for God received it up into his own bosom" (Moses 7:69). That same plan and those same principles are here, and we must prepare ourselves so we can be a celestial people because Zion can be set up only on the principles of the celestial kingdom; otherwise, the Lord cannot receive her unto himself.<br><br>The same evils that were there when the Lord destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah are being restored. To live in this day we need to put the Lord first in our lives. We need to live so that we have his power.<br><h2><b>The Power of the Holy Ghost</b></h2><br>Have you ever wondered what makes The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints different from other churches? There are many Christian churches. Why are we unique? What is it that we have? Joseph Smith answered that question for President Martin Van Buren as he waited on him at one time asking for redress for the losses that the Saints had suffered. Martin Van Buren, the president, said to him, "What makes your church different from the other churches?"<br><br>The Prophet's answer was, "We have the Holy Ghost."<br><br>I don't know whether or not you know what a marvelous blessing it is to have the Holy Ghost, but it makes it possible for a person to be born spiritually so as to be actually back in the presence of God through the Holy Ghost. As I see the struggle today, I see the adversary making great efforts to cut us off from the Holy Ghost, to remove us from this power that puts us in communication with the Lord, to isolate us so that he can destroy us. He gets us to do things so that our power is gone.<br><br>You see, a missionary out in the field without the Spirit is as helpless as a soldier with a gun without any ammunition. When converts are made, it is only when spirit speaks to spirit. You can talk people into the Church, but if you talk them in, they can be talked out or they will fall out. The real conversion comes when spirit speaks to spirit, when they have this marvelous witness from the Holy Ghost that the gospel is true.<br><h2><b>Personal Experiences</b></h2><br>I've been on both sides of the fence. I can remember a time when I believed but did not know for myself. I'm a five-generation Latter-day Saint. Most of our people have been in the Church since the days of Joseph Smith. Every one of my ancestors and Sister Reeve's ancestors crossed the plains as pioneers. The Lord has blessed us abundantly, and I've been aware that I have had many blessings--that I'm riding on a ticket that someone else paid for. It has kept me mighty humble.<br><br>This force that can cut us off can also keep us from knowing. Because I was raised in a Latter-day Saint home, we prayed; Dad and Mother prayed. Dad was in the bishopric all the years I can remember as a child. I can remember going away to school. I grew up in Millard County. We lived there during the Depression, and it was hard. I determined that I did not want to be there anymore. You'd work all year. You'd get up at 5:00 in the morning and work until 9:00 at night, and, when the season was over, you owed more than you did when you began in the spring. I had worked all summer. I had been paid a dollar a day. I had saved every cent I had earned. That is different from what we do today. I hadn't spent one cent. I wanted to go to school. I had $96.35.<br><br>Before I went away, I came to the bishop. I said, "Bishop, tomorrow I'm going away to school. I've worked all summer. I've saved all that I've earned. I have $96.35. Do you think that the Lord expects me to pay tithing on that when I need so much more to go to school and there's no other place to get any?"<br><br>This great bishop, and I'll be grateful to him forever, looked me right in the eye and said, "If you pay your tithing, you'll have what you need when you need it."<br><br>I went home and got the money, those nine dollars. I carried them down, and they got bigger as I got closer to his office, until when I got to the desk they were almost as big as wheels. The greatest trial I had had up to that point was to put them on his desk. I still have the receipt in my safety deposit box.<br><br>I went away to school. I rode in the back of a grain truck to get there. One of the first things that happened to me was that I sat in a class where a learned man said, "God is dead." I was shaken up. I was depending on Him. The bishop said He was going to help me. This learned man said that thinking people, anyone with intellect, would know that God is dead. We didn't have a telephone at home. I couldn't call Dad and Mother to be reassured. I hadn't met the new bishop yet. The pillars that held my house up had fallen down, and I needed to know. I can still remember that night when there was no place to go but to my knees. There alone in that little one-room apartment, I kneeled down. I prayed--no fancy words--something like this, "Father in Heaven, Dad and Mom have been praying to you all these years. This learned man says you're dead. I need to know. Are you there?" When I went back to that man's class, I knew something he didn't know. I knew there was a God, and He wasn't dead. I knew that He could hear, and I knew that He could answer. From that hour until now, that assurance has been like an anchor to my soul.<br><h2><b>You Can Know</b></h2><br>If you haven't a witness so that you know, I hope that you will make the effort to learn for yourself. The Lord has provided a sure means in the sacred record which came forth from the Hill Cumorah. As I stood in the Grandin Building where the Book of Mormon was printed just the other day--they have now made it a visitors' center--actually the very place the book was printed--I got a confirmation again that this is the record the Lord brought forth. It is the only book that has a promise that I know of in the world. The Lord has given the promise that, if you really want to know and if you have a sincere heart and ask with real intent, having faith in Christ, he'll reveal the truth of it unto you by the power of the Holy Ghost. "And by the power of the Holy Ghost ye may know the truth of all things" (Moroni 10:5). If you don't have that witness, I encourage you to work until you have it. It will change your life. It will bring meaning and purpose to the things you do. It will change your goals; it will give you direction; it will bring joy, peace, and satisfaction that cannot be had in any other way. It will bring a satisfaction; it will be like an anchor to you in these days when the world is confused.<br><h2><b>To Cut Us Off</b></h2><br>Let me talk a moment now about the Holy Ghost and what I feel the adversary is trying to do to cut us off from this witness that makes it so we can know. The Holy Ghost can dwell only in a clean tabernacle. There is an eternal law that this Being and his influence cannot dwell in an impure tabernacle. Our bodies are tabernacles, and if anything in them is impure--and the delicate memory banks in our minds are part of our bodies, and can become stained or defiled--they resist that Spirit, and it will be restrained from flowing to us. Can you see maybe a reason why the adversary is flooding the world with all the material that is out across the land? In the nations where Sister Reeve and I traveled, we did not see one that was not afflicted with this plague. Across the whole earth what's printed on the pages, what's in the magazines, what's in some of the music? You can't go to a show really any more unless you want to have those images and thoughts come into your mind.<br><br>I turn to the Doctrine and Covenants, section 63, and I would like to read what the Lord says about having the Spirit and what can happen if we allow some things into our minds.<br><br><i>And verily I say unto you, as I have said before, he that looketh on a woman to lust after her, or if any shall commit adultery in their hearts, they shall not have the Spirit, but shall deny the faith and shall fear.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 63:16]<br><br>Now the words<i>shall not</i>don't mean<i>maybe,</i>they mean<i>definitely;</i>the verse is talking about the Holy Ghost and only about our thoughts--no action. Can you see then why the adversary is making such an effort to cut us off from the power we have to set up the kingdom of God in the earth, to have communication, to have our own revelation from the Lord, to have our own guidance? I hope that each one of us might guard our minds and not allow anything in them that will defile our bodies so that we can be pure, clean, and holy so that the Spirit can radiate from us.<br><br>A scripture says, "As he thinketh in his heart, so is he" (Proverbs 23:7). This door to your mind can be controlled only by you and by the Lord. Your parents can't control it. Your bishop can't control it. The Lord can, but he won't because he has given you agency. So you alone determine what you allow to come into your conscious mind to be stored there as in a computer to be brought out whenever the Spirit touches you.<br><h2><b>The Means by Which We Can Protect Ourselves</b></h2><br>What a challenge then to live in this day! If we are going to be filled with the Spirit, we need to guard what comes into our minds. The Lord has given us the means by which we can protect ourselves in this evil day. He has talked about putting on an armor to protect us against a foe we do not see with our eyes or hear with our ears ordinarily, but he still has such marvelous power that he can keep us from the presence of the Lord, from having the full power of the Holy Ghost. I'd like to read to you from the Doctrine and Covenants what the lord says to do to put this protective power upon you.<br><br><i>Wherefore, lift up your hearts and rejoice, and gird up your loins, and take upon you my whole armor, that ye may be able to withstand the evil day, having done all, that ye may be able to stand.</i><br><br><i>Stand, therefore, having your loins girt about with truth.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 27:15–16]<br><br>What does that mean? How do you do that? What are the loins? Scripturally, the loins represent the power the Lord has given his children to initiate new life. The loin is that part of the body between the short ribs and the hip bone. The Lord says to gird with truth the use of this power to initiate new life. "And truth is knowledge of things as they are, and as they were, and as they are to come" (D&amp;amp;C 93:24).<br><br>Now if you gird something, what do you do? If I were going to gird my wrist, I would wrap something around it to strengthen it. For instance, I gird my wrist with this handkerchief. If I wrap it around my wrist tightly, it will strengthen my wrist. The Lord says to gird your loins with truth. To me that would mean to understand how sacred this power is, and the conditions or guidelines under which it is to be used. So, it would be protected and strengthened and you will not be caught in the web that Lucifer is spreading across the whole earth.<br><br>In the next verse the Lord says, "Stand, therefore, having your loins girt about with truth." The word<i>girt</i>means "moored, such as a vessel, held taut by two cables, so as not to swing to the wind or the tide." To have your loins girt about with truth means that you would have them so securely bound by your understanding and your commitment to yourself that the temptations that roll over the earth and the pressures that come on from peer groups would not be able to move you and carry you away. Isn't it interesting that the Lord has placed that first in the armor?<br><br>I don't know whether you can really understand all this talk about armor. But if you could have been with Sister Reeve and me at Warwick Castle in England, you could have seen many suits of armor sitting there that people wore long ago. They were to protect them against arrows, stones, axes, swords, and spears. In our day the Lord is talking about an armor that will protect us against an unseen foe.<br><br>The Lord goes on to explain the next piece of armor to put on: "Having on the breastplate of righteousness" (D&amp;amp;C 27:16). Now the breastplate would be the part that covers your chest that protects your heart and your lungs. You couldn't live very long without a heart. If an arrow went through your heart, you'd have to stop fighting. If you got one through an arm, you probably could go on and fight with the other arm, but the heart is a vital part.<br><br>Tonight we have Dr. Russell Nelson here. He is a great heart surgeon. I am so grateful to him. If it hadn't been for his skill and the help of the Lord, Sister Reeve wouldn't be here tonight. I'm grateful to him because he extended her life by his skill and his know-how in open-heart surgery.<br><br>The Lord has asked us to cover these vital parts so that they will not be injured. How does one put on the breastplate of righteousness? To me this part of the armor comes from keeping the commandments. Obedience to the Lord's commandments brings forth great blessings. Let's take one of the commandments--the Word of Wisdom, for instance. The Lord has given us the commandment. He said in preface to it,<br><br><i>In consequence of evils and designs which do and will exist in the hearts of conspiring men in the last days, I have warned you, and forwarn you, by giving unto you this word of wisdom by revelation.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 89:4]<br><br>And he gives us the Word of Wisdom saying, "Don't use alcohol, don't use cigarettes, don't drink tea or coffee," and I would add today, "Don't use drugs." They can destroy you, and not the least thing they'll do is cut you off from the Holy Ghost. Having made a covenant with the Lord to keep these commandments, if you knowingly violate the trust the Lord has placed in you, you will be cut off from the Spirit. Someone might say to you that one cigarette won't hurt you. But I want to tell you what it will do. If you have gone into the waters of baptism and promised the Lord that you would keep his commandments, if you knowingly violate that promise, the Holy Ghost cannot stay in a disobedient tabernacle. The real loss comes when you sever yourself from the full flow of the Spirit of the Lord. Gradually you will lose the light until you will be in darkness.<br><br>Let me tell you the story of one young man and his experience with the Word of Wisdom. As a young man about nineteen years old, after the funeral of his father, he and his mother and his sister made an agreement that they would never break the Word of Wisdom unless they were all three together and decided it was all right to do it.<br><br>He went away to the University of Pennsylvania to learn to become a dentist. He was now in his fourth year at the university, and he was the captain of the track team of this great university. The team went to Boston to compete in the national track meet at Harvard University.<br><br>The night before the big meet, while he was in his hotel room getting ready to retire, the track coach came and said, "Tomorrow is a great day for me and the school. I have always dreamed of having a national championship team. I want every member of the team to be in top shape. I have brought a bottle of special wine to tone up your system, and I want you to forget your funny Mormon ideas and have some so you'll be in top shape tomorrow."<br><br>"Coach, I just can't do it. I respect and admire you, but I have made a solemn promise to my sister and my mother and my God, and I just can't do it." The coach was disappointed as he went away.<br><br>The next morning there was an anxious knock on his door. His name was called out, and he answered, "What's the matter?"<br><br>The coach asked, "Are you all right?" He said, "Yes, I'm all right."<br><br>"Thank goodness. Every other member of the team is sick."<br><br>This young man went out as the lone representative of the university track team. He ran the 100-yard and 220-yard dashes. He had just run in a qualifying heat on the 220-yard dash, and ordinarily there is a field event in between the track events to allow the runners to rest and get their breath. On this occasion all the field events had been completed, and, because of the restless crowd, they announced the finals in the 220-yard dash. He was tired and needed a few minutes to rest. He protested to the officials, but they did not delay it.<br><br>As he lined up for the race, he said, that tired feeling left him, and that day he set a new world's record for the 220-yard dash on a curved track.<br><br>The Lord has given us a marvelous promise with that commandment. He said,<br><br><i>And all saints who remember to keep and do these sayings, walking in obedience to the commandments, shall receive health in their naval and marrow to their bones;</i><br><br><i>And shall find wisdom and great treasures of knowledge, even hidden treasures;</i><br><br><i>And shall run and not be weary, and shall walk and not faint.</i><br><br><i>And I, the Lord, give unto them a promise, that the destroying angel shall pass by them, as the children of Israel, and not slay them.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 89:18–21]<br><br>The Lord didn't fail him, and he won't fail you.<br><br>I can remember an occasion when I had pressure on me, a young bishop away in a distant city. They have what they call a social hour, and they determined I was going to join them. I couldn't do that and be the bishop. Yet the two of them stood by the door and said, "Okay, you're going to join us or you're not going out of here." I said a little prayer, "Father in Heaven, help me." I walked right between them and they didn't see me go, just as if the Lord had put a plastic bag over me, and I slipped right out. To this day not one of them has asked where I went.<br><br>The Lord never fails. All the other commandments--tithing, keeping the Sabbath day holy, all the commandments--they form this protective power. When you walk with the Lord, you walk in safety and protection.<br><br>Let's move on now to the next one. He says, "Having . . . your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace" (D&amp;amp;C 27:16). How do you do that? Our bodies are marvelous things. They have been organized in such a way that, when we do an action a number of times, it becomes a habit, and almost without conscious effort habits will automatically work for us. We set our own habit patterns.<br><br>For instance, if we have established the habit of prayer, it will be easier for us to pray than not to pray. We can have habits automatically work for us instead of against us. And they become a powerful source of protection. If we have our feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace, that would mean that we had been keeping the commandments and the habits are working for us.<br><br>Let's go on to the next piece of armor: "Taking the shield of faith wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked" (D&amp;amp;C 27:17). A shield is something which usually goes on your left forearm with which you can protect yourself from objects the enemy sends at you. In the days of the knights it could have been a protection against rocks, arrows, swords, or spears.<br><br>This part of the spiritual armor is faith in the Lord. It is an assurance which comes from your knowledge and understanding of the word of the Lord. You can hear the word of the Lord when you read the scriptures. You can hear the word of the Lord when you hear his prophets. You can feel the word of the Lord when you pray. You can build faith.<br><br>Let me relate a story of a young man who built a shield of faith. From the record of the Old Testament we learn of David, herding his father's sheep. He talked about a time when his confidence and trust in the Lord had reached a point that, when he tried to protect the sheep and a bear and a lion attacked him, the Lord delivered him out of the paw of the bear and the paw of the lion. The day came when his father, Jesse, asked him to leave the sheep to take some food down to his three older brothers who were fighting in Saul's army. He took some loaves, cheese, and parched corn and went down to his brothers. When he arrived he saw this giant of a Philistine challenging the armies of Israel, saying, "If one of you will come out and contend with me and he wins, we will be your servants; but if I win, you will be our servants."<br><br>Not one man in Saul's army dared answer his challenge. David was offended because Goliath had defied the God of Israel. David said he would go and fight this ungodly Philistine. Can you picture a young lad of maybe seventeen walking down to meet this giant, probably ten feet tall, with a spear that probably weighed more than David and a shield big enough to require a shield carrier?<br><br>When Goliath saw the unarmed youth coming to meet him, he was insulted and said:<br><br><i>Am I a dog, that thou comest to me with staves? . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . Come to me, and I will give thy flesh unto the fowls of the air, and to the beasts of the field.</i>[1 Samuel 17:43–44]<br><br>David replied,<br><br><i>I come to thee in the name of the Lord of hosts, the God of the armies of Israel, whom thou has defied.</i><br><br><i>This day will the Lord deliver thee into mine hand . . . that all the earth may know that there is a God in Israel."</i>[1 Samuel 17:45–46]<br><br>At the proper moment David placed a smooth stone in his sling, and with practiced aim he let it go. That day Goliath had something enter his head which had not been there before, and he toppled and fell to the earth. David had built a shield of faith that was a protection to him.<br><br>As we pray and search the holy scriptures and serve and obey, we, too, can build a shield of faith to protect us from the adversary. You have to obey the things you read. It is not enough to read and hear them. The Lord said,<br><br><i>I, the Lord, am bound when ye do what I say; but when ye do not what I say, ye have no promise.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 82:10]<br><br>Next the Lord says, "And take the helmet of salvation" (D&amp;amp;C 27:18). The helmet is to protect the head. In a football game a player who did not wear his helmet would probably only last two plays.<br><br>The helmet of salvation to me is to know who we are and why we are here and where we can go and what we can do and be.<br><br><i>I am a child of God,</i><br><i>And he has sent me here,</i><br><i>Has given me an earthly home</i><br><i>With parents kind and dear.</i><br><i>Lead me, guide me, walk beside me,</i><br><i>Help me find the way.</i><br><i>Teach me all that I must do</i><br><i>To live with him someday.</i><br>[Naomi W. Randall, "I Am a Child of God,"<i>Sing With Me,</i>no. B-76]<br><br>When a person knows who he is and why he is here, he has a real advantage.<br><br>And now for the final piece of armor, the Lord says, "Take . . . the sword of my Spirit" (D&amp;amp;C 27:18). Sometimes our sword may not be very big, but there can be great power in it. The Lord said,<br><br><i>Seek not to declare my word, but first seek to obtain my word, and then shall your tongue be loosed; then, if you desire, you shall have my Spirit and my word, yea, the power of God unto the convincing of men.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 11:21]<br><br>From the Book of Mormon we read of Alma and the sons of Mosiah, as they met at a transfer time from their areas of service in the mission field:<br><br><i>And what added more to his joy, they were still his brethren in the Lord; yea, and they had waxed strong in the knowledge of the truth; for they were men of a sound understanding and they had searched the scriptures diligently, that they might know the word of God.</i><br><br><i>But this is not all; they had given themselves to much prayer, and fasting; therefore they had the spirit of prophecy, and the spirit of revelation, and when they taught, they taught with power and authority of God.</i>[Alma 17:2–3]<br><br>Can you see what a marvelous thing it is if we are prepared, if we have the Spirit, if we are obedient, if we do our part? We can carry the burden the Lord has asked us to carry. It isn't easy. If it were easy, he wouldn't have sent you special young men and women here to do it. He has prepared you and held you back, trained you, made it possible for you to come in this day. I hope there won't be one of you who will fail the Lord. I hope that you will be true to this trust, that you will put on this whole armor that your may stand in these challenging days.<br><h2><b>The Lord Loves Us</b></h2><br>I'd like to give you a little more feeling for the Lord, this great Being we serve. I don't know how close your relationship is to him, but you know he will be as close to you as you'll let him be by how you feel and how you act.<br><br>Sister Reeve and I had the marvelous experience of a brief visit in the Holy Land, and we prepared ourselves. We searched every word we could find that was written about the Savior. We went through the Gospels. We didn't want to miss anything. I had been hearing President Lee talk about how he felt when he stood at the garden tomb. I had heard President Kimball talk about the feelings he had when he was on shepherd's hill. I wanted to feel those same feelings. We had the privilege to walk where Jesus walked. We had the opportunity to come out of the room where they had the last Supper, down off the Mount of Olives, across the brook Cedron, into the area they call the Garden of Gethsemane. In my mind's eye I could picture this lone figure out there about a stone's throw away from three apostles whom he had left at the gate to watch. As I looked I could see him suffering. I could see him prostrate on the ground, and I began to feel a kinship with him and felt like saying, "Why is he doing that? Why does he suffer like that? He didn't need to do it himself." This truth came into my mind: "He's doing it for you." When I realized that part of that suffering was because of me and my transgressions, I began to have new feeling and new love, greater gratitude for the Son of God.<br><br>When he described his suffering, he said,<br><br><i>Which suffering caused myself, even God, the greatest of all, to tremble because of pain, and to bleed at every pore, and to suffer both body and spirit--and would that I might not drink the bitter cup, and shrink.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 19:18]<br><br>Yes, new feelings of love and gratitude for him came into my heart as I realized that he had suffered so extensively, and he had done it for me. Then the soldiers came, 600 of them. The scriptures say they bound him. Can you imagine the Son of God being led like a common criminal down to be judged in an illegal trial at night? As he stood there in Annas's palace, they smote him on the face. He said, "Why smitest thou me?"<br><br>They reviled him, blindfolded him, struck him again, and said, "If you are the Son of God, why don't you prophesy who smote you?"<br><br>They took him before Caiaphas, and there they determined that he should die. Caiaphas couldn't take his life. They had to send him before Pilate. Four times Pilate tried to turn him loose. He couldn't find anything wrong in him. He said, "I find in him no fault at all" (John 18:38). Still they clamored for his crucifixion. So finally--and maybe it was his one last attempt to save Him--he sent Him down to be scourged. It doesn't say so in the scripture, but I had in my mind that maybe he thought that, if he sent Him down to be scourged, and He came forth beaten and bruised and bleeding, it might soften their hearts and they might let Him go.<br><br>Sister Reeve and I stood in a chamber where they scourged people. It almost makes your blood run cold to see what they did. Hands were tied above their heads to the ceiling, legs were tied so the victim couldn't fall down, and then clothing was taken from the back, and then 39 strokes were administered across the back. They had little reservoirs to hold the salt water used to restrain the bleeding if it became too profuse as they administered the scourging. I envisioned in my mind this suffering that the Son of God had, then to have them take him and mockingly put a purple robe on him and then lead him away up a little path they call Via Dolorosa up to where they say he was crucified. As I stood there, in my mind's eye I could almost see and hear the nails being driven into his hands. This great Being had no ill feeling in him. I thought, "What would I have done had I been there?" I would have fought back, and I would have failed. I am grateful he was so brave and marvelous and didn't fail. The last terrible hour, when he had to be left alone, was probably his greatest test. The Father withdrew his Spirit because Jesus had to do it himself.<br><br>I'm grateful that Heavenly Father didn't stop it. If he had stopped it and left us without rendering the service he rendered, we would never have had a body again. Our body would have gone to the grave never to rise. Our spirit would have been subject to Lucifer. No matter what we did, we would have been subject to him forever. I am so grateful for the strength of this great Being who is the Son of God. In godly dignity he gave up his life. They did not take it from him. After all this intense suffering, which was sufficient to cause him to cry out, "My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?" (Matthew 27:46), he reported his accomplishment: "Father, it is finished. Into thy hands I commend my spirit" (see Luke 23:46, JST Matt. 27:54).<br><h2><b>Testimony</b></h2><br>I testify to you today that he lives, that he is real, that he guides this church. There is no question. You can hear him speaking through President Kimball. You not only can hear him; you can feel him. You can see it in the Prophet's face. There was no question about it in the last conference--this great prophet, five foot six, standing there with hardly enough strength to stand up, just saying two or three sentences:<br><br><i>The work is divine, the Lord is at the helm, the Church is true, and all is well.</i>["The Lord Is at the Helm,"<i>Ensign,</i>May 1982, p. 76]<br><br>There wasn't anyone in that congregation that didn't know that the Lord had spoken through this great man in those few words.<br><br>Isn't it great to live in this day when the heavens are opened, when there is revelation, when there is guidance? Wouldn't it be tragic now if we fail in our part? We have a vital part; we have the opportunity to send this message across the earth. There are millions of people waiting for the gospel, and, if we fail, unless the Lord sends someone else to replace us, they will lose the blessings. I hope and pray that we won't fail the Lord in these trying times, we won't be caught in Lucifer's net, we won't be caught in his snare, that we will keep ourselves clean, sweet, pure, and obedient so the power of the Holy Ghost can work in us.<br><br>What a marvelous thing it is when your mind's turned completely to the Lord. The Lord said to sanctify ourselves. When he comes first in our lives, he becomes a moving, motivating power. I testify to you that he lives. I'd like you to know that there is no hesitation, there is no doubt. I know with every fiber of my being, every cell in my body. I know that God lives. I know that he guides this work. I know that he is alive. I know you can talk with him; I know that he hears. I know that he loves us. I know that he is there. He is as close as we will let him be. May God bless you and bless us all that we may not fail. If I had one wish, I'd wish I could be as young as you are. When you begin to see the years slip by, you are anxious to do all you can. I hope that all of you might put your energy in and move forth with new vigor, new energy, that we might follow the guidance of the Prophet when he has said, "Lengthen your stride, hasten your step, increase your efficiency, do just a little more."<br><br>May God bless you and be with you in the days ahead. I pray that you will have a desire to draw close to him so that this people will stand out, that we'll be the people that Isaiah saw when he said,<br><br><i>And it shall come to pass in the last days, that the mountain of the Lord's house shall be established in the top of the mountains, and shall be exalted above the hills; and all nations shall flow unto it.</i><br><br><i>And many people shall go and say, Come ye, and let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, to the house of the God of Jacob; and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths.</i>[Isaiah 2:2–3]<br><br>We are in that day. May God bless us that we won't fail. That those who are watching us from behind the scenes will be pleased with what they see, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ, the Lord. Amen.<br><br><i>Rex C. Reeve, Sr., was a member of the First Quorum of the Seventy of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when this fireside address was given at Brigham Young University on 8 August 1982.</i><br><br><i>© Intellectual Reserve, Inc.

<br>
I do not know those for whom this message is specifically intended or to what portion of those present it directly applies. I am confident, however, that if I am supported by your faith and prayers as it is delivered so that I can give expression to the deep feelings of my heart, this message will be of significant benefit to some who need it, provided they apply consistently in their lives the principles emphasized. I do not say this with any degree of personal pride, but in humble recognition of the experience I have had in its preparation. Seldom have I struggled as long and as hard to crystallize the feelings of my heart as I have on this occasion. But finally those sweet, quiet promptings of the Spirit came, which give me confidence to speak with conviction and assurance to those among us who are struggling with feelings of inadequacy or of being left out or of being misunderstood or not appreciated.<br><h2><b>Some Encounter Difficulties</b></h2><br>Each passing day I am aware that there are many youth of the Church who understand (integral)the teachings of the Savior and apply them faithfully and consistently in their lives. They continue to grow in strength and self-confidence and find their obedience is rewarded with happiness, peace, and self-assurance. I am also aware that there are significant numbers of youth who are striving to identify a path that will bring them satisfaction--a sense of belonging and of self-worth. Some have an intellectual knowledge of gospel principles but have not incorporated them completely into their own lives. They live partially or superficially the teachings of the Savior and, as a consequence, do not receive the fullness of direction that can come from the Lord or the ability to achieve blessings that result from being fully, willingly obedient to His commandments. They have not yet discovered the power and inspiration that come from the Lord to aid all of us in the difficult experiences of life. Such individuals strive mightily to face each day's challenges on their own, and they encounter difficulties. It is because I now know that they see only a part of the picture and can be stealthily led by Satan down erroneous paths, that, with deep love and empathy and with all the conviction of my soul, I wish to share some personal experiences which a kind and loving Lord has used to help me understand the meaning and power of some of the principles of His gospel.<br><br>I too have had such feelings of loneliness and of being left out and not appreciated.<br><h2><b>My Life and Learning</b></h2><br>I was born into a home where my father was not a member of the church, and my mother was what today some would categorize as inactive. During my early childhood, I did not in any way understand the significance of the fact that there was no priesthood-bearing patriarch or consistent teaching of pure gospel principles in our home. Yet no son could have loved more or been more proud of my father than was I then and am now. He taught his five boys by noble example the importance of industry, integrity, education, manual skills, trust, and obedience. We gained self-confidence through the practice of these worthy traits. Because he traveled frequently and left our precious mother alone for significant periods of time to raise five active, exuberant boys, we discovered in her an amazingly marvelous combination of love, patience, firmness, and diligence. She was and continues to be more a friend and companion than anything else. (I should add the Lord has since greatly blessed our family. Dad is currently a sealer in the Washington Temple, and mother serves with him as a temple worker. Both provide powerful examples of righteous obedience for each of us.)<br><br>During my youth, through kind, understanding bishops and patient home teachers and other interested members, the five boys were encouraged to attend Church and to participate in its activities. We did so, although at times reluctantly. I remember with sadness the times when at separation for Sunday School classes, I would slip out the back door to walk in the park. There were, however, times when I listened to the teachings in class. I'm sure that, if anyone would have questioned my testimony and understanding of the gospel, I would have fiercely defended it as being strong and vigorous. Only from the perspective of time and the marvelous experiences of later, more active participation in the Church, do I now realize that I knew very, very little of the true meaning of the gospel plan. I participated in Church activities but somehow felt I was always at the periphery. I would approach Mutual activities daydreaming of a glorious evening dancing with the most popular girls in the ward. The reality of each evening was quite different. As I sat on the sidelines and watched others enjoying themselves, I felt somehow left out, not part of the central group. The same thing occurred in school. Though I felt comfortable in the academic activities, the social and sport activities left me feeling alone and unwanted. It was not until a lot later in life that I realized it was largely my fault.<br><br>I have since learned that one cannot demand love and respect or require that the bonds of friendship and appreciation be extended as an unearned right. These blessings must be earned. They come from personal merit. Sincere concern for others, selfless service and worthy example qualify one for such respect. All my rationalization that others had formed select groups and knowingly ruled out my participation was largely a figment of my imagination. Had I practiced correct principles, I need not have felt alone.<br><br>Well did President McKay repeatedly observe, "Every man, every person radiates what he or she is. Every person is a recipient of radiation" ("The Times Call for Courageous Youth and True Manhood,"<i>Improvement Era,</i>June 1969, p. 116). Where proper gospel principles are observed, that radiation invites friendship and trust. Where they are lacking, there is a negative unpleasant radiation that closes the doors to righteous companionship.<br><br>During my last year at the university, I looked forward to the prospects of a fine professional future and had my life very well outlined. Then a kind and thoughtful Lord placed a bombshell in my little world. Her name was Jeanene Watkins. Her father's call to the senate brought her to Washington, D.C., where I lived. The more I knew her, the more fascinated I became, and each opportunity to be with her deepened the growing love within my heart. One evening as we conversed about the important things of life, she innocently said, "When I marry, I'll marry in the temple, a returned missionary." That comment struck me to the core. It began a process of reflection, contemplation, and prayer that resulted in my receiving a call as a missionary to Uruguay.<br><br>I thought myself ill prepared to teach the gospel to anyone. I had an intellectual understanding of some of the gospel principles that I recognized needed to be converted into a heart-centered, Holy-Ghost-inspired, burning testimony of truth. I struggled to communicate to the Lord my feelings of gratitude for the privilege of service, of the blessing of righteous parents, and for the love of one of His most precious handmaidens. I asked Him to help me become an effective servant in His hands. I strained to forget self, struggled to help others, and in the process, the skeleton of the teachings I had received took on the flesh and blood of new life and meaning.<br><br>I discovered that we are not left alone to face the challenges of life, but can receive guidance and strength from a loving, understanding God in heaven. I bathed my pillow with tears of pleading for the mercy of the Lord to forgive a wayward soul or to fortify a family in need--and found my own needs met. I pleaded that a heart could be softened or a struggling father could be given a personal witness of truth--and discovered the limitless breadth of love.<br><br>Familiar scriptures, through prayer and application, guided me to new depths of understanding and appreciation. I had read the words many times. They now took on new meaning--<br><br><i>And charity suffereth long, and is kind, and envieth not, and is not puffed up, seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked, thinketh no evil, and rejoiceth not in iniquity but rejoiceth in the truth, beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things.</i><br><br><i>Wherefore, my beloved brethren, if ye have not charity, ye are nothing, for charity never faileth. Wherefore, cleave unto charity, which is the greatest of all . . .</i><br><br><i>But charity is the pure love of Christ, and it endureth forever and whoso is found possessed of it at the last day, it shall be well with him.</i>[Moroni 7:45–47]<br><br>What a priceless message for any who would enjoy the comforting circle of true friendship. How I wanted then, as I do now, to share those exquisite feelings of love and appreciation--of belonging.<br><br>There were then, as now, constantly new lessons. Well do I remember the first time, when, as I pleaded with the Lord in solemn prayer for the help and guidance and feeling of support I had come to cherish, there was no answer. Rather I felt a barrier--an insurmountable wall. I reviewed my life, my feelings, my acts, and all that could affect such communication and found no problems. It was not until after much more purposeful struggling that there came the clarification. What I had felt was not a wall but a giant step, an opportunity to rise to a higher spiritual plane--an opportunity evidencing trust that I would obey correct principles without the necessity of constant reinforcement. After more effort, the peaceful, comforting presence of the Spirit returned.<br><h2><b>Four Principles</b></h2><br>I wish I had some magic wand that would allow me to touch the hearts of each for whom this message is intended and communicate the experiences that have flowed from a loving Father since that time, but I cannot. I can, however, mention four principles that I have come to recognize as the foundation of happiness and growth and the secure feeling of companionship with the Lord.<br><br>These four principles have brought the deepest feelings of worthwhileness, peace, and happiness into my own life. The Lord has established these cornerstones in His eternal plan, and each one is essential. All work together in harmony and reinforce one another and, when they are applied with diligence and consistency, produce strength of character and increasing ability to convert the challenges of life into stepping-stones to happiness now and forever. They are--<br><br>* Faith in the Lord Jesus Christ and His program<br><br>* Repentance to rectify the consequences of mistakes of omission or commission<br><br>* Obedience to the commandments of the Lord to provide strength and direction in our lives.<br><br>* Selfless service to enrich our daily existence<br><br>Satan also knows that these principles, if observed consistently, will render an individual increasingly resistant to his temptations. He has developed a comprehensive plan to undermine or destroy each one of them. For example, to dispose of faith, Satan would plant and cultivate in each one of us the seeds of selfishness, for he knows that, if left unchecked, they will grow into a monster that can consume and destroy the divine spirit in man. Selfishness is at the root of sin. It reinforces destructive habits that produce a dependence on chemical or physical stimulants that destroy the mind and body. Selfishness leads to unrighteous acts that debauch and deprave the soul.<br><br>Satan's program is based on immediate gratification of selfish desires. Participate now and pay later--yet the full, terrible consequences of payment are never revealed until it is tragically late.<br><br>The Spirit of the Lord can over power the stifling effect of selfishness. That Spirit comes with faith, repentance, obedience, and service.<br><h2><b>Genius of the Gospel Plan</b></h2><br>With the other brethren, I have the privilege of interviewing youth who have stumbled along the way and yet have painstakingly found their way back. Many are anxious to serve a mission. Their backgrounds vary widely, as does the degree of their transgression. Support from others ranges from strong to nonexistent. Yet there is always a common thread of similarity. In every case, without exception, each has come to the realization that wickedness never was happiness. Each has resolved to place into effect the saving principles of the gospel. The proper use of free agency produces the miracle of rebuilt, useful lives. I have personally verified that, until words like<i>faith, prayer, love,</i>and<i>humility</i>become a living part of us through personal experience and the sweet prompting of the Holy Spirit, they hold no great significance and produce no miracles. I found that I could learn gospel teachings intellectually and through the power of reason and analysis, recognizing that they were of significant value. But their enormous power and strength and ability to stretch one beyond the limits of his imagination did not become reality until patient, consistent practice allowed the Holy Spirit to distill and expand their meaning in my heart. The genius of the gospel plan is that by doing, principally in selfless service to others, those things the Lord counsels us to do, we are given every understanding, every capacity, every capability necessary to provide rich fulfillment in this life and the preparation necessary for eternal happiness in the presence of the Lord.<br><br>Yet anyone that paints a picture of life as being easy, without challenge, is either not being honest or has not yet encountered the growing experiences which the Lord gives each of His children to prepare them for happiness in this life and the blessing of dwelling eternally in His presence. The purpose of these experiences has been clarified by the Lord:<br><br><i>And if men come unto me I will show unto them their weakness. I give unto men weakness that they may be humble; and my grace is sufficient for all men that humble themselves before me; for if they humble themselves before me, and have faith in me, then will I make weak things become strong unto them.</i>[Ether 12:27]<br><br>Elder Orson F. Whitney wrote:<br><br><i>No pain that we suffer, no trial that we experience is wasted. It ministers to our education, to the development of such qualities as patience, faith, fortitude and humility. All that we suffer and all that we endure, especially when we endure it patiently, builds up our characters, purifies our hearts, expands our souls and makes us more tender and charitable, more worthy to be called the children of God . . . and it is through sorrow and suffering, toil and tribulation, that we gain the education that we come here to acquire and which will make us more like our Father and Mother in heaven.</i><br><br>We can, however, avoid unnecessary sorrow and distress. President Tanner has wisely counseled:<br><br><i>The first thing to remember is that if we really understand and live the principles of the gospel, we won't find ourselves in some of the predicaments we get into. Much of the loneliness, heartache and despair which is common to so many people, have come because either they or someone in their family or their mate did not live the principles of the gospel, or did not apply the principle of repentance.</i><br><br><i>That is the second thing to remember. If you do get into trouble, or have not kept the commandments and have transgressed, then we have this glorious principle of repentance to help us erase the guilt and start all over again. The Doctrine and Covenants tells us, "By this ye may know if a man repenteth of his sins--behold, he will confess them and forsake them."</i>[D&amp;amp;C 58:43]<br><h2><b>The Drain of Worry</b></h2><br>Some of us divert our best efforts from constructive accomplishment by investing them in mental anguish and continual worry. The Lord has taught me a great lesson about worry that I would like to share with you today. After a wonderful full-time mission, where everything that has subsequently proven to be of eternal value in my life began to mature, I was sealed in the temple to my lovely Jeanene. She had fulfilled her mission while I was serving mine. We began our life together with every expectation of happiness, having some understanding of the application of the principles of the gospel in our lives. I was blessed, I'm convinced, through the kindness of the Lord to obtain a job in a new, highly developmental pioneer effort to place a nuclear plant in a submarine. The work was fascinating, challenging, and absorbing. When combined with the natural growth experiences that come with the formation of a new family unit and Church assignments, I found each day fully occupied.<br><br>Within eight months, I was in the office of a doctor being carefully examined to determine if I had ulcers. For weeks each night I would return home from work with a severe headache, and only after a long, quiet period of isolation could I calm my nerves sufficiently to sleep briefly and return to work the next day. I began to prayerfully consider my plight. It was ridiculous. All I wanted to do was to be a worthy husband and father and carry out honorably my Church and professional assignments. My best efforts produced frustration, worry, and illness. In time, I was prompted to divide mentally and physically, where possible, all of the challenges and tasks and assignments given to me into two categories: First, those for which I had some ability to control and to resolve, I put into a mental basket called "concern." Second, all the rest of the things that were either brought to me or I imagined I had the responsibility to carry out, but over which I had no control, I put in a basket called "worry." I realized I could not change them to any significant degree, so I studiously strove to completely forget them. The items in the "concern" basket were ordered in priority. I conscientiously tried to resolve them to the best of my ability. I realized that I could not always fulfill all of them on schedule or to the degree of competence I desired, but I did my conscientious best.<br><br>Occasionally as I sat in my office, I'd feel my stomach muscles tighten and tension overcome me. I would cease whatever activity I was engaged in and with earnest prayer for support, concentrate on relaxing and overcoming the barrier that worry produced in my life. Over a period of time, those efforts were blessed by the Lord. I again came to understand how the Lord is willing to strengthen, fortify, guide, and direct every phase of life. The symptoms of illness passed, and I learned to face tasks under pressure.<br><h2><b>Worthy Accomplishment=Success</b></h2><br>Why is there such emphasis in the world today on things? When things become an end unto themselves--the object of our effort, not tools to be used to reach greater more noble goals--they become part of Satan's plan to deflect us from the Lord's program. They can lead us carefully down to hell. Things do not produce happiness on earth nor do they provide exaltation. Material things are to be respected for their value as tools. Every artist, surgeon, or writer needs tools. They become instruments for greater good and should not at any time be the ultimate goal of life.<br><br>Much of life's disappointment comes from looking beyond the mark, from seeking success and happiness where it cannot be found. When wealth, position, influence, and power become measures of success in life, we should not be disappointed when their attainment does not produce the satisfaction and blessings promised for fulfillment of the commandments of the Lord.<br><br>The Savior declared as His work and glory "to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man" (Moses 1:39). He enthroned love for one another, service to a neighbor, and building the kingdom of God for His glory and majesty as noble worthy goals that produce rewards beyond all power of expression.<br><br>Mormon gave us precious insight when he declared:<br><br><i>For behold, the Spirit of Christ is given to every man, that he may know good from evil; wherefore, I show unto you the way to judge; for every thing which inviteth to do good, and to persuade to believe in Christ, is sent forth by the power and gift of Christ; wherefore ye may know with a perfect knowledge it is of God.</i><br><br><i>But whatsoever thing persuadeth men to do evil, and believe not in Christ, and deny him, and serve not God, then ye may know with a perfect knowledge it is of the devil; for after this manner doth the devil work, for he persuadeth no man to do good, no, not one; neither do his angels; neither do they who subject themselves unto him."</i>[Moroni 7:16–17]<br><br>I have obtained a personal witness that the true monument to an individual is worthy accomplishment, not mounds of paper plans or hoards of accumulated possessions. The eternal progress we attain in our own life and our contributions to that progress in the lives of others are measure enough of the worthwhileness of our efforts here on earth. No matter who we are, what lofty position we hold, or what powerful influence we wield, these things in and of themselves are of no lasting moment. Of real worth is how well we serve as instruments in the hands of the Lord to accomplish his divine will or how devotedly we obey His commandments and worthily receive His ordinances. In the final analysis, all our success can be measured by how effectively we can interpret and accomplish the will of our Father in Heaven in our own lives, the lives of our own family and loved ones, and the lives of His other children we are blessed to serve.<br><h2><b>Conclusion</b></h2><br>It has been a distinct honor to have been in your presence today, and I'm not sure how many present benefited from the comments made. I ask, if they apply to someone you know, that you will share them. Once in my life, I had the feelings of being left out. I now share the companionship of incomparable brotherhood and sisterhood, a feeling of belonging, of being useful, and I recognize that it comes only from sincere striving to live the commandments of the Lord. There are those about us on every side who would justify taking a path contrary to that of the Lord because they feel rejected. Oh, how essential it is to touch such a heart and have it feel the expanding influence of the Holy Ghost and to show to such an individual how every problem of life can be corrected when the gospel is allowed to flow into one's life.<br><br>May God bless each of us to appreciate our heritage, the privilege of attending this glorious university, the great honor of being children of our Father in Heaven with testimonies of truth. May we share it with those in need, I humbly pray in Jesus' name. Amen.<br><br><i>Richard G.

<h1>rs and Smorgasbords - Richard L. Gunn - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
At about the time that you graduates were being born, I was invited to speak at a conference to be held in St. Louis. My wife, Jeanne, thought it was a wonderful opportunity for our children to see the famous Saint Louis Zoo, so I accepted the conference option of applying the cost of an airplane ticket toward driving.<br><br>We stuffed the children into our small car and headed east. Our budget-control plan pushed us into hamburger stands for lunch and dinner during our trip. In those days we used to say, "We were broke all week, so we had hamburgers." Nowadays, with our grandchildren, we say, "We had hamburgers allweek, so we're broke."<br><br>When we arrived at the convention hotel, Jeanne thought we should get something more adequate for the children. After sitting down in the hotel restaurant, we passed out menus and announced that we were going to have a <i>good</i> meal. We asked if there was anything they especially would like.<br><br>The children enthusiastically clapped their hands and shouted in unison, "Hamburgers!"<br><br>I am reminded of another incident that occurred as I was returning from India during World War II. Our staging area was Karachi, then part of India. At three o'clock in the morning an Indian vendor came down the street awakening us with his one English word: "Hamburgers."<br><br>There was an instant mob scene. Men came pouring out of every building, many clad only in their shorts. (That was a shortsighted maneuver that left some shortchanged.) Back home I had never seen a hamburger that cost more than fifteen cents; these were $2.50. Eager men snapped them up for three greenbacks if no change was available. They elbowed in with an aggressiveness that if matched on the battlefield would have shortened the war by months. The size of the hamburger did not dampen their interest. A twenty-five-cent coin could cover every part of the meat, and a penny-size dab of mustard on these dinky hamburgers was the total trimming. Soon the echo of empty bins sent the vendor flying for more meat--who knows to what source in India.<br><br>Most of you probably remember, as do I, when a big, thick, juicy hamburger was more desired than anything printed on any menu. But I suspect that if you graduates came to this special occasion of a graduation banquet--and many of you are here with relatives and special friends--and if you sat down at a banquet table to face a hamburger dripping on a paper napkin, would you have a different feeling in this hall than you now have?<br><br>We can enjoy a hamburger life, and we can live without banquets, special occasions, or bachelor's degrees. But what a loss to special feelings, to our quality of life, to the joie de vivre, if we do not partake of a smorgasbord of enriched perceptions, a search for sensitivity, the fruits of work, the arts, and the discoveries opened with bachelor's degrees.<br><br>In this 1982 class there may be some among you who are still single--that endangered species group. If any of you young men are about to "pop the question," surely you want to make the proposal a memorable event. Perhaps you might select a tucked-away restaurant with a romantic atmosphere and plan to have some favorite music floating through a delicate motif, candles reflecting bright sparkles in crystal glasses, silverware gleaming on a Belgian-lace tablecloth, and there, in the middle of a beautiful Dresden china plate, the pièce de résistance: a golden-brown ­hamburger! What a sensitive moment tochange herwhole life!<br><br>Could I suggest that if she comes from an aristocratic family, it might be better to plan on one of the superburgers--do you think a Big Mac has a nice ring to it? Can you picture her as she whispers, "Yes," with Wendy's famous juices running down her chin? If she is British, you must remember that it is important to build traditions into your marriage; on the first anniversary, a stately Burger King and "chips" might send her into ecstasy. Any young lady not truly thrilled with such thoughtfulness should at least find the occasion memorable.<br><h2><b>More Than a Hamburger</b></h2><br>As much as I love a hamburger, I think a special occasion needs sophisticated taste at the table, but even more than fine food, asensitive taste in living can make the whole future a special occasion.<br><br>When I am hungry I especially enjoy a smorgasbord. A smorgasbord is always an adventure to me. I can find my favorite foods along the way, and at the same time I can explore for possibilities of new tongue treats. Selecting can be as much fun as eating. In the selecting I wouldn't for a moment want any one of you to sample the sour food found so often today in the decaying parts of our society, but I also hope we will not hang on to a horse-and-buggy taste. I am thankful for a prophet who sees beyond the frostings, for men and women on this campus who have been great ideals to me and who have lifted mytaste, and for those in the Church who havebeen such great examples.<br><br>When I was a Boy Scout I had such an example in my Scout leader Bill Dunn. He convinced us that Troop 41 was the best troop in the whole world. We had to be the best to be in the troop. We loved the man.<br><br>During deer-hunting season Bill Dunn wentup into the mountains and bagged a deer for a big barbecue behind the church. We had a long table loaded with food, and I couldn't resist biting into a big venison sandwich before I reached the end of the table, where Bill stood with a big jug of juice. I didn't know it was apple cider--something I had hated from my earliest recollection. Who wanted to drink old rotten apples? It was simply an icky taste. I said a little limerick in my youth that went like this:<br><br><i>There was a young lady from Pied;</i><br><i>From eating green apples she died.</i><br><i>  While in the lamented,</i><br><i>  The apples fermented.</i><br><i>Now there is cider inside her inside.</i><br><br>And I didn't want any cider inside my inside.<br><br>I lifted my tin cup to Bill, and he filled it. One sip and my nose wrinkled all the way out to my ears--"Why, that's apple cider," Isputtered.<br><br>Bill had a cup in his hand, and he gulped down half the cup with one swallow and said, "Oh boy, isn't it good!" and down went the rest of the drink. I have loved apple cider ever since!<br><br>I usually pass by most of the special cheeseplates on a smorgasbord, but seldom without thought. When someone says, "Food for thought," I think cheese. For more than three-dozen years the thought of a refrigerator containing cheese has been stuck into my head with a glue stronger than Elmer's. A friend with high enthusiasm pulled me out to his kitchen to taste a new cheese he had just discovered. In that refrigerator he had at least twenty-one different kinds of cheese. My expertise hadn't gone much beyond ­noting the difference between cheddar and limburger, and as I tasted one of his great discoveries, I could not taste anything special about it. But I well remember him standing by that refrigerator and his radiation of pleasure.<br><br>The thought that has stuck with me for more than three decades is that he was sensitive enough to know the differences among twenty-one different pieces of cheese. That one refrigerator changed my life--not in tasting cheese but in portent. I will always be grate­ful to a friend for offering me more than a ­hamburger in hiskitchen.<br><h2><b>Going the Second Mile</b></h2><br>Some of you will live hamburger lives into many tomorrows. Some of you will partake of a smorgasbord that has twenty-one different flavors. Some of you may be leaving BYU better nourished than others, but there has been something more to chew on here at BYU than can be found in most universities<br><br>I didn't come for that "something" any more than I went into my friend's kitchen to enjoy cheese. I came to BYU to learn about art, and I learned more about art than I expected under the warm heart and talented brush of B. F. Larsen. But I am even more thankful in 1982 for the many "somethings" beyond art that I learned at BYU. The spiritual element has many dimensions. Not only was it an important seasoning in most classes I attended, but itreached out beyond classes.<br><br>For instance, I never took a chemistry class from Professor Joseph K. Nicholes--I can't even remember how I came to meet him here at BYU. We were all just part of the BYU family. He passed away many years ago, but I never walk this campus without feeling Brother Nicholes walking with me. I respect him; I'd like him to respect me.<br><br>One of the most important days of my life was the day we came out of an assembly in the Joseph Smith Building and he put his arm around my shoulders to give me a piece of advice. That commodity is dished out in extra servings during commencement days, but I do not remember giving him the slightest resistance. I do remember the earnestness in his face as he searched my eye for recognition that I understood. The war was on, and many of us had enlisted in the service, but we had been given the opportunity to come back to BYU to finish our bachelor's degrees with an increased emphasis on military subjects, such as math. Then we were to go on to officer training. The program was abruptly terminated, as more men were needed overseas. The assembly was our farewell at BYU before going down to the train for basic-training destinations.<br><br>Professor Nicholes convinced me in that thoughtful moment after the assembly that I should try to employ a little scripture from the Sermon on the Mount that urges us to go the second mile (see Matthew 5:41). (That's rather a risky thing to do if the enemy is only a mile away! Of course there is the second mile in the other direction.) It is said that if you cast your bread upon the water it will return a thousandfold. (Now what in the world can you do with a thousandfold of wet, soggy bread? Perhaps instead of hot dogs, the Marriott Center could sell sog dogs.) In the smorgasbord of experiences here at BYU during my student days, Ifelt a deep regard for faculty guidance; they fed me well at the banquet that is BYU. They fed me more than the bread of life. Perhaps Brother Nicholes believed that the military is a kind of conformity, different than that of the Jews but at least a denial of the important concept of free agency. The second mile breaks the mental--if not physical--­bindings, and a new spirit frees the man in anywalk of life.<br><br>We could elect our branch of service, and I chose the engineers, hoping I could get into mapping. I didn't know that I really elected the combat engineers, who go ahead of the infantry to clear the mines, build the bridges, etc., etc.! In combat, no engineer dies of boredom.<br><br>When I arrived at Fort Leonard Wood, as I sat on my bunk contemplating Brother Nicholes, I noticed some men at the other end of the barracks trying to learn the names of the parts of a gun. I said to myself, "Brother Nicholes, let's get to work on your idea." Ifound a piece of cardboard, and I made a drawing of a rifle and labeled all the parts. Thenew recruits tacked it to the wall.<br><br>It just so happened that the commanding officer of the unit came by on a quick inspection and found these soldiers studying the chart. He stopped and asked where it came from; they pointed down to me. He asked me many questions, including why I had made it.<br><br>The next day he called me into his office and said, "I just noticed your name on the KP list. Now there's no sense putting artistic hands in all that dirty dishwater. Why don't you report to the dayroom instead. We need a little blue sky painted behind the model of the bridge. When you are finished, take the day off."<br><br>I was through in half an hour. The man who took my place was awakened at three in the morning, and he cut butter for thousands and thousands of men--butter, butter, butter, all day long. Some thought that I had buttered up the colonel. I tried to show them the Bible connection, but I could not sell them on the idea. (Did you ever hear about the Buddhist that sold Bibles for his bread and "buddah"?)<br><br>During basic training I never did a single "dirty detail." Brother Nicholes was so effective I was embarrassed. But the main event came when I was called to the colonel's office for the last time. Each time I had reported, a new delight awaited me. This time the colonel said that he had just received an allotment for eight men to go to a photogrammetry school in Washington, D.C., and that I could have first choice if I wanted it. I grabbed the chance with both hands and all teeth. I have to acknowledge that it was Professor Nicholes who picked me out of 8,000 men at Fort Leonard Wood.<br><br>Leaving the combat engineers, I became a mapmaker in Washington while the men I trained with at Leonard Wood went to Tunisia and fought in those terrible battles on the Tunisian mountains. Sixty percent of them lost their lives in the first month. I wasn't afraid of losing my life, but I have always felt that Brother Nicholes spared it. I was a missionary in Hawaii when Pearl Harbor was bombed, and my companion and I were fully committed to defending with our lives, if necessary, the freedoms of America. Brother Nicholes increased my perceptions of freedom; he also made it so easy.<br><br>After Washington we were sent to Louisiana in error. "Who are you?" was the first Louisiana question.<br><br>"Photogrammetrists," we replied.<br><br>"Don't know anything about photogrammetry; we distribute petroleum," they said. While we were waiting for our overseas assignment, I walked around the base looking for something that Nicholes and I could do. Not much was there except a note on a bulletin board telling of a test that afternoon for a GI driver's license. I went down; no other candidates were there. They were glad to see someone, so I received extra help in learning how to drive a huge truck around the test pylons. It wasn't an expert performance, but they awarded me an official license that authorized me to drive any army vehicle except a tank.<br><br>Meanwhile, some brass decided that they couldn't have all these men just sitting around doing nothing, and somehow they decided that the swamps of Louisiana were worth guarding. It was muddy at that time of the year--mud, mud, mud, up to the knees in some places. The newly assigned guards mucked around their posts for two hours and then came back to the guardhouse for a four-hour rest. It was an unpleasant, dirty job.<br><br>At the original briefing meeting it was asked if anyone had a GI driver's license. Guess who was the only one?<br><br>"Okay, you are the driver."<br><br>When I picked up the guards two hours later, they were so muddy I wouldn't let them get in the clean cab with me. Back at the guardhouse, while they tried to clean the guck from clothing and rifles, I stretched out on a bunk in clean, dry clothing and read a book. Brother Nicholes helped me read as many books in the army as I did in school. Many thought I was the biggest goofer they knew, but when Iopened the Bible again to show the way, they turned aside and went out for hamburgers.<br><br>Brother Nicholes gave me many wonderful gifts during the war: Christmas vacation with my family, a special leave to take my family home before leaving for overseas, extra trips to see the Taj Mahal, a trip around the world, a return from overseas months in advance of most men in our mapping unit, etc., etc.<br><br>During a transfer from India to Okinawa by way of Kearns, Utah (an overseas replacement center just out of Salt Lake City), we were idle, awaiting flying orders out of California. It was time for a stroll with Brother Nicholes, and when I saw a sign saying Engineers Office, I walked in and said I knew something about engineering and asked if there was anything I could do for them. They fell over in a dead faint, saying, "Yes," on the way down. I believe the engineers had the only air-conditioned office on the base.<br><br>A month later the war ended, and every man in my unit was sent east to man the separation centers for returning servicemen--with my <i>single</i> exception. They crossed my name off the shipping list: "He's got a job here." The trains pulled out, and I was left behind in Salt Lake--where my wife was living at home.<br><br>Later it was discovered that the Salt Lake airport needed to be enlarged, and maps of the underground systems could not be found. The responsibility was given to me, and with four assistants we moved closer to SaltLake--­giving me an hour more per day with my ­family. Ilived at home for the last months ofmy military service.<br><br>When I told Brother Nicholes about the dozens of great things that had happened to me while following his counsel, he didn't look a bit surprised. A single idea from this campus changed my life. That idea also presented me with my position at BYU with Travel Study.<br><h2><b>The BYU Smorgasbord</b></h2><br>I asked the students in a BYU class many years ago if they would write a one-page paper on their most aesthetic or sensitive experience. I planned to use these papers as a springboard in exploring a smorgasbord of art and the idea of appreciation.<br><br>One of the students wrote:<br><br><i>I am in love! This is the deepest aesthetic experience I have ever had. Surely the realization of being in love with someone is one of the deepest of human emotions. Some may say this is not an aesthetic experience, but I think it most certainly is. It's the same feeling of awe and wonder and joy that one feels upon seeing, hearing, or reading something beautiful but magnified ten thousand times. It's beautiful. It's soul moving--soul engrossing--and isn't that what an aesthetic feeling is, after all?</i><br><br><i> I have often been moved by the beauty of a deep, soft, magical snowfall or the white enclosed emptiness of a crystalline fog or the beautiful, wild feeling that being in the country on a cloudy day gives me. (Cloudy days are infinitely more varied and moving than straight sunshine.) I have often felt a sympathetic rush of feeling at hearing some unexpectedly lovely line of poetry or a beautiful passage of music. I love the designs in oil slicks or peeling bark, the ­iridescent colors of beetles and waterfalls and flowers and insects. I love my pretty little pet chameleon, with his long, delicate toes and his brown and emerald coloring. I can lose myself in front of a sculpture, a painting, a ceramic pot, or a piece of weaving. To quote the popular song, "These are a few of my favorite things." I love such things; I am moved by them. But there is no feeling like the feeling of love for another human being. The realization that one is in tune with another soul, that one is seeing beyond the outward appearance into the essence of a person, is a greater experience than ­seeing the essence of a sunset or a poem, lovely as these are.</i><br><br><i> The feeling that one loves another--and is loved in return--is the most profound and beautiful and moving feeling in the world.</i><br><br>I read this to the class, and when I looked up, etched on almost every male face was the expression "Where do I find that girl?" Their eyes were searching the faces of the girls in the room--not for the color of her hair nor the shape of her nose. They were looking for a ­person who had found at least twenty-one different ways of enjoying life. Who wouldn't want to share a smorgasbord of life with her? By the way, I wrote her some years later and asked if I could quote her paper. She gave an affirmative response but added, "When I wrote that paper I thought I was in love. After three years of marriage with this special man, I'm <i>really</i> in love!"<br><br>As I sat in a doctor's office thumbing through some old magazines, I saw an article that asked, "Would you marry the same person again?" The article quoted several wives. One said:<br><br><i>When I first met him, he was already in love. After seven years of marriage, he still is. My husband is in love with life. My husband never met anybody he didn't like. He loves a baby--a baby anything. He loves sun, sea, sand, the flowers--and the weeds. He loves the grass, also the crabgrass. He can never quite get over the fact that anything as wonderful as being alive has happened to him. </i><b><i>It is pure joy to live with a man like that.</i></b><br><br>How many of you graduates are such a man?<br><br>Last January I left with forty-nine students and faculty members for London with a BYU study abroad program. What a smorgasbord of experience that creation is! Living almost around the clock with students also provides a different relationship than we usually have here on campus. This was my fourth study abroad assignment with BYU, and these six-month programs have given me an unusual opportunity for observing students close at hand--in the classroom and the dining room; during family nights and testimony meetings; while touring Europe and Israel, crying on shoulders, laughing at problems, staying overnight in an ancient castle, and so forth--and fostering attachments as close as one's own family.<br><br>Some of the students are so near to angel status that the blessings of being near them is personally exhilarating. Some work so hard trying to absorb all the multifaceted educational opportunities of that environment. I have learned much just by tasting the splashes from their plates. I often enjoy quoting a line from Plutarch that he wrote after studying the lives of the great: "The mind is less a vessel to be filled than a fire to be kindled" (from his essay "On Listening to Lectures," in <i>Moralia</i>). I have felt kindled in their presence; I have felt their own kindling in Europe's impressive presence. Ihope you have been truly kindled at BYU.<br><br>Some students only toy with the feast of ideas from the European smorgasbord. Perhaps they were too anchored with the drive-in familiarities of home, and they may have been like the man sitting across the table on a rolling ship at sea. As the man's face became more and more green, he finally rose from his chair, saying, "Please excuse me. I have a previous dinner engagement coming up."<br><br>And sometimes there is one who has not found the scriptural implications of a "communion of Saints." How should a student abroad represent BYU and the Church? How will you in the years ahead reflect your affiliation with this campus and an affinity with its destiny?<br><br>As our London students were waiting for an airplane, an elderly gentleman from England came over to me and said that he had been watching our students for some time, and he felt he must tell me how impressed he was with these students--with how they were dressed as well as with their manners and their conversation. He felt that if all young people in the world were like these students, all of our problems would be solved. He told me how lucky I was to travel in such an environment. Many times compliments have come about our students and Travel Study programs. I love BYU and the Church, and it is always a joy to me to hear these positive reflections on institutions that I treasure.<br><br>On a ship in the middle of the Black Sea just a few days ago, I sat at a table with some other passengers, and they knew from my program on the ship that I was with BYU Travel Study. They couldn't wait to tell me that the best part of the world's fair that they had recently seen in Tennessee was the performance of the Young Ambassadors from BYU. They reported in glowing terms about the quality of these young people and how they had performed.<br><br>Lu Sargent in the U.S. Embassy in Beijing told a BYU Travel Study group that she suspected the reason we had the best hotel in town (tourists have no hotel choice--the government assigns as they please) was because the Beijing authorities had been so tremendously impressed with a BYU performing group.<br><br>When I sat nervously at the apex of a long oval table to have my entrance oral examination for the Stanford graduate school, the first question asked was where I had taken my bachelor's degree. When I answered, "BYU," another faculty member said, "We have never had a poor BYU man yet; I have no further questions." I was out in five minutes; the candidate ahead of me was questioned for more than forty minutes.<br><br>I have always been grateful for the BYU graduates who went ahead of me. As you go forth, how will you represent these significant institutions and prepare the way for those who follow?<br><br>When I thought that a few of our study abroad students were below par in their appearance, I made a few comments in class. Later, around the corner, I overheard one of the students declaring with steel in her voice, "No one is going to dictate to me. I'll wear what I please!" Another student defended my presentation, and the steel-voiced one lashed out at her. I noticed she did not speak to my defendant for more than a week. When I have steel in my voice, I cannot savor tender morsels.<br><br>I have learned in observing the lives of many students that when we drop BYU ideals before or after graduation, we inescapably lose some of our sense of taste. I am often surprised at the resistance of those who oppose BYU dress standards. If Jesus invited the Twelve to have the Last Supper at my house, I doubt I would serve hamburgers or come in hamburger dress. Nor could I wear hamburger dress to meet President SpencerW. Kimball or to represent BYU. If we are not sensitive enough to appreciate the contributions of BYU in both the academic and spiritual things of our lives, we certainly reveal our insensitivity when we bite the hand that feeds. Who is so hungry to bite the hand of a prophet?<br><h2><b>Hungering and Thirsting After Learning</b></h2><br>When the assignment came to guide President Kimball through an Egyptian museum, I immediately thought, "What could I teach a prophet?" I needed not fear; President Kimball had been a student all his life. A bachelor's degree was not dessert. He wanted to savor each artifact in the museum; he leaned forward with a hunger for learning that anyone with or without a degree might well emulate. President Kimball is a perfect example of one who hungers and thirsts after righteousness (see Matthew 5:6), who hungers and thirsts after learning and appreciating. Your lives are surrounded with such examples, some sitting with you at these tables.<br><br>I wish you could have looked with me through my perceptions of the study abroad students of these past years as they have in an intimate environment revealed their tastes and talents. You would be convinced of the virtues of hungering and thirsting. You would be convinced of the values of exploring--­sensitively--the smorgasbord of educational experiences. You would be convinced of the flavor to life found in the arts. You would be convinced of the meager potential of hamburger lives.<br><br>Some students delighted in enriching their minds; others delighted in decorating their bodies. Jewelry, cosmetics, faded jeans, and hairstyles are no sin, but it is so clearly evident that an emphasis on surface decoration is as debilitating to the real meat of life as it is to the first principle of art design. The most important learning of all my experiences is that sensitive facets under the surface promote the greatest banquet in our lives.<br><br>The monotony of surface conformity reminds me of Louis Untermeyer ­writing about one of America's popular poets. Untermeyer was not attacking the family when he syndicated "The Old Woman Who Lived in a Shoe" as much as he was attacking the hamburger status we give the arts as well as the family and its members. He wrote:<br><br><i>It takes a heap o' children to make a home that's true,</i><br><i>And a home can be a palace grand or just a plain, old shoe;</i><br><i>But if it has a mother dear and good old dad or two,</i><br><i>Why, that's the sort of good old home for good old me and you.</i><br><br>Untermeyer concluded a few stanzas later:<br><br><i>And when he thinks (as may occur), this thought will please him best:</i><br><i>That ninety million think the same--including Eddie Guest.</i><br>["Edgar A. Guest Considers 'The Old Woman Who Lived in a Shoe' and the Good Old Verities at the Same Time," in Untermeyer, <i>Collected Parodies</i> (New York: Harcourt, Brace and Company, 1926), 54]<br><br>We reveal an insensitive taste when we conform to a grubby fad of 90 million; we also do the Church a disservice if we regiment our learnings on this campus to freeze our tastes for the virtue and achievements of those not of this campus nor of our faith. We are not asked before or after graduation to be the dressing of a bunch of turkeys or to camouflage the banner of the gospel's truths.<br><br>As we look forward from 1982, may we savor the ambrosia of an exciting future without losing the simplicity of a bowl of broth at the Last Supper. May we be sensitive enough to avoid a betrayal of trusts with a sop in the dish of the yearnings of our prophet, the goals of BYU, the aspirations of parents, and the sensitive spirit within each of us, I­earnestly pray.<br><br><i>Richard L. Gunn was a BYU professor of art ­history when this address was given on 19 August 1982 ata banquet for graduating students.</i>

<h1>el and Romantic Love - Bruce C. Hafen - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I once heard President Holland tell about a conversation he overheard between two freshman women talking about their favorite subject. One of them said, "Do you believe in college marriage?" The other replied, "Well, yeah, if the colleges really love each other." I would like to believe that there are no two colleges anywhere who "love each other" more than BYU and Ricks. I am in love with both places and consider both as my home. I must admit I think it is a blessing to the BYU campus to have several thousand former Ricks students here. The blessings also flow the other way, as we at Ricks are continually assisted in many ways by our BYU friends. When you catch cold in Provo, we sneeze in Rexburg. When you itch, we scratch. Indeed, when your able academic vice president, Jae Ballif, was given the title of "Provost" at the BYU campus, we immediately began to consider if our academic vice president should be called our "Rexburgst."<br><br>I'd like to say just a word about President Holland. For all his abundant gifts of personality and intellect, I think the core of Jeff Holland's soul is essentially spiritual. I believe the Lord has brought him here for a mission that is primarily spiritual in nature. He and Pat will bless this campus now and for years to come with their own unique blend of spiritual courage, insight, and devotion. Happily, the Lord has prepared the two of them in such a way that the intellectual life of this campus will only be made richer by the abundant brand of spiritual life the Hollands inspire.<br><br>Today's audience includes a few students who were at Ricks College earlier this year when I talked about "The Gospel and Romantic Love." I apologize to them because I am talking on that subject again today. I would add, however, that it is primarily because of the response of the Ricks students that I feel impressed to give this talk here. As I do so, I pray for inspiration, not only because of the importance and sensitivity of the subject, but also because of my great love and respect for the students of Brigham Young University.<br><br>Elder Boyd K. Packer once said to a group of students on this campus:<br><br><i>The powers awakened earlier in your life have been growing. You have been responding to them, probably clumsily, but they now form themselves into a restlessness that cannot be ignored. You are old enough now to fall in love--not the puppy love of the elementary years, not the confused love of the teens, but the full-blown love of eligible men and women, newly matured, ready for life. I mean romantic love, with all the full intense meaning of the word, with all of the power and turbulence and frustration, the yearning, the restraining, and all of the peace and beauty and sublimity of love. No experience can be more beautiful, no power more compelling, more exquisite. Or if misused, no suffering is more excruciating than that connected with love.</i>["<a href="https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/boyd-k-packer_eternal-love/"><span style="color: #33cccc;">Eternal Love</span></a>," BYU Fireside, 3 November 1963]<br><br>In approaching this topic, I feel I am walking on holy ground. This subject, delicate as it is, inspires my deepest reverence. The idea of romantic love, so commonplace that it is touched upon in virtually every book or movie or magazine, is also at the very center of the gospel of Jesus Christ. It is one of the greatest of God's laws that a man shall "leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh" (Genesis 2:24). As Elder Packer put it, "Romantic love is not only a part of life, but literally a dominating influence of it. It is deeply and significantly religious. There is no abundant life without it. Indeed, the highest degree of the celestial kingdom is unobtainable in the absence of it."<br><br>The other side of this coin, of course, is represented by what Alma told his wayward son, Corianton, who had gone after the Lamanite harlot Isabel. He said to his son: "Know ye not ... that these things are an abomination in the sight of the Lord; yea, most abominable above all sins save it be the shedding of innocent blood or denying the Holy Ghost?" (Alma 39:5).<br><br>I once saw, at close range, the face of a faithful father who had just learned that his handsome and promising young son had violated the law of chastity and that the boy's immature young girlfriend was pregnant. I'll never forget the look in that man's eyes as it dawned on him that his child of promise had willfully rejected what his parents had taught and what they wanted him to be. The father just sat in stunned silence, staring sadly at the rain outside his window in a grief that knew no comfort. As the tears ran freely down his face, he asked himself out loud: "Why? Why would he turn his back on all he knows to be right?" There came no answer but the gentle sound of the falling rain.<br><br>Why indeed? Why such a commandment? Sometimes we give as reasons for the law of chastity the risk of pregnancy or abortion, the possibility of an unwanted or embarrassing marriage, or the chance of a terrible venereal disease. With adultery, we talk about the damage of destroying an existing marriage or family. As serious as these things are, I'm not sure they are the fundamental reason for the Lord's having placed this commandment ahead of armed robbery, fraud, and kidnapping in the seriousness of sins. Think of it--unchastity is second only to murder. Perhaps there is a common element in those two things--unchastity and murder. Both have to do with<i>life,</i>which touches upon the highest of divine powers. Murder involves the wrongful<i>taking</i>of life; sexual transgression may involve the wrongful<i>giving</i>of life, or the wrongful tampering with the sacred fountains of life-giving power. Perhaps we should not expect the reasons for this commandment to be fully understandable to our finite minds. So often with our deepest feelings of joy or testimony or gratitude, we may attempt to describe their meaning with words, but our words fail us when we try to plumb the depths of those precious things that are too sacred, too significant, and even too mysterious to be susceptible to quickly understood explanations. Why is nature so exquisitely beautiful and full of harmony? Why do our hearts respond to the sight of little children laughing? Why, especially, do our hearts respond to overflowing when those little children we see laughing before us are our very own children? All we know is that God himself has said, time after time, over all the generations of man, "Thou shalt love thy wife with all thy heart, and shalt cleave unto her and none else" (D&amp;amp;C 42:22), "Thou shalt not ... commit adultery, ... nor do anything like unto it" (D&amp;amp;C 59:6).<br><br>I have been around enough to know that this is not the first time you have ever heard this subject mentioned from the pulpit. But I have also been around enough to know, especially recently, that no matter what you have heard and no matter how often, today we live in a world so completely soaked through with tragically wrong and evil ideas about sex that you must be<i>warned</i>--in love and kindness, but warned--lest the moral sleeping sickness that has overcome this nation's atmosphere claim you into deadly slumber. There have always been violators of the moral code, but the last few years have witnessed in this country a staggering revolution in sexual attitudes. Our social norms apparently began to unravel during the unrest of the 1960s, among students to start with. Research shows that in the period from 1970 to 1975, the number of college students who accepted the practice of premarital sex grew from about 50 percent to nearly 90 percent (Katz and Cronin, "Sexuality and College Life,"<i>Change,</i>February–March 1980, p. 44). College students are the most permissive of all groups, and they are<i>your</i>peer group. You cannot help being influenced by their general attitudes.<br><br>It would be of no help to you, by the way, to seek counsel about sexual norms in America from a typical professional therapist. The American Psychiatric Association recently voted to remove homosexuality from its list of disorders, even though one study pointed out by our own Allen Bergin showed that 50 percent of the male homosexuals surveyed in one American city had at least 500 sexual partners and 28 percent of them had had 1,000 partners (see "Bringing the Restoration to the Academic World: Clinical Psychology As a Test Case,"<i>BYU Studie</i>s 19 [1979]: 449, 464). If that is normal behavior, we've got problems. A representative of today's mainstream attitude among psychotherapists recently wrote in a professional journal that most people in his field believe "that human disturbance is largely associated with and springs from absolutistic thinking--from dogmatism, inflexibility, and that [being extremely religious] is essentially emotional disturbance" (Ellis, "Psychotherapy and Religious Values,"<i>Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology</i>48 [1980]: 635). In other words, the way to relieve one's guilt about an immoral life is to begin believing there is no such thing as an immoral life. Whatever you want to do is moral if you want to do it. This same psychologist expressed his concern about the mental stability of people who commit themselves to "unequivocal loyalty to any interpersonal commitments, especially marriage." You can imagine what this man and his professional associates would think of temple marriage. The same attitudes are springing up everywhere in other fields. I've done a lot of reading in my own field of law; I've read widely in the social sciences. It's now simply a fact that most of those who write and most of those who produce today's movies, TV programs, and popular music, as well as those who set the editorial policies of many national magazines, believe that sex outside of marriage is really quite harmless, if not rather healthy. I recently heard Mormon filmmaker Keith Merrill express his opinion that today's movie producers have no more hesitation about showing sexual acts on the screen than they do about showing people eating dinner.<br><br>Something deep within our national soul has gone wrong, brothers and sisters, and it cannot help but influence our attitudes and dull our normal senses in frightening ways. Twenty years ago there was much public support for the things you and I believe in, despite some occasional straying from those principles. All that is different now. Now we are almost suffocated by a dense fog of sensuality. Kenneth Kolson has described this basic change in national attitude in talking about<i>Playboy</i>magazine:<br><br><i>While</i>Playboy<i>is much the same thing that it was during the 1950's, it is not</i>exactly<i>the same thing, and the difference is crucial. During the 50's, there was, of course, pornography. We used to get it at the newsstand from the old man with the black cigar who would produce it, literally, from "under-the-counter." Sometimes it would circulate through the boys' locker room--usually pictures of fat</i>[women]<i>with missing teeth. It was available, all right, but one came by it</i>["out behind the barn," so to speak].<i>But now that the</i>Playboy<i>philosophy has been declared innocent by the grand jury of public opinion, now that it "is involved in the mainstream of our culture and values," it is acquired, and consumed, as thoughtlessly as a pound of bologna. You pack Mildred and the kids in the station wagon, buzz down to the local drugstore, plunk your two bucks down on the counter, and bring home artful pictures of young women who have straight teeth, deep suntans, and college educations. Every one of them is a former cheerleader, a current jogger, concerned about ecology. Middle class. When you get home, you throw your copy on the coffee table promiscuously</i>[alongside<i>Time</i>and<i>Newsweek</i>],<i>a public pronouncement that</i>you<i>buy</i>Playboy<i>for the literature. It's true: the difference between the 50's and</i>[today]<i>is that we don't give pornography a second thought any more.</i>[<i>Chronicles of Culture,</i>September–October 1979, p. 18]<br><br>And that is exactly what has gone wrong. We don't give it a second thought. The attitude of acceptance here and what I've seen in Europe is so widespread that there is nothing to compare with it in the last several centuries, in any civilized society; not since Rome, not since Sodom and Gomorrah.<br><br>The enormous scope of the drift is what makes it so treacherous. Even as we are surrounded by abnormality, everything somehow seems so normal. As written by Pascal:<br><br><i>When everything is moving at once, nothing appears to be moving, as on board ship. When everyone is moving towards depravity, no one seems to be moving, but if someone stops, he shows up the others who are rushing on, by acting as a fixed point.</i>[Blaise Pascal,<i>Pensées,</i>vol. 33 (Chicago: Encyclopaedia Britannica, Great Books of the Western World, 1952)]<br><br>We--you and I--must be that fixed point.<br><br>I want you to know that it isn't easy for me to paint such an extreme picture. I am usually a pretty calm and reasonable guy. But on this particular subject of sexual morality, I honestly believe our society is within the grip of the evil one, even in the moment when so many Americans feel more "free" than ever before. There is a reason why the scriptures record the word<i>devilish</i>after the words<i>carnal</i>and<i>sensual.</i>We read in the Pearl of Great Price that "Satan came among them, ... and they loved Satan more than God. And men began from that time forth to be carnal, sensual, and devilish" (Moses 5:13). And then when Cain slew Abel, he said, "I am free" (Moses 5:33). Cain was never more in bondage than when he said, "I am free." In exactly the same way, the American people have never been in greater moral bondage than in this time when they glory in being "free" to pursue pleasure in any form they fancy as if there will never be any tomorrow.<br><br>Can you see why the Brethren tell us to stay away from X- and R-rated movies? Can you see why they plead with us to avoid drugs, alcohol, vulgar music, and the other products of the carnal environment that now surrounds us almost as water surrounds the fish of the sea? These aren't trivial things, brothers and sisters. This isn't just a modern version of a fussy Victorian concern about bobby sox, social dancing, and driving over twenty miles an hour. This is not just Coke and makeup and nylons for twelve-year-olds. If the H-bomb symbolizes our age, we are playing now not just with fire, but with nuclear power. The prince of darkness has dragged out the heavy artillery. He is no longer limited to arrows and swords and BB guns. Now he is Darth Vader, with laser guns, light speeds, and the Death Star. We are near the end of a fight to the finish, and no holds are barred.<br><br>Let me talk now, on the other hand, about the more positive aspects of the law of chastity, because that part of the law is fundamental and important. Elder Packer said,<br><br><i>Oh, youth, the requirements of the Church are the highway to love, with guardrails securely in place, with help along the way. How foolish is the youth who feels the Church is a fence around love to keep him out. How fortunate is the young person who follows the standards of the Church, even if just from sheer obedience or habit, for he will find rapture and a joy fulfilled.</i><br><br>I'd like to read a provocative statement about the positive side of the law of chastity from an English writer:<br><br><i>Never was an age more sentimental, more devoid of real feeling, more exaggerated in false feeling, than our own. ... The</i>[TV]<i>and the film are mere counterfeit emotion all the time, the current press and literature the same. People wallow in emotion: counterfeit emotion. They lap it up: they live in it and on it....</i><br><br><i>... A young couple fall in counterfeit love, and fool themselves and each other completely. But, alas, counterfeit love is good cake but bad bread. It produces a fearful emotional indigestion....</i><br><br><i>... The peculiar hatred of people who have not loved one another, but who have pretended to, ... is one of the phenomena of our time....</i><br><br>... [But there is a]<i>profound instinct of fidelity in a man, which is, as shown by world-history, just a little deeper and more powerful than his instinct of faithless sexual promiscuity. ... The instinct of fidelity is perhaps the deepest instinct in the great complex we call sex. Where there is real sex there is the underlying passion for fidelity. And the prostitute knows this, because she is up against it. She can only keep men who</i>[want the counterfeit: and these men]<i>she despises....</i><br><br><i>... The</i>[Chief Thinkers of our generation know]<i>nothing of</i>[this].<i>To</i>[them,]<i>all sex is infidelity and only infidelity is sex. Marriage is sexless, null. Sex is only manifested in infidelity, and the queen of sex is the chief prostitute....</i><br><br><i>This is the teaching of the ... Chief Thinkers of our generation. And the vulgar public agrees with them entirely. Sex is a thing you don't have except to be naughty with. Apart from ... infidelity and fornication, sex doesn't exist....</i><br><br>[However, the truth is that the Christian]<i>Church created marriage by making it a sacrament, a sacrament of man and woman united in ... communion, ... and never to be separated, except by death. And even when separated by death, still not freed from the marriage. ... Marriage, making one complete body out of two incomplete ones, and providing for the complex development of the man's soul and the woman's soul in unison, throughout a life-time. Marriage sacred and inviolable, the great way of earthly fulfilment for man and woman, in unison....</i><br><br><i>... And this, this oneness gradually accomplished throughout a life-time in twoness, is the highest achievement of time or eternity. From it all things human spring, children and beauty and well-made things; all the true creations of humanity. ... The will of God is that He wishes this, this oneness, to take place, fulfilled over a lifetime....</i><br><br><i>... The oneness of ... man and woman in marriage completes the universe, as far as humanity is concerned, completes the streaming of the sun and the flowing of the stars.</i>[D. H. Lawrence,<i>Essays on Sex, Literature and Censorship</i>(New York: Twayne, 1953), pp. 96–111]<br><br>Properly understood, then, the scriptures counsel us to be virtuous not because romantic love is bad, but precisely because romantic love is so good. It is not only good; it is pure, precious, even sacred and holy. For that reason, one of Satan's cheapest and dirtiest tricks is to make profane that which is sacred. Building on a metaphor from President Harold B. Lee, it is as though Satan holds up to the world a degraded image of sexual love suggested by imagining the drunken, boisterous laughter of filthy men in a brothel, located on some crowded, dusty highway of life, where the flower of fair womanhood is jeered at, dirtied, brutalized, and ultimately crushed with unclean hands. Meanwhile, far, far away from the madding crowd, high up in the cool protected valleys of tall mountains, grows the priceless flower of virtue--untarnished, pure, and unsullied. It waits as a noble prize for those valiant few who are willing to climb to its heights by paying the price of patience, obedience, and a lifetime of devotion--an endless, unselfish loyalty to spouse and children.<br><br>May I suggest now eight brief, practical steps for those who would one day be true sweethearts, based on a foundation of righteous living.<br><br>First, have reverence for the human body and the life-giving powers of that body. That basic attitude is what I have hoped to convey in most of what I have said today. Your body is a temple. It is sacred and holy. Have the same reverence for it that you have for any temple that seeks to be the dwelling place for the Spirit of the Lord. It is also the dwelling place of the seeds of human life, the nurturing of which, with your chosen companion, within the bounds set by God himself, is lovely, of good report, and praiseworthy.<br><br>Second, during the time of courtship, please be emotionally honest in the expression of affection. Sometimes you are not as careful as you might be about when, how, and to whom you express your feelings of affection. You must realize that the desire to express affection can be motivated by other things than true love. As Erich Fromm put it,<br><br>Desire<i>can be stimulated by the anxiety of aloneness, by the wish to conquer or be conquered, by vanity, by the wish to hurt and even to destroy, as much as it can be stimulated by love. It seems that sexual desire can easily blend with and be stimulated by any strong emotion, of which love is only one. Because sexual desire is in the minds of most people coupled with the idea of love, they are easily misled to conclude that they love each other when they want each other physically. ...</i>[But]<i>if</i>[this]<i>desire ... is not stimulated by love, ... it ... leaves strangers as far apart as they were before--sometimes it makes them ashamed of each other, or even makes them hate each other, because when the illusion has gone they feel their estrangement even more markedly than before.</i>[<i>The Art of Loving</i>(New York: Harper and Row, 1956), pp. 45–46]<br><br>In short, save your kisses--you might need them someday. And when any of you--men or women--are given entrance to the heart of a trusting young friend, you stand on holy ground. In such a place you must be honest with yourself--and with your friend--about love and the expression of its symbols.<br><br>Third, be friends first and sweethearts second. Lowell Bennion once said that relationships between young men and young women should be built like a pyramid. The base of the pyramid is friendship. And the ascending layers are built of things like time, understanding, respect, and restraint. Right at the top of the pyramid is a glittering little mystery called romance. And when weary travelers in the desert see that glitter on top of the pyramid from far off, they don't see what underlies the jewel to give it such prominence and hold it so high. Now, you don't have to be very smart to know that a pyramid won't stand up very long if you stand it on its point instead of its base. In other words, be friends first and sweethearts later, not the other way around. Otherwise, people who think they are sweethearts may discover they can't be very good friends, and by then it may be too late.<br><br>Fourth, develop the power of self-discipline and self-restraint. Please remember that nobody ever fell off a cliff who never went near one. You've got to be like Joseph, not like David. When Potiphar's wife tried to seduce him, the scripture says, Joseph "fled, and got him out" (Genesis 39:12). Joseph knew that it is wiser to avoid temptation than to resist it. King David, by contrast, somehow developed too much confidence in his own ability to handle temptation. He was tragically willing to flirt--to flirt with evil, and it ultimately destroyed him. In your courtships, even when you feel there is a growing foundation of true love, show your profound respect for that love and the possibilities of your life together by restraining your passions. Please don't be deceived by the false notion that anything short of the sex act itself is acceptable conduct. That is a lie, not only because one step overpoweringly leads to another, but also because the handling of another's body is in an important sense part of the sexual act that is kept holy by the sanctuary of chastity. If ever you are in doubt about where the line is between love and lust, draw the line toward the side of love. Nobody ever fell off a cliff who never went near one.<br><br>Fifth, in your searching for the fulfillment of your romantic longings, live for the presence of the Holy Spirit, that you may have it as your constant guide. Don't date someone you already know you would not ever want to marry. If you should fall in love with someone you shouldn't marry, you can't expect the Lord to guide you away from that person after you are already emotionally committed. It is difficult enough to tune your spiritual receiver to the whisperings of heaven without jamming up the channel with the loud thunder of romantic emotion. The key to spiritual guidance is found in one word: worthiness. I won't take time to discuss it now but would urge you, if you want to do a little scripture study, to compare Doctrine and Covenants 63:16–17 with Doctrine and Covenants 121:45–46. You'll find something interesting there. Those who garnish their thoughts with virtue have the Spirit and have confidence in God's presence. Those who have lust in their hearts can't have the Spirit.<br><br>Sixth, avoid the habit of feeling sorry for yourself, and don't worry excessively about those times when you feel socially unsuccessful. Everybody in the world doesn't have to marry you--it only takes one. I remember the experience of a choice young woman who had been very popular and successful in many ways in her hometown. She passed up two or three chances to get serious with young men because she planned to attend college at a Church school, where she expected to find more promising opportunities. After she had been at that school for about six months without a date, however, she began to wonder if she had some loathsome disease. Seeing that experience through her eyes was very sobering for me about the risks we take in any large population center for LDS students, because sheer size and numbers can so easily cause people to make incredibly superficial judgments about others in ways that emphasize appearance above far more important but less obvious factors.<br><br>The opportunities for developing friendships (as sometimes distinguished from having "dates") with members of the opposite sex are very plentiful at a place like BYU and Ricks. Often these relationships lead to more promising possibilities than does the big social whirl. It's also less expensive. In approaching these opportunities, remember: "Worry not that you are not well known. Seek to be worth knowing." The college-age years are a wonderful time in which to experience a variety of human relationships, to go places and do things, to read widely, to find yourself, to develop the roots of spiritual and emotional maturity. To gain this kind of ripeness and growth simply takes time, experience, and effort.<br><br>The discouragement you may feel as another empty Friday night rolls by is often a form of the insecurity we all encounter as we try to find ourselves. Without the apparent approval of your self-worth that comes through social success, you may begin to doubt whether your life is really worthwhile. That kind of self-doubt is only part of a larger problem that accompanies most of us, married or single, all the days of our lives. There are times when we wonder if the Lord loves us; we wonder if other people love us. And so we mistakenly seek the symbols of success--whether that is being popular or being rich or being famous within our own sphere. Sometimes you may let someone take improper liberties with you, or you may indulge yourself in some practice that seems to bring temporary relief but only makes you feel worse in the long run. Some even make poor marriage choices, just to show the world that<i>somebody</i>will have them.<br><br>Ultimately, however, only the Lord's approval of our lives really matters. If you seek to be worth knowing and seek to do his will, all the rest will take care of itself. Never forget that all things work together for good to them who love God (see Romans 8:28). Your time for marriage may not come until the autumn of your life and then, in Elder Packer's phrase: "be more precious for the waiting." Even if your time should not come in this life, the promises of eternal love are still yours in the Lord's view of time if only you are faithful.<br><br>Seventh, avoid at all costs, no matter what the circumstances, abortion and homosexuality. As serious as is fornication or adultery, you must understand that abortion and homosexuality are equally wrong and may be worse. Even persons who only assist others, much less pressure them, to have an abortion are in jeopardy of being denied the privilege of missionary service. They may also be called upon to face a Church court, at the peril of their membership in the Church.<br><br>Eighth, if, through some unfortunate experience in your past, you have committed a moral transgression of the kind we have been talking about today, there is a way by which you may receive full forgiveness. There is no more glorious language in all scripture than the words of Isaiah, speaking as if it were by the voice of the Lord himself:<br><br><i>Though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.</i><br><br><i>If ye be willing and obedient, ye shall eat the good of the land.</i>[Isaiah 1:18–19]<br><br>The steps for the process of repentance are outlined in President Kimball's masterful book<i>The Miracle of Forgiveness.</i>If your transgressions are of the serious kind, you will need to see your bishop and voluntarily offer a full and complete confession. As frightening as that experience may seem to you, by this means you will find purpose and a peace of mind more hopeful and uplifting than you can now imagine. As you wonder how you might stand in the eyes of the Lord after such an experience, I commend to you the counsel of Elder Vaughn Featherstone, who talked in the October 1980 general conference about the repentance process for serious transgressions. The most memorable part of that candid and loving sermon was Elder Featherstone's expression of his attitude toward those who have had the courage and the faith to confess their sins and even face Church discipline, if necessary. Because I so much share Elder Featherstone's feelings, I would like to quote a portion of his remarks:<br><br><i>In Exodus 32, Moses had gone up to the mountain. The children of Israel had fashioned a golden calf with a graving tool. The people offered burnt offerings, and they sat down to eat, drink, and play; and there was great wickedness when Moses came down out of the mountain. He cast the tablets out of his hands, and they were broken; he burned the golden calf and caused the idolaters to be slain.</i><br><br><i>Then, when the people had repented (and that is the key), Moses went back before the Lord and prayed, "Yet now, if thou wilt forgive their sin--; and if not, blot me, I pray thee, out of thy book which thou hast written" (Exodus 32:32).</i><br><br><i>I have listened to possibly a thousand major transgressions; and each time after a truly repentant transgressor has left my office, I have either knelt behind the desk or bowed my head in prayer and said, "Lord, forgive him or her, I pray thee. If not, blot my name also out of thy book. I do not want to be where they aren't, for they are some of the most Christlike people I have ever met."</i><br><br><i>Though their sins be as scarlet, they may become white as the driven snow (see Isaiah 1:18), and the Lord has promised he would remember their sins no more (see D&amp;amp;C 58:42).</i>["<a href="https://www.lds.org/ensign/1980/11/forgive-them-i-pray-thee?lang=eng"><span style="color: #33cccc;">Forgive Them, I Pray Thee</span></a>,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 1980, p. 31]<br><br>I guess one reason I appreciate Elder Featherstone's feelings so much is that those are also my feelings about you. That's why I am willing to take the risk today that maybe you think I'm being too serious. I'm willing to take that chance because I don't want to be where the students of Ricks College and Brigham Young University are not.<br><br>For all that I have said by way of warning about the social conditions of the day or the limits we must place on ourselves, I'd like you to remember that the teachings of the gospel about romantic love are full of hope and peace and joy of the most uplifting and everlasting kind. I will always remember my straight-arrow friend that I met here in Provo who told me he took his fiancée to the bishop for a recommend to be married before they had ever experienced<i>any</i>physical dimension to their relationship--and I mean any!<br><br>After the regular interview, the wise bishop asked them, "Well, do you feel the spark when you hold each other close?"<br><br>My friend was perplexed. "The spark?"<br><br>The bishop tried to explain, but my friend was having trouble catching on. So the bishop<i>assigned</i>them to take one week to see if they had "the spark" in their relationship. He knew they'd figure it out and still remain worthy.<br><br>As my friend told me this story, I couldn't help asking, "Well, what did you find out?"<br><br>He blushed a little bit, and then he said, "Well, we finally fulfilled the assignment."<br><br>They learned the same thing that I have learned, about being sweethearts on the foundation of everlasting friendship and love. I testify to you with all my heart that the commandments of God are designed for our ultimate happiness, and that being sweethearts in the way the Lord intended it is worth waiting for, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Bruce C. Hafen was the president of Ricks College in Rexburg, Idaho, when this devotional address was given at Brigham Young University on 28 September 1982.</i><br><br><i>© Intellectual Reserve, Inc.

<h1>: Meekly Drenched in Destiny - Neal A. Maxwell - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I welcome you to a Christian campus where discipleship and scholarship are uniquely blended. I salute your ecclesiastical and academic leaders, so many of whom are with us tonight. They will serve you exceedingly well.<br><br>My brothers and sisters, as on another occasion at this pulpit, I will speak out of my own strugglings about another unglamorous but very crucial gospel objective. Then, the subject was<i>patience</i>, a virtue which is regarded by some as quite pedestrian but which is essential to our development and happiness.<br><h2><b>A Companion Virtue to Patience</b></h2><br>Our focus tonight will be on<i>meekness</i>, a companion virtue to patience. Meekness, too, is one of the attributes of Deity. Instructively, Jesus, our Lord and Exemplar, called attention to Himself as being "meek and lowly in heart" (Matthew 11:29). Paul extolled the "meekness and gentleness of Christ" (2 Corinthians 10:1). The Greek rendition of the word<i>meek</i>in the New Testament, by the way, is<i>gentle</i>and<i>humble</i>.<br><br>Actually, meekness is not only an attribute essential for itself; Moroni declared that it is also vital because one simply cannot develop those other crucial virtues--faith, hope, and charity--without meekness. In the ecology of the eternal attributes these cardinal characteristics are inextricably bound up together. Among them, meekness is often the initiator, the facilitator, and the consolidator.<br><br>Moreover, if one needs any further persuasion as to how vital this virtue is, Moroni warned, "none is acceptable before God save the meek and the lowly in heart" (Moroni 7:44). If we could but believe, really believe, in the reality of that bold but accurate declaration, you and I would then find ourselves focusing on the crucial rather than the marginal tasks in life! We would then cease pursuing life-styles which, inevitably and irrevocably, are going out of style!<br><br>There would be little reason for speaking to you of meekness if you were not serious candidates for the celestial kingdom. You live in coarsening times, times in which meekness is misunderstood and even despised. Yet meekness has been, is, and will remain a non-negotiable dimension of true discipleship. Its development is a remarkable achievement in any age, but especially in this age.<br><br>Furthermore, whether you realize it or not, you are a generation drenched in destiny. If you are faithful, you will prove to be a part of the winding-up scenes for this world, and as participants, not merely as spectators, though on later occasions you might understandably prefer to be the latter.<br><h2><b>Why So Important?</b></h2><br>Even so, why the stress on meekness? Merely because it is nice to be nice? The reasons are far more deeply imbedded in the "plan of happiness" (Alma 42:8) than that!<br><br>God, who has seen billions of spirits pass through His plan of salvation, has told us to be meek in order to enhance our enjoyment of life and our mortal education. Will we be meek and listen to Him and learn from Him? Or will we be like the Gadarene swine, that pathetic example of<i>totus porcus</i>--going whole hog--after the trends of the moment?<br><br>Perhaps, brothers and sisters, what we brought with us as intelligences into our creation as spirit children constitutes a "given" within which even God must work. Add to that possibility the clear reality of God's deep commitment to our free agency--and we begin to see how essential meekness is! We need to learn so much, and yet we are free to choose (see 2 Nephi 2:27)! How crucial it is to be teachable! There "is no other way" in which God could do what He has declared it is His intent to do. No wonder He and His prophets emphasize meekness time and time again!<br><br>Since God desired to have us become like Himself, He first had to make us free, to learn, to choose, and to experience; hence our humility and teachability are premiere determinants of our progress and our happiness. Agency is essential to perfectibility, and meekness is essential to the wise use of agency--and to our recovery when we have misused our agency.<br><br>Let us not brush by this developmental premise. The scriptures concerning life's purposes do make it clear that we<i>are</i>to become like the Father and His Son, Jesus Christ: "Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect" (Matthew 5:48). "Therefore I would that ye should be perfect even as I, or your Father who is in heaven is perfect" (3 Nephi 12:48). "Therefore, what manner of men [and women] ought ye to be? Verily I say unto you, even as I am" (3 Nephi 27:27). It is an awesome objective--impossible of attainment without meekness.<br><br>The Father and our Savior desire to lead us through love, for if we were merely driven where They wish us to go, we would not be worthy to be there, and, surely, we could not stay there. They are Shepherds, not sheepherders.<br><br>In that premortal council, wherein Jesus<i>meekly</i>volunteered to aid the Father's plan, He said, "Here am I, send me" (Abraham 3:27). It was one of those special moments when a few words are preferred to many. Never has one individual offered, in so few words, to do so much for so many as did Jesus when He<i>meekly</i>proffered Himself as ransom for us, billions and billions of us!<br><br>In contrast, we see in ourselves, brothers and sisters, the unnecessary multiplication of words--not only a lack of clarity, but vanity. Our verbosity is often a cover for insincerity or uncertainty. Meekness, the subtraction of self, reduces the multiplication of words.<br><br>Without meekness, the conversational point we insist on making often takes the form of<i>I</i>, that spearlike, vertical pronoun. Meekness, however, is more than self-restraint; it is the presentation of self in a posture of<i>kindness</i>and<i>gentleness</i>. It reflects certitude, strength, serenity; it reflects a healthy self-esteem and a genuine self-control.<br><br>So in matters little or large, if our emulation of the Lord is to be serious, we must do more than note and admire Jesus' meekness. He passed through "all of these things" which gave Him, too, needed experiences.<br><h2><b>Development Gradual, Sometimes Painful</b></h2><br>However, meekness is one of those attributes acquired only by experience, some of it painful, for it is developed "according to the flesh" (Alma 7:11, 12). It is not an attribute achieved overnight, nor is it certified to in but one exam; rather, it is certified to "in process of time" (Moses 7:21, 68, 69). The Savior said we are to "take up [the] cross daily" (Luke 9:23)--not just once or occasionally--and taking up the cross daily surely requires meekness.<br><br>There is, of course, much accumulated stereo-typing surrounding this virtue. We even make nervous jokes about meekness, such as, "If the meek intend to inherit the earth, they are going to have to be more aggressive about it!" We even tend to think of a meek individual as being used and abused--as being a doormat for others. However, Moses was once described as being the most meek man on the face of the earth (see Numbers 12:3), and we recall his impressive boldness in the courts of Pharaoh and his scalding indignation following his descent from Sinai.<br><br>President Brigham Young, who was tested in many ways and on many occasions, was once tried in a way that required him to "take it"--even from one he adored and admired. Brigham "took it" because he was meek. Yet, surely, none of us sitting here would think of Brigham Young as lacking in boldness or firmness. However, even President Young, in the closing and prestigious days of his life, spent some time in courtrooms being unjustifiably abused. When he might have chosen to assert himself politically, he "took it"--meekly.<br><br>Fortunately, you and I have had a chance to see, at rather close range, the remarkable meekness which operates in the life of President Spencer W. Kimball. His, too, is an impressive meekness which has combined with sweet boldness, producing signal achievments in the Kingdom.<br><br>Granted, none of us like, or should like, to be disregarded, to be silenced, to see a flawed argument prevail, or to endure a gratuitous discourtesy. But such circumstances as these seldom constitute that field of action from which meekness calls upon us to retire gracefully. We usually do battle unmeekly over far less justifiable issues, such as "turf."<br><br>Just what is this "turf" we insist on defending at almost the slightest provocation? If it is real estate, it will not rise with us in the resurrection. If it is concern over the opinions of us held by others, there is only one opinion of us that really matters. Besides, the opinions of others will only be lowered if we go on and ego tantrum. If "turf" is status, we should not be overly concerned with today's organizational charts. Who cares now about the peck order in the Sanhedrin of A.D. 31 which meant so much to some at the time?<br><br>Granted, there are some things worth being aroused about, as the Book of Mormon says, such as our families, our homes, our liberties, and our sacred religion (see Alma 43:45). But, if all our anxiety amounts to is our so-called image, it's an image that needs to be displaced anyway, so that we can receive His image in our countenances (see Alma 5:14).<br><h2><b>Further Consideration</b></h2><br>Let us consider meekness further.<br><br>The meek are filled with awe and wonder with regard to God and His purposes in the universe. At the same time, the meek are not awe-struck by the many frustrations of life; they are more easily mobilized for eternal causes and less easily immobilized by the disappointments of the day.<br><br>Because they make fewer demands of life, the meek are less easily disappointed. They are less concerned with their entitlements than with their assignments.<br><br>When we are truly meek, we are not concerned with being pushed around but are grateful to be pushed along. When we are truly meek, we do not engage in shoulder-shrugging acceptance but shoulder-squaring--in order that we might better bear the burdens of life and others.<br><br>Meekness can also help us in coping with the injustices of life--of which there are quite a few. By the way, our experiences with mortal injustices will generate within us even more adoration of the perfect justice of God--another of His attributes. Besides, there can be dignity even in silence, as was the case when Jesus meekly stood, unjustly accused, before Pilate. Silence can be an expression of strength. Holding back and holding on can be signs of great personal discipline, especially when everyone else is letting go.<br><br>Furthermore, not only are the meek less easily offended, but they are less likely to give offense to others. In contrast, there are some in life who seem to be waiting to be offended. Their pride covers them like boils which will inevitably be bumped.<br><br>Meekness also cultivates in us a generosity in viewing the mistakes and imperfections of others:<br><br><i>Condemn me not because of mine imperfection, neither my father, because of his imperfection . . . but rather give thanks unto God that he hath made manifest unto you our imperfections, that ye may learn to be more wise than we have been.</i>[Mormon 9:31]<br><br>Those of us who are too concerned about status or being last in line or losing our place need to reread those words about how the "last shall be first" and the "first shall be last" (Matthew 19:30). Assertiveness is not automatically bad, of course, but if we fully understood the motives which underlie some of our acts of assertion, we would be embarrassed. Frankly, when others perceive such motivations, they are sometimes embarrassed for us.<br><br>Granted, the meek go on fewer ego trips, but they have far greater adventures. Ego trips, those "travel now and pay later" indulgences, are always detours. The straight and narrow path is the only path which takes us to new and breathtaking places.<br><br>Meekness means less concern over being taken for granted and more concern over being taken by the hand. Less concern over revising our own plans for us and more concern about adopting His plans for us are other sure signs of meekness.<br><br>When you and I sing that Church hymn with the words, "More used would I be" (P. P. Bliss, "More Holiness Give Me,"<i>Hymns</i>, no. 114), one condition which keeps us from being "more used" is our lack of meekness. Sometimes, too, brothers and sisters, in our prayers we ask for the Lord to take the lead of our minds and hearts, but as soon as we say "Amen," we go unmeekly in our predetermined directions.<br><br>Meekness does not mean tentativeness, but thoughtfulness. Meekness makes room for others: "Let nothing be done through strife or vainglory; but in lowliness of mind let each esteem other better than themselves" (Philippians 2:3).<br><h2><b>Examples, Good and Bad</b></h2><br>There are, brothers and sisters, ever so many human situations in which the only additional time and recognition and space to be made available must come from the meek who will yield--in order to make time and recognition and space available for others. There could be no magnanimity without humility. Meekness is not a display of humility; it is the real thing. True meekness is never proud of itself, never conscious of itself.<br><br>It was said of one able, but comparatively meek, member of a nineteenth-century British cabinet, serving in Parliament:<br><br><i>If it was his duty to speak, he spoke, but he did not want to speak when it was not his duty--silence was no pain and oratory no pleasure to him.</i>[Forrest Morgan, ed.,<i>The Works of Walter Bagehot</i>(Hartford, Connecticut: travelers Insurance, 1889)]<br><br>The meek think of more clever things to say than are said. And it's just as well, for there is so much more cleverness in the world than wisdom, so much more sarcasm than idealism.<br><br>It is quite understandable, brothers and sisters, that we admire boldness and genius as we see these qualities convinced in some of the great figures in history. A merciful God has let such individuals make their significant contributions to humanity, such as in the political and economic realms. I cannot help but wonder, however, what more God might have done with such individuals if they had been sufficiently and consistently meek.<br><br>I think, for instance, of the towering and courageous Winston Churchill, admired in so many ways, including by me, but who had serious difficulty containing his ego which sometimes tarnished his otherwise remarkable contributions. One winces, even at this late date, as he reads Balfour's rebuke, in 1905, of a pressing and eager young Churchill in Parliament. Just after Winston had been excessive, Balfour rose in dignity and said:<br><br><i>As for the junior member of Oldham . . . I think I may give him some advice which may be useful to him in the course of what I hope may be a long and distinguished career. It is not, on the whole, desirable to come down to this House with invective which is both prepared and violent. The House will tolerate, and very rightly tolerate, almost anything within the rule of order which evidently springs from genuine indignation aroused by the collision of debate. But to come down with these prepared phrases is not usually successful, and at all events, I do not think it was very successful on the present occasion. If there is preparation, there should be more finish, and if there is so much violence, there should certainly be more veracity of feeling.</i>[Ted Morgan,<i>Churchill: Young Man in a Hurry</i>(New York: Simon and Schuster, 1982), p. 175.]<br><br>I think, too, of the remarkable General of the Army Douglas MacArthur whose place in history will also be rightfully generous. His mistakes, too, usually occurred as a result of a lack of meekness; his bravery was, on occasion, matched by his vanity. The brilliant and victorious sealord, Admiral Nelson, both achieved and suffered similarly.<br><br>I am not trying to fault these individuals, for each has significantly added to the measure of freedom so many mortals have enjoyed. Rather, I am suggesting how important to genuine and lasting greatness the virtue of meekness is, for its absence constitutes a limitation--even upon those whom we judge to be great by worldly criteria.<br><br>Granted, we admire boldness and dash, but boldness and dash can so easily slip into pomp and panache.<br><h2><b>Proper Use of Power and Authority</b></h2><br>By contrast, the meek are able with regularity to peel off the encrustations of ego that form on one's soul like barnacles on a ship. They are thus able to avoid the abuse of authority and power--a tendency to which, the Lord declared, "almost all" succumb. Except the meek. The meek use power and authority properly, no doubt because their gentleness and meekness reflect a love unfeigned, a genuine caring. The influence they exercise flows from a deep concern:<br><br><i>No power or influence can or ought to be maintained by virtue of the priesthood, only by persuasion, by long-suffering, by gentleness and meekness, and by love unfeigned.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 121:41]<br><br>How anxious we ought to be to emulate the manner in which God wields power! And this in a world of push and shove and shout. If we become too efficient at pushing, shoving, and shouting, then we are too adapted to this world--too busy polishing skills which will ere-long become obsolete.<br><br>Meekness rests on trust and courage. It is reflected in Nephi's meek acceptance of an assignment when he said, "I will go and do" (1 Nephi 3:7), without knowing beforehand all the implications of what he was undertaking.<br><br>Meekness permits us to be confident, as was Nephi, of that which we do know--even when we do not yet know the meaning of all other things (1 Nephi 11:17). Meekness constitutes a continuing invitation to continuing education. No wonder the Lord reveals His secrets to the meek, for they are "easy to be entreated" (Alma 7:23). Not only are the meek more teachable, but they continuously receive, with special appreciation, "the engrafted word" (James 1:21), as the apostle James said--and, as Joseph Smith described it, the pure flow of intelligence (see<i>Teachings</i>, p. 151)--all from the divine databank.<br><br>If we are meek, we will also handle our critics more wisely than did these predecessors:<br><br><i>Now there was a strict law among the people of the church, that there should not any man, belonging to the church, arise and persecute those that did not belong to the church, and that there should be no persecution among themselves.</i><br><br><i>Nevertheless, there were many among them who began to be proud, and began to contend warmly with their adversaries, even unto blows; yea, they would smite one another with their fists.</i>[Alma 1:21–22]<br><br>Meekness will permit us to endure more graciously the cruel caricaturing and misrepresentation that accompany discipleship, especially in the rugged last days of this dispensation. Remember the fingers of scorn in Lehi's vision which pointed and mocked at those who clung to the iron rod (see 1 Nephi 8:26–33)? The mockers were not a small minority. And they were persistent and preoccupied in their scorn of the saints. You will come to see that preoccupation.<br><br>Meekness permits us to be prompted as to whether to speak out or, as Jesus once did, be silent. But even when the meek speak up, they do so without speaking down.<br><br>I stress again that meekness does not mean we are bereft of boldness. A meek, imprisoned Joseph Smith displayed remarkable boldness in rebuking the grossness of the guards in Richmond jail:<br><br><i>Silence, ye fiends of the infernal pit! In the name of Jesus Christ I rebuke you and command you to be still; I will not live another minute and hear such language. Cease such talk, or you or I die this instant!</i>[<i>HC</i>3:208, note]<br><br>Isn't it interesting, in a world wrongly impressed with<i>machismo</i>, that we see more and more coarseness which is mistaken for manliness, more and more selfishness masquerading as individuality?<br><br>Meekness can make another very significant contribution as it aids us in bearing up under our personal afflictions (see Mosiah 3:19). Since the Lord has said he will have a "tried people," how can we possibly endure without meekness, the factoring experiences of this mortal probation?<br><h2><b>The World Takes a Different View of Meekness</b></h2><br>Illustratively, I turn now to an excerpt from President Brigham Young's secretary's journal for a choice insight brought to my attention by Professor Ronald Esplin. When asked in conversation, "Why are men left alone and often sad? Why is not God always at man's side promoting universal happiness at least for His Saints? Why does not God do everything for man?" President Young responded concerning how man's divine destiny requires individual experience and practice in learning "to act as an independent being"--to see what we will do, whether we will be "for God or not"--and in developing our own resources. Such experiences will teach us to be "righteous in the dark--to be a friend of God" (Brigham Young Office Journal, 28 January 1857). This is a sobering and revealing insight about God's plans for us here, and it underlines with urgency the need for the attribute of meekness, especially when one feels forsaken and forgotten and alone "amid th' encircling gloom" (J. H. Newman, "Lead, Kindly Light,"<i>Hymns</i>, no. 112).<br><br>In spite of all these advantages of meekness, will the world mistake meekness, however, for something else? Yes. But we must not let the world call the cadence for our march through life any more than we would let the world set the direction of that march.<br><br>Brothers and sisters, this mortal experience through which we are passing is one in which beauties abound; subtleties and delicacies are all about us, waiting to be noticed. Wonders are everywhere to be seen. It is, however, the observing meek, who will contemplate the lilies of the field, will ponder the galaxies and see God moving in His majesty and power. It is also the meek who will notice, and then lift up, those whose hands hang down (see D&amp;amp;C 81:5).<br><br>Peter waxed poetic when he urged "the Ornament of a meek and quiet spirit" (1 Peter 3:4). The meek and quiet spirit, which Peter recommended, is essential to our happiness here and hereafter, men and women alike.<br><br>Besides, even if our being meek results in our being abused in this world, we need to remember that we are being fitted for chores in another and better world--one which will be everlasting, not fleeting.<br><br>Some may still say, however, "Does not meekness invite abuse and dominance by the unmeek?" It may. But life's experiences suggest that sufficient unto every circumstance are the counterbalancing egos thereof; force tends to produce counterforce.<br><br>Please do not think of meekness, therefore, in the stereotyped ways. You will see far more examples of those in desperate need of meekness than you will ever see of the truly meek being abused.<br><h2><b>Development of Meekness Difficult</b></h2><br>I do not say that the development of meekness is easy. There are strivings and struggles and setbacks, inching forward when we would prefer to run. Even when we make some progress, there is the sober realization that our very best meekness is but a pale copy to Jesus' meekness. But it is "a type and shadow of things which are to come" (Mosiah 13:10). None of the divine virtues is easy to develop. But each is possible and portable. None of them will ever be obsolete.<br><br>Besides, what are the alternatives?<br><br>Genius unmodified by meekness? History amply attests that such is both a blessing and a curse! Expertise wrapped in overmuch ego? It is so difficult to utilize. Boldness and swiftness unrestrained by gentleness? Such traits are as likely to trample on people as to lift them!<br><br>It is meekness, therefore, that helps us to step gratefully forward to place on the altar the talents and time and self with which we are blessed--to be at God and His children's disposal. The offering is of a gentled self, a self concerned with charity--not parity.<br><br>Yes, there are real costs associated with meekness. A significant down payment must be made. But it can come from our sufficient supply of pride. We must also be willing to endure the subsequent erosion of unbecoming ego. Furthermore, our hearts will be broken in order that they might be rebuilt. As Ezekiel said, one's task is to "make you a new heart and a new spirit" (Ezekiel 18:31). There is no way that such dismantling, such erosion, such rebuilding can occur without real cost in pain, pride, adjustments, and even some dismay. Yet since we cannot be "acceptable before God save [we are] meek and lowly in heart" (Moroni 7:44), the reality of that awesome requirement must be heeded. Better to save one's soul than to save one's face.<br><h2><b>Conclusion</b></h2><br>I have spoken to you of this fundamental attribute because you truly are a generation drenched in destiny. May it prove to be meekly drenched in destiny. The attainment of your full possibilities will depend, as with all of us, on your developing adequately the eternal and cardinal attributes, including meekness.<br><br>God bless you and those like you the world over. Depend, meekly, upon God, for each of you--in ways yet to be experienced--will be depended upon by ever so many others.<br><br>I love you; I bless you, in apostolic authority, that you will not fail your individual rendezvous with those who await your touch and your ministry. Do not fail them! Prepare yourself in meekness to serve them, and God will bless you. I so bless you in that authority and in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Neal A.

<h1>bility: &quot;A Faithful Friend is a Strong Defense&quot; - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
We hadn't been at this business long before we realized that this hour is not conducive to long sermons. So we'll save that for later in the year and give you short sermons today.<br><br>There is, however, one thing we need to work out before I get serious with you. it is this Steve and Marie business. Some of you who were here last year will remember that purely in good fun, as just a slightly lighter moment in our solemnities here, Sister Holland and I mentioned that we got escorted into a movie theater sort of "stride for stride" to the front of the hall with Steve Craig and Marie Osmond.<br><br>Well, that was--essentially--a true story, and I just shared it here for your consideration last year. I wanted you to know about our summer even as we asked about yours. Well, since then everyone has just taken it all so seriously,<i>especially</i>Steve and Marie. Before long I wanted to run out in the street and just say it was a story, a little BYU humor. But no, I run out into the street and see thousands of people backed up from the Hotel Utah Ballroom to Bryce Canyon waiting to get into their wedding reception. There they were--Steve and Marie, and all the Osmond Brothers and all the basketball team. There was in fact a marriage, and I had just been kidding, just warming up the BYU audience a little on your first day back to school. I feel so responsible!<br><br>But, for all that, we are available for a price. If you make it worth our while, I will tell a story about<i>your</i>courtship in this setting and perhaps you will make the cover of national magazines, and garden clubs all over America will discuss your trousseau and taffeta. Write your hopes on a Wheaties boxtop in 25 words or less, including the man or woman with whom you wish to be seen walking down a theater aisle. Sister Holland and I will take care of<i>everything</i>from there on.<br><br>(Now you just watch. Some wise guy is going to send me a Wheaties boxtop and a reservation schedule for the Hotel Utah Ballroom.) Speaking of strange guys, which of you is the young man I saw pulling into town with a surfboard sticking through the sunroof of your Volkswagen? I don't want to seem a spoilsport, but someone has seriously misled you about the size of the canal that runs past Heritage Halls.<br><br>I'd like Sister Holland to speak to you for a moment. I told you last year what her father thought of me. I didn't mention her mother.<br><br>When Pat said so anxiously on our wedding day, "Now, Mother, I want this day to be perfect. I don't want even the least significant detail overlooked."<br><br>Her mother replied, "Oh, I'm sure Jeff will be there."<br><h2><b>Patricia T. Holland</b></h2><br>When I was just sixteen years old, I came to Provo to spend the summer studying music on this campus. I lived in Helaman Halls, practiced in the basement of the Joseph Smith Building, and ate an enormous amount of pizza at what is now the Brick Oven on Eighth North and First East.<br><br>I'm afraid that at such a tender age I was much more interested in boys and what I should wear to the dance than anything of any real value or substance. But, something happened to me that summer. It was a major turning point in my life, and this campus has had deep personal meaning for me since that summer of 1958. I began to see and hear and feel things I'd never experienced before. It was like coming alive in a new dimension. Looking back then from this perspective, I now know that, because of this university setting, my mind was beginning to open to "the glory of God." I was conscious perhaps for the first time of that relationship between his glory and his mind.<br><br>As I reflected on that special experience, while worrying and searching my heart for something of value to leave with you today, the scripture John 5:40 came to have bright, new meaning for me: "Ye will not come to me, that ye might have life."<br><br>What does he mean when he softly scolds, "Ye will<i>not</i>come to me, that ye might have life"? I don't think he was just talking about life eternal (though that too). I think he was speaking about here and now--I think he was speaking about a constant feeling of well-being and of thanksgiving for our very existence--of being alive spiritually.<br><br>I think he was saying that we search every where else for it first. We search for it in the praise of men, in worldly treasure or wordly pleasures, in clothing, in dances, and in enormous amounts of pizza while all the time he is crying, "Come unto me and ye will have life."<br><br>In our sixteen-year-old son Matt's seminary class, the teacher was trying to explain that to be constantly nourished by the word of the Lord was as binding and sustaining of life as the umbilical cord between mother and child. The teacher then asked the class, "What tangible resource do we have that is equally sustaining to us?" (I'm sure the teacher was hoping the class would respond with scriptures, prayer, obedience and so forth.) Our son Matt, with his laid-back sense of humor, raised his hand and asked, "Could it be an angelical cord?"<br><br>As many a truth is said in jest, Matt's analogy is the best I can think of to describe literally the life the Lord can give to us through a tie that is as firm and sustaining as we are willing to allow. It is something heavenly, even angelic, and it can turn darkness to light, and death to life.<br><br>Now what does this have to do with you here, eager this morning to start a new year of school at BYU? Since marriage, my husband and I have lived in many different places. We have studied at several institutions of higher learning--some of the best in this nation. However, never have we found one so rich, so fertile for finding God and finding ourselves as BYU. This university is a veritable banquet table laden with all that can sustain life, if you come to it hungering and thirsting for it.<br><br>My husband has had several occasions to speak around the country, and he has talked about our educational heritage and the values schools should uphold.<br><br>Did you know that the earliest statement of educational aim at Harvard University declared: "Everyone shall consider the main end of his life and studies is to know God and Jesus Christ which is eternal life"? All the nine colleges founded in the United States during the Colonial Period were sponsored by Christian churches. During the nineteenth century, however, education was becoming divorced from organized religion. It was then that the Latter-day Saints began this university, refusing to follow that national trend. As Elder George Q. Morris, a member of the Council of the Twelve, once said, "It is called the Brigham Young University, but it is the University of the Kingdom of God" ("Church Doctrine,"<i>Speeches of the Year</i>[Provo, Utah: Brigham Young University, 1955], p. 1). You see, you are the kingdom of God, here nurtured and tutored for your service in the world. John A. Widtsoe, who once served on the faculty of BYU and was later president of both Utah State and the University of Utah from which he was appointed to the Council of the Twelve, wrote:<br><br><i>There are many institutions of learning which foster splendidly the learning gains of the centuries. But, there is only one offering full collegiate training, Brigham Young University, in which the wisdom of men is saturated and made alive with the wisdom of the gospel of Jesus Christ.</i>["Commencement Day at Brigham Young University,"<i>Improvement Era,</i>July 1949, p. 449]<br><br>I'm here to bear my witness to the truth that the wisdom of men and women on this campus--the knowledge of your faculty, staff, and administration--is saturated and made alive with the wisdom of the gospel of Jesus Christ. In order for you to taste all that they have to offer, you will have to keep your angelical cord secure. I would like you to know that the president of this university, for all his fun and good humor, spends hours and hours, night and day, laboring to know the mind and the will of the Lord and seeks diligently to help fulfill the destiny of this school and of the Church. He strives to hold firm the very principles I suggest for you.<br><br>In closing, may I just say to you very personally that there are a few truly irreplaceable, priceless experiences that you can have in this world. One of these for me is that the Lord has allowed me to give life to my own three children.<br><br>The love that I felt as I realized it was my body, my strength, my constant nourishment that was giving life to my children formed a bond that is like nothing else in this world--nothing else, that is, expect for that love our Father in Heaven extends to us. You see, once you've given life, you<i>never</i>stop giving to it. I have tried to give my children comfort when my own heart ached. I have tried to give encouragement when my own life was confused, I have tried to give love when I knew it might not be returned.<br><br>Like every Mother, I have learned something of the link between "life" and "love." No wonder Nephi learned that the "tree of life" was literally the "love of God."<br><br>I love you very much, and I want your lives to be rich and full, not just this year, but always. May we all strengthen the cords that bind us to our Heavenly Father, who is always there to bless us, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><h2><b>Jeffrey R. Holland</b></h2><br>I would like my own remarks to be something of an extension of Sister Holland's. I, too, wish to speak with you about our life and love as a community, a community bound together with strong ties and common concerns. The quality of your life here--your happiness, your success, and your well-being--is constantly on my mind. Certainly it is as we start another school year together. Pat and I want you to be comfortable here. We want to know you and be friends with you and assist you in every way we can. We want you to succeed. We do love you very much.<br><h2><b>Friend to Friend</b></h2><br>Life at BYU is part of a rather large and important experiment in latter-day Christian living. It might even be considered a kind of United Order. Surely you are a select group, and, as with those pioneer experiments in communal living in Orderville, Brigham City, and elsewhere, we are terribly dependent upon each other. The idea is that we will live and work very closely together, each helping the other, and in the process nudge the whole institution just that much closer toward the ideal university BYU is intended to be, a university full of scholar/saints, young and old, who care very much about each other. We want BYU to be at least a little as heaven must be a lot. "Hell," on the other hand, said T. S. Eliot, "is oneself;/Hell is [experienced] alone. There is nothing to escape from and nothing to escape to. [In Hell] one is always along" (T. S. Eliot, "The Cocktail Party," act 1, scene 3).<br><br>Now except for those moments of solitude we all expect and wish for, I am anxious that no one feel needlessly alone at BYU. And in the few minutes I have with you, I hope to suggest a meaning there that goes significantly beyond the disappointments of mere loneliness. I am reaching for a special meaning of friendship, and, to the extent that I have either a text or a title, it is taken from the Apocrypha "A faithful friend is a strong defense. And he that hath found ... one hath found a treasure" (Ecclesiasticus 6:14).<br><br>I speak to you friend to friend.<br><h2><b>David McNeice, Jr.</b></h2><br>Last Saturday David McNeice, Jr., was buried. He was twenty-two. He had been married just three weeks. One week ago today he was standing in the Washington Street Station waiting for a Boston subway train to arrive when another man, screaming, abusive, and obviously drunk, entered the station, walked to the edge of the platform, and fell on to the tracks. Instantly--and I assume instinctively--twenty-two-year-old, newly married, responsible David McNeice jumped down on the track to help. At that instant, the train came out of the tunnel. McNeice frantically waved his arms, and then, as one observer described it to the press, "It was over so quickly." Not surprisingly, the drunken, abusive, fallen man survived the experience quite nicely. As they buried David McNeice, everyone who knew this young couple called it so needlessly, selfishly senseless.<br><br>What does this have to do with the first day of school at BYU? Well, nothing really--then again maybe everything.<br><h2><b>Virtues and Values</b></h2><br>Sister Holland mentioned in her remarks some of the invitations I have had recently to speak and tell the BYU story. A rather constant theme in those public speeches has been our commitment to virtues and values, purposes that have always mattered at universities and in civilized societies--purposes that certainly matter at Brigham Young University. They include, among a host of other things, courage and honor, honesty and integrity. They include good taste, careful speech, and hard work. They include sensitivity and spirituality and appreciation for both art and nature. They include a love of learning and a sense of progression and a sense of peace. They include an awareness of culture and tradition and history, especially history marking what time has shown to be the better way.<br><br>Why speak of such virtues and values?<br><br>Well, I for one happen to think BYU has a lot to say about them to a world that may be losing at least some of them. Furthermore, espousing them is part of what it means to be a Latter-day Saint. So for several of my first months here two years ago, I wrestled with what my highest personal tasks ought to be in relationship to those principles. I finally isolated four such tasks and made them the major goals of my administration. That next fall I went before the faculty and staff in our annual university conference and told them what my hopes were and why I thought BYU was a "pearl of great price," a gem worth putting on national display.<br><br>I then shared at least the spirit of those ideas in this assembly with you last year and began in earnest to do all I could to accomplish just four things: (1) to encourage our quest for truth as a university of the first rank, (2) to reinforce our commitment to basic moral virtues as a university whose light must have a special glow, (3) to tell the BYU story wherever and whenever possible, and (4) to extend the special sense of community we have always felt here. Those were and are my four personal tasks as I see them as my part in the BYU mission.<br><br>Some things have worked well. Some things haven't worked so well. And, of course, the task goes on. A lot of days have been very long. And a few nights have been pretty short. But I have loved it--deeply--and Sister Holland has loved it, and our children have loved it (within reason). And a lot of other friends on this campus have loved it and have done these things better and longer than the Hollands will ever be able to do them. But we believe in the task, have been blessed beyond measure, and are anxious to do a better job. And from time to time others around the country have expressed interest in our efforts. Nothing earthshaking because nothing very earthshaking was going on. But interest, often genuine interest, in BYU's desire to be a very "good" university--and I intend that adjective to apply with every possible interpretation.<br><h2><b>Disappointments</b></h2><br>After two years of doing what little we were capable of--usually right here on campus but occasionally in some outside setting--the syndicated services of the<i>Los Angeles Times</i>chose to run a rather complimentary column on BYU's view of these matters of truth and virtue. Perhaps some of you saw it. That story appeared coast to coast last spring. The copy I saw appeared on April 21. Two days later, on commencement day, April 23, 1982, these stories appeared in a United Press International release disseminated at least as widely, even as we marched, robed and hooded, to our important graduation exercises. The various headlines read "Four 'Y' Students Charged with Fake Document Fraud" (<i>Provo Herald,</i>22 April 1982), "[Y] Students Arraigned on [Driver] License Scam" (<i>Salt Lake Tribune,</i>23 April 1982), and so on.<br><br>By referring to this incident, I do not want to cause anyone any more pain than too many have already felt. I do not use the names of the students involved, and I hope you don't even know the names. I would not embarrass them or their parents or any of you. That is not my purpose. Remember, I'm speaking friend to friend. But perhaps enough time has gone by that, at least in the abstract, we can use the lesson it offers us as a group of people who have chosen to live together for a time.<br><br>"Virtus et Veritas"? Was the "falsifying of government documents ... in connection with a highly sophisticated driver license forgery scam operating out of one of the [university's dormitories]" (<i>Tribune)</i>--I am quoting directly the precise language of the wire services--was that either "virtuous" or "truthful"? Oh, there's a Latin phrase for it, but it isn't "Virtus et Veritas." And what of the sixty-seven individuals known to have ordered the false identification documents, showing those in possession to be twenty-one years of age when they were not? What need would exist for sixty-seven students on this campus to own a fake ID? Is it that tough ticket taker at the Varsity Theater? Is it the stern dispenser of "Y Sparkle" at the Cougar Eat? My gosh, if a Y student's life is getting that tough then maybe we all ought to get fake ID's. Perhaps it is the new football stadium--are there no seats for anyone under twenty-one? For students admitted here on their honor I can't imagine any other reasons for needing to appear twenty-one.<br><br>And what of the rest of the students in those rooms and in those halls and on those floors and in and out of that dormitory? Was everyone's education yet so paltry that none had<i>ever</i>heard Edmund Burke's telling dictum, "The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men [or women] to do nothing" (Edmund Burke,<i>Thoughts on the Cause of the Present Discontents,</i>23 April 1770)? Did anyone within forty-five miles of Hinckley Hall have any pangs of guilt or any whisper of conscience, knowing that a felony was being committed in facilities paid for and maintained by tithing dollars of widows and fatherless? And there we sat in another commencement exercise, speaking of truth and virtue. It is no wonder to me God once said to ancient Israel, "I despise your feast days, and I will not smell in your solemn assemblies" (Amos 5:21).<br><br>Let me cite one other disappointment and then leave this whole subject. (I don't like it any better than you do.) Sometime during our life together last year a very angry and disappointed father called me about his daughter's off-campus living situation. She had at least one roommate who apparently thought her boyfriend should be entitled to spend the night on the couch whenever the evening's weariness overtook him--and apparently most evenings he was "overtaken." After all, there was nothing really wrong going on. It was a little inconvenient in an apartment of girls, but there were walls and doors and robes, and he could be left pretty much alone. Well, I say to this Rip Van Winkle of Raintree or Riviera or wherever, and to his girlfriend and to her roommates--men do not sleep in women's apartments if either said man<i>or</i>woman wants to remain at Brigham Young University. Not on the couch, not in the kitchen, not on the floor, not entwined around five-gallon cans containing the next year's supply of whole wheat. No one has to be a 4.0 student to understand that, including the roommates who put up with it.<br><h2><b>A Covenant Society</b></h2><br>I speak of those unsavory issues not to sensationalize mistakes or to rule out the repentance that every one of us will need to call upon forever. I think if this had not been so recent and so devastating to me, I certainly would not choose to begin a new year's greeting to you this way. I am not pointing publicly at individual people and certainly am not inviting you to. But what I do want to stress on this very first day of the new school year is the nature of the covenant society we form when we come to BYU, that we have a right to hope for when we enroll here--that is, among faculty, staff, students, and administrators. We are, at least by the world's standards, "Separatists," just as those earliest Pilgrims were, sailing aboard our own<i>Mayflower</i>and determined to live a better way. Like them, we too feel we are on "God's errand in the wilderness." On the eleventh of November, 1620, when that first courageous little band touched land at Cape Cod, they --like us--signed a compact "for the glory of God, the advancement of the Christian faith, and the general good of the Colony" (William Bradford,<i>Of Plymouth Plantation</i>). Every social or political experiment in history has had some such code or compact or constitution--written or implied, Christian or otherwise--upon which it has depended for its very survival. We have one at BYU.<br><br>The success of our BYU experiment--like that of those first New Englanders--requires the best effort of everyone whose name is on the parchment. Ben Franklin said it best to the signers of the Declaration 150 years later. "We must all hang together," he said to his colonial friends, "or assuredly we shall all hang separately." The success we dream of here will take the best effort of all who come. It will never work otherwise, at least not fully and not well. It won't require abrasiveness or smugness of self-righteousness, but it will require integrity and it will require work.<br><br><i>Is every Christian expected to bear witness? A man content to bear no witness to the truth is not in the kingdom of heaven. One who believes must bear witness. One who sees the truth must live witnessing to it. Is our life then a witnessing to the truth? Do we carry ourselves in bank, on farm, in house or shop, in study or chamber of workshop, as the Lord would, or as the Lord would not? Are we careful to be true, or are we mean, self-serving, world-flattering, fawning slaves? When contempt is cast on the truth, do we smile?</i>[<i>When the truth is</i>]<i>wronged in our presence, do we make no sign that we hold by it?</i><br><br><i>I do not say we are called upon to dispute and defend</i>[<i>against falsehood</i>]<i>with logic and argument, but we are called upon to show that we are on the other side. ... The soul that loves the truth and tries to be true will know when to speak and when to be silent. But the true man will never look as if he did not care. We are not bound to say all that we think, but we are bound not even to look</i>[<i>like</i>]<i>what we do not think.</i>[George MacDonald,<i>Creation in Christ</i>(Wheaton, IL: Harold Shaw, 1976), p. 142]<br><br>In the kind of Christian community we anxiously pursue, we must not even look like what we do not think or believe. And we must never look as if we did not care. That is why we make gentle reminders about dress and grooming. Every year at the start of school I see just a few, a very few, who have "grubby" or immodest clothing or hair that is not trimmed or groomed, and I think, "We have failed to help them understand what we are about at BYU." It is a part, however small, of the mission we have, the witness we bear, the colony we're creating. It is part of governing ourselves once correct principles have been taught and understood. And it is important in far more significant ways than dress and grooming, in far more private arenas of our lives.<br><h2><b>Mutual Responsibility</b></h2><br>This reminder is, of course, directly applicable to all of us--beginning with the president of the university. If I robbed a bank this afternoon, or, worse yet for you, embezzled the university's operating funds, would I be the only one punished? I might be the only one to get a jail sentence, but<i>you</i>would be the ones punished. You and my wife and my children and my colleagues--all of you would bear part of that shame and burden. BYU and the LDS Church would be severely punished, at least in the public mind, for many years to come.<br><br>That's unfair, you say, but what is fair about the death of David McNeice, Jr.? You see we are all, in a sense, waiting at the same station together. We each have our own hopes and plans and dreams. But by virtue of our enrolling at BYU we have stated our basic agreement as to which train we will ride and what special rules of conduct we will obey as passengers. Of course, one drunk can stagger into our station and right off the platform, bringing needless, heartrending--and unfair--tragedy to his "friends" (never his "enemies"--his enemies would have left him on the track) almost before the trip has even begun. But the risk David McNeice took is a risk we must run in a Christian community.<br><br>Should a faculty member at BYU then write or say or teach or publish anything he or she wants and assume that's done without any impact upon colleagues in that department or college or the university as a whole? Maybe that intellectual isolation exists at some university, but not at BYU. Can a manager on our staff be free with his ledgers or supplies or cash or contracts and believe that he alone runs the risk of exposure? Maybe somewhere but not at BYU. So it ought not to be any great surprise that we have expectations for you as students, as well. There are no victimless crimes here. We do, in at least some very fundamental ways, "hold all things in common" as did the Saints of old. Ask not for whom the Y bell tolls. It tolls for thee.<br><br>You don't really need here today an introduction to Political Philosophy 101, and I am certainly not the one to teach it, but consider this early observation attributed to Socrates by Plato:<br><br><i>Mankind at first lived dispersed, and there were no cities</i>[read "universities" if you wish].<i>But the consequence was that they were destroyed by the wild beasts, for they were utterly weak in comparison of them, and their art was only sufficient to provide them with the means of life, and did not enable them to carry on war against the animals: food they had, but not as yet the art of government, of which the art of [defense] is a part. After a while the desire of self-preservation gathered them into cities</i>[universities]<i>but when they were gathered together, having no art of government, they</i>evil intreated one another,<i>and were again in process of</i>dispersion<i>and</i>destruction.<i>Zeus feared that the entire race would be exterminated, and so he sent Hermes to them, bearing reverence and justice to be the</i>ordering principles of cities and the bonds of friendship and conciliation. [Plato,<i>Protagoras;</i>emphasis mine]<br><br>Well, Zeus may not have sent Hermes, but Brigham Young did send Karl G. Maeser that we might learn to live together "in the bonds of friendship and conciliation." Whether out of a "desire for self-preservation" like the Greeks, or "for the general good of the Colony" noted by the Pilgrims, part of our education is to learn to live wisely and responsibly together. Hell<i>is</i>being alone and self-centered and untrue. If enough understood that soon enough, and thus cherished rather than chafed under the human bonds that must be formed, the whole world could be saved in something of a celestial colony, both here in time and in eternity.<br><h2><b>The Best That Lies Within</b></h2><br>Many of you--indeed most of you--make BYU just such a community of friends even now. I reluctantly speak of two or three or even sixty-seven who have problems during a year because I do so with full realization that more than 25,000 of you are contributing to the common good at BYU and are, for the tasks at hand, as heroic in your way as David McNeice was at that train station. I think no students anywhere in the world live more responsible and exemplary lives than do you at BYU. I salute you with all my heart. And you who are new today become part of a rare and priceless tradition.<br><br>We began by singing the school song. The words to that song were written by an early student at BYU, Annie Pike Greenwood. In 1909, as a nonmember of the Church, she also wrote something else--a brief testimonial in response to one of her friends who had remarked, "I think they must have spoiled you at that Brigham Young Academy." Reflecting on that comment Annie wrote,<br><br><i>It struck me forcibly that he was right. "They" had certainly spoiled me at "that Brigham Young Academy"--spoiled me as mother spoils her child--with kindness, encouragements, appreciation, charity--spoiled me so that I can never be content to take anything but the best the world has to give nor satisfied to give anything but the best that lies within me. By day and by night it comes upon me that I must fulfill all of which my teachers believed me capable."</i>[Ernest L. Wilkinson and W. Cleon Skousen,<i>Brigham Young University: A School of Destiny</i>(Provo, Utah: BYU Press, 1976), pp. 194–95]<br><br>What is the best that lies within us? Of how much are we capable? None of us yet knows, but that is why we have come to BYU. An old Arabic legend tells of a rider finding a spindly sparrow lying on its back in the middle of the road. He dismounted and asked the sparrow why his feet where in the air.<br><br>Replied the sparrow, "I heard the heavens were going to fall today."<br><br>"And I suppose you think your puny bird legs can hold up the whole universe?" laughed the horseman.<br><br>"Perhaps not," said the sparrow with conviction, "but one does whatever one can."<br><br>In my appreciation for you I suppose it is only fair to note that some of you probably do "whatever you can" in ways we might not fully encourage. President Dallin Oaks told me of an experience early in his administration. A prominent visitor to the campus was being hosted at a luncheon in the Wilkinson Center when he excused himself to visit the men's room. When the visitor returned, he looked dark and said with a tone of disappointment, "Well, I've discovered you Mormons are just like everybody else. When I go to a public restroom, I usually find things written on the walls, and BYU is no exception."<br><br>His totally abashed BYU hosts immediately tried to extend an apology, however lame, but as they stammered and stuttered, he burst out laughing. "Don't worry, it was confined to just one bold, handwritten word: REPENT."<br><br>Perhaps the author of that was the fellow with the surfboard.<br><br>You have all come to BYU "for the general good of the Colony," and you make it a wonderful place to be. Sister Holland and I love you with all our hearts for that gift. I said at the outset that I wanted to speak of friendship in a way that transcended mere companionship. We do not want you to be lonely here, but more than that we do not want you to be false.<br><br><i>Of all who will one day stand in dismay and sickness of heart, with the consciousness that their very existence is a shame, those will fare the worst who have been consciously false to their</i>[<i>friends</i>];<i>who, pretending friendship, have used their neighbor to their own ends; and especially those who, pretending friendship, have divided friends. To such Dante has given the lowest</i>[<i>circle in</i>]<i>Hell. If there be one thing God hates, it must be treachery.</i>[MacDonald,<i>Creation in Christ</i>, p. 230]<br><br>I ask you to care for each other the way the David McNeices of the world care. Don't play the part of the drunk. Leave BYU months or years from now better than you found it. Study hard. Make every semester count. Like little Annie Greenwood, give the best that lies within you. It is no easy task or convenient colonial duty. It will require much from you, and faithful friends will be a strong defense, I love you and welcome you back to school. "Ye are my friends," Jesus said to his disciples, and with his own life gave them the love than which, he said, there is no greater. "Ye are my friends," he said, "if ye do whatsoever I command you. ... These things I command you, that ye love one another" (John 15:14, 17).<br><br>May this be the best--and friendliest--year of our lives, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Jeffrey R. Holland was president of Brigham Young University when this devotional address was given on 7 September 1982.</i>© Brigham Young University. All rights reserved.</i>

<h1>on of the John Taylor Building - Gordon B. Hinckley - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I am honored to be with you this morning. It is no small or insignificant or unimportant thing to intrude upon the time and attention of so many thousands of you. Thank you for coming. I pray that I may be directed by the Spirit to say something to you which will be useful in your lives.<br><h2><b>Welcome to Students</b></h2><br>I am here for two assigned purposes. The first is to welcome you on behalf of the First Presidency of the Church, who stand as the president and vice-presidents of the Board of Trustees, to this new academic year. The second is to dedicate the John Taylor Building on this campus.<br><br>As President Holland has explained, it has been customary over a period of many years for the president of the Church to meet with you each fall. I regret that President Kimball has found it necessary to excuse himself this morning. Your disappointment is no greater than is my own. I am pleased to report that he is getting along well. He meets with us almost every morning. He was with us this morning. The last thing I did before leaving to come here was to talk with him. We greatly appreciate that association. He is the Prophet of the Lord in this day. We honor him as such and look to him for guidance. He gives us inspiration, and we are grateful for it. I assure you that no major decision is reached by the First Presidency and the Council of the Twelve, and no policy is implemented that impacts upon the membership of the Church without his approval. That should be reassuring to the membership of the Church who sustain him as prophet, seer, and revelator. Such he is, and of this I bear testimony to you.<br><br>I bring you his love and blessing. I bring also the love and blessing of his devoted and inspired counselors, President Tanner and President Romney. The Brethren in whose behalf I speak have great love and appreciation for this tremendous institution. They have great expectations concerning you, its student body. They and their associates of the Board of Trustees have allocated from the general funds of the Church, which are sacred trust funds, millions of dollars that have come from the consecrations of the members of the Church across the world, to make it possible for you to be here and drink at the fountains of knowledge, both secular and spiritual.<br><br>In so doing they have placed upon you a great and sacred trust. As a few thousand among the millions of Church members, you occupy a unique and enviable position. Yours is the opportunity to attend Brigham Young University, the university of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, here to study under a faculty of men and women of learning and of faith. There are many wonderful colleges and universities on this continent. But BYU is unique. It is the largest private university in America, and that is an indication of the great beneficence of the church which supports it and of the board which has responsibility for its operation. Furthermore, its plant, its programs, and its faculty are unexcelled. Most important, there exists a guiding determination on the part of its board that the Spirit of God shall be constantly invited as an overriding component of the environment in which you live and work while you are here.<br><br>BYU ought to be the very best in the entire world. Reflect for a moment upon the motto of this institution--"The glory of God is intelligence." You who have come here to study are walking the road that leads to immortality, eternal life, and that glory whose very essence is pure and godly and eternal intelligence.<br><br>I cannot emphasize too strongly the need on your part to take advantage of the tremendous opportunity that lies ahead of you as you begin this academic year. You must qualify yourselves with skills and with flexibility to meet the challenges of a changing society. I recently read a provocative monograph, dealing with a thesis on "the restructuring of America in the decade ahead." It emphasized that our society is changing far more rapidly than most of us realize.<br><br>This study pointed out that we are moving from an industrial to an information society:<br><br><i>In 1950, 65% of the U.S. work force was engaged in industrial occupations. Since 1950, that 65% has dropped to 27%. ... In 1950, about 17% of the work force was in information jobs (those involved with creating, processing, and distributing information)--today that figure is up to 60%--and the projection is that 80% of the U.S. work force will be in information jobs by the year 2000.</i>[John Naisbitt, "The Restructuring of America," Society of Chartered Property and Casualty Underwriters]<br><br>This study further points out that we are moving from a centralized to a decentralized society. There is a new federalism spoken of in Washington. The demise of the great, large-circulation magazines such as<i>Life, Look,</i>and<i>Saturday Evening Post</i>is indicative of this decentralization. "There are now more than 4,000 special interest magazines being published in the United States, and no huge circulation, general purpose magazines."<br><br>The study goes on to talk of a shift from a national economy to a global economy. We in the United States have witnessed some of this in the automobile and electronics industries. Once we were the preeminent producers of automobiles. There are now eighty-six countries that have automobile assembly plants.<br><br>"We now have two economies in America, one falling and one rising. We have a group of sunset industries and a group of sunrise industries" (Public Affairs Forum C.P.C.U., vol. 3, no. 1).<br><br>These shifts, which are going on all about us and which will continue in the years ahead, make education so very necessary--first, to recognize them; and secondly to be prepared to adjust to them. The competitive pressures will be tremendous as the Third World gears for increasing industrial capacity which in the past has been in other hands. I am convinced that the faculty of this university will face greater challenges than they have known in a long while. We must keep abreast of the times--no, we must keep ahead of them. This is one of the great responsibilities of education, to anticipate and to prepare for that which inevitably will come.<br><br>There is another evolution or revolution that has been going on. This too has created and will continue to create tremendous challenges, and particularly for the graduates of this institution.<br><br>Jim Bishop, prominent columnist, recently wrote as follows: "This is the twentieth year of America's Rotten Revolution. Two decades ago, this nation began its slide down the drain. It moved faster, more destructively, than the fall of the Roman Empire." He quoted from a book by Marvin Harris to be published this November by Simon and Schuster under the title<i>Why America Changed</i>. He spoke of the moral decline, the decline of ethics and principle. And then he concluded: "It was, no matter how you gauge it, a Rotten Revolution. America has paid dearly for greed on all levels. We cannot wish our way back to strength. The only way is to restore the morals we had in our innocence."<br><br>I am, by nature, an optimist. But no one, it seems to me, can be blind to the tremendous forces that are slapping our society. I received my baccalaureate degree fifty years ago, in the depression-ridden year of 1932. None of you students here today really has any idea of the economic darkness of those times. To be thrown onto the employment market in those times was like being cast into the sea to swim through heavy waves. Unemployment reached 30 percent. People committed suicide in despair. If a man had a job earning a hundred dollars a month, he was considered fortunate. Men who had been profitably employed found themselves standing in soup lines and living in shantytowns.<br><br>But with all of this, it seems to me, as I reflect on those days, there was something of tremendous good in the people. There was a spirit of mutual helpfulness, a spirit of respect one for another and, generally speaking, a high moral tone. Of course there was crime, even gang crime. There were the rumrunners and the moonshiners. There were even those who wished for arrest and conviction so that they could trade the cold of the outside for the warmth of jail. But, at least in the society of which I was a part as a young man, there was a great--and what I regard as wonderful--respect for women. Homosexuality was almost unheard of. The use of hard drugs was practically unknown.<br><br>We have traveled far since then, and the results are told in our statistics, of crime, divorce, and a long and sickening train of various immoralities.<br><br>And so, my dear young friends, as we welcome you this new academic year, we expect, and we hope you expect, to make the very most of the great and challenging opportunities you have before you--on the one hand, to equip yourselves for the changing and competitive world in which you will earn your livelihood, and, on the other hand, to cultivate a compelling loyalty to the unchanging and ever-constant principles of morality, integrity, and eternal truth which must undergird the character of every good man and woman, and every progressive society.<br><h2><b>The John Taylor Building</b></h2><br>Now, this brings me to the second reason for my being here, and that is to dedicate the John Taylor Building. I am grateful that we are now naming on this campus a structure for this remarkable man who sometimes is little remembered in this generation. Our studies of him are diminished, in comparison, by our studies of the two great men who preceded him as presidents of the Church, Joseph Smith and Brigham Young.<br><br>John Taylor was a remarkable man, whose life and example we ought to study more.<br><br>He was a man of principle, integrity, and fidelity. He was born in the lake country of Westmorland, that magnificently beautiful area of England where the deep waters of Windermere, Grasmere, and Morcombe Bay lend a quality to the environment that is exhilerating simply to inhale. I have been there, and I have tasted of that beauty. Here he grew through his childhood and youth and at the age of seventeen became a Methodist lay minister. A few years later he came to the New World and in 1832 settled in Toronto. It was here that his path crossed the path of Parley P. Pratt, who had been sent on a mission to Canada under a prophecy of Heber C. Kimball that there he would find a people ready to receive him, and that out of that service would come a harvest which would lead, among other things, to the spread of the work to the British Isles.<br><br>The story of the fulfillment of that remarkable prophecy is too long for this telling. Suffice it to say that John Taylor and his wife were baptized into the Church in 1836 through the labors of Parley Pratt who said, "The people there drank in truth as water, and loved it as they loved life" (<i>PPP,</i>p. 152). Thereafter, until the day of his death, John Taylor, the convert, was an unflinching and powerful exponent of the truths which had come into his life and which had taken possession of all his loyalties. He selected as his motto, "The kingdom of God or nothing." With that motto as his anchor, his life became the fulfillment of that marvelous promise given by the Lord through revelation when he said: "And if your eye be single to my glory, your whole bodies shall be filled with light, and there shall be no darkness in you" (D&amp;amp;C 88:67). He met Joseph Smith, and there came into his heart a great and powerful conviction that this man was indeed a prophet of God.<br><br>John Taylor said on one occasion: "I do not believe in a religion that cannot have all my affections, but in a religion for which I can both live and die. I would rather have God for my friend than all other influences and powers" (G. B. Hinckley,<i>Truth Restored</i>[Salt Lake City: Corporation of the President of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 1947], p. 140).<br><br>He believed this. He lived it. He advocated it by his example. He was a man of absolute fidelity and loyalty to Him whom he accepted as his leader.<br><br>He responded to calls twice to go to England, on another occasion to go to France, on another occasion to go to the Eastern States, and on yet another occasion to plead the cause of the Saints in Washington.<br><br>In the dark and troubled days of Nauvoo, when a number of those who had been close to the Prophet turned against him, John Taylor was one who remained at his side with absolute loyalty. There were traitors in those days, men who clandestinely connived against the Prophet. There was another group, the members of which professed belief but who spent much time criticizing and finding fault rather than holding the work together and building the kingdom. Selfishness and pride, and a lust for power and attention took possession of them. All this dissention reached its climax on the tragic day of 27 June 1844, when Joseph and Hyrum Smith were killed by the mob in Carthage Jail. There were two good men with them in that jail at that time. One was Willard Richards, who miraculously escaped injury; and the other was John Taylor, who was savagely wounded, four balls having entered his body from the pistols of the mob. The watch which he carried in his pocket stopped the one which likely would have taken his life. He would have given that life. Concerning his coming into the Church he had said:<br><br><i>I expected when I came into this Church, that I should be persecuted and proscribed. I expected that the people would be persecuted. But I believed that God had spoken, that the eternal principles of truth had been revealed, and that God had a work to accomplish which was in opposition to the ideas, views, and notions of men, and I did not know but it would cost me my life before I got through....</i><br><br><i>Was there anything surprising in all this? No. If they killed Jesus in former times, would not the same feeling and influence bring about the same results in these times? I had counted the cost when I first started out, and stood prepared to meet it</i>. [<i>JD</i>25:91–92]<br><br>It was he who wrote what we now have as section 135 of the Doctrine and Covenants concerning the death of Joseph Smith, saying:<br><br><i>Joseph Smith, the Prophet and Seer of the Lord, has done more, save Jesus only, for the salvation of men in this world, than any other man that ever lived in it. ...He lived great, and he died great in the eyes of God and his people; and like most of the Lord's anointed in ancient times, has sealed his mission and his works with his own blood; and so has his brother Hyrum</i>. [D&amp;amp;C 135:3]<br><br>It was that kind of loyalty to his leader, it was that kind of fidelity to the cause to which he had given his life, that sustained that cause and kept it moving forward in the dark and troubled days that lay ahead. John Taylor's faith in those difficult times was unmistakable. Listen to his words on the position of the Church in that fateful year of 1844:<br><br><i>The idea of the church being disorganized and broken up because of the Prophet and Patriarch being slain, is preposterous. This church has the seeds of immortality in its midst. It is not of man, nor by man--it is the offspring of Deity: it is organized after the pattern of heavenly beings, through the principles of revelation; by the opening of the heavens, by the ministering of angels, and the revelations of Jehovah. It is not affected by the death of one or two, or fifty individuals. ... Times and seasons may change, revolution may succeed revolution, thrones may be cast down, and empires be dissolved, earthquakes may rend the earth from centre to circumference, the mountains may be hurled out of their places, and the mighty ocean be moved form its bed; but amidst the crash of worlds and the crack of matter, truth, eternal truth must remain unchanged, and those principles which God has revealed to his Saints be unscathed amidst the warring elements, and remain as firm as the throne of Jehovah.</i>[<i>Times and Seasons</i>5:744, December 15, 1844]<br><br>Such is the nature of the man we honor today. How appropriate that a building on this great campus be named to his memory. How marvelous his example to all of us who will accept it and live by it. We have those in the Church these days, as there were in Nauvoo, who profess membership but spend much of their time in criticizing, in finding fault, and in looking for defects in the Church, in its leaders, in its programs. They contribute nothing to the building of the kingdom. They rationalize their efforts, trying to justify with pretenses of doing good for the cause, but the result of those efforts is largely only a fragmentation of faith, their own and that of others. How different the motto and the life of the man we remember today: "The kingdom of God or nothing." I commend it to each of you as a standard for your own lives.<br><br>God bless his memory to our good and his life as our example, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br>Now, if you will bow your heads and close your eyes, we shall join in a prayer of dedication.<br><h2><b>Dedicatory Prayer</b></h2><br>Our beloved Father in Heaven, thou who art our Father and our God, we bow before thee this day in solemn prayer with grateful hearts. We are met on the campus of this great institution which is operated in thy name and in the name of thy beloved Son, the Lord Jesus Christ. We are thankful for this university with its faculty and all of it facilities, and for the great student body who have come here to learn with hope and desire, and with faith and prayer.<br><br>We reflect today upon those who have gone before us who laid the foundations of the great work of which we are a part--thine anointed servant, the Prophet Joseph Smith, and those who have succeeded him in that high and sacred office down to him who stands in that office today, even President Spencer W. Kimball, for whom we pray.<br><br>On this occasion we particularly remember with appreciation the third President of the Church, President John Taylor, whom thou didst bless and whose mind thou didst touch so that he received the teachings of everlasting truth and who thereafter with great courage, and with faith and fidelity loyally walked as one who was a convert in very deed and who became a great and powerful exponent, even that he came to be known as "the Champion of Liberty." We thank thee for the life of President John Taylor. We thank thee for his leadership. We thank thee for his great example. We thank thee for those of his descendents who are with us this day and ask thy special blessings upon them that they may always remember him who was their forebear, who walked in faith and with courage and great capacity as an exponent of thy word.<br><br>Now, Father, we are here to dedicate a structure named in his memory, even the John Taylor Building. In the authority of the holy priesthood which we hold, and in behalf of all who are present, we dedicate the John Taylor Building on the campus of the Brigham Young University for the great purposes for which it has been constructed, that it may stand on this campus as a place of beauty, yes, but, more importantly, as a place of learning as well as of teaching, as a place of service, as a place of helpfulness, and that all who are housed here may have in their hearts a great sense of service to those who come seeking assistance. We pray that thou wilt bless them with a love for humanity, for this building is presently used to house those departments of the university and of the Church which are designed to look after the needs of those who need help of many kinds. Dear Father, bless those who are there to serve that they may do so with kindness and with love and in the Spirit of thy Son whose life was the very essence of love and service to others.<br><br>We pray that thy watchcare may be over this building that it may stand on this campus with its associate buildings as a great tribute to the beneficence of the Church which operates this university. May the name of John Taylor receive a new emphasis and a new attention as a result of the presence of this building on this campus, and may all who enter its portals be constrained to reflect in their minds upon the life, the strength, the faith, and the example of him whose name it carries. To this end we seek thy blessing on this day of dedication, and, in so doing, we dedicate ourselves anew to thy service in the name of thy beloved Son, even the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Gordon B.

<h1>rds for Obedience - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I am grateful for the opportunity of visiting with you in this fireside. I also sense very deeply my responsibility as I fill this assignment. As one of Christ's agents, I have the obligation of doing his will on this and all occasions. The Lord reasoned with those so ordained concerning their callings: "Wherefore, I the Lord ask you this question--unto what were ye ordained?" And he answered, "To preach my gospel by the Spirit, even the Comforter which was sent forth to teach the truth" (D&amp;amp;C 50:13–14). With all my heart and all the energies of my soul, I desire an interest in your faith and prayers so that we can experience the blessing promised as a result of such preaching. That blessing, as I continue in section 50 of the Doctrine and Covenants, says, "Wherefore, he that preacheth and he that receiveth, understand one another, and both are edified and rejoice together" (D&amp;amp;C 50:22). I pray that we will communicate through the power of the Spirit so that we might all be edified.<br><h2><b>Blessing and Law</b></h2><br>I would like to build my remarks around an important passage from the Doctrine and Covenants. The Lord said:<br><br><i>There is a law, irrevocably decreed in heaven before the foundations of this world, upon which all blessings are predicated--</i><br><br><i>And when we obtain any blessing from God, it is by obedience to that law upon which it is predicated.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 130:20–21]<br><br>The laws that govern our progression were established, irrevocably, before the foundation of the world by an all-wise and all-powerful Father, whose work and glory it is to "bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man" (Moses 1:39). These laws were based on God's infinite knowledge about what is necessary for his children to progress.<br><br>The Prophet Joseph Smith explained why God established laws and gave insight into God's motives and purposes, and I quote from the teachings of the Prophet Joseph when he said:<br><br><i>God himself, finding he was in the midst of spirits and glory, because he was more intelligent, saw proper to institute laws whereby the rest could have a privilege to advance like himself. ... He has power to institute laws to instruct the weaker intelligences, that they may be exalted with himself, so that they might have one glory upon another, and all that knowledge, power, glory, and intelligence, which is requisite in order to save them in the world of spirits.</i>[<i>Teachings,</i>p. 354]<br><br>In the premortal existence, one of the noble and great spirits, who "was like unto God," described the purpose of our mortal existence in these words:<br><br><i>We will go down, for there is space there, and we will take of these materials, and we will make an earth whereon these may dwell;</i><br><br><i>And we will prove them here with, to see if they will do all things whatsoever the Lord their God shall command them;</i><br><br><i>And they who keep their first estate shall be added upon; and they who keep not their first estate shall not have glory in the same kingdom with those who keep their first estate; and they who keep their second estate shall have glory added upon their heads for ever and ever.</i>[Abraham 3:24–26]<br><h2><b>Christ's Obedience</b></h2><br>Satan came out in open rebellion against the Father's plan and sought to destroy the agency with which God had blessed man. He said, "Behold, here am I, send me, I will be thy son, and I will redeem all mankind, that one soul shall not be lost, and surely I will do it; wherefore give me thine honor" (Moses 4:1). Satan's disobedience is archetypal?--the perfect bad example. It contrasts with Christ's perfect obedience and submission to the will of the Father. As you know, God cast Lucifer down, and he became the devil, the father of lies. God chose Christ to come into the world to carry out his plan.<br><br>The nature of God's love is shown in his purpose for sending Christ into the world:<br><br><i>For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.</i><br><br><i>For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved.</i>[John 3:16–17]<br><br>Christ's love is one with his Father's, for as Nephi said, "He doeth not anything save it be for the benefit of the world; for he loveth the world, even that he layeth down his own life that he may draw all men unto him" (2 Nephi 26:24). Jesus Christ, of course, has perfectly executed the Father's plan, making it possible, through his atonement, for all people to experience peace in this life and eternal life in the world to come.<br><br>The angel who heralded the Savior's birth into the world said, "Behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people" (Luke 2:10). This birth announcement was most appropriate for One who is the source of all that brings joy, contentment, and peace in this life, with the promise of eternal happiness for the faithful.<br><h2><b>That We Might Have Joy</b></h2><br>Nephi wrote that "men are, that they might have joy" (2 Nephi 2:25). The Prophet Joseph Smith confirmed this, stating:<br><br><i>Happiness is the object and design of our existence; and will be the end thereof, if we pursue the path that leads to it; and this path is virtue, uprightness, faithfulness, holiness, and keeping all the commandments of God.</i>[<i>Teachings,</i>pp. 255–56]<br><br>Personal happiness is a legitimate goal; it should be a central purpose of our lives. It is not a selfish goal as long as we pursue it according to the plan of happiness instituted by the Father and revealed to us by the Son. The Prophet Joseph Smith continued this theme of happiness by teaching that<br><br><i>in obedience there is joy and peace unspotted, unalloyed; and as God has designed our happiness--and the happiness of all His creatures, He never has--He never will institute an ordinance or give a commandment to His people that is not calculated in its nature to promote that happiness which He has designed, and which will not end in the greatest amount of good and glory to those who become the recipients of his laws and ordinances.</i>[<i>Teachings,</i>pp. 256–57]<br><br>If we are experiencing true joy, it is evidence that our course of action is approved of our Father; and as joy and peace are fruits of the Spirit (see Galatians 5:22), these feelings can be sure guides in helping us learn to discern the Spirit.<br><br>If happiness is important to us, we should not be surprised to find it as a thread of hope throughout Christ's ministry. The night before his crucifixion, for example, he said:<br><br><i>If ye keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love; even as I have kept my Father's commandments, and abide in his love.</i><br><br><i>These things have I spoken unto you, that my joy might remain in you, and that your joy might be full.</i>[John 15:10–11]<br><br>And in his great intercessory prayer, he said, "And these things I speak in the world, that they might have my joy fulfilled in themselves" (John 17:13).<br><br>The pathway to happiness, both in this life and in the next, is encompassed in the gospel of Jesus Christ. This plan of happiness is essential for our well-being, both spiritual and temporal. As the Author of our salvation stated, "If ye know these things, happy are ye if ye do them" (John 13:17).<br><br>Now, I hope I have made it clear that obedience to the gospel of Jesus Christ and strict adherence to his teachings are essential for the simple reason that we cannot progress or be happy without such obedience. We are familiar with the operations of law in our everyday lives, and the laws governing our progression and happiness are just as inexorable.<br><h2><b>Agents unto Ourselves</b></h2><br>When we speak of obedience to law, we must also speak of companion principle--free agency. Without free agency our mortal probation would not be a test; the Lord could not prove us to see if we would do all things that he has commanded. Therefore, we read of Adam and his children: "And it is given unto them to know good from evil; wherefore they are agents unto themselves" (Moses 6:56). We are free to choose between good and evil, to act for ourselves. We know also that we will be enticed by both good and evil. If we choose good, we will abide "in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free." If we choose evil, we will be entangled in the "yoke of bondage" (Galatians 5:1). God wants us to be free and independent, to act for ourselves and not to be acted upon (see 2 Nephi 2:26). He wants us to "be anxiously engaged in a good cause, and do many things of [our] own free will, and bring to pass much righteousness; for the power is in [us]" (D&amp;amp;C 58:27–28).<br><br>Now, the key to our freedom lies in an apparent paradox: we must give up our freedom voluntarily in order to know the freedom that only Christ can give.<br><br>The Savior is our perfect prototype and exemplar in this type of celestial obedience. During his mortal ministry, the Lord said, "I can of mine own self do nothing: as I hear, I judge: and my judgment is just; because I seek not mine own will, but the will of the Father which hath sent me" (John 5:30). His ultimate demonstration of obedience, incomprehensible to us, was his atonement. Abinadi said of him 150 years before his birth, "Yea, even so he shall be led, crucified, and slain, the flesh becoming subject even unto death, the will of the Son being swallowed up in the will of the Father" (Mosiah 15:7).<br><br>Our sacrifices can never compare to the Savior's; but our willing obedience, our submission to the will of the Father, should be like unto his. We read in Omni (1:26) that we are to "come unto him, and offer [our] whole souls as an offering unto him." Elder B. H. Roberts taught that "to submit his mind and his will to God [is] man's highest act of worship--self-surrender." (Quoted by Truman G. Madsen,<i>Defender of the Faith: The B. H. Roberts Story</i>[Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1980], p. 378.)<br><h2><b>Only Two Choices</b></h2><br>This is a difficult doctrine to accept and live. But it becomes easier if we understand and have faith that we really have only two choices: obey the Father or serve the devil. Listen carefully to Lehi's teachings concerning the choices we can make:<br><br><i>I would that ye should look to the great Mediator, and hearken unto his great commandments; and be faithful unto his words, and choose eternal life, according to the will of his Holy Spirit.</i><br><br>This is option number one, to choose eternal life by following the will of the Holy Spirit. Now the second option is to<br><br><i>Choose eternal death, according to the will of the flesh and the evil which is therein, which giveth the spirit of the devil power to captivate, to bring you down to hell, that he may reign over you in his own kingdom.</i>[2 Nephi 2:28–29]<br><br>I have never known anyone who has deliberately chosen to obey the devil. There may be such people, but I have never known one. I have observed, however, many people who choose to follow the "will of the flesh," to pursue their own self-interests to the exclusion of God's will. In "doing their own thing" they assert a false independence, and independence from God rather than freedom in God. And the result will inevitably be captivity, for pursuing our own will leaves us subject to the devil.<br><br>Remember the Nephites, who shortly before Christ's visit were puffed up in pride, seeking for power and riches. We read that they were "carried about by the temptations of the devil whithersoever he desired to carry them, and to do whatsoever iniquity he desire they should" (3 Nephi 6:17).<br><br>By contrast, Christ taught, "If ye continue in my word, then are ye my disciples indeed; And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free" (John 8:31–32). There may be some truth in C. S. Lewis's observation that "There are only two kinds of people in the end: those who say to God, 'Thy will be done,' and those to whom God says, in the end, '<i>Thy</i>will be done'" ("The Great Divorce,"<i>The Best of C. S. Lewis</i>[Washington, D. C.: Canon Press, 1969], p. 156).<br><br>President Marion G. Romney taught:<br><br><i>To seek to know the Father's will and to comply therewith does not mean abject submission to an arbitrary superior force, but rather bringing ourselves into harmony with the laws and principles prevailing in an orderly universe. It is the only way by which we may be at peace in the earth, and eventually rise to our high destiny as the children of God.</i>[<i>CR,</i>April 1945, pp. 86–87]<br><h2><b>Two Examples of Obedience</b></h2><br>Let me cite two examples of people who have demonstrated this type obedience. First, Nephi the son of Helaman, of whom we read:<br><br><i>Blessed art thou, Nephi, for those things which thou hast done; for I have beheld how thou hast with unwearyingness declared the word, which I have given unto thee, unto this people.</i><br><br><i>And thou hast not feared them, and hast not sought thine own life, but hast sought my will, and to keep my commandments.</i><br><br><i>And now, because thou hast done this with such unwearyingness, behold, I will bless thee forever; and I will make thee mighty in word and in deed, in faith and in works; yea, even that all things shall be done unto thee according to thy word, for thou shalt not ask that which is contrary to my will.</i>[Helaman 10:4–5]<br><br>Second, let me quote from a talk given by Elder Boyd K. Packer at this university in 1971. Elder Packer said:<br><br><i>Perhaps the greatest discovery of my life, without question the greatest commitment, came when finally I had the confidence in God that I would loan or yield my agency to him--without compulsion or pressure, without any duress, as a single individual alone, by myself, no counterfeiting, nothing expected other than the privilege. In a sense, speaking figuratively, to take one's agency, that precious gift which the scriptures make plain is essential to life itself, and say, "I will do as you direct," is afterward to learn that in so doing you possess it all the more. ...</i><br><br><i>We should put ourselves in a position before our Father in heaven and say, individually, "I do not want to do what I want to do. I want to do what thou wouldst have me do."</i>["Obedience,"<i>BYU Speeches of the Year,</i>7 Dec. 1971, p. 4]<br><h2><b>The Principle of Opposition</b></h2><br>I testify that such commitment is the pathway to true freedom, and hence progression and happiness. The reason that more people have not made this commitment brings us to another principle associated with obedience and agency--the principle of opposition. Lehi taught, "For it must needs be, that there is an opposition in all things" (2 Nephi 2:11). The source of this opposition, ultimately, is the devil, and the reason for his opposition is given as follows: "And because he had fallen from heaven, and had become miserable forever, he sought also the misery of all mankind" (2 Nephi 2:18). Christ seeks our happiness, and the devil seeks our misery, and we receive wages of him whom we list to obey (see Alma 3:27).<br><br>Opposition to our obedience takes many forms. Let me name just a few general categories. First, ignorance, deception, false doctrine. We are told that "It is impossible for a man to be saved in ignorance" (D&amp;amp;C 131:6). The devil delights in the benighted condition of mankind, "And that wicked one cometh and taketh away light and truth, through disobedience, from the children of men, and because of the tradition of their fathers" (D&amp;amp;C 93:39).<br><br>There is no salvation in believing false doctrines. And false doctrines are being promulgated on every front so that even "the humble followers of Christ ... are led, that in many instances they do err because they are taught by the precepts of men" (2 Nephi 28:14). The doctrines that we believe determine our actions, and there is great danger in entertaining the falsehoods spread by the enemies of righteousness. I am grateful for this university and for wonderful teachers and the administration here, who are promulgating truth. I hope you students realize what a great opportunity and privilege it is to attend this university. What you learn here and how you prepare yourselves may have eternal consequences.<br><br>Next, let me warn you against gratification of pleasure, which can impede your progress and rob you of your happiness. The Savior taught the Nephites:<br><br><i>But if it be not built upon my gospel, and is built upon the works of men, or upon the works of the devil, verily I say unto you they have joy in their works for a season, and by and by the end cometh, and they are hewn down and cast into the fire, from whence there is no return.</i>[3 Nephi 27:11]<br><br>Indulgence may bring temporary pleasure, but be assured that it will not last. Happiness does not come from indulging an appetite. It is a state of being that results from the possession of that which is true, good, and beautiful. It is more enduring and soul-satisfying, of a higher intellectual and moral nature. Sin, by contrast, brings increased desire and decreased satisfaction; it results in jaded tastes that require ever-increasing variety and intensity to satisfy an appetite that is being slowly desensitized.<br><br>Finally, let me name pride and vain ambition as an obstacle to obedience. Isaiah noted an attitude of Babylon as the complete opposite of obedience:<br><br><i>For thou hast trusted in thy wickedness: thou hast said, None seeth me. Thy wisdom and thy knowledge, it hath perverted thee; and thou hast said in thine heart, I am, and none else beside me.</i>[Isaiah 47:10]<br><br>Self-sufficiency is the antithesis of humility, and it is repugnant to God. Note the contrast between this attitude and the attitudes of Nephi and Elder Packer.<br><h2><b>The Whole Law</b></h2><br>Well, we all have our weaknesses. Some commandments are hard for one person to live, while another has no trouble at all living the same commandments. Sometimes we pick and choose the commandments that we want to live. Thus we find a young person who will not drink coffee, yet he will indulge in immoral behavior, or one who will pay tithing but not study the scriptures. This results in a double-minded approach to the gospel. There are unity and harmony in the gospel, with each commandment and law complementing and supporting all others. When we violate or neglect one commandment, we place ourselves in jeopardy with any or all of the other commandments. A person who covets, for example, may be easily tempted to steal or to lie, to disregard the Sabbath, or to allow worldly goods to become idols that displace his faith in God. I suppose that James had something like this in mind when he wrote, "For whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all" (James 2:10).<br><br>Our motives and intentions are all-important. We will make mistakes and do things that we know we shouldn't; but if our attitude is one of humble submission to God, if we are earnestly striving to improve, then we will experience progress and happiness. We will be on the path to eternal life. But if we are knowingly violating commandments, with no sincere desire to repent, we are in great danger. Let me refer to two men whose lives were touched by the Master. The first is the rich ruler, who asked Christ, "What shall I do to inherit eternal life?" This question shows that the man had a degree of faith and trust in the Savior. The Lord answered, "Thou knowest the commendments," and quoted several of the ten commandments. The ruler replied:<br><br><i>All these have I kept from my youth up.</i><br><br><i>Now when Jesus heard these things, he said unto him, Yet lackest thou one thing: sell all that thou hast, and distribute unto the poor and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come, follow me.</i><br><br><i>And when he heard this, he was very sorrowful: for he was very rich.</i>[Luke 18:18–23]<br><br>This ruler, because of opposition in the form of riches, turned his back on the Lord, and what do you suppose the scriptures would have recorded of him had he accepted the Savior's challenge?<br><br>Contrast his reaction with the experience of Zacchaeus, a chief among the despised publicans, who was also very rich. When Jesus came to Jericho, Zacchaeus sought to see Jesus, but, being small of stature, he could not see over the crowd. So<br><br><i>he ran before, and climbed up into a sycamore tree to see him: for he was to pass that way.</i><br><br><i>And when Jesus came to the place, he looked up, and saw him, and said unto him, Zacchaeus, make haste, and come down; for today I must bide at thy house.</i><br><br><i>And he made haste, and came down, and received him joyfully.</i>[Luke 19:2–6]<br><br>We assume that Jesus taught him the gospel, and his life was changed. The scripture continues:<br><br><i>And Zacchaeus stood, and said unto the Lord; Behold, Lord, the half of my goods I give to the poor; and if I have taken any thing from any man by false accusation, I restore him fourfold.</i><br><br><i>And Jesus said unto him, This day is salvation come to this house, forsomuch as he also is a son of Abraham.</i>[Luke 19:8–9]<br><br>Will we turn our backs on the Savior because of some possession or desire that we vainly suppose to be of great worth? Or will we follow the Savior, as did Zacchaeus, committing ourselves to do his will forever? The Lord pleaded:<br><br><i>Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.</i><br><br><i>Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly of heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls.</i><br><br><i>For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.</i>[Matthew 11:28–30]<br><h2><b>Obedience Brings Rewards</b></h2><br>I testify that the burden of disobedience is oppressive, but we may cast our burdens on the Lord through repentance. Then we can gain the peace and happiness that is promised through obedience to the laws that have been established by God. Perhaps a few specific examples will show how obedience will result in the promised rewards.<br><br>When I was serving as a mission president in Arizona, I had the privilege of interviewing a fine woman who had accepted the gospel and desired to be baptized. I asked her if her husband consented to her baptism. She answered that he did and that he also was interested in the gospel. She said, however, that he could not be baptized because he suffered terribly from arthritis. Also, the doctors had told him that if he quit smoking, his ulcers would perforate, probably resulting in his death.<br><br>I told her that she ought to wait until her husband could be baptized with her. I read her the promises in section 89 of the Doctrine and Covenants, which we know to be the Word of Wisdom:<br><br><i>And all saints who remember to keep and do these sayings, walking in obedience to the commandments, shall receive health in their navel and marrow to their bones;</i><br><br><i>And shall find wisdom and great treasures of knowledge, even hidden treasures;</i><br><br><i>And shall run and not be weary, and shall walk and not faint.</i><br><br><i>And I, the Lord, give unto them a promise, that the destroying angel shall pass by them, as the children of Israel, and not slay them.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 89:18–21]<br><br>I told her that I do not usually go against the counsel of physicians, but in this case, I promised that if her husband would quit smoking, the Lord would bless him and he would be able to be baptized.<br><br>She agreed and went home to talk with her husband. He accepted the promise with great faith, placing his hope in Christ above his trust in the doctors. They went through the house and gathered every cigarette they could find. Then they carefully shredded the cigarettes, burned the paper, and disposed of the tobacco. The next morning, the wife awoke to find that her husband was not in bed. He had been in the shower and was getting dressed. This was the first time in many years that his wife had not had to help him get out of bed and help him get dressed. They were baptized two weeks later, and he continued to enjoy his independence in spite of his illnesses.<br><br><i>And when we obtain any blessing from God, it is by obedience to that law upon which it is predicated.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 130:21]<br><br>During a recent tour to Papeete in the Tahitian Islands, my wife and I attended a conference on a distant island called Makemo. It is several hundred miles from Papeete. There are a few Latter-day Saints that live on that island, and my desire was to visit every Latter-day Saint in the mission. About sixty people live on a small island about thirty miles away from Makemo. Fifty-six of those sixty are members of the Church. About thirty of those people crowded into a very small boat to come to Makemo to attend the conference with us. They had never seen a General Authority, and their contact with other people was very infrequent. About every three months a boat would come to their little island. In fact, no General Authority had ever visited the island of Makemo since Elder Rufus K. Hardy was there many years ago. (If Elder Rufus K. Hardy doesn't strike your memory, he served as one of the First Council of the Seventy at the time of Heber J. Grant.) After the conference and the feast they gave us (their feasts were a little unusual, raw fish, uncooked lobster, seaweed--Delicious!) I was with the mission president in a room when the branch president from this distant island thirty miles away from Makemo came in. They sat down on a bed in the room, and I observed as that branch president pulled a soiled envelope out of his shirt. I watched as he counted some currency and gave it to our mission president, President Jay Larson. When he excused himself I turned to the mission president and asked, "What was in the envelope?"<br><br>With tears in his eyes, he replied, "It was the tithing from that branch. It totaled about $2100."<br><br>I too was touched by the experience and felt the Lord's presence. Surely the Lord would open the windows of heaven for such faithfulness. In fact, I believe such joyful obedience to a commandment of God is in itself a blessing.<br><br><i>And when we obtain any blessing from God, it is by obedience to that law upon which it is predicated.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 130:21]<br><br>I am aware of a young man who came to his bishop for help with his family. It seemed that everything was wrong in his home. He argued with his wife, and their goals were so very opposite. His children seemed to bicker all the time, and when he tried to spend time with them, he got out of sorts very quickly. He was spending more time away from home and was using his money unwisely. After much counseling about family relations, the inspired bishop began to sense the young man's low self-esteem and eventually discovered the root of the problem: the young man had been bothered by immoral desires ever since he could remember. He loved his wife, but also he was easily attracted to other women. His thoughts were plagued by lustful desires, and he delighted in the challenge of flirting. Consequently, he suffered severely from guilt, and he felt too weak to ever fully repent. A heart full of lust has little room for the true love that should prevail in a family. For months the young man followed the bishop's plan for overcoming his weakness. The change that occured was remarkable. His family life improved dramatically. He saw qualities in his wife and children that he had never seen before. He found new joy in spending time with his family and found reservoirs of spiritual strength that he was unaware of. Alma counseled his son Shiblon to "bridle all your passions, that ye may be filled with love" (Alma 38:12). This young man had learned to bridle his passions, and the lust in his heart was replaced with a love such as he had never imagined.<br><br><i>And when we obtain any blessing from God, it is by obedience to that law upon which it is predicated.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 130:21]<br><br>Perhaps you read in a recent<i>Ensign</i>about an exuberant convert named Maria. On one occasion her branch was gathered at a lake for two baptisms. The author wrote:<br><br><i>One of the converts and a missionary stood in the water about to proceed with the ordinance when a noisy family walked by, laughing and shouting.</i><br><br><i>None of us had as good a command of the Spanish language as Maria did, so we asked her to tell them to be quiet. "Maria," we urged, "ask them to go somewhere else."</i><br><br><i>But instead, Maria invited the noisemakers into our group. Quiet now, the family watched both baptisms while she explained the details of our beliefs. Afterward, they invited the missionaries to their home. They accepted the baptismal challenge a few weeks later.</i>[Kathryn Malmfeldt, "The Trouble with Maria,"<i>Ensign,</i>August 1982, p. 47.]<br><br>The Lord promised:<br><br><i>Open your mouths and they shall be filled. ...</i><br><br><i>Yea, open your mouths and spare not, and you shall be laden with sheaves upon your backs, for lo, I am with you.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 33:8–9]<br><br>Maria took the Lord's promise literally; she opened her mouth to invite some nonmembers into a baptismal service. We can be sure that she experienced joy with the new converts and that her joy prompted further missionary service.<br><br><i>And when we obtain any blessing from God, it is by obedience to that law upon which it is predicated.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 130:21]<br><h2><b>Rewards of the Right Kind of Education</b></h2><br>Finally, let me speak of the rewards that come from an education. President David O. McKay said that "True education is awakening a love for truth, a just sense of duty, opening the eyes of the soul to the great purpose and end of life" (<i>CR,</i>April 1965, p. 8). The time you spend at this university is important for many reasons. You will, of course, learn skills that will increase your capacity to serve, that will make you a more productive citizen, and that will prepare you for your life's occupation so that you can support your family and contribute to our society. But most important, you will become an educated person. You will learn to love the pursuit of knowledge and truth, and this is a characteristic of spirituality. I promise that, as you develop good study habits and a keen interest in knowledge, your continuing education will be a source of joy to you throughout your life. The Lord said:<br><br><i>If thou shalt ask, thou shalt receive revelation upon revelation, knowledge upon knowledge, that thou mayest know the mysteries and peaceable things--that which bringeth joy, that which bringeth life eternal.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 42:61]<br><br>Your education is contingent upon your observing the laws of learning.<br><br>I have said much about obedience. It is admittedly a challenging principle. Obedience is hard, as well it ought to be. Is it worth it? Let the Lord answer that question:<br><br><i>For thus saith the Lord--I, the Lord, am merciful and gracious unto those who fear me, and delight to honor those who serve me in righteousness and in truth unto the end.</i><br><br><i>Great shall be their reward and eternal shall be their glory.</i><br><br><i>And to them will I reveal all mysteries, yea, all the hidden mysteries of my kingdom from days of old, and for ages to come, will I make known unto them the good pleasure of my will concerning all things pertaining to my kingdom.</i><br><br><i>Yea, even the wonders of eternity shall they know, and things to come will I show them, even the things of many generations.</i><br><br><i>And their wisdom shall be great, and their understanding reach to heaven; and before them the wisdom of the wise shall perish, and the understanding of the prudent shall come to naught.</i><br><br><i>For by my Spirit will I enlighten them, and by my power will I make known unto them the secrets of my will--yea, even those things which eye has not seen, nor ear heard, nor yet entered into the heart of man.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 76:5–10]<br><h2><b>"Thy Word Is a Lamp"</b></h2><br>In conclusion, let me bear my testimony that the commandments are for our instruction and edification; they are not a burden to those who love the Lord. They are our road map, an iron rod through the mists of darkness.<br><br><i>The law of the Lord is perfect, converting the soul: the testimony of the Lord is sure, making wise the simple.</i><br><br><i>The statutes of the Lord are right, rejoicing the heart: the commandment of the Lord is pure, enlightening the eyes.</i>[Psalms 19:7–8]<br><br>When we truly accept the Lord's laws as our guideposts to happiness and progression, our defense and refuge in an uncertain world, we can exclaim to the world in the words of the psalmist:<br><br><i>O how I love thy law! It is my meditation all the day.</i><br><br><i>Thou through thy commandments has made me wiser than mine enemies. ...</i><br><br><i>I understand more than the ancients, because I keep thy precepts. ...</i><br><br><i>Through thy precepts I get understanding: therefore I hate every false way.</i><br><br><i>Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path.</i>[Psalm 119:97–98, 100, 104–105]<br><br>May this be our attitude toward the gentle commands of our Lord, I pray humbly as I leave you my blessing and witness that the Church is true, that God lives, that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of the living God. He loves us and desires that we keep his commandments. I bear solemn witness unto you, my good friends, that President Spencer Woolley Kimball is a prophet of the living God, and I pray that we'll ever listen to a prophet's voice and do the things that the Lord would have us do, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Jack H Goaslind was a member of the First Quorum of the Seventy of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when this devotional address was given at Brigham Young University on 26 September 1982.</i><br><br><i>© Intellectual Reserve, Inc.

<br>
<h2><b>What Is It to Be "Born Again"?</b></h2><br>One day, as I was traveling on a plane to New England, I entered into a conversation with a young stewardess sitting in the seat next to me. Most members of our Church know how to steer a conversation toward the gospel, and, before long, we were talking about religion. She told me that she had recently been converted from her former manner of living and was now "saved." I congratulated her. Then she added that she was now a "born-again Christian."<br><br>I asked her how she was born again, and she told me that she had accepted Jesus Christ as her personal Savior and now believed in him. I told her how wonderful that was, but explained that acceptance of and belief in Jesus Christ is normally called faith. She said, "But I have changed my former way of thinking and living. I am now on the path to eternal life." Again I congratulated her and told her<i>that</i>change is normally called repentance. "But," she said, "I have felt a marvelous spiritual change come over me which has purged all evil from my soul." I then asked her if this were not a gift from the Holy Ghost. "I suppose it is," she admitted, "but I mean I've had a sanctification experience, not through any work that I or any other person has done for me, but a work of grace whereby Jesus has pardoned my sins and promised me eternal life. I don't need any formal church organization to accomplish this. A person needs only that wonderful, spiritual experience, or feeling of grace." She added that she had truly been reborn spiritually. From her words, I knew she did not understand what is meant by being "born again" nor what is termed the second birth.<br><br>I have observed that few people who profess to be Christians--even many within The Church of Jesus Christ--really understand some of the most basic principles of the gospel. Today I want to teach you a little about one of these basic principles or what it actually means to be "born again."<br><h2><b>"I Am the Door"</b></h2><br>Jesus was speaking of a basic concept when he related the parable of the sheepfold, as recorded in the tenth chapter of John. He called himself the true shepherd and said the sheep must enter in at the door, as does the good shepherd. He explained that those who try to climb into the sheepfold by some other way are thieves and robbers. The shepherd leads the way coming in or going out, and the sheep follow him, for they recognize his voice. They trust the shepherd and will follow him, but they will not follow a stranger. His hearers could not understand what Jesus meant by this statement, and so he explained:<br><br><i>I am the door: by me if any man enter in, he shall be saved, and shall go in and out, and find pasture.</i>[John 10:9]<br><br><i>I am the good shepherd, and know my sheep, and am known of mine.</i><br><br><i>As the Father knoweth me, even so know I the Father: and I lay down my life for the sheep.</i>[John 10:14–15]<br><br>What did Jesus mean when he said, "I am the door for the sheep"?<br><br>When Jesus said he was the door to the sheepfold, he meant that there is only one door or way by which one can return to God the Eternal Father. That door must be through Jesus himself and is a very narrow door which is designed and constructed to conform not only to his teachings but also to his works. If we enter in through that door, it must be in the Father's way as Jesus demonstrated through his own life of instruction and service and not by some other way prescribed by man.<br><h2><b>Symbolism of Baptism</b></h2><br>Jesus had preached this doctrine before, as, for example, when he spoke with Nicodemus. Nicodemus was a prominent Jew and a member of the Sanhedrin, which was the supreme council or tribunal of the Jews. When Nicodemus asked Jesus how he could personally enter into that fold as one of the chosen sheep or true believers,<br><br><i>Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot</i>[even] see<i>the kingdom of God.</i>[John 3:3; emphasis added]<br><br>Nicodemus could not understand how a person could be born again and asked how that was possible. How can a person again enter into his mother's womb and be born a second time? Jesus explained that this new birth was symbolic in nature and thus different from one's first birth. He explained that a person had to be born this second time both of water and of the Spirit. He was not referring to a spiritual experience only, but to an experience involving water also.<br><br>When Nicodemus still could not understand and questioned what was meant, Jesus chided him and asked, "Art thou a master of Israel [that is, a teacher of the people], and knowest not these things?" Jesus thus was asking how Nicodemus could fail to recognize that he had been speaking of baptism. After all, the Israelites had been practicing baptism for centuries and had carried a baptismal font with them through the wilderness, which they placed in front of the tabernacle as they set up camp in the wilderness. Even at that day the font or "brazen sea" stood before the temple in Jerusalem. Surely Nicodemus as a master or teacher of Israel should have recognized the teaching Jesus referred to and should have understood what Jesus meant. But Nicodemus did not understand, and many people today--even some within the Church of Jesus Christ--do not fully understand what occurs when a person is baptized. This lack of understanding was also evidenced by the words of the stewardess in the seat next to me on the airplane.<br><br>Baptism richly symbolizes many things. For example, Paul likened baptism to the crucifixion and resurrection of Jesus in the following words addressed to the Romans:<br><br><i>Know ye not, that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death?</i><br><br><i>Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death: that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life.</i><br><br><i>For if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death, we shall be</i>[raised out of the water]<i>also in the likeness of his resurrection:</i><br><br><i>Knowing this, that our old man</i>[that is, our former unrighteous life]<i>is crucified with him, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sin</i>[that is, the devil]. [Romans 6:3–6]<br><br>In other words, there must be a death to the type of life most people live. The wicked self must die. In my own thinking, I define wickedness simply as disobedience to God. Personal disobedience, or wickedness, must cease and die.<i>That</i>disobedience to the laws of God must not only die and be buried, but must remain dead and buried. Such a change of life for the better is normally called repentance. All personal disobedience to God must end and be replaced by a willingness to keep his laws and his commandments.<br><br>Repentance precedes baptism. And baptism itself is an ordinance to wash away former sins. So the washing in water symbolized the purification of our souls, just as bathing in water cleanses our bodies from the grime and dirt of everyday living and makes us feel refreshed again. But baptism symbolizes something more. It is the beginning of a new life. Just as the resurrection purges the dross and imperfections of mortality and renews and perfects the body, so baptism cleanses the soul from sin and prepares a person to lead a better, more perfect life in the future. We can see how apt Paul's simile was in which he compared baptism with death and the resurrection.<br><br>But this is only part of the concept and meaning of baptism. When Jesus referred to being born again, he was comparing this experience with our original birth. During gestation, the fetus is completely surrounded by the amniotic fluid in the womb. The fetus is nourished by the blood of its mother, which provides the necessary food for the developing body. When the body is prepared and the spirit enters the body, a living soul is created ready for birth. Without that spirit, the child would be stillborn, and the creation process would not be complete.<br><br>Note now what the Lord told Adam and Eve to teach their children:<br><br><i>That by reason of transgression cometh the fall, which fall bringeth death, and inasmuch as ye were born into the world by water, and blood, and the spirit, which I have made, and so became of dust a living soul</i>[the creation process],<i>even so ye must be born again into the kingdom of heaven, of water, and of the Spirit, and be cleansed by blood, even the blood of mine Only Begotten; that ye might be sanctified from all sin, and enjoy the words of eternal life in this world, and eternal life in the world to come, even immortal glory.</i>[Moses 6:59]<br><br>That is why baptism is called a second birth. Note, too, how the Lord describes the results of baptism:<br><br><i>For by the water ye keep the commandments; by the Spirit ye are justified, and by the blood ye are sanctified.</i>[Moses 6:60]<br><h2><b>Baptism Alone Not Enough</b></h2><br>Without the nourishment provided by the atonement of Jesus Christ, baptism would remain just a dead form. Baptism alone cannot save us. Works alone cannot save us. Baptism must be accompanied by the granting of the Holy Ghost which makes us spiritually alive just as God breathed into Adam the breath of life when he was created. Without the Holy Ghost, we would be spiritually stillborn and would not have power to enter the presence of God the Eternal Father.<br><br>As to the importance of confirmation following baptism by water, Paul recorded that he found some of the Ephesians had been baptized in the same manner of immersion that John the Baptist had used. When Paul then asked if they had received the Holy Ghost, he was astonished to find that they had not even heard about it. He then explained:<br><br><i>John verily baptized with the baptism of repentance, saying unto the people, that they should believe on him which should come after him, that is, on Christ Jesus.</i><br><br><i>When they heard this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus</i>[not in the name of either John or Paul].<br><br><i>And when Paul had laid his hands upon them, the Holy Ghost came on them; and they spake with tongues, and prophesied.</i>[Acts 19:4–6]<br><br>In other words, their original baptism was invalid, apparently because it had been performed by someone without proper authority as evidenced by their lack of knowledge of the complete ordinance. They were spiritually still-born, and the whole ordinance had to be performed again properly, in full, by one having authority.<br><br>Even if all the ordinances were carried out properly and with authority, we still could not be saved. The grace of Jesus Christ is also necessary. Mankind cannot be saved solely by obedience to the laws and ordinances of the gospel. Only those ordinances coupled with the<i>atonement of Jesus Christ</i>and conditioned upon obedience to gospel truths can bring us back into the presence of God the Eternal Father. Thus, through the atonement of Jesus Christ together with the proper ordinances performed in the proper manner by proper authority and coupled with obedience to the laws and commandments of God, we can be saved from death and can be exalted even to live in the presence of God the Eternal Father. That is why all<i>three</i>of these concepts are mentioned in the Third Article of Faith, which we accept as truth.<br><h2><b>A Second Birth</b></h2><br>Let us return again to the symbolism of baptism as a second birth. John the Beloved knew and taught this same doctrine of comparing baptism with a birth process, leading to exaltation into the presence of the whole Godhead of Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. Referring to Jesus Christ, he wrote:<br><br><i>This is he that came by water and blood, even Jesus Christ; not by water only, but by water and blood. And it is the Spirit that beareth witness, because the Spirit is truth.</i><br><br><i>For there are three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost: and these three are one.</i><br><br><i>And there are three that bear witness in earth, the Spirit, and the water, and the blood: and these three agree in one.</i>[1 John 5:6–8]<br><br>Not only are the proper form and authority necessary, but one must have proper understanding of what is actually being accomplished in this baptismal ordinance. Note again the symbolism. Just as the three persons in the Godhead constitute a unity of purpose, so the three elements of baptism constitute a unity which can bring us back into the presence of those Three in heaven. The unity of this baptismal ordinance on earth mirrors in symbolism the unity in heaven.<br><br>Let us here pause a moment to explain the dual nature of Christ's atonement. Jesus Christ defined his work as follows:<br><br><i>For behold, this is my work and my glory--to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man.</i>[Moses 1:39]<br><br>When people of the world speak of being "saved," they refer to being saved from death--that is, to rise in the resurrection. This is the first part of the atonement of Jesus Christ as he described it. It is a pure gift of grace which Jesus Christ gives to<i>every</i>person who has lived on the earth and is independent of the works we do. But to be<i>exalted</i>to eternal life and to be able to live the kind of life that God the Eternal Father lives requires not only the gift of grace that Jesus gives to all mankind through his atonement, but that gift coupled with our own obedience and conformance to all the requirements of righteous living prescribed by the gospel of Jesus Christ. Exaltation, or the eternal life Jesus spoke about, comes from a partnership with Jesus Christ which begins in the ordinance of baptism, as we accept membership in the family of Jesus Christ, and is developed through a life-time of righteous living.<br><h2><b>Born into Family of Jesus Christ</b></h2><br>Now, if we are born again, we must be born into a family. Into whose family are we born? Why, into the family of Jesus Christ! The scriptures refer to the Savior as the Bridegroom and to the church as the bride. Through baptism, then, we become children in that royal family, with Jesus Christ as our Father. Through the baptismal ordinance we take upon ourselves a new family name--the name of Jesus Christ. Paul states that we are thereby adopted as the sons and daughters of Jesus Christ. Note these words of Paul given to the Romans:<br><br><i>For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons</i>[and daughters]<i>of God.</i><br><br><i>For ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear; but ye have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father.</i><br><br><i>The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the children of God:</i><br><br><i>And if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ; if so be that we suffer with him</i>[that is, if we are obedient and serve as Jesus Christ has done]<i>, that we may be also glorified together.</i>[Romans 8:14–17; emphasis added]<br><br>That the adoption process which Paul referred to is baptism is made clear in his message to the Galatians:<br><br><i>For ye are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus.</i><br><br><i>For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ.</i><br><br><i>There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female</i>[in other words, it makes no difference at all what you have been in the past; through this ordinance you are now all equally children of God]<i>: for ye are all one in Christ Jesus.</i><br><br><i>And if ye be Christ's, then are ye Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the promise</i>[to receive the same promise and blessings as were given to Abraham]. [Galatians 3:26–29; emphasis added]<br><br>Baptism thus is an ordinance through which this adoption is effected and we take upon our selves the new family name of Christ, in other words become<i>Christians</i>.<br><br>As the waters of baptism fit closely around the body as we are immersed in the water, note how narrow the door into the fold has become. By the ordinance of baptism and confirmation, a person is both physically and spiritually adopted as a child of Jesus Christ. You will remember that God the Father had but one physical son on this earth. That Only Begotten Son is Jesus Christ. The only way a person can come back or be exalted into the presence of God the Eternal Father and clothed with a perfected resurrected body of flesh and bone is through Jesus Christ, the only physical Son of God the Eternal Father. That is why the scriptures in so many places state that there is only one name given by which mankind can be saved, or, better stated, exalted into the presence of God the Father. That name is the name of Jesus Christ. Jesus correctly said, therefore, that he is the door to the fold.<br><br>King Benjamin, that great Book of Mormon leader, explained it clearly in the following words:<br><br><i>And now, because of the covenant which ye have made ye shall be called the children of Christ, his sons, and his daughters; for behold, this day he hath spiritually begotten you; for ye say that your hearts are changed through faith on his name; therefore, ye are born of him and have become his sons and his daughters.</i><br><br><i>And under this head ye are made free, and there is no other head whereby ye can be made free. There is no other name given whereby salvation cometh; therefore, I would that ye should take upon you the name of Christ, all you that have entered into the covenant with God that ye should be obedient unto the end of your lives.</i><br><br><i>And it shall come to pass that whosoever doeth this shall be found at the right hand of God, for he shall know the name by which he is called; for he shall be called by the name of Christ.</i>[Mosiah 5:7–9]<br><br>We can take upon ourselves this holy name only by means of a covenant with God to accept Jesus Christ as our adopted Father. We witness that covenant in the waters of baptism. We thus take upon ourselves a new and holy name by which we shall be called hereafter.<br><h2><b>The Name by Which We Are Called</b></h2><br>It bothers me a little to hear members of our Church speak familiarly of Jesus Christ. They often refer to him as "our elder Brother." It is true that Jesus Christ was the Firstborn of all the spirit children of God the Eternal Father. In the spirit world he was known as Jehovah, the Firstborn. In that world, we were justified in referring to him as our elder Brother because we were with him there, and he was indeed our elder Brother in that existence. But that time has passed. We are now living in a new and a different world. Before we came here, we accepted Jehovah to become our Anointed Savior, our God and King, even our covenant Father.<br><br>When we are baptized, we actually make a new covenant with God the Eternal Father to take upon us the name of his Only Begotten Son. Jesus Christ thus becomes by adoption our covenant Father. It is, therefore, in my opinion, wrong on earth after baptism to refer to him now as "our elder Brother." He is<i>now</i>our covenant<i>Father</i>, and we have become his covenant sons and daughters. We ought to be more respectful and show our gratitude to him for the opportunity we have to become members of his royal family.<br><br>It was for this reason that Peter made his statement that we quote so often from his first letter:<br><br><i>But ye are a chosen generation, a</i>royal<i>priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvelous light:</i><br><br><i>Which in time past were not a people, but are</i>now<i>the people of God: which had</i>not<i>obtained mercy, but now have obtained mercy.</i>[1 Peter 2:9–10; emphasis added]<br><br>Through baptism we have become adopted members of the royal family of Jesus Christ, and that is the basic reason we now call each other "brother" and "sister." We have indeed become members of the Church or family of Jesus Christ.<br><br>If we can keep that concept clearly in mind, that we are now children of Jesus Christ, it will change our lives. If we live righteously enough, we can even go into the temple and be sealed into the patriarchal lineage of the Melchizedek Priesthood. We then become the covenant children of Jesus Christ even<i>more</i>completely by taking upon us the name of Jesus Christ in its original meaning. We can become anointed saviors ourselves through vicarious work for the dead. In the temple we are given authority to assist our covenant Father, Jesus Christ, in his redemptive work of sealing together all men, women, and children in family order who are worthy of such blessings. It is in this manner that the covenant family of Jesus Christ is put into proper patriarchal order of lineage for the eternity of family life to come.<br><br>If we can only understand the full stature of the name by which we then are called, we will live different lives. No longer will we do less than our best in class assignments. No longer will we be dishonest in paying our bills or in the treatment of our roommates or landlords, nor will we take unfair advantage of anyone in<i>any</i>way. Our word will be as binding on us as our bond. No longer will we be unkind to our associates, or be unvirtuous or immoral or selfish in any way, either secretly or openly. We will do nothing to bring dishonor or shame to that holy name we carry as children of Jesus Christ. We will respect and honor our covenant Father, Jesus Christ, and be righteously jealous and protective of the holy name we bear. We will judge everything we do on the basis of how it might reflect on him whose name we carry, not only on our lips but in our very hearts.<br><br>Peter stated clearly the importance of that name as he testified of Jesus to the Jews:<br><br><i>This is the stone which was set at naught of you builders, which is become the head of the corner.</i><br><br><i>Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.</i>[Acts 4:11–12]<br><br>Paul told how important this name becomes to us as he taught the Ephesians:<br><br><i>For this cause I bow my knees unto the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,</i><br><br><i>Of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named.</i>[Ephesians 3:14–15]<br><br>Nephi, that great Book of Mormon prophet, told of the truth of this concept as he wrote:<br><br><i>Behold I say unto you, that as these things are true, and as the Lord God liveth, there is none other name given under heaven save it be this Jesus Christ, of which I have spoken, whereby man can be saved.</i>[2 Nephi 25:20]<br><br>This truth was also revealed in our own time to the Prophet Joseph Smith in the following words:<br><br><i>Behold, Jesus Christ is the name which is given of the Father, and there is none other name given whereby man can be saved;</i><br><br><i>Wherefore, all men must take upon them the name which is given of the Father, for in that name shall they be called at the last day;</i><br><br><i>Wherefore, if they know not the name by which they are called, they cannot have place in the kingdom of my Father.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 18:23–25]<br><h2><b>That Narrow Gate</b></h2><br>To repeat Jesus' words:<br><br><i>I am the door: by me if any man enter in, he shall be saved, and shall go in and out, and find pasture.</i>[John 10:9]<br><br>Thus, through baptism we can enter through that narrow gate into the kingdom or family of Jesus Christ as heirs--joint heirs with Jesus Christ--to all the blessings of God the Eternal Father. Through righteous living we can receive all those blessing which God has reserved for those who are prepared to receive them. Thus, through the atonement of Jesus Christ and through obedience to the laws and ordinances of the gospel, we take upon us the name of Jesus Christ--in Hebrew, Yehoschuah Maschiach, which interpreted means, the Anointed Savior or Redeemer. Through this ordinance we can walk, at least in part, in the very footsteps of our Lord and Savior.<br><br>I only wish I had been able to teach these principles to that stewardess before our plane landed and we were separated. Perhaps, though, I sowed a seed which will someday sprout and grow when a missionary later on contacts her and has an opportunity to explain the<i>true</i>meaning of being a "born-again Christian."<br><br>Of Jesus Christ I testify, that he lives and directs this Church through chosen prophets. I testify also of the divine nature of the baptismal covenant and of its importance in our lives if we keep and respect that contract. I testify of the truth of these doctrines in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Theodore M.

<br>
<h2><b>"It's Knowing What's Right That's Hard!"</b></h2><br>Upon graduating from law school, I was fortunate to obtain a position as a clerk at the Utah Supreme Court. I became there intimately acquainted with the workings of the court and came to know personally the judges who presided. Part of my work was to review and outline the facts of a particular case, to research the applicable law, and then to play what is sometimes called the devil's advocate with the judge who would eventually write the opinion deciding the matter. It was an exciting and challenging thing to do. I remember vividly listening to the persuasive arguments of the lawyers for the opposing parties and being swayed first by one and then by the other as case after case was argued on appeal.<br><br>Some years later, after leaving the court, I had occasion as a practicing attorney to use the library at the state capitol. There I happened to meet the chief justice, whom I knew well. He invited me into his office to chat about old times. As we talked about the law and the problems of the practice, our conversation turned to the administrative challenges of running the court. My friend the chief justice was weary. In a few months he would be old enough to retire and leave contention and controversy to others. He indicated that he had given serious thought to doing just that.<br><br>"What would<i>you</i>think if I retired?" he asked.<br><br>Although I could understand the reasons why he might want to escape from the heavy responsibility of the court, I blurted out my instinctive reaction to his question.<br><br>"Oh, judge," I said, "please don't do that. You will never know how comforting it is to those of us who practice here to have someone on the court who always tries to do what's right."<br><br>Now that was not a sophisticated or a reasoned response to his question. It was unlawyer-like on my part, I suppose. But it was a heartfelt and overly simplified statement of truth. I intended it as a compliment. To my surprise, he became angry. He raised his voice, furrowed his brow, and said,<br><br>"Heavens, Burt, any fool can<i>do</i>what's right. It's<i>knowing</i>what's right that's hard!"<br><br>Of course, he did not mean that he had a greater ability to do right than anyone else. He did not mean that fools find it easy to obey the law. Nor did he intend to depreciate the difficulty of<i>doing</i>anything. My friend had, however, unerringly focused upon his greatest concern as a judge. What he was saying was that, while not everyone applied the law to their own conduct, it was not hard to do so once the law had been determined. It was then a relatively simple matter of doing it or not. What was much more difficult was to determine what the law should be and to decide between two competing, attractive, and well-reasoned alternatives presented by articulate and sophisticated spokesmen. The more difficult thing for him was to choose or determine or to decide which of two compelling courses was correct.<i>That</i>was hard.<br><br>Is this not true in our lives as well? While not implying that we always are able to do what we know--to keep the commandments, to pay our tithing, to be honest, and so forth (and I know that for most of us these things are hard enough)--nevertheless, let me suggest that what is infinitely more difficult is to choose or know what to do at the countless crossroads which come every day into our lives. Especially is this true when the choices which are presented to us all appear to be equally persuasive or attractive.<br><h2><b>Examples from Everyday Life</b></h2><br>Let me illustrate. Imagine with me that you are a college student. That shouldn't be too difficult. It is eight-thirty in the morning. You got up late because you went to bed late. You have an assignment due in your 9-a.m. class. You have not finished it. You are not presentable, and you haven't had breakfast. You know that you might possibly make it to class on time if you hurry and remain hungry.<br><br>It also occurs to you that if you stayed home and worked on the assignment all day, you could type it up in finished form. You could then put yesterday's date on it and hand it in tomorrow. You could tell the professor that it was done on time, but that you had a one-hundred-degree fever or the twenty-four-hour flu and couldn't get out of bed. Part of that might be true.<br><br>What do you do? You know you should tell the truth. You know that you should be in class. You know about integrity. These absolute values are known, and, if you were asked questions regarding them in the abstract, you would clearly know what the answers should be. However, in the context of the end justifying the means, it might also seem important that you get your assignment in, that you not fail the class, that you keep faith with your parents who are paying your tuition, and that you stay on track in your major subject so as to be able to graduate. And so, what might in isolation be simple turns out to be a complex problem of daily living for you. It is easy to rationalize and say, "It is too late to get to class now. It would do no good to hurry. Play it cool. Everyone calls in sick once in a while. The professor will never know."<br><br>Everyday choices come into our lives which constantly require us to apply what we know. Doing what we know is right is then relatively easy. Knowing what to do in the face of competing, conflicting choices is more difficult.<br><br>Let me give you another example. Imagine with me again that you have been looking for a job for months. You are behind on your car payments, and, unless you get something soon, the finance company will repossess your automobile. It is early on a rainy November morning; you are on your way to the most promising job interview you have ever had. Once again you are late. The gas gauge indicates that you will have just enough fuel to get there if you are lucky. You slow down for a stoplight and see an acquaintance standing in the rain at the bus stop. You know that, if you give your friend a ride, you will be even later. You know that, unless you exceed the speed limit, you won't arrive at the appointed hour. You know that, if you get another moving violation, you will lose your license.<br><br>A decision must be made--what do<i>you</i>do? If the situation could be broken down, all of us would know what should be done about any individual item: You should not speed, you should stop for gas, you should give your friend a helping hand, and, of course, the job is important to your financial well-being and happiness. It merits almost any honorable effort to obtain it. But out of all of this, what do<i>you do</i>? Either you stop or you don't. Either you speed or you do not. Does it matter if you break the law? Does it matter if you get the job? Does it matter if you lose your license? Is it important if you fail to give your friend a ride? Are there hidden and unforeseen consequences of possibly running out of gas or driving too fast? Are there eternal consequences as well?<br><br>In such instances, knowing what to do can be most difficult, and the consequences of making wrong choices can be permanent and irretrievable.<br><br>So it is in the illustrations which I have given. Going or not going to a class, getting too close to sin, stopping in the wrong place or failing to stop at all, obeying or disregarding moral laws or the laws of the land--all of these things may eternally affect the course of your existence. What then to do? How do we find the right course? And having found it, how do we maintain it?<br><h2><b>Challenges of Gospel Living</b></h2><br>It is relatively easy to stay on the strait and narrow path as long as traffic is light and the road is marked. All we have to do is hold the course. But, at frequent moments along the way, we meet others living their lives and exercising their free agency. Without wanting it to be so, we find their demands and expectations influencing our behavior and coloring our choices. The testing time comes when friends say, "Come on. Don't be a spoilsport," or "It's o.k.; everybody does it," or "No one will know."<br><br>At such moments we discover that it is not easy to see, let alone maintain, our course. We find that it is difficult to prepare in advance answers to all of life's questions. We come to know that there are many unmarked junctions in mortality, and that we often arrive at them in the dark without signposts or road maps to help us select the way.<br><br>In other words, the problem of applying what we know to the choices which confront us every day in the world is never easy. The challenges of gospel living come to us not in circumstances of our own choosing, not necessarily one at a time, not often in the classroom, but in situations which we do not fully control.<br><br>All of us want the good life; all of us want to be honest and virtuous and to do good to all men. These ultimate values have been pronounced good by God himself. None of us would argue with them, and indeed could not.<br><br>But believing in being honest is one thing. It is still another to<i>be</i>honest when the forces of daily life make it appear advantageous to be otherwise. Professing concern for others is one thing, but choosing to serve others at an interchange where our own convenience and benefit are prominently present is the real test of our commitment to the second great commandment.<br><br>To see our way clearly through the conflicts of everyday living so as to find the course which will ultimately prove to be the best course--that is hard. This is because in much of life the rules have not been revealed, the way is not lighted, and there is no precedent. Each of us must find and walk his or her own path to perfection. The scriptures provide much help and we can profit from the experiences of others, but the fact remains that life is full of lonely moments when we alone decide what we will or will not do.<br><h2><b>Part of the Plan</b></h2><br>It would surprise me very much if the Lord did not know all of this. I am very certain that he wants it to be this way. He tells us, for example,<br><br><i>It is not meet that I should command in all things; for he that is compelled in all things, the same is a slothful and not a wise servant; wherefore he receiveth no reward.</i><br><br><i>Verily I say, men should be anxiously engaged in a good cause, and do many things of their own free will, and bring to pass much righteousness.</i><br><br><i>For the power is in them wherein they are agents unto themselves. And inasmuch as men do good they shall in nowise lose their reward.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 58:26–28]<br><br>In other words, it is intended that we have a significant measure of discretion and control over our own lives. In areas where we are not commanded, we are to be agents unto ourselves. We are not going to be controlled or commanded from heaven in these areas, whether we want to be or not.<br><br>Section 98 of the Doctrine and Covenants tells us why. Simply stated, the reason is that we are on probation. There the Lord says:<br><br><i>And I give you a commandment, that ye shall forsake all evil and cleave unto all good, that ye shall live by every word which proceedeth forth out of the mouth of God.</i><br><br><i>For he will give unto the faithful line upon line, precept upon precept; and I will try you and prove you herewith ... for I have decreed in my heart, saith the Lord, that I will prove you in all things, whether you will abide in my covenant, even unto death, that you may be found worthy.</i><br><br><i>For if ye will not abide in my covenant ye are not worthy of me.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 98:11–12, 14–15]<br><br>Mortal probation requires that God's children make conscious choices. Were it otherwise, the Lord could not determine who we really are and what we really want. It is of this area where no specific counsel or commandments have been given--where it is not know what to do or how to do it--where free agency is in absolute sway--that I speak. This is the sphere of which my friend on the supreme court said, "It is knowing what's right that's hard."<br><br>We must recognize that throughout our lives we will be required to choose between duty or obligation and other more or less attractive alternatives. Should we watch television or go visiting teaching? Should we spend time with the family or with friends? Do we read the scriptures or the latest novel? Do we leave the children home or take them with us? Do we go into debt or do without? Each of these choices when made excludes others. Were it otherwise, there could be no real probation. The Designer of the plan of salvation made it that way. By watching and observing where our hearts are as the result of the free choices we make, he then knows who and what we really are.<br><br>Often we are required to choose between two good things. This is one of the paradoxes of modern Mormonism. For example: there is a direct relationship between the amount of time spent on a particular calling and the amount of good one can do. A bishop does much good by visiting a needy member. He does ten times as much good by visiting ten needy members. How much time should he spend visiting? We get close to the Lord by studying the scriptures and pondering them. We get closer still by studying harder and pondering more. How much, then, should we study? A good father spends time with his family. A better father spends more time and has a regular weekly evening out with his wife as well.<br><br>Where is the line to be drawn? When is enough enough and more too much? How can we tell if we are active enough, serving others enough, loving enough, home enough, or whether the balance needs to be adjusted to avoid jeopardizing our salvation? Aristotle once said:<br><br><i>It is no easy task to be good. For in everything it is no easy task to find the middle ... anyone can get angry--that is easy--or give or spend money; but to do this to the right person, to the right extent, at the right time, with the right motive, and in the right way,</i>that<i>is not for everyone, nor is it easy; wherefore goodness is both rare and laudable and noble.</i>[Aristotle,<i>Nichomachean Ethics,</i>The World's Great Thinkers, Vol. 2, Man and Man: The Social Philosophers (New York: Random House, 1947 p. 39]<br><br>Could a man be a better husband if he spent every evening at home with his wife? Could he be a better husband if he had no children, thereby having all of his spare time to dedicate to her? The answer is a resounding no! No one--husband, wife, children or church--has the claim on the full time of someone else. Children with all the time of their parents would be overshadowed and become dependent. The Church with full-time bishops would have a paid ministry and become an end in itself rather than a divine organization to help perfect the individual children of God.<br><h2><b>Striking a Balance Essential</b></h2><br>It is impossible to provide detailed instructions for each person and circumstances because the balance varies according to the specific needs and abilities of each individual member of the Church. But somewhere short of total commitment to each of the great causes of family, church, employment, and self there is a balance among them all that is desirable--and not only desirable, but obviously necessary because of time limitations imposed upon us by our creator. Let us not make the mistake of criticizing the inheritance of time given us by our Father. Let us rather look at what he would have us do with the time we have been given.<br><br>There are certain areas of stewardship that we must enter. They are not and indeed must not be mutually exclusive. Each requires time. It takes time to be a father, a Relief Society president, a salesman, a student. Service takes time. Inevitably there are conflicts. But the secret of better performance in one area may not necessarily be at the expense of another. The Lord did not intend that we be at ease in Zion (see 2 Nephi 28:24). He intended that all things be done in "wisdom and order" (Mosiah 4:27).<br><br>A balance must be struck. Proper balance usually does not mean that we go down one road as far as we can go to the exclusion of all other roads. Rather it is to go down as many roads as necessary, and not more, no further than we must, in order not to impede our progress on other paths which out Father also expects us to walk. But which paths should we walk--and how far? When should we begin--and where? And how can we be sure that, among the many ways we have chosen, our way, the course of our life, is pleasing to the Lord?<br><br>Thomas Griffith, a contributing editor for<i>Time</i>magazine, once summarized the problem this way. As a young man, he said,<br><br><i>I thought myself happy at the time, my head full of every popular song that came along, the future before me. I could be an artist, a great novelist, an architect, a senator, a singer: having no demonstrable capacity for any of these pursuits made them all appear equally possible to me. All that mattered, I felt, was my inclination; I saw life as a set of free choices. Only later did it occur to me that every road taken is another untaken, every choice a narrowing. A sadder maturity convinces me that, as in a chess game, every move helps commit one to the next, and each person's situation at a given moment is the sum of the moves he has made before.</i>[Thomas Griffith,<i>The Waist-high Culture</i>(New York: Harper and Brothers, 1959), p. 17]<br><br>If this is so, and it is, then it becomes urgently important, as Elder Richard L. Evans used to say, that we be "where we ought to be, when we ought to be there," and that we be "doing what we should do when it ought to be done." For we will be judged by the choices we have made, and the balance we have struck becomes what we are.<br><br>It is noteworthy to me that as Socrates sought the solution to this problem, he asked whether the ability to judge correctly the right road, when he has never been there and doesn't know it, could ever be acquired by man. He determined that the gift of always making wise choices was beyond<i>mortal</i>ability to obtain. It could not be purchased, learned, or acquired by nature. "Whosoever has it gets it by divine dispensation," he said (see Plato,<i>Meno</i>[New York: Penguin Books, 1956], pp. 153–57).<br><br>Isn't that interesting? One of the world's reputedly wisest men, when face to face with the question of how to get from where he was to where he knew he should be, threw in the towel. The ability to wisely walk<i>that</i>road, he sadly concluded, had to come by divine dispensation and not by man's own intellect or will.<br><h2><b>What Is the Answer?</b></h2><br>Now that you have the problem, what is the answer? Can we, as Latter-day Saints, expect to fare any better as we make decisions or attempt to find balance in our lives? As a humble servant of the Lord, I testify that we can. Let me tell you why.<br><br>At the conclusion of the first day of the Savior's ministry among the Nephites, he taught them to pray:<br><br><i>Ye must always pray unto the Father in my name.</i><br><br><i>And whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my name, which is right, believing that ye shall receive, behold it shall be given unto you.</i>[3 Nephi 18:19–20]<br><br>I have often thought that this occasion was the greatest teaching moment in the recorded history of the world. The Nephites had only recently experienced the destruction of their cities, the death of loved ones, the separation of families, and the loss of homes and worldly possessions. They had survived turmoil and horror. They had known three days of total, impenetrable darkness. Of all the peoples on earth, they had much to pray for.<br><br>Then they heard a voice from heaven and saw the Son of Man descend from the sky. They heard him speak to them. Every word that he said must have been permanently engraved upon their hearts. Under these circumstances, Jesus Christ promised them that whatever they should ask the Father which was right would be given unto them. They remembered that after he departed from them and ascended into heaven. The scripture records that they dispersed. What they had seen and heard was noised abroad among the people before it was yet dark. Many people labored all the night that they might bring others to be on the morrow in the place where Jesus should show himself.<br><h2><b>The Holy Ghost Shows the Way</b></h2><br>And when the morrow came, the Twelve who had been chosen to lead the people caused them to kneel on the face of the earth and pray as they had been taught the day before. Of one mind they prayed to the Father in the name of Jesus. Remembering his promise, they asked for that which they most desired. And of all the things that they could have prayed for, the restoration of health, of homes, the reuniting of loved ones, the healing of the sick and the wounded, their leaders, their enemies--what was it they asked for? The scripture says simply: "They desired that the Holy Ghost should be given to them" (3 Nephi 19:9).<br><br>The Nephites undoubtedly had in mind the teachings of Nephi himself when he explained the function and purpose of the Holy Ghost. He had asked:<br><br><i>And now, my beloved brethren, after ye have gotten into this strait and narrow path</i>[which is to enter the Church by baptism and receive a remission of sins and the gift of the Holy Ghost],<i>I would ask if all is done? Behold, I say unto you, Nay....</i><br><br><i>... Ye must press forward with a steadfastness in Christ, having a perfect brightness of hope and a love of God and of all men. Wherefore, if ye shall press forward, feasting upon the word of Christ and endure to the end, behold, thus saith the Father: Ye shall have eternal life.</i><br><br>And then he added, most significantly, I believe:<br><br><i>Behold, again I say unto you that if ye will enter in by the way, and receive the Holy Ghost,</i>it will show unto you all things what ye should do. [2 Nephi 31:19, 20; 32:5, emphasis added]<br><br>Is it any wonder then, that the Nephites wanted above everything else the Holy Ghost? For without him and the ability to know all things whatsoever they should do, they had no hope of returning to their Father; they had no hope of successfully making right choices which would lead them to happiness and eternal life. They knew this elusive gift was the Holy Ghost.<br><br>The Nephites, after one day with the Savior, understood perhaps better than we the terms of their probation. They comprehended the necessity of divine intervention in their lives to assist them in finding their way home.<br><br>Much mention is made of the gift of the Holy Ghost in the Church. Each of us who has been baptized has this gift. Collectively, and individually if we are worthy, it sets us apart and makes us different from all other people on the face of the earth. That statement may sound arrogant or presumptuous to some. I intend no offense. But either the gift means something, or it does not. And if it does, we might best discover what it means lest we find ourselves grouped with the man which had received one talent, and, being afraid to use it, went and hid it in the earth (see Matthew 25:14–29).<br><h2><b>No Need to Look Back</b></h2><br>It is difficult for me to illustrate this principle, not because I do not know the Holy Ghost, but because most of my encounters with him are too personal to recount here. Nevertheless, let me try to show you how the Holy Ghost has operated in my life, how he may operate in yours, and how we are unlike other people as a result.<br><br>A good number of years ago I found myself on a bus. The bus was loaded with young men from all over the country. We were arriving at Castle Air Force Base in California to attend summer camp. We were cadets aspiring to be commissioned second lieutenants in the United States Air Force. As the bus entered the field, we got off and were met by a regular air force captain who assembled us in companies on the parade ground. Suitcases, duffel bags, and civilian clothes were everywhere. We were given directions to the barracks and the commissary. We were told to report in dress uniform at two o'clock that afternoon on the parade ground. I was assigned to lead the first company away.<br><br>It was an interesting summer. We spent much time in the classroom, some on the firing line, and some in the air. Each week there was a rotation of assignments; we all drew our fair share of disagreeable duty, and each week cadet officers were appointed to participate in special leadership training programs and to direct the lives of the rest of us.<br><br>As the summer wore on, I became aware that I had not received a leadership assignment. As camp drew to an end and the last duty rosters were posted, I noticed that I had been over-looked as a cadet commander. Knowing that my success or failure in the air force depended in part on how well I performed in this capacity, I asked for and received an appointment with the officer in charge of the camp.<br><br>At the proper hour, I presented myself at his office. I saluted. When asked what I wanted to discuss, I told him that I had noticed a mistake in the duty roster, and that I had not been given the rotating assignment of cadet commander. Without even looking up from his desk, the captain told me that he knew that, that he had already decided that I had no future in the air force. As I started to protest, he said, "You remember the day that you got off the bus? I asked you to march the men to the barracks. As I watched you, I knew that you did not have what it takes to be an officer in the air force. The duty roster stands. You are dismissed."<br><br>A flood of thoughts came to my mind. Years of preparation were suddenly of no avail. The course of my life hung in the balance. I turned to leave. There was a silent prayer in my heart. More of a question than a prayer, really. "Did I come this far to fail?" I asked. I found myself immobilized in front of the captain's desk. I struggled for words. My career was important to me. To my surprise, I clicked my heels together, saluted smartly, and, without having taken thought of what I should say, I said, "Begging the captain's pardon, sir, but I was under the impression that we were going to be graded by what we learned while we were here, and not by what we knew when we came."<br><br>Now you don't talk that way to regular air force officers. There was no precedent for what I did or said. At the time I didn't know from what source came the courage for the words. But I do know that I was at a crossroads. My future activities and associates would be different, depending upon what happened at that moment. My temptations and trials would be different, depending upon what happened at that moment. I would be an enlisted man or an officer, depending on what happened at that moment. The course of my life hung in the balance, as it so often does on seemingly little things.<br><br>The captain got up from his desk; he nearly bit his cigar in two. He was obviously unaccustomed to that kind of insubordination. He walked around to where I stood. He looked at my shoes, he looked at my uniform, he looked at my double chin as I held myself at strict military attention. For at least five minutes, although it seemed much longer, he circled me time after time. I stood there not knowing what else to do. Finally he said, "I might have been wrong about you. Maybe you do have what it takes to be an officer in this man's air force. We'll change the duty roster; you can command your company during the last week's activities. We'll see what you can do."<br><br>Do I believe that the Holy Ghost prompted me in what I said and did that day? Yes, I do. Could not someone else, a non-Latter-day Saint perhaps, have said the same things, or something better, so as to achieve the same result? I don't know. What I do know is that for me, in that moment, in that place, what I said and did was right. Someone else may have been more articulate; someone else may not have gotten into the difficulty in the first place. Others may have turned on their heels and left upon being informed of the captain's displeasure. The course of their lives would have been different had they done so.<br><br>I have never looked back on that incident. I am certain that what happened was right. I have no regrets, nor have I ever given more than passing thought to what might have become of me had I left the office and the air force at that moment.<br><br>I know that one of our greatest blessings as Latter-day Saints is that<i>we</i>need never look back. We need never ask what might have been. Should I have dropped out of school or struggled to get my degree? Should I have married Sally instead of the girl I did marry? What if I had taken that job in the East instead of teaching school?<br><h2><b>We Can Know beyond Doubt</b></h2><br>If we have been worthy, and if we have followed the guidance of the Spirit as manifested in the feelings of our hearts, then we can know beyond doubt that what is done was best. We can be certain, although there may have been trials, or we may be having difficulties, that we are where the Lord would have us be. We will know that, although the grass may seem greener elsewhere, our decision to enter the pasture we are in was prompted and purposeful and preparatory.<br><br>Knowing these things and knowing that for the most part we have done what the Lord wanted done can bring peace and joy beyond expression. No other people on earth can ever have<i>this</i>blessing, for it comes from having the companionship of the Holy Spirit.<br><br>As I have better understood my relationship with the Holy Ghost, I have come to know--<br><ul><br> 	<li>what it is to unexpectedly change airplanes in a distant city only to find after arriving home that a scheduled flight has been indefinitely delayed.</li><br> 	<li>what it is to begin a missionary interview with the question, never asked before or since, "Elder, who have you been fighting with," and to hear the astonished reply, "President, how did you know?"</li><br> 	<li>what it is to pay a surprise visit to a distant city and to hear someone say, "I have been praying for days that you would come."</li><br></ul><br>Occasionally, I have had time to pray and ponder before acting on the promptings of the Comforter. More often I have found myself as Nephi, "led by the Spirit, not knowing beforehand the things which I should do" (1 Nephi 4:6).<br><br>The Lord told Joseph and Oliver, "It shall be given thee in the very moment what thou shalt speak and write" (D&amp;amp;C 24:6).<br><br>To Thomas B. Marsh he said,"Go your way whithersoever I will, and it shall be given you by the Comforter what you shall do and whither you shall go" (D&amp;amp;C 31:11).<br><br>What to say! What to write! Where to go! What to do! Such guidance, if given infrequently for only some of life's decisions, would be priceless. But the broader promise was given to the Prophet Joseph at Salem, Massachusetts, that "for the main," (or for the most part) the place he should tarry would be signalized to him by the peace and power of the Spirit (see D&amp;amp;C 111:8). And the Three Witnesses were told that the Holy Ghost would manifest "all things which are expedient unto the children of men" (D&amp;amp;C 18:18).<br><br>This is of monumental significance. It is then easier to understand why President Marion G. Romney in the April conference of 1974 said, "The importance of receiving the Holy Ghost is beyond expression." But beyond expression must not mean beyond reverent thankfulness or beyond understanding. The world may not comprehend that the Holy Ghost manifests the "truth of all things" (Moroni 10:5). We know that he does.<br><br>The Lord told the Prophet Joseph Smith,<br><br><i>God shall give unto you knowledge by his Holy Spirit, yea, by the unspeakable gift of the Holy Ghost, that has not been revealed since the world was until now;</i><br><br><i>Which our forefathers have awaited with anxious expectation to be revealed in the last times, which their minds were pointed to by the angels, as held in reserve for the fullness of their glory.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 121:26–27]<br><br>The gift has been given--what we make of it is up to us. Unless we listen to counsel, we will receive none. Unless we pray, exercise faith, love, obey, and keep the tabernacles of our spirits clean--we can have no claim upon this unspeakable gift.<br><br>May we so live as to have the guidance of the Holy Spirit to help us make wise decisions at those moments in every day when we apply what we know in such a way as to be judged by what we do, I pray humbly, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>F.

<h1>nderstanding - Marion D. Hanks - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
For you who were in a meeting where I spoke last week in the stake conferences here, I will in comfort and patience quote the words of Ambrose Bierce who was defining the word<i>twice</i>as "Once too many." And I will also quote the words of Dr. Edward Hashimoto the morning after Pearl Harbor. He was a professor at the University of Utah Medical School and a delightful and marvelous human being of Japanese Ancestry. You may recall what happened at Pearl Harbor on a certain Sunday morning. On Monday morning Dr. Hashimoto faced his class in absolute silence, looked slowly around, and then said, "Don't look at me. I'm Irish."<br><br>Well, I have come as bidden, delighted to be invited and hopeful that I may be useful-- in some way an instrument in the Lord's hands this morning. I had two or three delightful hours reading scriptures last night and incidentally noting some ideas. I thought with a smile to myself this morning, not knowing exactly what I'm going to serve you, about my dear friend with a large family whose wife is a very sweet, wonderful, and perhaps over-sensitive person. She was serving her large family soup one night and had just begun to put the bowls on the table--having served the littlest people first--when the doorbell rang. She quickly snatched back the bowls already served and put them away while the visitor was ushered in. Just before the visitor departed, the littlest boy, looking with some bewilderment at what had lately been and no longer was before him, said, "<i>Daddy, have we already aten?</i>"<br><br>I feel as if I've already "aten." I've had the advantage of feasting on the most important words in the world for several hours. Lacking some specific direction, I just read, and that was really fun. I commend it to you. I thought of two other little incidents that seem relevant and not just stories to be told.<br><br>A major financial institution in Salt Lake City has just completed the refurbishment of their original small building on the corner of First South and Main Street and the modernization of the old clock that has stood out there for years, once run by water power, now of course by more modern means. A man was on a tall ladder working on that clock while people walked by him. Apparently a good many asked if he was fixing the clock. Finally he said to one who inquired: "No, I'm nearsighted."<br><br>The other story is about the boy who was having trouble with mathematics. The teacher, anxious to help him, brought some physical objects and said to him, "Now, Tom, if I have ten apples and I take five away, what's the difference?" He said, "That's how I feel about it, teacher, what's the difference?"<br><h2><b>Importance of One Day</b></h2><br>Among the wonderful ideas I was blessed to run across last night, some of which I'm going to share with you, is this page with three or four short paragraphs to which I ask you to listen with interest because it's worth it. From David Grayson, a favorite and beloved friend, whom I know through his books, I read:<br><br><i>This is a well earned Sunday morning. My chores were all done long ago, and I am sitting down here after a late and leisurely breakfast with that luxurious feeling of irresponsible restfulness and comfort which comes only upon a clean, still Sunday morning like this--after a week of hard work--a clean Sunday morning with clean clothes, and a clean chin, and clean thoughts, and the June airs stirring the clean white curtains of my windows. From across the hills I can hear very faintly the drowsy sounds of early church bells, never, indeed, to be heard here except on a morning of surpassing tranquility. And in a barnyard back of the house Harriet's hens are cackling triumphantly. They are impiously unobservant of the Sabbath Day.</i><br><br><i>I turned out my mare for a run in the pasture. She has rolled herself again and again in the warm earth and shaken herself after each roll with an equine delight more pleasant to see. Now, from time to time, I can hear her gossipy whickerings as she calls across the field to my neighbor Horace's young bay colts.</i><br><br><i>When I first woke up this morning I said to myself:</i><br><br><i>"Well, nothing happened yesterday."</i><br><br><i>Then I lay quiet for some time--it being Sunday morning--and I turned over in my mind all that I had heard or seen or felt or thought about in that one day, and presently I said aloud to myself:</i><br><br><i>"Why, nearly everything happened yesterday."</i><br><br><i>And the more I thought of it the more interesting, the more wonderful, the more explanatory of high things appeared the common doings of that June Saturday. I had walked among unusual events--and had not known the wonder of them! I had eyes, but I did not see--and ears, but I heard not. It may be, it</i>may<i>be, that the Future Life of which we have had such confusing but wistful prophecy is only the reliving with a full understanding of this marvelous life that we now know. To a full understanding this day, this moment even--here in this quiet room--would contain enough to crowd an eternity. Oh, we are children yet--playing with things much to large for us--much too full of meaning.</i>[Baker, Ray S.,<i>Adventures in Friendship</i>, by David Grayson (pseud.) (New York: Doubleday, Page &amp;amp; Co., 1910), pp. 173–75]<br><br>Last night at midnight, having done my reading and thinking and praying, I took this pad and single-spaced on it events that had happened during the day. It had been an uneventful day, a day which was supposed to be a kind of a catch-up day, a preparing day for a full week and what is to follow, a think day, a put-together day, a day for refurbishment in a sense, a day of quietness, maybe even a day at home. But when I had noted all that occurred, in the spirit of Grayson's motivating thoughts, I had a long list of exciting and important events to remember and consider.<br><br>Let me mention only one. A neighbor from across the street knocked on the door in the evening with a very apologetic look on her face and said, "My sister was using our telephone, or I would have called first, Mr. Hanks. Do you have an egg we could borrow?"<br><br>I invited her into the kitchen and showed her our vast wealth in eggs. We had a dozen and three. I said, "Will you take the dozen or the three?"<br><br>She said, "We only need one."<br><br>I said, "Well, you can't leave here with only one." So I gave her the box with the three, took her to the door, and sent her on her way, smiling and happy, to go home and tell her mother that she had three eggs. I can almost imagine the conversation. "But I sent you for one," and all the rest.<br><br>Do you know how exciting that is? These great people are here from Taiwan. Their daddy is a professor at the university. They are a wonderful family, and I had the great blessing of sending her home with three eggs. One day she will replace the eggs, and our friendship will be firmer and better.<br><br>I met Bob Cundick on his way out of the temple. He has his index finger broken and in a cast. You students know who Dr. Cundick is? He plays the tabernacle organ. I said to him, "How could anybody be so dumb as to break his first finger when he is an organist?" We laughed, he told me about it, and I went on my way.<br><br>Well, out of all of this, what happened in that uneventful day when nothing happened--when, in fact, everything happened? I've been thinking about the<i>fuller understanding</i>that will come and that may amount, as David Grayson said, to what heaven really is. Out of it came a couple of ideas I'd like to share. What is this fuller understanding? What are the principles which will become far more significant in that "Future Life" of which Grayson spoke? I believe that there are three fundamental elements in life that need to be thought about.<br><h2><b>1. Foundational Principles of God's Plan</b></h2><br>One is the foundational principles, that body of truth which constitutes the reality, the revelation, of that which is real and true, has been, is, and ever will be; the truth about God and about Christ and about man and about life and eternity; the truth about those fundamentals that constitute God's plan. Are these things important to know? The answer in the scripture is that they mean life eternal, to know God and his holy Son. They not only mean life eternal; they mean life worthwhile, life harmonious, life constructive, life sweet, life beautiful, life contributing, life lovely, life progressive. Yes, these things are the beginning, and I won't try to rehearse for you the meaning of all of them, but let's note some examples.<br><br>Rufus Jones, the great Quaker teacher and mystic, with whom I fell in love when I first read the first thing I found that he had written, said about the Almighty and why it's important to know him:<br><br><i>Vital religion cannot be maintained and preserved on the theory that God dealt with our human race only in the far past ages and that the Bible is the only evidence we have that our God is a living, revealing, communicating God. If God ever spoke, He is still speaking. He is the great I am, not the great he was.</i>["A Flash of Eternity," newspaper article]<br><br>Last week from a wonderful Methodist friend, who serves in Scouting and whom I came to admire and love greatly in that worthy endeavor, there came a note sharing some good things that have happened to him. One of them was that he had met a young man who had been one of his Scouts. The man obviously was in some distress, and Brother Dyke, as he spoke with him, discovered that he had lost his wife in a tragic way. He had little children, and this loss had almost destroyed him. They had stayed with his mother during the last stages of the terrible illness, but then had to go home to their little apartment--and how he dreaded that. They ate TV dinners and watched television until too late. The little girl fell asleep, and he carried her to bed. When he returned, his son said, "Daddy, tonight, just tonight, could I sleep with you?" The two of them went into the bedroom and lay there in the dark, neither sleeping.<br><br>In the darkness, Bill said, his son spoke, "Daddy, are you looking at me?"<br><br>He said, "Yes, son, I'm looking at you."<br><br>The little boy said, "Okay." He snuggled his little body tight into the small of his daddy's back and went to sleep.<br><br>Bill said, "Mr. Dyke, I don't believe I've ever felt so alone. I looked out the window, and I said out loud, 'God, O God, if you're looking at me, and you know my need, I can make it.'"<br><br>There is more in this wonderful letter from a dear friend, who is one example of many that reinforce my certain conviction that deep in the hearts of good men there is a simple and beautiful comprehension of a real, revealing, communicating, living Father. Of Christ we say the same: our Savior, our Lord, our Master, our<i>living</i>Head.<br><br>I love maybe as much as anything I've learned in years what Karl Barth, the great theologian, is said to have replied when he was asked--he who had filled a library with his own books and was a magnificent mind and human being--if he could summarize what he had learned. This is how he answered, "Jesus loves me, this I know, for the Bible tells me so." That is what Karl Barth said he had learned in a lifetime, the most important thing he had learned in a lifetime: "Jesus loves me, this I know, for the Bible tells me so."<br><h2><b>2. What Man Is</b></h2><br>The second element is man. Oh, what an exciting, wonderful thing to contemplate what man is! I've always loved the marvelous Jewish comedian, teacher, and human being whose name was Sam Levenson. Maybe you know him. I hope you do. He talked once about going to a psychiatrist and paying a whole lot of money. Then, finally, he thought it over and said to himself, "What am I doing here? What is this fellow doing for me? What is he helping me with for fifty or one hundred dollars an hour? Really all he is doing is asking me the same question my father asked me all my life, 'Who do you think you are, anyway?'<br><br>Who do we think we are? Let me tell you in a word what Socrates said, "Self-knowledge is the kind of knowledge required for one to become an ethical being. The ignorance which causes vice and immorality is not ignorance of moral principles or laws, but an ignorance of one's own self" (quoted by Earl Nightingale, Program 4366). Kierkegaard said, "There is nothing of which every man is so afraid as of getting to know how enormously much he is capable of doing and becoming." They are saying what we surely know, that we are children of God. A man commenting on this concluded a brief radio address this way. I beg you to listen: "When you drive by those porno stalls and see those people lined up for the sick movies and so on, remember the words of Socrates, 'The ignorance which causes vice and immorality is not ignorance of moral principles or laws, but an ignorance of one's own self.'"<br><br>There are things that children of God just should not do, that they should not accept, that they should never contribute to. The<i>they</i>is the<i>we</i>, we who are, among other things, divine by origin and potential. We are also neighbors and family members with everybody else. We are also unique persons with a responsibility to find and develop those talents that are special, those gifts that are uniquely ours.<br><br>Life is purposeful, a schoolground, not a playground. In the eternities there is a better world where there is no more sorrow and there are no more tears. The plan is a more excellent way. I wish we could talk about that. They are the fundamental things, I believe, which we need to have--foundational to what else? What else is there? There are two groups of people who aren't very happy here and cannot be and won't be hereafter: "Such as have and do not spend, and such as know and do not act." It is not enough to know. The prophet taught us, "Now, if ye believe all these things, see that ye do them" (Mosiah 4:10). In the words of Jesus are the instructions we need. We are also taught out of a source to which Brother Holland referred, "If to do were as easy as to know what were good to do [or to be done], chapels had been churches, and poor men's cottages princes' palaces" (W. Shakespeare,<i>The Merchant of Venice,</i>act 1, scene 2, line 13). The great poet is telling us that it is easier to know than to do.<br><br>I read aboard an airplane on my last trip to the Orient a few weeks ago something I've thought a lot about since: Jack Curtice, the former football coach at the University of Utah, died in California. He had gone to Stanford from Utah and then to a smaller school. Jack Curtice was a good coach. What touched me and made me shed a tear on that airplane--because I knew him too--was the enterprising and inspiring response of his athletes fifteen or twenty years later to this coach. They remembered whether they won or lost, I guess, but nobody mentioned it. They talked about the fairness, the humor, the humanity, the decency, the integrity, the honesty and honor of Jack Curtice. They talked about the way he treated them, and they shed tears--men of prominence and accomplishment, men in the army and business and the legal field and elsewhere--all responding when their old coach died. I marveled at these sincere and merited tributes.<br><br>In that same newspaper I read the account of "Mercury" Morris. Does the name mean anything to this generation? He was all-pro for many years for the Miami Dolphins and then San Diego. "Mercury" Morris, the great runner, a college graduate, bright enough to do a lot of worthwhile things. He had been arrested with $250,000 of cocaine on his table and $124,000 in cash. He was charged with and was last week convicted of a series of crimes that will, or could, put him in prison for many years. He will go to prison for at least fifteen years, with no possibility of parole. It said he left the courtroom weeping, with a white Bible in his hand.<br><br>Jack Curtice and "Mercury" Morris. Well, there is nothing, nothing more true than that we are God's children and have been given a chance to have a vision of what it is he wants. I love this thirtieth chapter of Deuteronomy, where we are taught by the great prophet that it isn't all that hard. Listen to what he says:<br><br><i>For this commandment which I command thee this day, it is not hidden from thee, neither is it far off.</i><br><br><i>It is not in heaven, that thou shouldest say, Who shall go up for us to heaven, and bring it unto us, that we may hear it, and do it?</i><br><br><i>Neither is it beyond the sea, that thou shouldst say, Who shall go over the sea for us, and bring it unto us, that we may hear it, and do it?</i><br><br><i>But the word is very nigh unto thee, in thy mouth, and in thy heart, that thou mayest do it.</i>[Deuteronomy 30:11–14]<br><br>Then he teaches the central principle of all of that:<br><br><i>See, I have set before thee this day life and good, and death and evil;</i><br><br><i>... blessing and cursing: therefore choose life, that both thou and thy seed may live:</i><br><br><i>That thou mayest love the Lord thy God, and that thou mayest obey his voice, and that thou mayest cleave unto him: for he is thy life, and the length of thy days.</i>[Deuteronomy 30:15, 19–20]<br><br>Oh, there are so many marvelous things in the scriptures. We are children of God, and we are brothers and sisters, and we are neighbors. We have the blessing and inescapable responsibility of deciding what we are going to do about that.<br><h2><b>3. Testimony</b></h2><br>Then there is a third and final thing about which I would like to speak a moment. We need to know these foundational truths, and I'm sure you can't just intuit them, although they are born within us, and the process is more peeling away than it is planting, I believe. We need to need to learn those truths through asking, seeking, knocking, through study, through effort. Missionaries come back and want to know why it is different and why they don't have the same feeling when they want the same feeling. The answer is obvious: the Lord has given it, feast upon the words of Christ and those other marvelous instructions in chapter 31 of 2 Nephi; pray and serve and stay close and keep your mind away from the dirt and the filth.<br><br>When we know and act, I believe the third fundamental is to have this blessing called testimony, or the witness that the Spirit brings. I thought and thought and had a hundred examples and am going to use the simple one of the bishop in Taiwan. Some of you will have been there and may know the bishop in Taipei. He had to leave the mainland of China with the defeated armies thirty years or so ago. He has been there thirty years, totally out of communication with his wonderful wife and his children, unable to write, unable to let her know or her him of present things. He joined the Church a few years ago. He has been a marvelous, strong, unselfish bishop for a number of years. I keep thinking about him. What gives a man enough hope, enough faith, enough endurance, to put up with that when most of us scarce stand a day or a week or a month away from those we love the best? There is something that strengthens us, that testifies this is true and that motivates us to move in this way.<br><h2><b>Conclusion</b></h2><br>As I conclude, I want to share with you two other examples of a combination of these three. One is a letter that came in Hong Kong from a family that I had never met:<br><br><i>Dear Elder Hanks,</i><br><br><i>In an effort to make our family Christmas more meaningful we decided together to economize and use the savings to feed the hungry children in Cambodia. Examples of what our children have done to earn money are to address envelopes for my work, sell stationery, work around the yard and house. The kids earned a penny a page for reading; they used the money they were going to spend buying presents for each other and put it into this account. They have given up a trip and goodies. We bought a smaller size Christmas tree that would sit up on top of the table rather than a full-size tree and are giving the difference. In all, the enclosed check represents on behalf of our family money that we would have spent on Christmas but did not. We know that you will put it to good use. We are grateful for our many blessings, sorry that there are so many who suffer so much. Please let us know what else we can do. Have a Merry Christmas.</i><br><br>And I did have and I know that they did have.<br><br>Let me leave ringing in your ears, I hope, what a refugee said to one of the beautiful ladies who is now a teacher at this university and was an outstanding person as others are here. I wish I could name them all, but that would be impossible and perhaps inappropriate. They put on a Christmas program for the refugees. I'm not going to try to pull your heartstrings and tell you what it is like in a refugee camp. There is no possible way. These people, devoid of everything, everything that we think of as important, with terrible memories, imposed upon viciously, incredibly, unbelievably by others, now gathered inside a fence or a wall hoping that sometime, someplace there will be a home for them beyond these six feet on a pallet which is home now. They had Christmas the way we celebrate it with one of our beautiful girls representing the Madonna, holding a little brown baby. They told the story, our great young ladies did, in song, in scripture, and explanation, and when it was all over, some came to talk about it, and one said with tears and wonder in her face and voice, "Why, the story of Jesus is a refugee story."<br><br>Fill that in. Please let your imagination run. Then she said, "I'm sure they didn't know who he was, or they would have given him their bed in the inn."<br><br>We know who he was. God bless us to be what we ought to be and thus through that Spirit learn what we need to know and grow so that we may never be among such as have and do not spend, or such as know and do not act. In the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Marion D.

<h1>e to God - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
My dear brothers and sisters. I am very grateful for the privilege accorded me to address you on the eve of the important Thanksgiving recognition we give to this Thursday's holiday. I am confident that I am the most blessed of you all, as I have been privileged to be a member of the administrative staff of BYU for the past thirty years. It has brought important and special responsibilities to me and my family. In carrying them through, we have been blessed in many ways. To be closely associated with President Ernest L. Wilkinson, President Dallin Oaks, and now President Jeffrey R. Holland has enriched our lives. I have watched these great men work to build this university to a pinnacle of size, quality, and strength that makes possible your presence on this campus this very day. I salute them and express a deep gratitude for their excellent achievements.<br><h2><b>Gratitude a Way of Life</b></h2><br>I wish to share with you an awareness that thanksgiving should be in our hearts and expressed in our actions every day of the year, not just on 25 November 1982.<br><br>Stanley Dixon penned these most thoughtful words that were set to beautiful music like that we are hearing this hour:<br><br><i>Thanks be to God for roses rare,</i><br><i>For skies of blue and sunshine fair.</i><br><i>For every gift I raise a prayer,</i><br><i>Thanks be to God.</i><br><br><i>Thanks be to God for lovely night,</i><br><i>For mystic fields with stars bedight,</i><br><i>For hours of dream and deep delight,</i><br><i>Thanks be to God.</i><br><br><i>Thanks be to God for love divine,</i><br><i>The hopes that 'round my heart entwine,</i><br><i>For all the joy that now is mine,</i><br><i>Thanks be to God.</i><br>[Stanley Dixon (New York: Associated Music Publishers)]<br><br>President N. Eldon Tanner has said, "Thanksgiving Day gives each and every one of us an invitation and a wonderful opportunity to pause and count our many blessings and to give thanks to God and praise him from whom all blessings flow" ("Thanksgiving 1968,"<i>Church News,</i>23 November 1968, p. 9).<br><br>President Marion G. Romney, in his address in the past general conference, made us deeply aware of the principle of gratitude and thanksgiving, and I quote:<br><br><i>The virtues of gratitude have been widely extolled and the sinfulness of ingratitude has been just as widely condemned.</i><br><br>He continued:<br><br><i>It has been said that "an ungrateful man is like a hog under a tree eating acorns, but never looking up to see where they come from" (Timothy Dexter,</i>The New Dictionary of Thoughts<i>[Garden City, NY: Standard Book, 1961], p. 308).</i><br><br><i>Jesus revealed his feeling about ingratitude when only one of ten lepers whom he had healed turned back and gave thanks.</i>["Gratitude and Thanksgiving," <i>Ensign,</i>November 1982, p. 49]<br><br>We can read this account in Luke 17:11–18.<br><br>Elder Bruce R. McConkie has said: "True worship includes<i>thanksgiving</i>to God--the acknowledging and confessing with joy and gladness of the benefits and mercies which he bestows upon his children" (<i>MD,</i>p. 788).<br><br>I submit that the thanksgiving we should acknowledge should be an everyday occurrence directed to him who created us all.<br><br>It seems appropriate to share with you the statement the First Presidency gave to the Church this past Saturday in the<i>Church News:</i><br><br><i>As the season of Thanksgiving approaches, it brings with it the reminder that this cherished holiday had its birth in religious faith and still finds its best expression in prayers of gratitude and repentance. For this Thanksgiving and the joyful Christmas season to follow, our counsel to all men and women everywhere is, remember the scripture injunction, "Thou shalt thank the Lord thy God in all things." (D&amp;amp;C 59:7.)</i><br><br><i>Ingratitude is one of the woeful failings of our society. The failure to acknowledge the sovereignty and the beneficence of God, the refusal to bend our will to His, are at the very root of the major problems in our society.</i><br><br><i>Prayer, family prayer in the homes of people in all lands, is one of the simple medicines that would check the dread disease that robs men and women of honesty, character and integrity. In generations past, individual and family prayers, in the homes of people throughout the world were as much a part of the day's activity as was eating. As the practice of prayer has diminished, moral decay has increased.</i><br><br><i>The inclination to be holy, to be thankful, is increased as family members kneel together and thank the Lord for life and peace and all that they may become under His guidance. In remembering together before the Lord the poor, the needy, the oppressed, there is developed, unconsciously but realistically, a love for others above self, a respect for others, a desire to serve the needs of others. One cannot ask God to help a neighbor in distress without being motivated to do something toward helping that neighbor.</i><br><br><i>What miracles would be evident if, beginning now, beginning this Thanksgiving season, we all would lay aside our own selfishness and lose ourselves in the service of others. Our prayers of Thanksgiving, this season and daily all through the year, will bring comfort to our hearts, knit us together in love, and open to us the treasures of wisdom, knowledge, gratitude and forgiveness.</i>["Express thanks in prayers and service, say Church leaders," <i>Church News,</i>20 November 1982, p. 3]<br><h2><b>Expression of Gratitude Important</b></h2><br>In positive reflection I turn to doctrinal references which place special responsibilities on us all to express our gratitude to our Creator. "Thou shalt thank the Lord thy God in all things." This important commandment, found in section 59, verse 7, of the Doctrine and Covenants, is as binding upon us as any other law of God. We are commanded to do "all things with prayer and thanksgiving," and "Ye must give thanks unto God in the Spirit for whatsoever blessing ye are blessed with" (D&amp;amp;C 46:7, 32).<br><br>Now, Thanksgiving Day 1982 is soon upon us. What will we do with it? This year will it merely be a day of feasting, watching TV, or seeking pleasure?<br><br>When the day was first instituted, it was regarded as a religious observance completely in line with the commandments I just stated. The Pilgrims, it will be remembered, were grateful for their very lives; and whom did they thank? Almighty God. They knew the source of their blessings. They knew they had been preserved by a divine hand. Most of you in this assembly have been blessed with pioneer ancestors who would testify that they were preserved to arrive in these valleys because of divine intervention in their behalf.<br><br>So now, what about ourselves? Are we willing to recognize that our daily blessings are provided by other efforts than our own? The arrogance of much of mankind today merely states, "I've done it myself."<br><br>I submit that our blessings flow from many, many others and through divine approbation. As an example, one of the most important things on earth, essential to our welfare, is plain, ordinary water. Did we make it? Did we pipe it into our homes? Did we make the pipe? Did we sterilize it so that it would be bacteria free? And, who provided the streams from which water comes? Who caused the rains to fall, the earth to be fertile? Who first gave us seeds to plant? Who placed cows and sheep and birds and trees on the earth?<br><br>Are we not dependent upon him and his creations? No one can measure the gratitude we owe to the Almighty as the Great Provider. No one can measure the appreciation we owe to our fellowmen, those who plant and harvest, and those who provide services on every hand. In this complex world there is a network of interdependency among us all. So many others are involved in providing for us the things which we ourselves could not provide, it is folly to ignore them. We ride in cars and planes, but did we make them? We use oil and gasoline, but from where did they come? We eat bread and drink milk for our health, but did we produce them?<br><br>When Paul wrote to Timothy about the latter days, he gave as one of the signs of the times the fact that people would become "unthankful, unholy" (2 Timothy 3:2). This is an interesting combination of words--that one with ungrateful attitudes can be unholy, their roots being in the same evil source. Ingratitude, of course, is unholy from every standpoint. It is evil in itself. Let's turn to appreciation, gratitude, and thanks.<br><br>So, on this special Thanksgiving 1982, what will be your list of "gratitudes"?<br><h2><b>Three Reasons for Gratitude</b></h2><br>I desire to share just<i>three</i>of my own. Hundreds of blessings are found in each of these three for which I daily thank my Father in Heaven:<br><br>1.<i>My citizenship</i>in this great United States of America.<br><br>2.<i>My membership</i>in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.<br><br>3.<i>My wife</i>and family.<br><br>Now, just a brief reference to each:<br><br>1.<i>I love my country.</i>It has been good to me. I have been pleased to serve in the U.S. Navy Reserve for thirty-four years. While I was a guest in the home of Admiral Emmet L. Tidd, in Washington, D.C., not too long ago, he shared this experience. He had just returned to Washington, D.C., following an extended trip to several major powers in the world to assess their strengths for the Chief of Naval Operations. He observed on his return that our country, with all its political, social, and economic problems, is still so<i>far ahead</i>of whichever country might be second, he would have no second thoughts about his love for America and his faith in this great country and where he would want to reside. I feel the same way. Some outsider has said, "Your country may not be a rose garden, but it also is not a patch of weeds." I am blessed every day because of being a citizen in this land. Having just returned from the Mideast on university business, I can't figure out why I was so blessed as to be assigned to be raised up and to live in this special land rather than where I have just visited, or in some other part of the world.<br><br>I am grateful for a student body expression twice each day that permits students to stand in reverence and thought each morning as the<i>Star Spangled Banner</i>is played, and the flag is raised, and then again lowered the same way in the late afternoon. Visitors to our campus stand in awe as this is done. Some say it is old-fashioned. If so, I will take the old-fashioned way.<br><br>Where do you stand on the appreciation of this land of liberty? President David O. McKay once stated: "We are grateful for this land of America, 'choice above all other lands.' The freedom vouchsafed by the Constitution of the United States, which guarantees to every man the right to worship . . . in accordance with the dictates of his own conscience, made possible the establishment of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints" ("Thanksgiving 1968," <i>Church News</i>, 23 November 1968, p. 9). I am thankful for this event.<br><br>2.<i>I value and treasure my membership in the Church:</i>I was privileged to be born in New Zealand while my parents were serving together on their first mission. How blessed I've been to have parents so wonderful that they have given me a royal heritage of membership in the Church. They themselves have been living examples for us to follow. They are here today. I wish them to know how much I love and appreciate them. How fortunate for me to fill a mission and thereby fortify my testimony of the Church and all it means in our lives. I will be eternally grateful for the training and leadership opportunities I have experienced through my Church assignments. What a blessing to you and to me to recognize our church's commitment to education. We are the recipients of the privilege of this great campus. Let's not fall short of measuring up to expectations of our respected Church and university leaders.<br><br>Yes, we are blessed through our membership in the Church. If we are faithful, these blessings have eternal application. Let's not forget that. Is your Church membership worthy of a special thanksgiving expression?<br><br>3.<i>I love my wife, Nonie, and my family very much.</i>I've been blessed with a beautiful eternal companion, together completing forty-two years last week. Busy with Church and school life these forty-two years, she jokes about having to marry me to get rid of me; but we have a relationship I would wish for all of you young marriage prospects. It isn't easy living with a fellow like me, but we are planning on many, many more years together. Nonie is as beautiful inside as you see her on the outside. So, with three wonderful children, eleven grandchildren, and a few adopted ones, life is very sweet and worthwhile.<br><br>How does one best express thanks for all of this? I must thank a very compassionate Father in Heaven. Do you have a special reason this holiday season to feel as I do about my family?<br><h2><b>Conclusion</b></h2><br>Now, I recognize that my Thanksgiving expressions for country, church, and family blessings must be directed to my Father in Heaven. You have heard three of my gratitudes. What will be the gratitudes you may express to your Father in Heaven this Thanksgiving season?<br><br>Some years ago I read a simple Thanksgiving prayer:<br><br><i>O, heavenly Father:</i><br><i>We thank Thee for food and remember the hungry.</i><br><i>We thank Thee for health and remember the sick.</i><br><i>We thank Thee for friends and remember the friendless.</i><br><i>We thank Thee for freedom and remember the enslaved.</i><br><i>May these remembrances stir us to service</i><br><i>That Thy gifts may be used for others.</i>[Abigail Van Buren, "Dear Abby," <i>Deseret News,</i>25 November 1976, p. 4C]<br><br>Said in another way by Wilfred A. Peterson:<br><br><i>The art of thanksgiving is</i>thanks living.<i> It is gratitude in action. It is applying Albert Schweitzer's philosophy: "In gratitude for your own good fortune you must render in return some sacrifice of your life or other life."</i><br><br><i>It is thanking God for each new day by living it to the fullest.</i>["The Art of Thanksgiving," <i>The Art of Living</i>(New York: Simon and Schuster, 1961), pp. 44–45]<br><br>My prayer for each of us is that during this Thanksgiving season we can all count our blessings in a way that truthfully says, "Thanks be to God," in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Fred A. Schwendiman was the Support Services vice-president of BYU when this devotional address was given on 23 November 1982.</i><br><br><i>© Brigham Young University.
