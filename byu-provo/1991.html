<h1>s of Standard-Bearers of the Lord - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Sister Nelson and I are happy to be with you. I convey love and best wishes for a happy New Year from the First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve. We express our gratitude to Presidents Rex E. Lee and Kerry Romesburg, their companions, and members of their faculty and staff from both Brigham Young University and Utah Valley Community College for their marvelous service. And we express appreciation to our Regional Representative, stake presidents, and their partners here tonight.<br><br>We are especially delighted to be with you students. You recognize, as we do, that you are a fortunate few. Many more throughout the world would give anything to be where you are. Many have been called to military duty elsewhere in the world. They would gladly trade places with you. Surely our prayers are for peace and for each individual on assignment away from family and loved ones at this time.<br><br>We have so much for which we can be thankful. This is the first Sunday of a new year. Nineteen-ninety has been most historic. In what was known a few months ago as the German Democratic Republic, missionaries are now reaping a rich harvest in a unified Federal Republic of Germany. Many new missions were created, including those in Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, and Greece. And in lesser numbers, wonderful servants of the Lord labor as his representatives in Yugoslavia, Romania, Bulgaria, Estonia, and Russia. None of this was so when I was here a year ago. The year 1991 promises to be equally exciting in this rapidly growing church (see D&amp;amp;C 65:2). Each of us, if properly prepared, can play an important part in fulfilling its divine destiny.<br><br>I hope my message tonight will help us and the Church to realize our remarkable individual and institutional potential. The title chosen for my message is "Standards of Standard-Bearers of the Lord." You will note there are three parts to the title. I would like to discuss the last mentioned first, because the Lord is the chief cornerstone on which this Church is based. Next, I should like to discuss his standard-bearers. Finally, I should like to discuss his standards.<br><h2><b>The Lord and His Atonement</b></h2><br>Let us first contemplate the Lord Jesus Christ and his atonement. In a very real way, it affects each of our lives and the lives of every human being who ever lived. Understanding the significance of his atonement is fundamental to choices we make in all facets of our lives. The atonement of the Lord is central to our faith (see<i>Teachings,</i>p. 121).<br><br>We are scripturally bound to study it and to teach it. From the book of Moses, may I quote these words of God:<br><br><i>I give unto you a commandment, to teach these things freely unto your children, saying:</i><br><br><i>That by reason of transgression cometh the fall, which fall bringeth death, and inasmuch as ye were born into the world by water, and blood, and the spirit, which I have made, and so became of dust a living soul, even so ye must be born again into the kingdom of heaven, of water, and of the Spirit, and be cleansed by blood, even the</i>[atoning]<i>blood of mine Only Begotten; that ye might be sanctified from all sin, and enjoy the words of eternal life in this world, and eternal life in the world to come, even immortal glory;</i><br><br><i>For by the water ye keep the commandment; by the Spirit ye are justified, and by the blood ye are sanctified;</i><br><br><i>Therefore it is given to abide in you.</i>[Moses 6:58–61]<br><br>But before one can comprehend the<i>atonement</i>of Christ, one must first understand the<i>fall</i>of Adam. And before one can comprehend the fall of Adam, one must first understand the<i>Creation.</i>These three pillars of eternity relate to one another.<br><br>In the beginning God created the earth and all that was upon it. He created man in his own image, male and female created he them (see Genesis 1:27; 5:2; D&amp;amp;C 20:18; Moses 2:27; 6:9). Adam and Eve were first created with bodies of flesh and spirit, without blood, and were unable to die or beget children. Thus we might describe this as a<i>paradisiacal creation,</i>one that initially equipped Adam and Eve to live in the Garden of Eden, which was in a state of everlasting paradise (see Moses 4:28).<br><br>Adam and Eve's subsequent fall effected a change upon their bodies. Although I don't understand completely the chemistry of that change, somehow it permitted blood to circulate in their veins. It provided for processes of aging and death to come upon their tabernacles of flesh. And in a marvelous manner, it allowed the blessing of procreation, so that myriads of awaiting spirits could be born and thus obtain mortal bodies. The fall was a necessary part of Heavenly Father's plan for his children. Indeed, "Adam fell that men might be; and men are, that they might have joy" (2 Nephi 2:25). The so-called fall of Adam might thus be termed the<i>mortal creation.</i>It allowed mankind to attain and endure the mortal experience, to enjoy posterity, and then to leave this period of probation through the portal of death.<br><br>Adam and Eve's fall, however, and subsequent sins of their posterity, cut mankind off from the presence of God. An atonement, or reconciliation, had to be made. And only God could make it. Even before the Creation was completed, the premortal Jehovah understood the need for an atonement. Even before breath was put into the man Adam, the Christ knew that a Savior would be required. He understood his responsible role. He was to be born into mortality to suffer, to bleed, and to die.<br><br>Why?<br><br>That each of us might ultimately be<i>at one</i>(atoned) with God after our mortal experience, that we might be able to live with him once again, as we did as spirit beings before our birth. His atonement would allow our resurrection from the dead. Then our bodies would be changed to those of flesh and spirit and be able to dwell in the presence of God. The effects of the atonement might thus be expressed as the<i>immortal creation,</i>for "as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive" (1 Corinthians 15:22).<br><br>No serious student of the life of Christ can fail to be deeply moved by the Lord's own personal testimonies of his atoning experience. Even though he knew what was required, the record states that he felt "sore amazed, and to be very heavy" (Mark 14:33; see also verses 35–36).<br><br>His high commission he completed at Gethsemane and on Calvary's cross. There he gave this last testimony: "It is finished" (John 19:30). The plan was consummated. He had fulfilled his earlier prophecy: "To this end was I born, and for this cause came I into the world" (John 18:37).<br><br>It is not surprising that the Lord Jesus personally testified of this atoning experience in these latter days when the gospel was restored. He spoke these words and caused them to be recorded for<i>all of us</i>to comprehend:<br><br><i>Wherefore, I command you to repent, and keep the commandments which you have received by the hand of my servant Joseph Smith, Jun., in my name;</i><br><br><i>And it is by my almighty power that you have received them;</i><br><br><i>Therefore I command you to repent--repent, lest I smite you by the rod of my mouth, and by my wrath, and by my anger, and your sufferings be sore--how sore you know not, how exquisite you know not, yea, how hard to bear you know not.</i><br><br><i>For behold, I, God, have suffered these things for all, that they might not suffer if they would repent;</i><br><br><i>But if they would not repent they must suffer even as I;</i><br><br><i>Which suffering caused myself, even God, the greatest of all, to tremble because of pain, and to bleed at every pore, and to suffer both body and spirit--and would that I might not drink the bitter cup, and shrink--</i><br><br><i>Nevertheless, glory be to the Father, and I partook and finished my preparations unto the children of men.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 19:13–19]<br><br>It seems almost beyond comprehension to think that he paid this enormous price for me and for each of you. And yet, as far as we are concerned individually, unless you and I do our part, his atonement will have been in vain. It is that covenant relationship--that mutual trust--that makes his atonement such a personal gift. It brings us protection, perennial hope, and the promise of joy.<br><h2><b>Standard-Bearers</b></h2><br>Standard-bearers march at the vanguard of a worthy cause. They represent that which is good and noble. They often carry flags or other symbols to express identity, purpose, and unity.<br><br>Speaking of such standard-bearers, I was told a tender account during the holiday season just past. While children reenacted the Christmas story, one child held high a star wrapped in aluminum foil, mounted on a broomstick. Later, someone commended the child for his stamina in holding that star so high for such a long period of time. The child, who had spoken no lines, joyfully replied, "I had the most important part in the play. I showed people how to find Jesus."<br><br>As his standard-bearers, we are to help the honest in heart to find Jesus. We don't wave flags. And generally we don't carry stars mounted on broomsticks. Instead, as standard-bearers for Jesus the Christ, we willingly and gratefully take his sacred name upon us. We enlist in his cause by covenant.<br><br>Each standard-bearer has accepted this scriptural charge:<br><br><i>If ye shall follow the Son, with full purpose of heart, acting no hypocrisy and no deception before God, but with real intent, repenting of your sins, witnessing unto the Father that ye are willing to take upon you the name of Christ, . . . by following your Lord and your Savior down into the water</i>[of baptism],<i>. . . then shall ye receive the Holy Ghost; . . . then can ye speak with the tongue of angels.</i>[2 Nephi 31:13]<br><br>So, standard-bearers first qualify by entering the covenant of baptism. They are thereby blessed with the gift of the Holy Ghost. Then they can speak effectively in leading others to the Lord (see D&amp;amp;C 11:21).<br><br>Standard-bearers of the Lord regularly renew their qualifying covenant of baptism. When the sacrament is administered, words of recommittal are offered in prayer to God in behalf of all who "are willing to take upon them the name of [his] Son, and always remember him, and keep his commandments which he hath given them, that they may always have his Spirit to be with them" (Moroni 4:3; see D&amp;amp;C 20:37, 77).<br><br>Standard-bearers of the Lord are the hope of Israel in Zion's army. They are chosen children of the promised day. They are helping to hasten his work in his time, just as he has decreed (see D&amp;amp;C 88:73).<br><br>Meanwhile, the elect of the Lord are responding to personal promptings to seek and surely find him. Perhaps an example will serve to illustrate. A little more than a year ago, a "velvet revolution" occurred in the country of Czechoslovakia, in which a restrictive regime of forty years was overturned. Political prisoners were released from jail. One of them later became the current president of that country. Last summer a twenty-one-year-old medical student in Plzen, named Ale(breve)s, determined to use his new freedom and his vacation period to earn some money and to find God. In June 1990 he came to New York City. There he was offered a job driving an automobile for a rental agency. The agency needed a car to be driven to Salt Lake City.<br><br>Through an interpreter, he said, "I don't want to go to Salt Lake City."<br><br>They replied, "Do you want the job?"<br><br>He said, "Yes, I want the job."<br><br>"Then you<i>will</i>drive to Salt Lake City," they demanded.<br><br>So this he did. While there he went to Temple Square, where he first met standard-bearers of the Lord. He heard their message of the restored gospel. He studied intensively with missionaries in Salt Lake City and then at the Missionary Training Center here in Provo. In the process, this very bright young man also learned the English language. In August he was baptized, following which he was brought in to meet President Monson and me. It was then we learned that one of the two missionaries who had taught him the gospel in Utah was Elder Tobias Burkhardt, son of the president and matron of the Freiberg Temple in the former German Democratic Republic. Ale(breve)s has now returned to Plzen to resume his medical studies. He found his faith and now bears the holy priesthood. He also learned a new language and is in a position to make great contributions to the work as a standard-bearer for the Lord in Czechoslovakia and elsewhere.<br><h2><b>Standards</b></h2><br>Standards of the Lord may be tangible or intangible. In Old Testament days, the children of Israel were told to "pitch their tents, every man by his own camp, and every man by his own standard" (Numbers 1:52).<br><br>More frequently cited, both in ancient and in modern scripture, are spiritual standards.<br><br>One week after Solomon had dedicated the first house of the Lord built on Mount Moriah, the Master personally came to that temple and accepted it as his holy house. Then and there he taught the importance of abiding by his standards of personal righteousness. He said:<br><br><i>If thou wilt walk before me, . . . and do according to all that I have commanded thee, and shalt observe my statutes and my judgments;</i><br><br><i>Then will I</i>[establish]<i>the throne of thy kingdom.</i>[2 Chronicles 7:17–18]<br><br>By way of reinforcement, the Master Teacher then added this warning:<br><br><i>But if ye turn away, and forsake my statutes and my commandments, which I have set before you, . . .</i><br><br><i>Then will I pluck them up by the roots out of my land which I have given them; and this house, which I have sanctified for my name, will I cast out of my sight.</i>[2 Chronicles 7:19–20]<br><br>But the ability of the people to hear and obey was stunted by their lack of conviction. Jeremiah recorded this stern reprimand of the Lord:<br><br><i>How long shall I see the standard, and hear the sound of the trumpet?</i><br><br><i>For my people is foolish, they have not known me; they are sottish children, and they have none understanding: they are wise to do evil, but to do good they have no knowledge.</i>[Jeremiah 4:21–22]<br><br>Protective standards of righteousness were similarly stressed in New Testament times. Paul recorded this charge:<br><br><i>Stand therefore, having your loins girt about with truth, and having on the breastplate of righteousness;</i><br><br><i>And your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace;</i><br><br><i>Above all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked.</i><br><br><i>And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God.</i>[Ephesians 6:14–17; see D&amp;amp;C 27:15–18]<br><br>Book of Mormon prophets likewise emphasized the importance of correct standards. One so wrote:<br><br><i>I have spoken plainly unto you, that ye cannot misunderstand. And the words which I have spoken shall stand as a testimony against you; for they are sufficient to teach any man the right way; for the right way is to believe in Christ and deny him not; for by denying him ye also deny the prophets and the law.</i><br><br><i>And now behold, I say unto you that the right way is to believe in Christ, and deny him not; and Christ is the Holy One of Israel.</i>[2 Nephi 25:28–29]<br><br>This loving Lord again came to the earth in the latter days to teach standards of light and truth to children of this generation. Our Redeemer said:<br><br><i>I have sent mine everlasting covenant into the world, to be a light to the world, and to be a standard for my people, . . . to be a messenger before my face to prepare the way before me.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 45:9]<br><br>The Church and its membership are standards for the world. The Lord said:<br><br><i>For thus shall my church be called in the last days, even The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.</i><br><br><i>Verily I say unto you all: Arise and shine forth, that thy light may be a standard for the nations.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 115:4–5]<br><h2><b>For the Strength of Youth</b></h2><br>With this background in mind, let us study the fundamental standards expected of us as standard-bearers of the Lord today. At general conference time last fall, announcements were made of the publication of a booklet entitled<i>For the Strength of Youth.</i>If your copy is handy, you may wish to refer to it as I continue. Within its pages are summary statements of certain vital standards. These statements were prepared by the Lord's anointed, mindful of this scripture in the Doctrine and Covenants:<br><br><i>It is an imperative duty that we owe to all the rising generation, and to all the pure in heart--</i><br><br><i>For there are many yet on the earth . . . who are only kept from the truth because they know not where to find it.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 123:11–12; see also Jeremiah 50:2; 1 Nephi 21:22]<br><br>The scriptural statement then continues:<br><br><i>These</i>[standards]<i>should then be attended to with great earnestness.</i><br><br><i>Let no</i>[one]<i>count them as small things; for there is much which lieth in futurity, pertaining to the saints, which depends upon these things.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 123:14–15]<br><br>The booklet reviews, in an abbreviated way, specific standards. Although much is included, much more could have been and is not. Sufficient detail is included to allow each of you to know what the Lord expects of you. In addition, you may studiously and prayerfully consult with parents, teachers, and advisors when additional guidance is deemed necessary.<br><br>You know in a very real way the prevalence of immorality. You are aware that drugs, alcohol, steroids, and other harmful substances are readily available.<br><br>As you live in the midst of much that would harm you, heed this verse of warning that closes chapter four of the Book of Mosiah. A prophet of the Lord is speaking:<br><br><i>If ye do not watch yourselves, and your thoughts, and your words, and your deeds, and observe the commandments of God, and continue in the faith of what ye have heard.</i>. . ,<i>even unto the end of your lives, ye must perish. And now, . . . remember, and perish not.</i>[Mosiah 4:30]<br><br>No prophet, no parent, no loving partner or person wants you to "perish." If you are to be preserved, you must take the responsibility to<i>watch yourself,</i>precisely as the scripture commands.<br><br>For your protection, this little publication lists twelve standards. May I review them briefly and offer a comment about each of these important standards.<br><br>1.<i>Dating.</i>Begin with the end in mind, and let your beginnings be bright. The end you seek is a celestial family, enabled by your being sealed in the temple to one you love. So for now, choose companions who make you better when you are with them--those who are willing to take upon themselves the sacred name of the Lord, live his commandments, and join with you in being one of his standard-bearers.<br><br>2.<i>Dress and Appearance.</i>This topic concerns the importance of personal choice. As you clothe yourself modestly and groom yourself attractively, your ability to make wise choices will be enhanced. Please pre-think your decisions. Your body is a temple of God; honor it. Don't get caught in the squeeze of opposing pressures. Downward pressure to be worldly is contrary to the uplifting pressure to live in accord with the Lord's standards. Step aside from the squeeze and let the elevating power of the Lord lift you without restraint to your loftiest heights.<br><br>3.<i>Friendship.</i>Cultivate the companionship of good friends. But also seek to broaden your circle. Reach and teach widely without fear. Enjoy opportunities to learn more from others. Share your testimony often and be a good friend to all you know. Don't forget to take advantage of choice friendshipping moments with parents, adults, advisors, and bishops. They will welcome your conversation. Surely, silent treatment is beneath the dignity of those who have taken upon themselves the name of Christ. And play your own part in helping to make your home a place of partnership, prayer, and peace.<br><br>4.<i>Honesty.</i>Personal standards should honestly govern every action. The honest person needs to remember only one version of an event. Those who don't obey standards they profess are called "hypocrites." While the world will always be full of them, recognize them for what they are and resolve to avoid their dishonest pattern of behavior. And remember, the payment of tithing will help discipline your mind to be an honest one.<br><br>5.<i>Language.</i>Language has the power to inspire and edify. You have the potential to speak with the tongue of an angel. Speak kindly of others. Don't be vulgar or profane. And for exciting new opportunities in life, study the language of people in lands other than your own.<br><br>6.<i>Media.</i>This topic pertains to movies, television, radio, videocassettes, books, magazines, and all other means that compete for the attention of your precious sight and hearing. Purveyors of pornography would enslave you by making their addicting snares seem desirable. But don't put all the blame on the media. The person who patronizes smut must bear ultimate accountability.<br><br>7.<i>Mental and Physical Health.</i>I have lived long enough now to witness the demise of classmates and colleagues who unwisely chose to disobey the Word of Wisdom (see D&amp;amp;C 89) and other divine counsel regarding the care of their bodies. I promise that as you keep the commandments of your Heavenly Creator and follow instructions that he has decreed for your benefit, you will be blessed in this life now and forever more.<br><br>8.<i>Music, Dancing, and Other Recreation.</i>The Lord expects us to seek after things that are "virtuous, lovely, or of good report or praiseworthy" (Articles of Faith 1:13). Enjoy them and discern between uplifting influences and those that might lead you away from standards of the Lord.<br><br>9.<i>Sexual Purity.</i>What does that mean? It means you take upon yourself the name of the Lord and reserve use of his gift of procreative powers exactly as he has decreed. These powers are not to be abused in lust, adultery, fornication, or perverted behavior. The purpose of the Lord's atonement is to qualify you for eternal marriage and everlasting joy with your predecessors and posterity. Satan would like to destroy the family and all that holds it together. While the world descends to the level of concern for "safe sex," your standard is sacred sex--within the bounds of holy matrimony as intended by the Lord.<br><br>General terms used in the booklet such as "moral cleanliness," "sexual purity," and "high standards" will become personally applicable only when you literally take upon yourself the name of Jesus Christ and do as he would have you do.<br><br>10.<i>The Sabbath Day.</i>I plead with you to do more than passively follow lists of do's and don'ts compiled by others. Generate your own policies and live by them. Follow the standard of the Lord, who centuries ago said: "My sabbaths ye shall keep: for it is a<i>sign</i>between me and you throughout your generations; that ye may know that I am the Lord that doth sanctify you" (Exodus 31:13, italics added; see also Ezekiel 20:20).<br><br>Additional guidance has been given in our dispensation, recorded in section 59 of the Doctrine and Covenants (verses 9–13).<br><br>Questions regarding appropriate behavior on the Sabbath are easily resolved when you study these scriptures and then determine what sign you choose to give to God of your regard for him.<br><br>11.<i>Spiritual Help.</i>Standard-bearers of the Lord have qualified by covenant to receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. There can be no greater guide to assure spiritual help through all your days.<br><br>12.<i>Repentance.</i>We all make mistakes. They are an important part of our maturing experience. But there is a real difference between a mistake and sin. Verses from modern revelation help distinguish the two:<br><br><i>And inasmuch as they erred it might be made known. . . .</i><br><br><i>And inasmuch as they sinned they might be chastened, that they might repent;</i><br><br><i>And inasmuch as they were humble they might be made strong, and blessed from on high, and receive knowledge from time to time.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 1:25–28]<br><br>The humble and prayerful person can be blessed with discernment and be made strong. And through the atonement of Jesus Christ, we can repent and be forgiven. For serious wrongdoing, or sin, confession to one's bishop is necessary. And remember, repentance is not repentance until sins are forsaken and repeated no more (see D&amp;amp;C 58:42–43).<br><br>Living in accord with these twelve standards will help us be worthy standard-bearers of the Lord. Then we can be his means of serving our fellowmen (see John 13:35; Mosiah 2:17).<br><br>Recognize the reality of the Redeemer and the power of the Lord's atonement in your life. Ponder this thought, phrased first as a question then as a testimony: "Did he do all this--for me? Yes, he did all this--for me!"<br><br><i>I stand all amazed at the love Jesus offers me,</i><br><i>Confused at the grace that so fully he proffers me.</i><br><i>I tremble to know that for me he was crucified,</i><br><i>That for me, a sinner, he suffered, he bled and died.</i><br><br><i>Oh, it is wonderful that he should care for me</i><br><i>Enough to die for me!</i><br><i>Oh, it is wonderful, wonderful to me!</i><br>["I Stand All Amazed,"<i>Hymns,</i>1985, no. 193]<br><br>His atonement is real. He has established<i>standards</i>by which each of us can become<i>standard-bearers of the Lord.</i>I so testify in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Russell M. Nelson was a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when this fireside address was given at Brigham Young University on 6 January 1991.</i><br><br><i>© Intellectual Reserve, Inc.

<h1>titution and the Restoration - Rex E. Lee - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
This morning I want to talk to you about a very important relationship that exists between, on the one hand, our lives, our practices, and our beliefs as participants in the restored gospel of Jesus Christ and, on the other, the Constitution of the United States. In one sense, this topic is a timeless one, because the Restoration and the Constitution trace their beginnings almost to the same point in time, and over the intervening two centuries have grown and flourished side by side.<br><br>And yet, in another sense, the subject is not only timely, but also time-driven. Today's devotional is the last one that will occur during the fifteen-year period from 1976 through the summer of 1991 that Congress officially designated as our bicentennial. Bicentennial! Over the past fifteen years--for most of you, the majority of your conscious years--this word has virtually acquired a secondary meaning. Viewed narrowly, it has been a ceremonial observance of the most remarkable period in the history of our nation, and perhaps in the history of the world. From a broader perspective, the bicentennial has symbolized patriotism and liberty and has served as a valuable reminder that the unique blessings we enjoy as Americans are largely attributable to a document that has proven to be, notwithstanding some flaws, probably the most successful governmental undertaking in the history of civilized life on this planet.<br><br>Constitutional principles and constitutional issues continually bear on our day-to-day activities. This very day, January 15, 1991--President Bush's deadline for the withdrawal of Iraqi troops from Kuwait provides an excellent example. It is an event and a day of obvious significance and concern to every American and to the world. Surrounding it on all sides is a constitutional issue. I'll say more about what that issue is in a moment. But at the outset I want you to understand that constitutional questions enter into a spectrum of our interests ranging from global war to nude dancing to non-returnable soft-drink containers.<br><h2><b>A Dramatic Story</b></h2><br>The two-hundred-year anniversary that we have been observing was a fifteen-year period that began with the Declaration of Independence and ended with the adoption of the Bill of Rights by the first Congress in the summer of 1791. The constitution-making portions of that decade and a half lasted only four years and consisted, in my view, of three basic phases. The first was the famous Philadelphia Convention in the summer of 1787. That story has been told several times and in several ways, but nowhere more interestingly nor more accurately than by our own BYU film production<i>A More Perfect Union.</i>The convention was conducted in secret and represented several struggles of epic proportions among the delegates, ultimately resolved by a series of compromises. Someday someone should make another movie like<i>A More Perfect Union,</i>telling the story of the second and third phases, which were ratification and the adoption of the Bill of Rights. Chronologically, ratification and the Bill of Rights adoption occurred in successive time periods, but they ended up being linked to each other. Their story is just as dramatic, and the process came just as perilously close to failure as did the Constitutional Convention itself. Let me explain.<br><br>The crucial time period for ratification lasted from late 1787 through the events of the summer of 1788. Formally and technically, the number of states required was nine, but everyone knew that if the new republic was to have a chance, the Constitution would have to be ratified by certain key states, including New York, Massachusetts, and Virginia. Very quickly, national leaders divided into two camps: the Federalists who supported the new Constitution, and the anti-Federalists who opposed it. The anti-Federalists included such luminaries as George Mason, Patrick Henry, and Richard Henry Lee of Virginia; Samuel Adams and Eldridge Gerry of Massachusetts; and Luther Martin of Maryland. They were distressed over the fact that this secret convention, authorized only to modify the Articles of Confederation, had instead established an entirely new form of government. Worse yet, it was a national government--with some of the very centralizing features and powers that the Articles of Confederation just a few years before had been deliberately designed to avoid. Indeed, many felt that this new document would lead us back on a path to monarchy.<br><br>The Federalists' efforts to secure ratification were led principally by Madison and Hamilton, who, with some help from John Jay, published under the pseudonym "Publius" a series of eighty-five essays entitled "The Federalist." Those essays are today not only the most authoritative sources for determining the original intent of the Founding Fathers, they are also part of our national literary treasure store.<br><br>The anti-Federalists rather quickly focused their attack on the lack of a "bill of rights." For both sides, the bill of rights issue was more tactical than substantive. All assumed that if the anti-Federalists succeeded in sending the entire Consitution into a second convention to consider including a bill of rights, a second convention would not have the advantage of secrecy that the first had enjoyed, and the proponents of a new constitution could therefore probably not duplicate the series of compromises on which their work of the summer 1787 had depended. In short, a new convention would mean no constitution at all, and both sides understood that the battle over a bill of rights was really a battle over the Constitution itself.<br><br>Once again, it was a compromise that carried the day, but this time a procedural one. Following the Massachusetts lead in early 1788, the crucial state conventions ratified the Constitution as it stood, but accompanied it with the addition of some proposed bill of rights amendments that Congress could consider<i>after</i>ratification. Given the closeness of the votes in Massachusetts, New York, and Virginia, it is quite clear that without this ratification--now Bill of Rights--later compromise, our Constitution would never have come into existence. And yet when the first Congress convened in April of 1789, most of its members were inclined to consider virtually any matter of business other than the Bill of Rights. If not for the constant pressure of one man, James Madison, then a member of the House of Representatives, the first Congress might never have enacted a bill of rights. (Ironically, Madison had been defeated for the Senate by Richard Henry Lee, who had opposed the Constitution.) Therefore, in all three phases of our constitution-making--drafting, ratification, and adding the Bill of Rights--Madison was the central figure. He truly deserves his title, the Father of our Constitution.<br><h2><b>The Limitation of Government</b></h2><br>What, then, is this Constitution that Madison and Hamilton and others labored so diligently and precariously to bring about, and whose bicentennial we have been celebrating over the past four years? In the most elementary sense, the answer is that it is a part of our American body of laws, and laws are the rules by which we govern ourselves. But out of all the rules of conduct that rise to the level of law in our society, the Constitution is different in several respects. I will mention just two, and they are interrelated.<br><br>First, the Constitution is supreme over all other law. That means that in the event there is any inconsistency between the provisions of the Constitution and law that stems from any other source, the other law is invalid for that reason alone. That is what we mean when we say that laws are "unconstitutional."<br><br>The second distinction is one that is not often talked about but is very important and is related to the first. As compared to any other kind of law--including statutory, regulatory, or judge-made common law--constitutional law (at least by the formal processes specified by the Constitution itself) is very difficult to make or change. Consider this: In two hundred years we have added only twenty-six amendments. The first ten, which include a large share of our most important constitutional provisions, were enacted in just a little over two years. But since that time, of the literally thousands of constitutional amendments that have been proposed, only sixteen--an average of eight per century--have actually become part of our constitutional law. And of those sixteen, two have canceled each other out, the majority have dealt with relatively unimportant matters, and only one, the Fourteenth, has an importance comparable to some of the provisions that were adopted between 1787 and 1791.<br><br>The central feature of the American Constitution is that with only one exception, its provisions are confined to limiting the powers of government. The single exception is the Thirteenth Amendment, which prohibits slavery and involuntary servitude and therefore necessarily governs relationships between private, nongovernmental people and entities. With that single exception, the Constitution leaves untouched those vast bodies of other law that regulate the rights and obligations that individuals, groups, and institutions owe to and enjoy from each other. I suspect that the great majority of Americans don't know that. It follows that when we speak of our constitutional rights, we are necessarily speaking of rights that we enjoy vis-a-vis government, either national, state, or local. The Constitution is silent with respect to rights that we might enjoy vis-a-vis our employer, our neighbor, or any other nongovernmental person or entity who infringes on our interests in any way other than the imposition of slavery or involuntary servitude, neither of which has been a terribly pressing issue over the past century and a quarter.<br><br>The Constitution is, in short, a limitation on government. It accomplishes its governmental-authority-confining mission in two basic ways, and, with the exception of the Thirteenth Amendment, every provision of the Constitution, in my opinion, falls into either one or the other of these two categories of limitations on governmental power.<br><br>The first category is the obvious one. The Constitution contains some fairly obvious, though not always specific, prohibitions concerning what government--federal, state, or local--can do to its citizens. Some of the most prominent are protections for the criminally accused, such as the privilege against self-incrimination, protection against unreasonable searches and seizures, the right to counsel, and jury trial. The best known of the noncriminal protections are contained in the First Amendment, most of whose guarantees pertain to some form of free expression, and include freedom of speech and press, freedom of assembly, and the free exercise of religion. (Interestingly enough, the only nonexpression right contained in the First Amendment is a structural provision, the so-called establishment clause, which deals with relationships between governments and religious organizations.) And although the original Constitution was criticized by the anti-Federalists for its lack of a bill of rights, it actually contained several important limitations on government designed solely to protect individual rights, such as the prohibitions against bills of attainder and ex post facto laws, the habeas corpus guarantee, and the contracts clause.<br><br>The other way that the Constitution limits governmental powers is more subtle, not as well known, but equally important and equally effective. It consists of a combination of two separate structural provisions. They are structural provisions in that they protect the individual against governmental power not by overtly prescribing what government cannot do, but rather by creating separate governmental units that compete for government power. By spreading the powers of government among several separate entities and by making each a competitor with the others, there is a lesser likelihood that any of those entities can ever acquire power in sufficient measure to become oppressive. The Constitution accomplishes this division of power along two dimensions: one horizontal, and one vertical.<br><br>First, it divides powers horizontally among three separate branches of the federal government. This breaking up of governmental authority among separate branches of the federal government was, in a very real sense, the first order of business for the 1787 Constitution makers. Thus, in Article I they created a legislative branch (Congress) and gave it the power to make laws; Article II created an executive branch (the president), charged with the responsibility "that the laws be faithfully executed"; and then Article III created the third branch (the federal courts), whose duty it is to interpret the laws.<br><br>The Constitution also divides power in a quite different way--vertically--between the federal government on the one hand and the various state governments on the other. Moreover, it gives each of these competitors a power feature that the other does not have. That is, the law-making authority of the states (a larger circle) is broader because the powers of the federal government (a smaller, included circle) are confined to those that the Constitution itself specifically authorizes any of the three branches to exercise, or powers that can be fairly implied by those specifically enumerated powers. But within its narrower sphere, federal law trumps state law whenever the two come into conflict. In summary, therefore, under this constitutional vertical division of authority, which we call federalism, the federal law is more potent, and within its confined sphere prevails when, as very frequently happens, the two come into conflict, but the total package of state powers is larger.<br><h2><b>Genius Features</b></h2><br>All of this talk about structure and competition for power in government may sound terribly boring to some of you, maybe even irrelevant. Let me tell you why I get so excited about it. It is not just my natural affinity for esoteric things. I believe that these interlocking structural features, separation of powers and federalism, lie at the core of why our constitutional system of government has survived and served us so well over two centuries. Both are simple in their basic precepts. But in their actual operation they can only be described as genius features. Over the long run of our nation's history, they have managed to maintain a balance of power both within the federal government and also between our two systems of government that has effectively protected our individual liberties in ways that are more subtle, but in my view just as effective, as the better-known guarantees contained in the Bill of Rights.<br><br>And they do so in ways that affect all of us. Just ask yourselves, for example, what single issue have you been most concerned about over the last several weeks? I would guess that for most of you, number one on your worry list has been the possibility of war. Did you know that at the bottom of the tussle between Congress and the president over the past several weeks, culminating in last weekend's congressional debate and resolution, is a rock-solid separation of powers issue? Among the powers that the Constitution splits up among different governmental entities are those that pertain to our ability to make war. In Iraq, Saddam Hussein can call all the shots by himself. But in this country, it takes some cooperative effort between at least two governmental competitors. Iraq's system is more efficient, but ours is better designed to assure against arbitrary and tyrannical government. And that's why I conclude that these structural features really amount to a genius system.<br><br>One of the most important features of the American Constitution, both in theory and in practice, is the magnificent breadth of its most important provisions--notably the commerce clause, most of the Bill of Rights guarantees, and the Fourteenth Amendment's due process and equal protection clauses. The lack of specificity of these and other provisions has almost certainly been essential to the ability of this document drafted in 1787 to survive over 200 years of the largest and most unanticipated change that any country at any time has ever experienced.<br><br>And yet there is another edge to this generality. Someone has to be vested with the final authority to determine what the Constitution means when its provisions are applied to concrete practical facts, many of which were totally unanticipated at the time of the Constitutional Convention. For example, how, if at all, is the authority of the states to regulate the lengths and weights of trucks on interstate highways precluded by Congress's constitutional authority "to regulate commerce . . . among the several states"? In 1787 few people were thinking about interstate highways or trucks. Similarly, the Constitution guarantees against infringements on free speech. What does that guarantee do, if anything, to state laws providing recovery for libel and slander? And what is speech? Any form of expression? Does it include flag burning? If so, is there a difference between burning flags and burning draft cards? Or sleeping in tents as a protest against homelessness? And what about the recent controversy over the refusal of the National Endowment for the Arts to give grants to projects or works that it considers obscene? Does the Constitution require that so long as NEA gives grants to anyone, it not exclude those that it considers objectionable?<br><br>You can read the Constitution very carefully and not find, even in a footnote or an annotated version, any answer to any of those questions. Each of these is a form of expression, and yet none of them uses words. Speech or not? First Amendment protected or not? Different people would give different answers to those questions.<br><br>And even where the text is more specific, questions of interpretation still remain. For example, with respect to the issue that is very much at the forefront of all of our minds today, how much could President Bush have done in the Persian Gulf without a formal congressional declaration? In this case, Congress acted, but in other crucial instances, such as the Civil War, Korea, and Vietnam, congressional action was either absent or less decisive. The Constitution states unequivocally, and quite specifically, that "the Congress shall have power . . . to declare war." Yet in language that is equally unequivocal and equally precise, Article II states that "the President shall be Commander-in-Chief of the Army and Navy of the United States." Did Presidents Lincoln, Truman, Johnson, and Nixon act unconstitutionally, or were they within their Article II powers?<br><br>Nothing in the text of the Constitution, and nothing in its history, provides the answer to those and many other practical questions that arise every day. But if our nation is to survive as a functioning constitutional republic, someone has to say what these broad, general provisions of the Constitution really mean. Since the issue is one of interpretation, common sense tells us that the Constitution is among the laws that the courts interpret, and that commonsense view is supported both by 187 years of actual practice and also by the most authoritative piece of constitutional history on this issue, Number 78 of the<i>Federalist Papers,</i>authored by Hamilton.<br><br>There are some consequences of this judicial power to interpret the Constitution that are a concern to many people, including your speaker. It means that five people--a majority of the Supreme Court--have the power not only to interpret the Constitution, but also effectively to amend it if they choose to do so, with little effective power for Congress, the president, or the people to reverse what the Court does in any particular case.<br><br>As large and as real as that concern is, it needs to be tempered by two facts. The first is that it is fairly clear to me that this power of judicial review--the authority of the courts to have the last word on constitutionality--was intended by the 1787 framers, though they did not explicitly say so. By combining the power of judicial review (which, as Hamilton says, they probably did intend) with the very broad language that the Founding Fathers used in the Constitution's most important provisions, the expansive judicial power that comes from judicial review was, in a sense, part of the "original intent" of the 1787 framers.<br><br>Second, there is, over the long run, a responsiveness between the will of the people and the content of our constitutional law. This comes about through the power of the president to appoint members of the federal judiciary. Indeed, as every recent president since Eisenhower has explicitly observed, one of the most important acts of any president--some have said the most important--is to appoint members of the Supreme Court, whose average tenure has been several times that of our presidents.<br><br>Therefore, over the decades of your future careers as voting Americans, just remember that when you vote for a president, you are doing more than picking the person who will lead us in war and peace and have access to Camp David and Air Force One. You are also in effect making a decision as to what kind of person you want on the Supreme Court. Our nation's history over the last half century demonstrates this fact. Particularly illustrative are the eight Roosevelt appointments in the late 1930s and early 1940s, and Nixon's four appointments between 1969 and 1972. While both of these presidents, and others, were probably disappointed in some of their appointees, as a group, those appointed by Roosevelt and also Nixon reflected the views of the president who appointed them, and presumably the people who elected the president. Most important of all, both the Roosevelt and the Nixon appointees have had large effects on all of us that will last for decades and, in many instances, forever.<br><h2><b>The Constitution's Significance for Latter-day Saints</b></h2><br>The constitutional principles and features that we have discussed thus far are relevant to every American citizen, and indeed to every person who enjoys the benefits of our constitutional system of government. For those of us who are members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, the study of the Constitution offers at least three other pluses, and they are unique to us.<br><br>The first is that the Restoration itself probably could not have survived if 200 years ago the anti-Federalists had prevailed. The events of the Restoration all occurred in this country. The message that it brought back to the world was highly controversial and provocative. Even with such protections as separation of powers and federalism and the explicit religion guarantees of the First Amendment, our early survival was as miraculous as that of the Constitution itself. Without those protections, we likely would not have survived at all.<br><br>It is, at the least, a remarkable coincidence--and in my view, no coincidence at all--that Joseph Smith was born less than fifteen years after the Bill of Rights became part of the Constitution. It's easy to forget that. The establishment of our Constitution by the hands of wise men occurred in the eighteenth century, and the birth of Joseph Smith and the First Vision in the nineteenth, but they actually took place only a few years apart. President Wilford Woodruff observed that the United States was the only place on earth where the Lord could have established his church and kingdom. And in more recent times, President David O. McKay in the dedicatory prayer for the Los Angeles Temple expressed gratitude for the Constitution and for the fact that it made the Restoration possible. How important, then, has the Constitution been for us? Without it, we probably would not have the gospel.<br><br>And this brings me to the second unique relationship between our American Constitution and our religion. We know that in fact the events whose two-hundredth birthday we observe did not come about just by chance. The descriptive phrase most commonly used by many members of the Church is that our Constitution was "divinely inspired." Unfortunately, some Church members have deduced from that general, nonscriptural description more than the scriptures or the Constitution or common sense will sustain.<br><br>That is, from the general label "divinely inspired ," some assume that the Constitution is tantamount to scripture, and therefore perfect in every respect, reflecting in every provision and every sentence the will of our Heavenly Father, just as is true of the Book of Mormon or the Doctrine and Covenants. That view cannot withstand analysis. Our Constitution has some provisions that are not only<i>not</i>divine, they are positively repulsive. The classic example is contained in Article V, which guaranteed as a matter of constitutional right that the slave trade would continue through at least the year 1808. There are other provisions that are not as offensive as the slavery guarantee, but they were quite clearly bad policy, and certainly were not divinely inspired in the same sense as are the scriptures. Moreover, regarding the Constitution as tantamount to scripture is difficult to square with the fact that our republic has functioned very well, probably even better, after at least one of its original provisions (requiring United States senators to be elected by their respective state legislatures rather than by the people at large) was amended out of existence by the Seventeenth Amendment.<br><br>In my own view, this whole issue is resolved simply by examining what the scriptures say, rather than resorting to the generality "divinely inspired," which you will not find anywhere in the standard works. Probably the most helpful statement is contained in section 101, verse 80 of the Doctrine and Covenants: "And for this purpose have I established the Constitution of this land, by the hands of wise men whom I raised up unto this very purpose." I submit that this scripture makes it very clear that our Heavenly Father's involvement in the bringing forth of our Constitution was more an involvement in process than in end result. As President Benson has stated, "It is my firm belief that the God of Heaven raised up the Founding Fathers and inspired them to establish the Constitution of this land." His focus, and the focus of the Doctrine and Covenants, frees us of the burden of trying to equate the Constitution with scripture and, therefore, to justify every part. And a focus on process reaffirms the fact that the Constitution did not just come about by chance. Our Heavenly Father did play an active and essential role. That role was not the revelation to a prophet of infallible truth, perfect and reliable in every aspect. Rather, what the Lord did was to raise up at just the right time and in just the right combination people who could and predictably would produce a document that is, on balance, the most remarkable ever struck by human hands. Interestingly enough, James Madison himself in Number 37 of the<i>Federalist Papers</i>also expressed the view that "it is impossible for the man of pious reflection not to perceive in it [referring to the Constitution] a finger of that Almighty hand which has been so frequently and signally extended to our relief in the critical state of the Revolution." Statements similar to that of Madison can be found in the writings of others of the Founding Fathers.<br><br>A final area of constitutional interest unique to Latter-day Saints finds its source in the well-known "hanging by a thread" statements by the Prophet Joseph Smith. Similar statements have been reiterated by no fewer than six of his successors, including the current prophet. In a forthcoming book to be published by the Religious Studies Center, Professor Donald Cannon lists over forty instances in which these seven presidents have either used the "thread" metaphor or something like it. But in none of those quotations cited by Professor Cannon has any Church leader ever been very specific as to the metaphor's meaning.<br><br>Unfortunately, some members of the Church have been all too ready to offer their own explanations. The only thing consistent about these explanations is that in each instance, it was the Church member's own unresolved, often very private, grievance that supplied evidence that the thread was beginning to fray, sometimes beyond repair. Among some people, any problem from a tax increase to a failure to collect the garbage on time to a boundary dispute with one's neighbor is likely to call forth the observation that it is certainly easy to see how the Constitution is hanging by a thread. A companion assertion is that the election or appointment of certain persons, often the person making the assertion, to designated positions provides the key to preventing the demise of our constitutional system.<br><br>In my view, this is another instance in which going beyond what our leaders have said can be misleading at best, and potentially fraught with mischief. Even though we have not been given the exact meaning of the prophets' statements about the Constitution hanging by a thread, the scriptures do define the conditions on which freedom in the land of America ultimately depends. I am satisfied that whatever else may eventually hang in the constitutional balance, this much is clear: The continuation of the blessings of liberty depends finally on our spiritual righteousness. As the Lord told the Jaredites in the Book of Ether, this is a "land of promise." And "whatsoever nation shall possess it shall be free from bondage, and from captivity, . . . if they will but serve the God of the land, who is Jesus Christ." If the people fail to keep this covenant, they "shall be swept off when the fulness of his wrath shall come upon them. And the fulness of his wrath cometh upon them when they are ripened in iniquity" (Ether 2:9–12).<br><br>I hope that after this morning's discussion you will have a better understanding not only of what the Constitution is and how it works, but also of what it does not do. As Paul Martin Wolff, a prominent Washington, D.C., lawyer, has observed:<br><br><i>The Constitution has too often been misused for personal gain. Individual desires have been palmed off as scholarship. Politicians have pandered to the public by compounding misunderstandings of Supreme Court decisions, not correcting them. Constitutional pronouncements appear everywhere, from bumper stickers to talk shows. Too many people appear in classrooms, pulpits, campaign platforms, and mass circulation magazines, telling us not what they believe the Constitution means, but what they insist it says, giving every appearance that they are the sole heirs of James Madison's wisdom.</i>[Paul Martin Wolff,<i>Legal Times of Washington,</i>November 9, 1981]<br><br>Necessarily, today's discussion has been very summary in its content. I cannot hope to give you in thirty-five minutes a constitutional law course that either in our political science or our law school curriculum would occupy a full year, or that for more serious students of this fascinating subject can consume a lifetime and still leave many questions unanswered. What I hope we have been able to accomplish is two things. The first is to give you a basic understanding of what the Constitution is and is not, how it operates, and its particular significance for you. Second, I hope that you now have an interest in learning more as an enduring, continuing part of your overall learning processes. The Lord's caution about the relationship between our righteousness and our liberties has been reiterated over the centuries from Jaredite days to Nephite days to our own. Scriptures ancient and modern tell us that there is something we can do to contribute to the cause of freedom in this land governed by a constitution whose bicentennial we celebrate--a constitution established by the hands of wise men raised up by God for that very purpose. That each of us may make that contribution through the lives we lead, by keeping our Heavenly Father's commandments, and striving to be more like his Son is my prayer, in the name of his Son, Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Rex E. Lee was president of Brigham Young University when this devotional address was given on 15 January 1991.</i><br><br><i>© Brigham Young University. All rights reserved.</i>
<h1> the Scriptures unto Us - Dean L. Larsen - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I have been advised that this fireside concludes a series of activities that have focused attention on the Book of Mormon, with particular emphasis on the book of Alma. In many ways Alma could qualify as an independent scripture. It contains almost twice as many chapters as any other book in the Book of Mormon. Its recounting of the missionary labors of the sons of Mosiah among the Lamanites is one of the most remarkable missionary stories of all time. Alma's great treatise on faith and the power of God's word in chapter 32 is a classic. Amulek's explanation of the Atonement in chapter 34 is as straightforward and clear as any treatment of this subject to be found in the scriptures. Alma's admonitions to his son Corianton merit the closest study, particularly his exposition on mercy, justice, and judgment in chapter 42. And there is so much more.<br><br>As I have studied the Book of Mormon, I have become convinced that, in addition to its being another powerful witness for Jesus Christ and his gospel plan, it has unusual value for us by virtue of what we can learn from the experiences of the people whose record it is. In some respects, our review of the historical events in the book permits us to see a reflection of ourselves. As we compare circumstances and conditions in our own time with those we see in relevant segments of the Book of Mormon history, we may be able to predict with some degree of accuracy the consequences of human behavior in our day. We can also gain vital insight into how we may continue to merit the Lord's blessings and thus avoid the calamities that so often befell these ancient people. The book of Alma is as useful in this kind of review as any of the scriptures we possess. With your indulgence this evening, I am going to look beyond the significant doctrinal teachings that make Alma such a rich treasury and invite you to look with me at the lives of the people from this part of the record and compare them with conditions and events in our present day. In doing so, I intend to draw upon other relevant sources, some from the Book of Mormon, and some from other documents that may help us to see ourselves in the continuing historic panorama of God's dealings with his earthly children.<br><h2><b>"And Thus They Did Dwindle in Unbelief"</b></h2><br>As the book of Mosiah concludes, the people of Nephi have been established under a government of elected judges. Alma, the son of Alma, has been named as the "first and chief judge." He is also the presiding officer of the Church.<br><br>It is a good time. The great love felt by the people for King Mosiah has laid a strong foundation for the new government. The Church is well established, and the people "rejoiced because of the liberty which had been granted unto them" (Mosiah 29:39).<br><br>Challenges soon confront the leaders in this new system. Alma is faced with a seditious movement against the government as well as against the Church. Gideon, one of the most loved and respected of the senior citizens, is murdered. Nehor, who has instigated the insurrection, and who is personally guilty of Gideon's murder, is summarily tried and executed for his crime. But his apostate influence has taken root among the people, for, as the record says, "there were many who loved the vain things of the world ," and "the hearts of many were hardened" (Alma 1:16, 24).<br><br>By the time five years have passed, the Nephite nation is torn by civil war, and there are many defections from the Church. In the midst of these difficulties, the Nephites are invaded by Lamanite armies. In the ensuing battles, so many Nephites are slain that they are not numbered because of the greatness of their number (see Alma 3:1). It is a time of great remorse among the Nephites.<br><br><i>And so great were their afflictions that every soul had cause to mourn; and they believed that it was the judgments of God sent upon them because of their wickedness and their abominations; therefore they were awakened to a remembrance of their duty.</i><br><br><i>And they began to establish the church more fully; yea, and many were baptized in the waters of Sidon and were joined to the church of God.</i>[Alma 4:3–4]<br><br>In this resurgence of faith the Nephites prosper again. Peace returns. Remarkably, it does not last for long. Within a period of three years, defection and apostasy begin to manifest themselves within the Church.<br><br><i>And it came to pass in the eighth year of the reign of the judges, that the people of the church began to wax proud, because of their exceeding riches, and their fine silks, and their fine-twined linen, and because of their many flocks and herds, and their gold and their silver, and all manner of precious things, which they had obtained by their industry; and in all these things were they lifted up in the pride of their eyes.</i>[Alma 4:6]<br><br>The dissension spreads rapidly. Alma, perplexed by the drift of his people toward another tragedy, resigns from his position as chief judge and turns his full energy and attention to the collapsing church.<br><br><i>And this he did that he himself might go forth among his people, or among the people of Nephi, that he might preach the word of God unto them, to stir them up in remembrance of their duty, and that he might pull down, by the word of God, all the pride and craftiness and all the contentions which were among his people, seeing no way that he might reclaim them save it were in bearing down in pure testimony against them.</i>[Alma 4:19]<br><br>Alma then goes to the major cities of the land to accomplish his purpose--to Zarahemla, Gideon, Melek, Ammonihah, Sidom , among the Zoramites, and eventually to Jershon. Much of Alma's record is composed of the great doctrinal discourses preached by Alma and his companions in their efforts to reclaim this people. It is a labor of many years and demands the utmost of Alma's faith and perseverance.<br><br>In the course of these events, we can observe the manner in which the Lord tests and tries his people. We note, as well, the afflictions that he permits them to bring upon themselves in order to humble them and keep them from falling completely away from the course he has marked out for them. The warfare and suffering described in the latter chapters of Alma are grim reminders of the tragedies that people can bring upon themselves when they drift away from the Lord's standard.<br><br>In each dispensation of the gospel prior to the one in which we live, there has come a time when the people of God have succumbed to the worldly influences that have encompassed them. Periods of spiritual darkness have followed as the earth's inhabitants have turned themselves away from God and have suffered the consequences of their folly. The saddest recorded accounts in the scriptural and historical records are those of once-favored people who drift into apostasy.<br><br>Following the Savior's visit to the Nephites and Lamanites here in the Americas, the people who responded to his ministry enjoyed a period of unprecedented prosperity and happiness. In 4 Nephi we find this description of them:<br><br><i>And the Lord did prosper them exceedingly in the land; yea, insomuch that they did build cities again where there had been cities burned. . . .</i><br><br><i>And . . . the people of Nephi did wax strong, and did multiply exceedingly fast, and became an exceedingly fair and delightsome people. . . .</i><br><br><i>And it came to pass that there was no contention among all the people, in all the land; . . .</i><br><br><i>And there were no envyings, nor strifes, nor tumults, nor whoredoms, nor lyings, nor murders, nor any manner of lasciviousness; and surely there could not be a happier people among all the people who had been created by the hand of God.</i>[4 Nephi 1:7, 10, 13, 16]<br><br>For almost 200 years the people lived in these favored circumstances. Then, almost inconceivably, they left the pattern of life that had brought them such great blessings.<br><br>Mormon's commentary on the spiritual decline of this people is worthy of careful, thoughtful review:<br><br><i>And now I, Mormon, would that ye should know that the people had multiplied, insomuch that they were spread upon all the face of the land, and that they had become exceedingly rich, because of their prosperity in Christ.</i><br><br><i>And now, . . . there began to be among them those who were lifted up in pride. . . .</i><br><br><i>And from that time forth they did have their goods and their substance no more common among them.</i><br><br><i>And they began to be divided into classes. . . .</i><br><br><i>And . . . there were many . . . which professed to know the Christ, and yet they did deny the more parts of his gospel. . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . the people did harden their hearts, for they were led . . . to do all manner of iniquity. . . . And thus they did dwindle in unbelief and wickedness, from year to year.</i>[4 Nephi 1:23–27, 34]<br><br><i>But wickedness did prevail upon the face of the whole land, insomuch that the Lord did take</i><br><br><i>away his beloved disciples, and the work of miracles and of healing did cease because of the iniquity of the people.</i><br><br><i>And there were no gifts from the Lord, and the Holy Ghost did not come upon any, because of their wickedness and unbelief. . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . for behold they had wilfully rebelled against their God.</i>[Mormon 1:13–16]<br><h2><b>Similar Challenges in Our Time</b></h2><br>We have been assured that in this last dispensation of the fulness of times there will be no universal apostasy. When the Lord appears again in his glory, he will find a people who will have remained faithful and who will be ready to receive him and join with him in the completion of his work.<br><br>But the fact that there will not be a complete apostasy in this last dispensation does not mean all who have received the gospel and become members of the Church will remain faithful. Prophetic references to our own day, in fact, seem to indicate that there will be many who have known the truth and have tasted of the Lord's goodness who will then allow themselves to be tempted away from the course the Lord has marked out for them.<br><br>In the October general conference of 1965, Elder Harold B. Lee spoke of the test that would come, and in his remarks he cited the words of President Heber C. Kimball, who said:<br><br><i>We think we are secure here in the chambers of the everlasting hills. . . , but I want to say to you, . . . the time is coming when we will be mixed up in these now peaceful valleys to that extent that it will be difficult to tell the face of a Saint from the face of an enemy to the people of God. Then, brethren, look out for the great sieve, for there will be a great sifting time, and many will fall; for I say unto you there is a</i>test,<i>a TEST, a<b>TEST</b>coming, and who will be able to stand?</i>[Orson F. Whitney,<i>Life of Heber C</i>.<i>Kimball</i>(Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1967), p. 446]<br><br>In Lehi's vision of the tree of life, he describes those who would be tempted away from the path of eternal happiness, even after they have followed the rod of iron to the tree and tasted of its fruit. This is Lehi's description of what he saw:<br><br><i>And it came to pass that there arose a mist of darkness; yea, even an exceedingly great mist of darkness, insomuch that they who had commenced in the path did lose their way, that they wandered off and were lost.</i><br><br><i>And it came to pass that I beheld others pressing forward, and they came forth and caught hold of the end of the rod of iron; and they did press forward through the mist of darkness, clinging to the rod of iron, even until they did come forth and partake of the fruit of the tree.</i><br><br><i>And after they had partaken of the fruit of the tree they did cast their eyes about as if they were ashamed.</i><br><br><i>And I also cast my eyes round about, and beheld, on the other side of the river of water, a great and spacious building; and it stood as it were in the air, high above the earth.</i><br><br><i>And it was filled with people, both old and young, both male and female; and their manner of dress was exceedingly fine; and they were in the attitude of mocking and pointing their fingers towards those who had come at and were partaking of the fruit.</i><br><br><i>And after they had tasted of the fruit they were ashamed, because of those who were scoffing at them; and they fell away into forbidden paths and were lost.</i>[1 Nephi 8:23–28]<br><br>Nephi later declared, "And it came to pass that I saw and bear record, that the great and spacious building was the pride of the world" (1 Nephi 11:36).<br><br>In reference to the calamities that will come upon the disobedient in the last days, the Lord revealed to Joseph Smith:<br><br><i>Nevertheless, Zion shall escape if she observe to do all things whatsoever I have commanded her.</i><br><br><i>But if she observe not to do whatsoever I have commanded her, I will visit her according to all her works, with sore affliction, with pestilence, with plague, with sword, with vengeance, with devouring fire.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 97:25–26]<br><br><i>Behold, vengeance cometh speedily upon the inhabitants of the earth, a day of wrath, a day of burning, a day of desolation, of weeping, of mourning, and of lamentation; and as a whirlwind it shall come upon all the face of the earth, saith the Lord.</i><br><br><i>And upon my house shall it begin, and from my house shall it go forth, saith the Lord;</i><br><br><i>First among those among you, saith the Lord, who have professed to know my name and have not known me, and have blasphemed against me in the midst of my house, saith the Lord.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 112:24–26]<br><br><i>Behold, I tell you these things, even as I also told the people of the destruction of Jerusalem; and my word shall be verified at this time as it hath hitherto been verified.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 5:20]<br><br>With these direful warnings and predictions the Lord combines remarkable promises to those who will remain faithful and who will not yield to the temptations the world offers. But these are conditional promises. The Lord will not be mocked in these last days by those who make covenants of obedience and then violate them with a sense of impunity or with the deceitful intent of one day repenting and coming back into line after purposeful excursions into forbidden paths.<br><br>Nephi was allowed to see our time in vision, and he knew of the efforts the adversary would make to delude and confuse the members of the Church as well as others of God's children. Nephi said:<br><br><i>For behold, at that day shall he rage in the hearts of the children of men, and stir them up to anger against that which is good.</i><br><br><i>And others will he pacify, and lull them away into carnal security, that they will say: All is well in Zion; yea, Zion prospereth, all is well --and thus the devil cheateth their souls, and leadeth them away carefully down to hell.</i>[2 Nephi 28:20–21]<br><br>We live in a time of rapid Church growth. Large numbers are being baptized throughout the world. Many countries that have not been accessible to the missionary effort are now opening their doors. In many respects Zion is prospering, and things seem to be going well.<br><br>In the midst of this apparent general prosperity of the Church, it is well for us to look carefully and honestly into our own lives to see if some of the evidences of spiritual infirmity are beginning to reappear, particularly in light of the warnings the Lord has given to us.<br><h2><b>Maintaining Centers of Spiritual Strength</b></h2><br>Historically, the drifting away from the course of life marked out by the Lord has occurred as individuals begin to make compromises with the Lord's standard. This is particularly true when the transgression is willful and no repentance occurs. Remember Mormon's description of those who turned away from the true path in his day. They did not sin in ignorance. They willfully rebelled against God. It did not occur as a universal movement. It began as individual members of the Church knowingly began to make compromises with the Lord's standard. They sought justification for their diversions in the know ledge that others were compromising as well. Those who willfully sin soon seek to establish a standard of their own with which they can feel more comfortable and which justifies their misconduct. They also seek the association of those who are willing to drift with them along this path of self-delusion.<br><br>As the number of drifting individuals increases, their influence becomes more powerful. It might be described as the "great and spacious building syndrome." The drifting is the more dangerous when its adherents continue to overtly identify with and participate with the group that conforms to the Lord's way. Values and standards that were once clear become clouded and uncertain. The norm of behavior begins to reflect this beclouding of true principles. Conduct that would once have caused revulsion and alarm now becomes somewhat commonplace.<br><br>Alma was faced with this challenge as he began his efforts to reestablish the order of the Church among his people. To them he said:<br><br><i>All you that are desirous to follow the voice of the good shepherd, come ye out from the wicked, and be ye separate, and touch not their unclean things; and behold, their names shall be blotted out, that the names of the wicked shall not be numbered among the names of the righteous. . . .</i><br><br><i>For what shepherd is there among you having many sheep doth not watch over them, that the wolves enter not and devour his flock? And behold, if a wolf enter his flock doth he not drive him out? Yea, and at the last, if he can, he will destroy him.</i><br><br><i>And now I say unto you that the good shepherd doth call after you; . . . and he commandeth you that ye suffer no ravenous wolf to enter among you, that ye may not be destroyed.</i>[Alma 5:57, 59–60]<br><br>Alma's father, you will recall, had been faced with this problem in the days of King Mosiah. He consulted with the king, and it was determined that the matter should be dealt with within the Church. Alma, therefore, went to the Lord to learn what should be done. The Lord's response is of great significance.<br><br><i>Therefore I say unto you, Go; and whosoever transgresseth against me, him shall ye judge according to the sins which he has committed; and if he confess his sins before thee and me, and repenteth in the sincerity of his heart, him shall ye forgive, and I will forgive him also.</i><br><br><i>Now I say unto you, Go; and whosoever will not repent of his sins the same shall not be numbered among my people; and this shall be observed from this time forward.</i>[Mosiah 26:29, 32]<br><br>Zeezrom's story in the book of Alma is an excellent example of the effectiveness of repentance. Zeezrom, who once taunted and defied Alma, made a dramatic change in his life and became one of the stalwarts in the effort to strengthen the Church and reconvert his people. He was one of the few who became companions with Alma in his missionary labors, obviously deserving of the complete trust and confidence of his priesthood leader.<br><br>The safe course to follow is to adhere strictly to the standards set by the Lord, without compromise. Those who do so give support to one another in righteousness and faith. They have compassion for the sinner, but an intolerance for sin. They deal with the unrepentant sinner in such a way that he cannot persist in working his evil, insidious influence among them.<br><br>Such was the case with the people of Enoch. Time will not permit a review of the circumstances in Enoch's day, but a careful study of that episode may give some insight into the manner in which the Lord will preserve a righteous people in our time in a world that is ripening in iniquity as it was before the flood.<br><br>Within the framework of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Savior has provided a refuge from the evils of the world. Wherever a congregation or community of Saints is found, there should be the sustaining influence of the gospel and the assurance that those who identify themselves as Saints are applying themselves to gospel principles.<br><br>As in the days of Enoch, the Lord makes promises to the faithful of this dispensation who will maintain such centers of spiritual strength.<br><br><i>And the glory of the Lord shall be there, and the terror of the Lord also shall be there, insomuch that the wicked will not come unto it, and it shall be called Zion.</i><br><br><i>And it shall come to pass among the wicked, that every man that will not take his sword against his neighbor must needs flee unto Zion for safety.</i><br><br><i>And there shall be gathered unto it out of every nation under heaven.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 45:67–69]<br><br><i>And the nations of the earth shall honor her, and shall say: Surely Zion. . . cannot fall, neither be moved out of her place, for God is there, and the hand of the Lord is there;</i><br><br><i>And he hath sworn by the power of his might to be her salvation and her high tower.</i><br><br><i>Therefore, verily, thus saith the Lord, let Zion rejoice, for this is Zion--the pure in heart.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 97:19–21]<br><br>In conforming to the instruction given by the Lord to Alma, leaders have an obligation to exercise the judicial processes essential to preserving a refining gospel environment, free from the corrupting influences that otherwise intrude within the group and threaten its spiritual base.<br><br>In establishing the code of honor here at Brigham Young University, Church leaders have attempted to foster an institution of higher learning that can offer to those who come here as faculty or students the assurance of a place where academic studies can be pursued in a gospel environment uncontaminated by the influences that are destructive to faith and spiritual well-being.<br><br>All who enroll here at BYU make a pledge to which they affix their signatures as an affidavit that they will abide by the code of honor or be subject to dismissal.<br><br>You will know, individually, whether or not you have integrity to that pledge. I think you will have some sense, collectively, as to whether this code of honor is being upheld by the student body of BYU. May I give it as my strong personal conviction that to the degree you, individually, violate this code, you invite into this campus community a spirit of dissent that will inevitably have its effect upon you as well as upon this institution.<br><br>May I express profound admiration and gratitude to those of you who retain your commitment to this code of honor as well as to the principles of the gospel of Jesus Christ. Your integrity will not go unnoticed by a just and loving Father in Heaven. You represent a moral strength that is greatly needed today. You continue to contribute to the perpetuation of a condition here on this campus that will bless many lives.<br><br>It should not surprise us, in light of the counsel we have been given, that we occasionally observe some of the things Alma saw among the members of the Church for whom he had concern and to whom he made this appeal:<br><br><i>Behold, I say unto you, that the good shepherd doth call you; yea, and in his own name he doth call you, which is the name of Christ; and if ye will not hearken unto the voice of the good shepherd, to the name by which ye are called, behold, ye are not the sheep of the good shepherd.</i><br><br><i>And now if ye are not the sheep of the good shepherd, of what fold are ye? . . .</i><br><br><i>For I say unto you that whatsoever is good</i><br><br><i>cometh from God, and whatsoever is evil cometh from the devil.</i>[Alma 5:38–40]<br><br><i>And now, my brethren, I would that ye should hear me, for I speak in the energy of my soul; for behold, I have spoken unto you plainly that ye cannot err.</i>[Alma 5:43]<br><br>At the conclusion of Enos' record in the Book of Mormon, he speaks of the struggle that was necessary to keep the people of his day from falling into disobedience and despair. He says:<br><br><i>And there was nothing save it was exceeding harshness, preaching and prophesying of wars, and contentions, and destructions, and continually reminding them of death, and the duration of eternity, and the judgments and the power of God, and all these things-- stirring them up continually to keep them in the fear of the Lord. I say there was nothing short of these things, and exceedingly great plainness of speech, would keep them from going down speedily to destruction.</i>[Enos 1:23]<br><br>I do not believe conditions among the members of the Church today are as severe as they were in Enos' time. However, I believe it is a time for great plainness in speech. Against the backdrop of conditions in Alma's day and the prophesies the Lord has given pertaining to our own time, I have tried to speak to you in plainness and forthrightness about the conditions in which we live and the reasons for feeling some concern about whether we are fully qualifying for the blessings the Lord has promised. I have hoped to confirm two things with you that the Lord has made clear in his revelations. One is that, while individuals may fail to withstand the tests, the Lord will not permit apostate influences to engulf his Church in this dispensation. This may require a purging from time to time in a manner that he has described in unmistakable terms. Such purging, if it is required in our day, will be as painful and devastating as any experienced by God's children at anytime on the earth. The suffering of the disobedient in the time of Alma gives some idea of the terrible circumstances that a wayward people can bring upon themselves.<br><br>The second thing I wish to confirm with you is that if we will be faithful to the gospel plan of life, if we will keep the commandments of God without compromise, without attempting to willfully, purposefully cheat against that which we know to be right and pure and good, we will have the preserving, protecting power of the Lord to be with us, regardless of the course the world may take and its inevitable consequences.<br><br>We have a solemn obligation to the Lord, to ourselves, to our posterity, and to the many good people in the world who are looking for the right way to preserve a community of Saints who the Lord can bless and who can serve as a beacon and a sanctuary to all who love the Lord and seek to do his will. May we be wise enough and honest enough with ourselves to avoid the tempting of the adversary, who desires to cheat our souls and lead us carefully down to his depths of despair and misery. May we be fervent enough in our faith and love of the Lord and his work that we will be more than passive camp followers in our Church membership. May we be assertive and aggressive in standing for all that is right and pure and good, I pray humbly in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Dean L.

<h1>nto You, Be One” - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
As a mission president, I taught the missionaries to ask a few questions about the town in which they were to labor. Where did the town get its name? When was it settled and why? "Then," I told them, "you will know more about the town than even those who have lived there all of their lives." Most people do not know the very simple and, ofttimes, fascinating things about the community in which they live.<br><br>You come to Brigham Young University from all over the world. It is my purpose to tell you things about this great community of learning that you do not know. I will tell you things about the past: why it is unique and why and how this university was founded; something about the present: how it is governed; and something of the future: what we must do if we are to keep faith with those who founded it. Most of what I tell you, you will not find written in books.<br><h2><b>Church Education in the Early Years</b></h2><br>From the beginning, the Church has fostered both spiritual and secular learning, for that is in the revelations. The Lord revealed that "the glory of God is intelligence, or, in other words, light and truth. Light and truth forsake that evil one. [Ye are commanded] to bring up your children in light and truth" (D&amp;amp;C 93:36–37, 40). Another revelation tells us that "whatever principle of intelligence we attain unto in this life, it will rise with us in the resurrection" (D&amp;amp;C 130:18). There are other scriptures that emphasize the importance of both religious and secular learning. One of them includes a promise:<br><br><i>Teach ye diligently and my grace shall attend you, that you may be instructed more perfectly in theory, in principle, in doctrine, in the law of the gospel, in all things that pertain unto the kingdom of God, that are expedient for you to understand.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 88:78]<br><br>As the early Saints moved to Ohio, Missouri, and Illinois, they established elementary and secondary schools in each settlement. Schools of the Prophets were organized for adult leaders in Kirtland, Ohio, in 1833, and other such schools were organized even after the settlement here in the West. I know they had a School of the Prophets in Brigham City, for instance. In 1840, a university was established in Nauvoo.<br><br>During the trek to the Rocky Mountains, elementary classes were conducted in the camps. In the fall of 1847, within three months of arriving in the valley, the first schools were organized. Three years later the University of Deseret was founded; it later became the University of Utah. The deeding of this university to the state foreshadowed a policy to turn Church-related schools to the civil government as soon as public schools were available to our members.<br><br>Beginning in 1875, the Church established academies in the United States, Canada, and Mexico. They were to provide secondary secular and religious education. By 1907, the Church was operating thirty-five academies. The academies included elements of what we now have in junior colleges. For example, President Harold B. Lee graduated from the Oneida Stake Academy in Idaho and was appointed principal of an elementary school. He was eighteen years old at the time. President Benson graduated from that same academy.<br><br>With the establishment of free public high schools, attendance at the academies declined. Some were closed; others became Church-sponsored junior colleges. By 1931, only Juarez Academy in Mexico remained. In time, except for Ricks College, the junior colleges were all transferred to the states. Weber State University began as the Weber Academy. President David O. McKay was principal at the time of his call to the Twelve. Brigham Young Academy became Brigham Young University.<br><br>Incidentally, there was a Brigham Young College established in 1877 in Logan. It was replaced by a land-grant college, now Utah State University.<br><br>And in 1891 the Church announced the establishment of the Young University in Salt Lake City headed by Dr. James E. Talmage. Buildings were under construction and equipment had been purchased when the Panic of 1893 occurred. Church leaders set aside those plans in favor of supporting the University of Utah, which was sinking under the depression, and Dr. Talmage was appointed president of that university (John R. Talmage,<i>The Talmage Story</i>[Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1972], pp. 119–23).<br><br>When they moved from academies to public secondary schools, our youth missed religious instruction. In 1912, the Church opened the first released-time seminary adjacent to Granite High School in Salt Lake City. The following year Able S. Rich, who was a teacher in agriculture at the time, was hired to open the second seminary in Brigham City. Brother Rich was still there as principal when I began to teach there forty years ago.<br><br>Institutes of religion were established at public colleges beginning in 1926 at the University of Idaho. I have known personally most of those who pioneered religious education in the Church.<br><br>There is another chapter. In fairly recent times, elementary and secondary schools were established many places in the world where schools were not available to our members. When public education became available, more than a hundred schools--including a university, junior colleges, academies, secondary and elementary schools--were transferred to state governments or were closed.<br><br>In order to coordinate the programs and growth of Church schools, a General Church Board of Education was organized in 1888, consisting of selected local Church leaders--stake presidents, for instance. Karl G. Maeser was named the first superintendent of Church schools, a position that later became the commissioner of Church education.<br><h2><b>Working As One</b></h2><br>In recent years, the board of education of the Church and the board of trustees for Church colleges and universities has been the First Presidency, six members of the Quorum of the Twelve, a member of the Presiding Bishopric, and the presidents of the Relief Society and the Young Women of the Church.<br><br>I can best tell you how you are governed today, how the board of trustees functions, by explaining the principles and procedures we follow in the meetings of the First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. These procedures protect the work from the individual weaknesses apparent in all of us.<br><br>When a matter comes before the First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles in a temple meeting, one thing that is determined very quickly is whether it is of serious consequence or not. One or another of us will see in an apparently innocent proposal issues of great and lasting consequence.<br><br>It is clear from the revelations that the decisions of the presiding quorums "must be by the unanimous voice of the same. . . . Unless this is the case, their decisions are not entitled to the same blessings" (D&amp;amp;C 107:27, 29). In order to ensure that to be the case, matters of consequence are seldom decided in the meeting where they are proposed. And, if the proposal is a part of a larger issue, sufficient time is taken to "bring us all along" so that it is clear that each of us has either a clear<i>understanding</i>of the issue or, as is often the case, has a very clear<i>feeling</i>about it.<br><br>The Doctrine and Covenants instructs us:<br><br><i>Let not all be spokesmen at once; but let one speak at a time and let all listen unto his sayings, that when all have spoken that all may be edified of all, and that every man may have an equal privilege.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 88:122]<br><br>It would be unthinkable to deliberately present an issue in such a way that approval depended upon how it was maneuvered through channels, who was presenting it, or who was present or absent when it was presented.<br><br>Often one or more of us is away during regular meetings. We all know that the work must proceed and will accept the judgment of our brethren. However, if a matter has been studied by one of the Quorum in more detail than by the others or he is more familiar with it either by assignment, experience, or personal interest, the matter is very often delayed until he can be in on the discussion.<br><br>And, always, if one of us cannot understand an issue or feels unsettled about it, it is held over for future discussion.<br><br>I remember occasions when a delegation was sent to the hospital to discuss with a member of the Council who was ill some urgent matter that could not be delayed but which needed that "unanimous consent." There are occasions, as well, when one of us will leave the meeting temporarily to call one of our number who is abroad to get his feelings on a matter under discussion.<br><br>There is a rule we follow: A matter is not settled until there is a<i>minute entry</i>to evidence that all of the Brethren in council assembled (not just one of us, not just a committee) have come to a unity of feeling. Approval of a matter in principle is not considered authority to act until a minute entry records the action taken--usually when the minutes are approved in the next meeting.<br><br>Sometimes an afterthought keeps one of us restless over a decision. That is never dismissed lightly. It cannot be assumed that that restless spirit is not in fact the Spirit of Revelation.<br><br>That is how we function--in council assembled. That provides safety for the Church and a high comfort level for each of us who is personally accountable. Under the plan, men of very ordinary capacity may be guided through counsel and inspiration to accomplish extraordinary things.<br><br>Even with the best of intentions, it does not always work the way it should. Human nature may express itself on occasion, but not to the permanent injury of the work. I have a deep, even a sacred, regard for councils; inspiration is evident in them. If ever another course has been followed, trouble has followed as surely as night follows day.<br><br>When I was first called as a General Authority, I was serving as an assistant administrator of seminaries and institutes and as a member of the administrative council of BYU. They were kind enough to have a dinner to see me off with Elder Marion G. Romney, representing the board of education, as the speaker.<br><br>President William E. Berrett made a very brief response in which he said that Brother Tuttle (who by then was one of the Seventy) and I had something of a motto. It was "Follow the Brethren." Brother Romney responded with some humor that he was glad for that motto since I already had been given an assignment to assist him. "Now I know that Brother Packer will do everything I tell him to do."<br><br>I was asked to respond. I did not know Brother Romney very well at that time or I should not have said what I did. Nevertheless, I lived to learn that the very intimate relationship I had with him in years to come began that night when I said, "Brother Romney misunderstood! Our motto was 'Follow the<i>Brethren,'</i>not 'Follow the<i>Brother.'"</i>He drew close to me thereafter because I had shown respect for a principle that was precious to him. There is only one "Brother" to follow, and that is our Prophet President. But even he does not act alone, for he has counselors.<br><br>These same principles that govern the function of the presiding councils of the Church work equally well in auxiliary organizations. And they apply to a combination of the two, such as in the board of trustees, where great women endowed with a special credential of insight have full Voice.<br><br>As a trustee, I have, over the years, uniformly referred problems that came individually to me back to the university administration, or to the board, not wanting, as a<i>brother,</i>to assume what belonged to the<i>Brethren.</i>I have generally not even asked for a report, nor have I intervened unless assigned to do so.<br><br>These checks and balances that the Lord intended to operate in his Church are, after all, the safe course. If we are to meet the great challenges now facing this university, we must respect these principles. The Lord said, "I say unto you, be one; and if ye are not one ye are not mine" (D&amp;amp;C 38:27). And, the Lord added:<br><br><i>I give unto you directions how you may act before me, that it may turn to you for your salvation.</i><br><br><i>I, the Lord, am bound when ye do what I say; but when ye do not what I say, ye have no promise.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 82:9–10]<br><br>And, I repeat, "I say unto you, be one; and if ye are not one ye are not mine" (D&amp;amp;C 38:27).<br><h2><b>This Board of Trustees</b></h2><br>Even with all of this, there are those who believe that priesthood and auxiliary leaders are not really qualified to govern a large university. Some have even recommended that an independent board of trustees be organized, made up of specialists or experts representing the professions, business, industry, and government, believing that others would better understand the social, philosophical, technological, and professional issues such as might relate to the administration of a university. They have suggested that such a board, provided with independent sources of finance, would protect the Brethren from their own lack of qualification.<br><br>If career or secular experience is considered to be essential, and I admit it has a place, if that is thought to be indispensable for members of a board, we are not altogether lacking in such qualification. However, we may not put quite the premium on them as others do.<br><br>It may be of interest to you to review some of the career or secular qualifications of those who presently preside over the Church schools and over this university. Since I have gone to some length to explain how we work as a body--as one--I will present something of a composite résumé of the career or secular experience of the trustees of Brigham Young University. While we do not consider such qualifications to be indispensable, some others evidently do.<br><br>Since this is a community of learning, I will list first the academic degrees held by members of the board. Five of the twelve trustees have earned doctor's degrees. One of the five holds both a doctor of medicine degree from the University of Utah and a Ph.D. degree in surgery and physiology from Minnesota. The other doctorates are in law, business administration, and education. The universities represented are Harvard, Chicago, Southwestern, and Brigham Young.<br><br>Four other board members hold master's degrees in agriculture, business, political science, and one in curriculum design (held by one of the women on the board). The schools represented are Iowa State, the University of Utah, and Brigham Young.<br><br>All but one of the others hold either a bachelor of arts or a bachelor of science degree. That one is a homemaker, having devoted herself to helping her husband through medical school and to her family. She brings a dimension to our board that is consummately precious--a perspective that is valued above degrees. This great woman presides over the largest women's organization in the world with a membership of more than 2.75 million women.<br><br>As for scholarship, it ranges from average to Phi Beta Kappa, Phi Kappa Phi. Several degrees were bestowed cum laude (with honor). There is magna cum laude, summa cum laude, and, as with me and you, if by chance you graduate, "Thank you, Laude."<br><br>As for<i>experience</i>in education, one board member served as executive vice president of the University of Utah; another was professor and acting dean of the School of Law at the University of Chicago and was president of Brigham Young University. Another was associate professor of the Graduate School of Business at Stanford University, visiting professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and president of Ricks College. Another is an honorary professor at three universities in Shandong and Shanxi provinces in China and visiting professor at other universities in China as well as at universities in Mexico, Chile, and Uruguay.<br><br>Two have served as Church commissioner of education and one as assistant administrator of seminaries and institutes and on the administrative council at BYU. Four have served on the board of regents that governs all public colleges and universities in the state.<br><br>As for honorary doctorates, I count thirty-three, and I may have missed one or two. It is a little hard to find out. They were bestowed by public and private universities across the nation in humanities, letters, law, science, medical science, public service, and other fields.<br><br>Board members have received honors, awards, fellows, and distinguished alumni from universities, prestigious societies, professional and scholastic organizations. There are honorary citizen and other awards from community, state, and national governments, including one from the government of Argentina. It would take pages even to list them.<br><br>Board members have given public service to community, state, and nation. The chairman of the board of trustees served for eight years in the president's cabinet. Several have served on select or advisory committees to the White House and to departments of the federal government. One was chairman of the board of the Public Broadcasting System. Some members have served in state senates, one as a justice on the state supreme court, others on city councils. The list of service on governors' select committees; committees for constitution revision, for selection of judges and other public servants; commissions; boards; advisory committees; foundations; trusts; and other community, state, and regional organizations is far too long to list here.<br><br>And, of current interest and importance, there is one other category of experience of members of your board of trustees: that is service in the military. Included on this list is a marine corporal, a combat infantry staff sergeant, an army medical officer and an army artillery officer, a field officer and bomber pilot in the air force, and two who served in the navy. President Benson was in the ROTC at Utah State when World War I ended.<br><br>In our free enterprise system, board members have been both employer and employed and have been owners, chairmen, directors, officers, and managers of corporations and have owned and do own stock in business and industry, as all citizens have a right to do. For instance, at the time of his call to the Twelve, one member of the board was serving on twenty-six corporate boards. Some are a little puzzled that such service has continued after their call, thinking it a little too worldly for Church leaders. But such service contributes valuable experience and serves other very important interests of the Church. We are caught between those who think we are not in touch with the world and those who think our keeping in touch with it is somehow wrong. Keep in mind the system of lay clergy the Lord established. We are commanded to remain<i>in</i>the world but not to be<i>of</i>the world.<br><br>At present, 1,711 institutes of religion enroll members in sixty-two countries, and there are seminaries in ninety countries. In addition, we operate twenty-six elementary, middle, or secondary schools about the world. During just the last one year, members of the board have traveled in forty-six countries. Many of the countries have seen more than one board member. Besides the main countries you might expect on the list are Swaziland, Lesotho, the Soviet Union, Estonia, Romania, Hungary, Bulgaria, the People's Republic of China, and many others.<br><br>We do not go as tourists. We meet with church, educational, community, and government leaders and, of far more importance, we meet with the rank and file of the people. We gain a knowledge of "things which are abroad; the wars and perplexities of the nations, and the judgments which are on the land; and a knowledge also of countries and of kingdoms" (D&amp;amp;C 88:79). There is not a body of twelve people anywhere on this earth who travel as broadly and as constantly as members of this board of trustees. Should a problem arise virtually anywhere on earth, one of us has been there recently.<br><br>Members of the board hold in common their ordinary beginnings. They came from homes, as you did, where their parents sent them away to school, often at great sacrifice, with encouragement to apply themselves so that they could be of service one day to their families, the community, and the Church. One became an agricultural agent, another a secretary, one a printer, two became lawyers, one a lumberman, another a hardware merchant, three became teachers, one a surgeon, one an accountant, and one a homemaker.<br><br>Were I to add the education, travel, and career qualifications of the other six members of the Twelve who do not presently serve on the board of trustees, it would increase this report proportionally.<br><br>Now, all of these things are<i>never, absolutely never, talked of or even mentioned in our circles.</i>In thirty years, I have never heard one conversation on all of that which I have just reviewed for you. I risk being scolded for even mentioning them here. I know that most of you, too, do not consider these secular or career achievements as being overruling in their consequence, but there are those who do. They feel we may not understand the mysteries of the world of academia and therefore are not fully qualified to set policy, standards, and direction for a university. For them, perhaps these things needed to be said.<br><br>There are other qualifications on which we do set higher premium. While secular achievements deserve and receive our respect, as indicated by what we have done in those fields, they are not those on which we place the<i>highest</i>value. Those of higher value relate to the qualities of character that establish a balance in education and have to do with moral stability.<br><br>We know the method of learning associated with the workings of the Spirit. We treasure the gift of the Holy Ghost that has been conferred upon every member of the Church and that can influence others who are seeking the truth. We know the voice of the Lord when he speaks. We know the processes of revelation and how to teach them to those who want to learn. These qualifications we<i>do</i>talk about constantly and strive ever to measure up to them.<br><h2><b>"By Study and Also by Faith"</b></h2><br>Now listen carefully! It is crucial that you understand what I tell you now. There is danger! Church-sponsored universities are an endangered species--nearly extinct now. Recently the administration of Baylor University announced that it was severing ties with the Baptist Church, which founded it 145 years ago. Other Baptist schools--Furman, Mercer, and Wake Forest--are going through the same process. They join Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Chicago, Columbia, and a long, long list of others--other universities that have severed ties from the churches that founded and financed them.<br><br>Last month's journal of the New York-based Institute on Religion in Public Life was devoted to the de-Christianizing of American universities. I quote from their editorial entitled "The Death of Religious Higher Education."<br><br><i>The beginning of wisdom on this subject is to recognize that the road to the unhappy present was indeed paved with good intentions. To be sure, there were relevant parties who made no secret of their hostility to religion. But, for the most part, the schools that lost, or are losing, their sense of religious purpose, sincerely sought nothing more than a greater measure of "excellence." The problem is that they accepted, uncritically, definitions of excellence that were indifferent to, or even implicitly hostile to, the great concerns of religion. Few university presidents or department chairmen up and decided one day that they wanted to rid their institutions of the embarrassment of religion. It may reasonably be surmised that most believed that they were advancing a religious mission by helping their schools become like other schools--or at least more like the "best" of other schools. The language of academic excellence is powerfully seductive.</i>["The Death of Religious Higher Education,"<i>First Things,</i>January 1991, p. 8]<br><br>If we succeed in keeping BYU in faith with the founders, we will do something very few others have done. Our best protection is to ensure that the prerogatives of this unique board of trustees are neither diluted nor ignored. Boards of education, trustees, and regents are venerable and indispensable institutions in education in the free world. They are not to be taken lightly. Theirs, and theirs alone, is the right to establish policies and set standards under which administrators, faculties, and students are to function--standards of both conduct and of excellence.<br><br>It is not unusual for highly trained professionals to smart under the necessity of working under a lay board whose members may not be as highly educated as they consider themselves to be. But the future of education in the free world, and of this unique university, depends on safeguarding the prerogatives of the boards of education.<br><br>The ties between universities and the churches that founded them have been severed because of constantly recurring contention between the spiritual and the temporal; the never-ending controversy between a narrow view of science and religion; the ancient conflict between<i>reason</i>and<i>revelation.</i><br><br>There are two opposing convictions in the university environment. On the one hand,<i>"seeing is believing."</i>On the other,<i>"believing is seeing."</i>Both are true! Each in its place. The combining of the two individually or institutionally is the challenge of life. Neither influence will easily surrender to the other. They may function for a time under some sort of a truce, but the subtle discord is ever present.<br><br>They mix the way oil and water mix--only with constant shaking or stirring. When the stirring stops, they separate again. It takes a catalytic process to blend them. This requires the introduction of a third ingredient, a catalyst, which itself remains unchanged in the blending process.<br><br>Each of us must accommodate the mixture of reason and revelation in our lives. The gospel not only permits but<i>requires</i>it. An individual who concentrates on either side solely and alone will lose both balance and perspective. History confirms that the university environment always favors reason, and the workings of the Spirit are made to feel uncomfortable. I know of no examples to the contrary.<br><br>Spirituality, while consummately strong, reacts to very delicate changes in its environment. To have it present at all and to keep it in some degree of purity requires a commitment and a watch-care that can admit to no embarrassment when compared with what the scholarly world is about.<br><br>The moral and spiritual capacity of the faculty and what they shall give, and the spiritual atmosphere in which students are to learn and what they receive, will not emerge spontaneously! They happen only if they are<i>caused</i>to happen and thereafter maintained with unwavering determination. We at BYU can be competent in both and also merit the respect of those charged with the accreditation of institutions of higher learning.<br><br>Some have envisioned BYU as a great graduate research university as opposed to an undergraduate teaching university. A few years ago the term "the Harvard of the West" was tossed about, and moves were made to recast BYU in that image. But that transformation was not initiated by the board of trustees.<br><br>Recently, lengthy discussions on the future role of BYU have been held between the board of trustees and the administration. They have led in the direction of defining BYU as an "academically selective, teaching-oriented, undergraduate university, offering both liberal arts and occupational degrees, with sufficiently strong graduate programs and research work to be a major university" (Minutes of the Church Board of Education, 7 June 1990).<br><br>When that role is finally defined, it will be determined by the board of trustees, whose fundamental credentials were not bestowed by man and whose right and responsibility it is to determine policy and "approve<i>all</i>proposed changes in basic programs and key personnel" and establish standards for both faculty and students (Minutes of Executive Committee, 27 April 1982).<br><br>I spoke of the catalytic process where two seemingly antagonistic influences can merge and each give strength to the other. The essential catalyst for the fusion of reason and revelation in both student and faculty is the Spirit of Christ. He is "the true light that lighteth every man that cometh into the world" (D&amp;amp;C 93:2). The blending medium is the Holy Ghost, which is conferred upon every member of the Church as a gift.<br><br>The blending of opposites is everywhere present in life. A base metal, fused with a precious one, can produce an alloy stronger and more resilient than either component alone.<br><br>Such a blending is seen in the priesthood of God, ordained to be conferred upon the ordinary man who must live in the base, workaday world where reason and the muscles of his body are the substance of his livelihood. The blending in of revelation will make him anything but ordinary. While such a man must remain<i>in</i>the world, he is not<i>of</i>the world.<br><br>Marriage is the wedding of opposites, the union of the man (who faces the world) with woman (who is often the more refined in spirit). When neither seeks to replace the other, the complementing differences in their nature are fostered. Then, in expressions of love, life itself is conceived, and together they receive a fullness of joy. The fusion of reason and revelation will produce men and women of imperishable worth.<br><br>On the one hand is reason: the thinking, the figuring things out, the research, the pure joy of discovery, and the academic degrees man bestows to honor that process. On the other is revelation, with the very private and very personal, the very individual, confirmation of truth. The combining of them is<i>the</i>test of mortal life!<br><br><i>And the spirit</i>and<i>the body are the soul of man.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 88:15; emphasis added]<br><br><i>For man is spirit. The elements are eternal, and spirit and element, inseparably connected, receive a fulness of joy;</i><br><br><i>And when separated, man cannot receive a fulness of joy. . . .</i><br><br><i>The glory of God</i>is<i>intelligence, or, in other words, light and truth.</i><br><br><i>Light and truth [will] forsake that evil one. . . .</i><br><br>[We are]<i>commanded . . . to bring up</i>[our]<i>children in light and truth.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 93:33–34, 36, 40; emphasis added]<br><br>Now, all of that is but a preface, an introduction, to my message, which I present in two short sentences.<br><br>To you of the administration and faculty, I repeat the counsel given to Dr. Karl G. Maeser by President Brigham Young when he sent him here to start this school: "You ought not to teach even the alphabet or the multiplication tables without the Spirit of God. That is all. God bless you."<br><br>To you students, I quote a revelation to you from the Lord: "As all have not faith, seek ye diligently and teach one another words of wisdom; yea, seek ye out of the best books words of wisdom; seek learning, even by study and also by faith" (D&amp;amp;C 88:118).<br><br>I give to you my sure witness of the Lord and pray that he will protect this great university as together we move into the perilous years ahead. I say this in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Boyd K. Packer was a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when this devotional address was given at Brigham Young University on 12 February 1991.</i><br><br><i>© Intellectual Reserve, Inc.

<h1>to Know China - Dallin H. Oaks - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
At the close of his earthly ministry, our Savior, Jesus Christ, said to his apostles:<br><br><i>Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.</i>[Matthew 28:19]<br><br>Almost everyone in this audience has participated or will participate in the fulfillment of that divine direction. The Church of Jesus Christ is a missionary church. It was so in the beginning, and it is so today in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.<br><br>The most populous nation in the world today is the People's Republic of China. Its 1.1 billion people make up more than 20 percent of the world's population.<br><br>We have many thousands of members of Chinese ancestry in many parts of the world, including over 30,000 in Hong Kong and Taiwan. About 10,000 of our members were born in the People's Republic of China, and many still live in that country.<br><br>The Chinese who are members of our Church make up such a tiny fraction of the total population of the People's Republic of China that we could not really say that we have fulfilled our scriptural duty to teach that nation. This is especially clear when we do not have any missionaries in the People's Republic of China. It is currently against the law to send foreign missionaries to China or to proselyte in that country. And because our Church observes the laws of each nation, we have no plans to send missionaries or to engage in proselyting activities in that great land.<br><br>Today I will speak of the past, the present, and the future of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in the People's Republic of China. I will give special and thankful emphasis to the part that Brigham Young University students and teachers are playing in that great drama.<br><h2><b>A Beginning</b></h2><br>I begin my account in October 1978, when President Spencer W. Kimball gave a great missionary address to the Regional Representatives of the Church. I was then a Regional Representative, and I was also president of BYU. (I pause to note that in October 1978, most of you who are now freshmen at BYU were just entering the first grade. It takes many years to accomplish the purposes of the Lord. That idea has special application to China.)<br><br>President Kimball spoke of our obligation to take the gospel to what he called "the uttermost parts of the earth" (see D&amp;amp;C 58:64). His message was electrifying. No one who was present will ever forget the witness they felt that this was a prophet giving the Lord's message to the leaders and members of his restored Church.<br><br>The prophet pleaded for us to move forward, saying, "It is better for something to be<i>underway</i>than under<i>advisement."</i>He referred to various nations where we had not yet taught the restored gospel. He singled out China for special praise, saying:<br><br><i>By comparison with the widespread breakdown of morality and discipline in the western world, the Chinese are a disciplined, industrious, frugal, closely knit people. Their moral standards are very high by modern western standards. . . . Family life is strong, with old family members still given great respect and care.</i><br><br>I quote just two more sentences from President Kimball's great message:<br><br><i>When we are ready, the Lord will use us for his purposes.</i><br><br><i>There are almost three billion people now living on the earth in nations where the gospel is not now being preached. If we could only make a small beginning in every nation, soon the converts among each kindred and tongue could step forth as lights to their own people and the gospel would thus be preached in all nations before the coming of the Lord.</i><br><br>When I returned from that meeting I asked my assistant, Bruce L. Olsen, to begin planning for a BYU performing group to go to China. That idea was farfetched, because at that time the United States had no diplomatic relations with China, and U.S. tourists were not welcome there. But a prophet had called for beginnings, and this was a beginning BYU could attempt.<br><br>What followed seemed a miracle, even for those with the greatest faith.<br><br>Just two months later, in December 1978, President Jimmy Carter unexpectedly announced that the United States and China would exchange formal diplomatic recognition on the first day of 1979. With that announcement, a BYU trip to China became at least a theoretical possibility--if an invitation could be obtained, if our board of trustees would approve, and if we could figure out what music and dance numbers would be acceptable in that country with which we had so little experience.<br><br>Beyond all of the political and musical questions were a host of technical problems. For example, if a BYU group were invited, could they take their sound and lighting equipment, and, if so, what was the voltage of the power source in the various cities of China, and what kind of connections would be necessary to tap into it?<br><br>Miracle followed miracle. Our friends in Friendship Ambassadors, a group that fostered improved international relations through the performing arts, had close ties with officials in Romania. That nation had close relations with China. China offered to receive a tourist group sent by Romania in February 1979. Romania authorized Friendship Ambassadors to assemble the group, and they invited BYU to send representatives. By these means, Val Lindsay and Ed Blaser went to China on a trip that established our contacts with the China Travel Service, answered most of our technical questions, and gave us valuable insights into what kind of music and dance would be acceptable to Chinese audiences.<br><br>During the first few months of 1979 we began serious but confidential planning about how we could assemble a group with the varied talents that would be required for a first-class variety show. But we could only plan. We could not make any arrangements until we had a formal invitation from our Chinese hosts.<br><br>How would we obtain an invitation? As often happens when we are doing the work of the Lord and the time is right, friends were raised up to assist us. A BYU official had a friend on the island of Guam. As president of a friendship association with China, this businessman had been one of the first Westerners to visit that country. He identified the Chinese officials we should contact to seek an invitation. He also counseled us to enlist the help of prominent U.S. senators. Idaho Senator Frank Church, then chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, wrote Chinese officials on our behalf. His enthusiastic endorsement of BYU was extremely helpful.<br><br>As we kept our plans secret and waited for an invitation, our spirits were touched at the experience of a former BYU student performer. Linda Tang, a Chinese girl from Hong Kong, was working in San Francisco on an internship. As she sat at her desk one day, she had a distinct spiritual impression that she was going to return to BYU and travel to China with the Young Ambassadors. She dismissed the idea as impossible, but the impression kept returning. Several days later, she called Randy Boothe and told him about her impression. When I heard about Linda's experience, I felt reassured that our desires would be realized. I was not surprised when she was later chosen to perform on the trip.<br><br>As I recall, it was late in March or early in April when we received a brief invitation from the China Travel Service. They invited a BYU group to come, but they gave no performance commitments or dates, and they indicated that the group would just be tourists.<br><br>Throwing caution to the winds, we went ahead on faith. By this time, all of our performing groups were committed to other summer tours. Randy Boothe assembled a group of twenty performers by depleting the Lamanite Generation and two Young Ambassador groups. They rushed into the rehearsals necessary to learn the complex choreography and music for a ninety-minute program. They also had to learn enough Chinese to do some of the songs and narration in that language.<br><br>For an account of what happened next, I quote Bruce L. Olsen, the senior university official on the tour:<br><br><i>Four days before the group departed, a telegram arrived from China which told us to bring only simple musical instruments.</i><br><br><i>Although the students had been restricted to one carry-on bag, and our equipment was cut to a bare minimum, we still had over 2,000 pounds of costumes and equipment. Despite the nature of the telegram, we prayerfully decided to move ahead with our plans.</i><br><br><i>Upon arrival in Canton we met our guides, who called a meeting in the International Visitors' Lounge of the airport. I wish you could have seen that gathering. Surrounding a little round table were our tour leaders, Elder James E. Faust of the Council of the Twelve (who, along with Sister Faust, was assigned by President Kimball to accompany us), and the two guides. "Just what do you expect from us?" Miss Wong asked. I remember tightening my stomach muscles and saying, "We hope to do at least one major performance in each city." The guides then questioned us in minute detail about the performance--they wanted to see the music, the lyrics to each song, and to know what the choreography to each number meant. As we moved through the show, Randy would call the students over to give their Chinese narrations or to sing their Chinese songs. Soon the balcony area of the airport was rimmed with Chinese watching this curious performance. At the conclusion, the guides announced that we would perform the next morning at the Peking Minorities Institute.</i><br><br><i>It was clear that this performance was a test. The performance went well, and by the end our Chinese hosts announced that we would be giving another performance in the Red Tower Theater, the most prestigious performance hall in Peking.</i><br><br><i>The next day Miss Wong took Randy aside and told him that a great deal was riding on this concert. She said, "I don't want to alarm the students, but I am very afraid for them." She explained that the artistic elite of Peking would be attending the concert, the symphony orchestra personnel, the ballet, the opera, and the song and dance troupe--in fact, the 1,600 seats would be filled with artistic people. She said that two years ago she was sure that our group would not have been admitted to China and that how the Young Ambassadors were received would decide whether we were invited back or whether other groups would ever be admitted. We called a special meeting to explain the gravity of the situation to the Young Ambassadors and asked them to prepare.</i><br><br><i>It was an uneasy group of students that went on stage the next night, but their faith was great and their talent and hours of practice were rewarded. The audience responded to the performance quickly. Fifteen minutes into the show people were coming backstage telling us that "The important people in the audience are pleased." The audience "oohed" and "aahed" during dance routines and called back the clever number from the musical</i>Shenandoah,<i>"Next to Lovin' I Like Fightin' Best," for three bows and then demanded that after intermission we start our show by doing it again.</i><br><br><i>Prior to leaving for China, we were told not to expect anything but light, polite applause, but this audience demanded four encores and not only gave a standing ovation, but also held their hands high over their heads while clapping. It was the most enthusiastic response I have seen anywhere in the world. It was obvious we had passed the test.</i><br><h2><b>The Miracle of China</b></h2><br>What does all this have to do with teaching the gospel in all nations? When the first LDS missionaries began their work in Great Britain and Europe, they were often going to the countries of their own ancestry, where the laws and customs were similar to those in the United States. That has been the pattern for more than a century. In Europe and in the nations of the Americas, our missionaries have been welcomed or at least tolerated.<br><br>In contrast, in the century ahead, we will knock on the doors of nations with whom we do not have ancestral ties. In addition to differences of language and nationality, we will face barriers of culture and some barriers of hostility from wars or resentments against prior colonial or other repression.<br><br>The laws of some nations, such as China, presently forbid foreign missionaries. In other nations, the laws forbid any proselyting by Christians. Some of those barriers will drop when friendship is cultivated and trust is earned. Other barriers will fall because of the blessings of God, whose work this is. Through his prophet he promised:<br><br><i>If . . . the children of men keep the commandments of God he doth nourish them, and strengthen them, and provide means whereby they can accomplish the thing which he has commanded them.</i>[1 Nephi 17:3]<br><br>I think this is what President Kimball meant when he said:<br><br><i>If we could only make a small beginning in every nation, soon the converts among each kindred and tongue could step forth as lights to their own people and the gospel would thus be preached in all nations before the coming of the Lord.</i><br><br>I think of this as I look at the miracle of China. In 1921 Elder David O. McKay went to China and dedicated that land for the preaching of the gospel of Jesus Christ. In his dedicatory prayer, he pleaded with our Father in Heaven to bless the land of China and its people. Notable among his petitions were these:<br><br><i>May peace and stability be established throughout this republic.</i><br><br><i>Stay the progress of pestilence, and may starvation and untimely death stalk no more through the land.</i><br><br><i>Grant, our Father, that these young men and women may, through upright, virtuous lives, and prayerful study, be prepared and inclined to declare this message of salvation in their own tongue to their fellowmen.</i><br><br>Many of Elder McKay's petitions have now been answered. I was impressed with this when I spoke with an aged Chinese man in Shanghai in the summer of 1980. Through an interpreter he told me that when he was a boy, he saw thousands of his countrymen without shelter or food. He described seeing people on the streets dying of starvation. Now, he said with some pride, he and his wife had a place to live and a pension that provided adequate food. By comparison with my life, his circumstances were meager; by comparison with his life as a youth and the lives of his progenitors, he was prosperous.<br><br>Fifty-eight years after Elder McKay's prayer of dedication, another young apostle, Elder James E. Faust, offered a prayer of rededication. Surrounded by the BYU participants in that first tour to China, in a location close to where the original prayer was offered, he prayed for a fulfillment of the impressive blessings promised upon that great land and its noble people.<br><br>The following year my companion and I were privileged to be in China with the second group of Young Ambassadors to perform in that land. Presiding over that group was Elder Gordon B. Hinckley. The next year, 1981, BYU's American Folk Dancers, forty-two strong, performed in China. They were accompanied by Elder Boyd K. Packer and President Jeffrey R. Holland. Their performances were televised live in China to an estimated audience of 135 million.<br><br>Since that time many other BYU performers have visited China, including the Ballroom Dancers, the Lamanite Generation, the Wind Symphony, and the Chamber Orchestra. In these visits, many ties of friendship have been forged, and much understanding has been gained. We have increased in our understanding of China and its aspirations and problems. For example, of the fifteen men currently serving in the First Presidency and Council of the Twelve, ten have traveled in China, most more than once. Several of us have had in-depth discussions with senior Chinese leaders.<br><br>On their part, Chinese officials have chosen to take a close look at our Church and its leaders and members, here in the United States and in China. For example, Church leaders have met with three Chinese ambassadors to the United States, one of whom visited us in Salt Lake City. We have hosted many Chinese leaders, including the current premier, at BYU--Hawaii and the Polynesian Cultural Center. We have met with a former president of China, with a former vice premier and foreign minister. Scores of other leaders could be mentioned.<br><br>In other important developments of the last decade, temples of the Lord have been dedicated on the continent of Asia (in Korea) and on Taiwan. In Asia we have six stakes of Zion whose membership is predominantly Chinese (in Taiwan and Hong Kong). Chinese people hold key leadership positions in the Church in many other great cities and countries of the world, including Toronto and Victoria in Canada, Melbourne in Australia, Singapore and the Republic of the Philippines in Asia, and in many cities in the United States.<br><br>We cannot send missionaries to the People's Republic of China, but each year China sends thousands of its choicest sons and daughters to various foreign lands to study. In those places they quite naturally meet our missionaries, and many of these Chinese students are joining the Church. Some have already returned to China, and others will return when their studies are completed. We encourage our Chinese members to return to China. Their country needs them in China and the Lord needs them in China. The work of China will go forward with these young engineers, scientists, scholars, and artists. At the same time, the work of the Lord will go forward in a natural law-abiding way because of those who have received the message of the restored gospel. In every land, that message makes its recipients better citizens, better workers, and better friends.<br><h2><b>Furthering Our Ties of Friendship</b></h2><br>Perhaps you have noted that as I have spoken of the nations of the world, I have not spoken about governments or wars or rebellions or political repression. I am aware of all of these things, which occur in many nations. They, of course, affect the timing and manner in which we pursue our divine mandate to teach the gospel of Jesus Christ in all nations. But overarching all of these difficulties and deviations are two great realities of mortal life: (1) the brotherhood of man--all men and women of whatever nation, kindred, tongue, or people; and (2) the Fatherhood of God, who has commanded us to teach the great truths of his gospel in every nation and has promised us that he will "provide means whereby [we] can accomplish the thing which he has commanded [us]" (1 Nephi 17:3).<br><br>Things do not happen rapidly in China. When the impatience of Americans meets the patience of Orientals, patience wins. I believe that in China the Lord will do his own work, and, as he has said in modern scripture, his work will be done "in his own time, and in his own way, and according to his own will" (D&amp;amp;C 88:68).<br><br>In the meantime, we are privileged to be good friends to our Chinese brothers and sisters. In our day that friendship has many forms. I have spoken at length about our BYU performing groups, which were in the vanguard in establishing our friendly relations with the Chinese people and their leaders. Our next and continuing relationship is with the Chinese students and teachers who have left their own country to study in other lands. Many of these are at BYU, in Provo, and in Hawaii. Others are at the Polynesian Cultural Center, where they are receiving hands-on experience in the important tourist industry. Other Chinese visitors are becoming acquainted with our Church and its members in hundreds of other locations in North America, Europe, and Asia.<br><br>Many Latter-day Saints are becoming better acquainted with China and its people by living or traveling in that great land. The David M. Kennedy Center here at BYU has arranged for LDS couples and singles to be appointed by various Chinese colleges and institutes to go to China to teach English for a year. These valiant volunteers are doing a great work of brotherly and sisterly service. Many other Latter-day Saints have traveled to China to serve its people. Experts in medicine, agriculture, technology, business, and the arts have generously given service with their heads and hearts and hands. I hope they always introduce themselves as members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints so that their service to China is identified with the Christian mission of their church.<br><br>That was surely true of Dr. Russell M. Nelson. Just after his call to the Council of the Twelve, he fulfilled an earlier commitment to serve for a month as a visiting professor of surgery at Shandong Medical College in Shandong Province, China. There he taught Chinese surgeons the latest techniques of coronary arterial angiography and bypass graft surgery, as he had also done for several years prior to his call. Sister Nelson taught English classes for the medical students. Their efforts are a model for Latter-day Saints who have opportunities for service in China or other countries of the world.<br><br>We have also sent books to libraries in China. We have arranged for microfilming of official and family records. And we have sent assistance to the victims of a devastating earthquake.<br><br>Each year there are new examples of coincidences--I call them miracles--that further our ties and our friendship with China and its people. I will give only one example, this from 1990.<br><br>Exactly a year ago this month, Elder and Sister William L. Taylor, missionaries laboring in the Ireland Dublin Mission, received an invitation to go to China as the guests of the Chinese People's Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries. They were invited because of something that happened in China forty-five years earlier. High-ranking Chinese officials learned about them through the father of a Chinese woman Elder and Sister Taylor had met in Ireland. When the mission president told me the circumstances, I approved their leaving the mission field to accept this invitation. I cautioned them that out of respect for China's laws, they should not go to China as missionaries, but as friends who would simply seek to increase understanding between our peoples.<br><br>William Taylor was working on Wake Island as a civilian contractor in 1941. In the initial weeks of World War II, he was taken prisoner by the Japanese. He spent three and a half years in a Japanese prison camp near Shanghai, China. In May 1945, he escaped while being transferred north toward Beijing by train. Eluding his pursuers and suffering many hardships as he made his way across China, Brother Taylor eventually found his way to the Communist-led Eighth Route Army. After about two months with these friendly forces, he was taken to Yenan. There, Brother Taylor met Mao Ze-dong, who told him that he was the only foreign prisoner of war who had ever made a successful escape in North China. The two had their photograph taken together.<br><br>Forty-five years later that photograph, shown to a Chinese contact in Ireland, produced the invitation that took Elder and Sister Taylor to China. In China they were entertained for seventeen days in Shanghai, Chongqing, Xi'an, Yenan, and Beijing, where they were hosted at a banquet in the Great Hall of the People. There they met a distinguished Chinese leader who had been foreign minister of China. Through that contact by a faithful Latter-day Saint man, Church leaders have been able to meet with this high-ranking man and further the ties of friendship between our church and the People's Republic of China.<br><br>As a footnote to this remarkable account, I should add that the story of William Taylor's meeting with Mao Ze-dong is probably the first story ever featured in both our<i>Church News</i>(7 July 1990, p. 6) and in the Chinese government's<i>Beijing Review</i>(28 January 1991, p. 33). I hope it will not be the last.<br><br>People sometimes ask me about what can be done to "open China." In response, I state my belief that China is already "open"--it is we who are closed. We are closed because we expect the Orient to be the same as the West, China to be the same as Canada or Chile. We must open our minds and our hearts to the people of this ancient realm and this magnificent culture. We must understand their way of thinking, their aspirations, and their impressive accomplishments. We must observe their laws and follow their example of patience. We must deserve to be their friends.<br><br>As we become friends of China, and as we learn from them, our Father in Heaven, who has made "all nations of men . . . and [has] determined . . . the bounds of their habitation" (Acts 17:26), will bring his purposes to pass in that great nation "in his own time, and in his own way, and according to his own will" (D&amp;amp;C 88:68).<br><br>The Lord has said, "I am able to do mine own work" (2 Nephi 27:20). He is doing that work all over the world as walls crumble and as old prejudices are readjusted. He is doing his work in China, and we who think we are important actors are often no more than admiring spectators. The work of the Lord will go forward. We will soon see the fulfillment of the Book of Mormon prophecy that "the Lord doth grant unto all nations, of their own nation and tongue, to teach his word, yea, in wisdom, all that he seeth fit that they should have" (Alma 29:8).<br><br>I testify of the truthfulness of that promise and of the optimism with which we look forward to continuing associations and to mutual blessings with our great friends in the People's Republic of China. This is the church of Jesus Christ. He is our Savior. Of that I testify as I ask the blessings of the Lord upon each of us in this great work, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Dallin H.

<h1> Him All Things Hold Together&quot; - Neal A. Maxwell - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I wish to talk about your unfinished journey. It is the journey of journeys and will be described quite differently this Easter night. It is an arduous journey. The trek awaits--whether one is rich or poor, short or tall, thin or fat, black or white or brown, old or young, shy or bold, married or single, a prodigal or an ever faithful. Compared to this journey, all other treks are but a brief walk in a mortal park or are merely time on a telestial treadmill.<br><h2><b>Becoming Men and Women of Christ</b></h2><br>Your journey is embodied in an invitation from the resurrected Lord, who himself inquired, "What manner of men [and women] ought ye to be?" Then he directed, "Verily I say unto you, <i>even as I am" </i>(3 Nephi 27:27; emphasis added). Making this journey qualifies us eventually as the men and women of Christ.<br><br>Confirming this developmental goal, the Prophet Joseph Smith declared, "If you wish to go where God is, you must be like God, or possess the principles which God possesses" (<i>Teachings, </i>p. 216). Peter, likewise, spoke of the manner of persons we ought to be in all godliness (see 2 Peter 3:11).<br><br>The scriptures provide the road map for this journey because it is the word of God that will lead the men and women of Christ in a straight and narrow course and land their immortal souls at the right hand of God (see Helaman 3:29–30).<br><br>Jesus, our guide and model, had a perfect guide and model himself:<br><br><i>Then answered Jesus and said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, The Son can do nothing of himself, but what he seeth the Father do: for what things soever he doeth, these also doeth the Son likewise. </i>[John 5:19]<br><br>Just what Jesus saw "the Father do," including premortally, we do not know, but Jesus was the perfect pupil and he had a Perfect Teacher!<br><br>Each of us is at a particular point in the journey, having "come thus far." However, if we are deflected from this journey, we will, instead, become estranged from Christ:<br><br><i>For how knoweth a man the master whom he has not served, and who is a stranger unto him, and is far from the thoughts and intents of his heart? </i>[Mosiah 5:13]<br><br>If we are not <i>serving </i>Jesus, and if he is not in our <i>thoughts </i>and <i>hearts, </i>then the things of the world will draw us instead to them! Moreover, the things of the world need not be sinister in order to be diverting and consuming.<br><br>For the serious disciple, the cardinal attributes exemplified by Jesus are not optional. These developmental milestones take the form of traits, traits that mark the trail to be traveled. After all, should not Latter-day Saints have a special interest in what is required to become a Saint, virtue by virtue and quality by quality? Hear the words of King Benjamin:<br><br><i>And becometh a saint . . . </i>submissive, meek, humble, patient, full of love, willing to submit <i>to all things which the Lord seeth fit to inflict upon him. </i>[Mosiah 3:19; emphasis added]<br><br>These attributes are <i>eternal </i>and <i>portable! </i>Being portable, to the degree developed, they will go with us through the veil of death, and still later they will rise with us in the Resurrection when all else stays behind. Meanwhile, so much of our time is ironically devoted to learning and marketing perishable skills that will soon become obsolete. It isn't just the morticians who will have a vocational crisis in the next world, brother and sisters. Please note several additions to these key qualities:<br><br><i>And now I would that ye should be humble, and be submissive and gentle; </i>easy to be entreated; <i>full of patience and </i>long-suffering; <i>being </i>temperate <i>in all things. </i>[Alma 7:23; emphasis added]<br><br>Unsurprisingly, the disciple's way of using power and authority will reflect these same qualities, for he is to lead by <i>persuasion, long-suffering, gentleness, meekness, love unfeigned, and kindness </i>(see D&amp;amp;C 121:41–42). Such should be our leadership style. It is certainly Jesus'!<br><br>Numerous other scriptures describe the same, small cluster of spiritual qualities that the men and women of Christ are to strive to achieve in their lives. When significantly developed, these qualities will convey the added "authority of example"! When you and I have seen that authority, we are filled with admiration for it.<br><br>Since Christ also declared, "If ye love me, keep my commandments" (John 14:15), clear and specific obligations clearly rest upon us, especially when we ponder this next commandment, which, if we love him, we will strive to keep: "Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect" (Matthew 5:48).<br><br>The Greek rendering for "perfect" is, by the way, "complete, finished, fully developed." After his atonement and resurrection, Jesus included himself as our pattern. "Therefore I would that ye should be perfect even as I, or your Father who is in heaven is perfect" (3 Nephi 12:48). One of the problems we have in the Church is that we consider perfection in abstraction, and it becomes too intimidating. But when we think of it in terms of the specific, cardinal attributes, and we strive to develop these in a steady process of self-improvement, it is quite a different matter.<br><br>Ponder this ancient self-description with its focus on attributes:<br><br><i>And the Lord passed by before him, and proclaimed, The Lord, The Lord God, merciful and </i>gracious, <i>long suffering, and abundant in </i>goodness <i>and </i>truth. [Exodus 34:6; emphasis added]<br><br>When Jesus visited his hometown, the people wondered at his gracious words (see Luke 4:22). What is enjoined upon us is thus very specific. The specific qualities are made clear again and again in the scriptures. So is our need to follow the developmental path:<br><br><i>For I have given you an example, that ye should do as I have done to you. </i>[John 13:15]<br><br><i>And again, it showeth unto the children of men the straitness of the path, and the narrowness of the gate, by which they should enter, he having set the example before them. </i>[2 Nephi 31:9]<br><br>These qualities are not only developmental destinations, but, meanwhile, if developed significantly, they also provide us with the balance urgently needed for traveling on the demanding narrow path! It is so easy to fall off one side or the other!<br><br>The divine direction is clear: "Behold I am the light; I have set an example for you" (3 Nephi 18:16).<br><br>Too often when we seek to excuse ourselves, it is, ironically, "the natural man" we are excusing. Yet scriptures inform us "the natural man" is to be "put off" (see Mosiah 3:19). "He" certainly should not be "kept on" because of a mistaken sense that the natural man constitutes our individuality.<br><br>In this process, substance and style interplay constantly--more than we realize! How, for instance, can we be like the Father and Son if we are poor listeners? How can we become "even as [Jesus] is" if we are impatient or proud?<br><br>The gospel gives proportion as to both substance and style. For example, it is far more important to be morally clean rather than to be a clean-desk individual. Similarly, it is better to "speak the truth in love," as Paul counsels, than it is to simply speak the truth (see Ephesians 4:15).<br><br>These scriptural virtues are intertwined, interactive, and interdependent. We are to be:<br><br>1. Meek and humble--not self-concerned, dismissive, proud, seeking ascendancy. Blessed are the meek because they are not easily offended. Besides, those who "shine as lights in the world" have no need to seek the spotlight! (See Philippians 2:15.) The world's spotlights are not only fleeting, but they employ inferior light!<br><br>2. Patient--not hectic, hurried, pushy.<br><br>3. Full of love--not demanding, dominating, manipulative, condescending, or harsh.<br><br>4. Gentle--not coarse, brusque, and vindictive.<br><br>5. Easily entreated--not unapproachable, inaccessible, and nonlistening.<br><br>6. Long-suffering--not impatient, disinterested, curt, easily offended. There are so many people in the Church, brothers and sisters, waiting to be offended. And it doesn't take long. If one has a chip on his or her shoulder, you can't make it through the foyer, so to speak, without getting it knocked off.<br><br>7. Submissive to God--not resistant to the Spirit, counsel, and life's lessons.<br><br>8. Temperate (self-restrained)--not egoistic, eager for attention and recognition, or too talkative. In your life and mine, the great moments of commendation and correction have come usually in one-liners.<br><br>9. Merciful--not judgmental and unforgiving. Blessed are the merciful, for they shall know the caress of causality as their forgiving mercy restores others to wholeness! Though God is perfected in the attributes of justice and mercy, we read that, finally, "Mercy overpowereth justice" (Alma 34:15).<br><br>10. Gracious--not tactless, easily irritated, ungenerous.<br><br>11. Holy--not worldly.<br><br>As we think about the process of becoming the men and women of Christ, questions may naturally arise, such as: "Will all the men and women of Christ be alike in every respect?" "Will there be a loss of individuality?" I think not. For instance, the quality of meekness is clearly essential, but there are many individual ways of expressing meekness. Furthermore, what we now defensively regard as constituting individuality is likely to be significantly refined.<br><br>An immense developmental clue is to be found in these next words: "Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me" (Matthew 11:29). By being yoked, we can best learn of Jesus' perfected qualities, though only in our comparatively small ways. If we are meek, through our smaller but similar experiences we will come to appreciate Jesus' perfected qualities even more. Then our <i>adoration </i>of him produces a desire for <i>emulation </i>of him.<br><br>The Prophet Joseph, whose own life was lived in a crescendo of self-improvement amid adversity, observed:<br><br><i>The nearer man approaches perfection, the clearer are his views, and the greater his enjoyments, till he has overcome the evils of his life and lost every desire for sin; and like the ancients, </i>[he] <i>arrives at that point of faith where he is wrapped in the power and glory of his Maker and is caught up to dwell with Him. But we consider that this is a station to which no man ever arrived in a moment</i>. [<i>Teachings, </i>p. 51]<br><br>The clearer one's views, the more one sees "things as they really are," the greater the happiness!<br><br>Thus, beyond the free gift of immortality, "working out our salvation" includes "working out" the development of these eternal virtues in our lives!<br><br>Given the tremendous importance of these virtues now and in the world to come, should we be surprised if, to hasten the process, the Lord gives us, individually, the relevant and necessary clinical experiences? We do not usually seek these, however. Yet they seem to come, don't they, even when we do not remember having signed up for a particular course? Sometimes we find ourselves enrolled again in the same course. Apparently we were only auditing before; perhaps this time it can be for credit!<br><br>Emerson pleaded, "Give me truths: for I am weary of the surfaces" ("Blight," in <i>The Complete Writings of Ralph Waldo Emerson </i>[New York: Wm. H. Wise &amp;amp; Co., 1929], p. 874). While amid so much that is inane, and while surrounded by so many little and superficial things, it is only in the bright light of the restored gospel that we can see the truth as to who we really are and what our possibilities are! As Jacob wrote, we not only see things as they really are, but as they really will be (see Jacob 4:13).<br><br>The Lord loves each of us too much to merely let us go on being what we now are, for he knows what we have the possibility to become!<br><br>It is all part of the journey of going home. Developmentally, we are all prodigals. When we really "come to" ourselves, spiritually, we, too, will say with determination, "I will arise and go to my father" (Luke 15:18).<br><br>This true celebration of the risen Lord of Easter, therefore, is one of emulation as well as of adoration for him. Since he is risen from the grave, let us not be dead as to the things of the Spirit! How can we celebrate the empty tomb with empty lives? How can we celebrate his victory over death by being defeated by the world?<br><h2><b>The Infinite Atonement</b></h2><br>May I now speak further of Jesus, of the Resurrection, and of the Atonement?<br><br>Christ's death and resurrection were specifically foretold in a multitude of scriptures, including this from Isaiah.<br><br><i>Thy dead men shall live, together with my dead body shall they arise. . . . and the earth shall cast out the dead. </i>[Isaiah 26:19]<br><br>Ponder how that prophesy was later dramatically fulfilled as recorded by Matthew:<br><br><i>And the graves were opened; and many bodies of the saints which slept arose,</i><br><br><i>And came out of the graves after his resurrection, and went into the holy city, and appeared unto many. </i>[Matthew 27:52–53]<br><br>As signified by Jesus' personal resurrection and the recognition of him by friends, immortality is not merely being one droplet in some floating sea of cosmic consciousness! Resurrection is not being a mere molecule in an unremembering cloud of drifting molecules! His resurrection was personal and recognizable. So will ours be! Did not the resurrected ancients go into Jerusalem and appear unto many?<br><br>Oh, how we adore Jesus for his atonement! For his free gift of immortality to all! Consider for a moment, how would we regard Christ without the reality of his atonement and resurrection? How would we regard the Sermon on the Mount without the resurrection of the sermon giver <i>and </i>eventually all of us? Without the reality of God's plan of salvation and Jesus' atonement, how could the meek truly inherit the earth? How could the pure in heart really see God? (See Matthew 5.)<br><br>No wonder Paul wrote of Christ, "in him all things hold together" (Revised Standard Version, Colossians 1:17). When, collectively or individually, brothers and sisters, things seem to fly apart for us at times, what fitting imagery: "In him all things hold together"! Given the centrality of the doctrine of resurrection, the Restoration has as one of its main purposes to witness not only of Jesus' resurrection, but that of all mankind.<br><br><i>And righteousness will I send down out of heaven; and truth will I send forth out of the earth, to bear testimony of mine Only Begotten; his resurrection from the dead; yea, and also the resurrection of all men. </i>[Moses 7:62]<br><br>There are so many ways in which Christ holds all things together. In fact, scriptures further advise, "all things bear record of me" (Moses 6:63).<br><br>At Christmastime, for instance, we celebrate a special star that announced Jesus' birth at Bethlehem. Thus, the so-called "little star of Bethlehem" was actually very large in its declaration of divine design! It had to have been placed in its precise orbit long, long before it shone so precisely! Persuasive divine design is underscored in what the Lord has said: "All things must come to pass in their time" (D&amp;amp;C 64:32). His overseeing precision pertains not only to astrophysical orbits but to human orbits as well. This is such a stunning thing for us to contemplate as to our obligations to "shine as lights" within our own orbits and personal responsibilities! (See Philippians 2:15.)<br><br>In Jesus there is a unique blend of both meekness and majesty. Though the Lord of the Universe, Christ was meekly willing to live in this world, which he created under the Father's direction. In Paul's words, he agreed to reside on earth as a person of no reputation (see Philippians 2:7).<br><br>We sing of his birth, "The stars in the heavens looked down where he lay" ("Away in a Manger," <i>Hymns, </i>1985, no. 206). The onlooking universe was apparently created by him under the Father's direction, involving "worlds without number" (Moses 1:33). Thus the meek Christ child was cradled not only in a manger but was also cradled in the midst of the majesty of his own creations! Even the least of these, when we contemplate the heavens, permits us to see God "moving in his majesty and power" (D&amp;amp;C 88:47). Do we not sing of "All the worlds thy hands have made"? (See "How Great Thou Art," <i>Hymns, </i>1985<i>, </i>no. 86.)<br><br>In the Eastern Hemisphere, the special star that signaled his meek birth was recognized by only a few shepherds and several wise men. However, when Christ comes in majesty and power, the sign of his second coming will be such that "all people shall see it together" (D&amp;amp;C 88:93). He declares "all flesh shall see me together" (D&amp;amp;C 101:23). What an impending moment of unparalleled majesty for the Millennial Messiah. Yet it was preceded by the meekness of his Mortal Messiahship.<br><br>He created worlds, yet he was regarded as merely being a carpenter's son. He called and inspired Old Testament prophets. Yet Jesus was regarded by some contemporaries in the meridian of time as being less than those very prophets (see Luke 16:29; John 5:45–46; John 8:33, 37–38).<br><br>In his mortal ministry, meek Jesus spoke of how he had yet "other sheep" (John 10:16). Still later, when with those "other sheep" of the Nephite fold, he spoke of still "other sheep" (3 Nephi 16:1–3). How many folds and flocks does he have? We do not know. But there are inklings of his majesty, for "by him, and through him, and of him, the worlds are and were created, and the inhabitants thereof are begotten sons and daughters unto God" (D&amp;amp;C 76:24). Yet this Great and True Shepherd, in meekness, revealed to a solitary Samaritan woman that, indeed, he was the Messiah (see John 4:26; Helaman 15:13).<br><br>Because Jesus was brilliant beyond our comprehension, he knew even premortally, though intellectually, what he was volunteering to do. Yet he had to experience it all personally--especially the awful agony of Gethsemane and Calvary. He who is "more intelligent than they all" is also more meek than they all! (See Abraham 3:19.) He went meekly forward and partook of the most bitter cup--and did so without becoming bitter!<br><br>Jesus descended below all things in order to be able to comprehend all things (see D&amp;amp;C 88:6; 122:8). Thus he is not only a <i>fully atoning </i>Savior but is a <i>fully comprehending </i>Savior as well!<br><br>Christ somehow came to know--just as specifically prophesied--our griefs, sorrows, pains, sicknesses, afflictions, and infirmities (Isaiah 53:4; 2 Nephi 9:21; Mosiah 14:4). He did so, declared Alma, that he might know, according to the flesh, how to succor and to help us in the midst of our infirmities (see Alma 7:11–12).<br><br>Only in restoration scriptures--specifically the Book of Mormon--is Jesus' atonement referred to as the "infinite atonement" (2 Nephi 9:7; 25:16; Alma 34:12).<br><br>It was "infinite" in several dimensions. First, in what is called the "great and last sacrifice," the sacrifice of a mere animal or an imperfect mortal would not do. It required the sacrifice of an <i>infinite being, </i>an eternal and sinless God (see Alma 34:10). Jesus, you will recall, volunteered premortally: "Here am I, send me" (Abraham 3:27). Never has anyone offered to do so much for so many with so few words! As an infinite being, Jesus had the unique power to put down and take up his life.<br><br>Jesus' atonement also had <i>infinite impact </i>affecting all mankind (see 2 Nephi 25:16). "For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive" (l Corinthians 15:22).<br><br>Third, his atonement involved <i>infinite suffering--</i>suffering beyond our comprehension (see D&amp;amp;C 19:18). I will note especially some of his suffering.<br><br>The Atonement fulfills many prophesies. Jesus was to be spat upon (see 1 Nephi 19:9), struck, scourged (see Mosiah 3:9). He would be given vinegar and gall (see Psalms 69:21). He would issue a soul cry, the very words of which were prophesied by David in a Messianic psalm (see Psalms 22:1; Matthew 27:46). None of his bones was to be broken (see Psalms 34:20).<br><br>We begin to see in the scriptures the weight of the Atonement burdening him shortly before Gethsemane and Calvary:<br><br><i>Now is my soul troubled; and what shall I say? Father, save me from this hour: but for this cause came I unto this hour. </i>[John 12:27]<br><br>The full weight fell upon him when he entered the Garden of Gethsemane, where he "fell on the ground" (Mark 14:33–36). At one point in the process an angel appeared to strengthen him (see Luke 22:43). The keenest of all intellects to ever grace this planet endured sufferings that were worse than even he, with his unexcelled brilliance, had ever imagined. Hence he was "sore amazed" or, in the Greek, "astonished," "awestruck" (Mark 14:33). He became "very heavy," which, in the Greek means, "depressed and dejected."<br><br>When in the garden, he issued "the Abba cry" (Mark 14:36; Psalms 22:1). It was the most intimate, familial cry of a child in the deepest of distress for his father.<br><br>All the cumulative weight of our sins--the whole human family--fell upon him. He, and he alone, bore them! Thus he is able to say, "I have overcome and have trodden the wine-press alone, even the wine-press of the fierceness of the wrath of Almighty God" (D&amp;amp;C 76:107; 88:106). This would include all the penalties that a God who cannot look upon sin with the least degree of allowance would require (see D&amp;amp;C 1:31). Could there be any wrath more fierce than divine wrath? Especially as Jesus encountered cumulative, mortal grossness including the vilest of all human sins? Jesus bore them.<br><br>Indeed, Christ was alone, for "there was none with me" (Isaiah 63:3; D&amp;amp;C 133:50). His astonishing, personal triumph was complete. Yet he who premortally had promised he would give glory to our Father kept that promise, saying after accomplishing the Atonement, "Nevertheless, glory be to the Father" (D&amp;amp;C 19:19; Moses 4:2).<br><br>Several years ago, Christian physicians, writing in the <i>Journal of American Medicine, </i>indicated they felt that, because of the loss of blood when he was scourged, Jesus would have been in serious, if not critical condition before he ever carried a portion of his cross to Calvary. Other scholars say Jesus was likely scourged with a Roman flagellum, something similar to a cat-o'-nine-tails with metallic objects at the end of each thong. If he assumed the usual posture for scourging, it would have been kneeling over before his scourger so that the muscles of his back were tensed and thus more easily torn and shredded. He would have lost much blood in addition to what he lost earlier while bleeding from every pore in Gethsemane.<br><br>No wonder he needed help to carry the cross!<br><br>Jesus bore all mortal sins, mankind's cumulative total. Thus Jesus, of his suffering, truly could later say that "he descended below all things" (D&amp;amp;C 88:6).<br><br>The requirements of divine justice were severe. According to Elder James Talmage, in order "that the supreme sacrifice of the Son might be consummated in all its fulness, the Father seems to have withdrawn the support of His immediate Presence [while Jesus was on the cross], leaving to the Savior of men the glory of complete victory over the forces of sin and death" <i>(Jesus the Christ, </i>3rd ed. [Salt Lake City: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 1916], p. 661). What an awful and awesome aloneness! What deprivation, especially after the special and extended closeness of Father and Son!<br><br>On the cross, there came from Christ the soul-rending cry, "My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?" (Matthew 27:46; see also Psalms 22:1). What awful aloneness! Is it possible that Jesus needed to suffer and experience aloneness not only so his personal triumph would be total, but also so that he might "know according to the flesh" how it is for us to feel forsaken? (See Alma 7:11–12.) In any case, he felt forsaken and alone.<br><br>Compared to his feeling forsaken, what are our occasional feelings of being forsaken and alone? Or our feelings of being unnoticed and unappreciated? Or our deprivations?<br><br>All this emptying agony preceded the empty tomb, which signified the glorious resurrection. In his comments after the awful atonement, he uses words like "sore" and "exquisite." Jesus tells us that he suffered "both body and spirit" (D&amp;amp;C 19:18–19). He does not even mention having been spat upon, struck, receiving vinegar and gall, being scourged, etc. He does say that he trembled because of pain and would that he might not shrink, that he might not fail to partake fully of the bitter cup and finish the Atonement (see D&amp;amp;C 19:18). As already indicated, he partook of the bitter cup and did so without becoming bitter! Mercifully for all of us, he did not shrink!<br><br><i>And behold, I am the light and the life of the world; and I have drunk out of that bitter cup which the Father hath given me, and have glorified the Father in taking upon me the sins of the world, in the which I have suffered the will of the Father in all things from the beginning. </i>[3 Nephi 11:11]<br><br><i>I have overcome and have trodden the winepress alone, even the wine-press of the fierceness of the wrath of Almighty God. </i>[D&amp;amp;C 76:107]<br><br>Thus he became our <i>fully comprehending </i>and <i>fully atoning </i>Savior. No wonder we sing of him, <i>"How great thou art!"</i> (<i>Hymns, </i>1985, no. 86).<br><br>Why did he do it?<br><br><i>And the world, because of their iniquity, shall judge him to be a thing of naught; wherefore they scourge him, and he suffereth it; and they smite him, and he suffereth it. Yea, they spit upon him, and he suffereth it, because of his </i>loving kindness <i>and his long-suffering towards the children of men. </i>[1 Nephi 19:9; emphasis added]<br><br>Ponder the term <i>loving-kindness. </i>It is a special word, used in David's plea after he sinned so grievously:<br><br><i>Have mercy upon me, </i>O <i>God, according to thy </i>loving kindness: <i>according unto the multitude of thy tender mercies blot out my transgressions. </i>[Psalms 51:1; emphasis added]<br><br>Hold that special word in your minds as I read in conclusion these verses about his coming majesty:<br><br><i>And it shall be said: Who is this that cometh down from God in heaven with dyed garments; yea, from the regions which are not known, clothed in his glorious apparel, traveling in the greatness of his strength? . . .</i><br><br><i>And the Lord shall be red in his apparel, and his garments like him that treadeth in the winevat.</i><br><br><i>And so great shall be the glory of his presence that the sun shall hide his face in shame, and the moon shall withhold its light, and the stars shall be hurled from their places.</i><br><br><i>And his voice shall be heard: I have trodden the wine-press alone, and have brought judgment upon all people; and none were with me;</i><br><br><i>And now the year of my redeemed is come; and they shall mention the </i>loving kindness <i>of their Lord, and all that he has bestowed upon them according to his goodness, and according to his </i>loving kindness,<i> forever and ever. </i>[D&amp;amp;C 133:46, 48–50, 52; emphasis added]<br><br>Blessed be the Father for his loving-kindness in giving his Only Begotten as Our Redeemer! We do not know, nor could we appreciate if we did, the feelings of the Father as he watched his firstborn go through the Atonement. How great our Father is. Blessed be the Son, Jesus Christ, for his loving-kindness in atoning for our sins. I "scarce can take it in" ("How Great Thou Art"). Whenever you and I witness and experience in a human being impressive loving-kindness, we marvel--and we should marvel. But such highly developed loving-kindness is still not closely comparable to Jesus' loving-kindness. So it is with each of his qualities about which I have spoken tonight. When we are fortunate enough to experience the stirring samples of likeness, these are real and wonderful experiences, but they are not yet fullness. They are not yet the fullness found in Jesus. Even so, he of fullness clearly and kindly beckons us to develop that greater likeness in our lives which precedes fullness. It is that likeness that will give us the light in our lives so that we might, as Paul says, "shine as lights in the world." These are the attributes that convey to us the added authority of example. And as we emulate him, by developing likeness in these attributes, he will bless us and magnify us for his purposes.<br><br>My quorum president, President Howard W. Hunter, said twenty-six years ago in April general conference, "He loves the Lord with all his heart, who loves nothing in comparison of him and nothing but in reference to him."<br><br>As one of his special witnesses, I testify to you tonight that he is risen. And how marvelous it is, even given the great distance of the trek spoken of earlier, that he beckons us to develop this likeness so that one day we may have fullness with him. It is the journey of journeys. Nothing else is even remotely comparable to it in its importance. There is nothing in comparison of him. Indeed, as Paul said, "in Christ all things hold together."<br><br>That is my witness to you on this Easter night, the reality of his mercy, the genuineness of his loving-kindness. He has said to us, "What manner of men [and women] ought ye to be? Verily I say unto you, even as I am" (3 Nephi 27:27). What an invitation! That invitation verifies the possibility of its realization.<br><br>I salute you for who you are, but, more important, for what you have the possibilities to become. There is none like him. And as he has said to us in the marvelous imagery of holy scriptures, "I wait for you with open arms." But it is we who must go to him in this journey of journeys.<br><br>Finally, I witness to you the reality of the great Atonement. It is the central act of all human history. Nothing else even remotely approaches it in terms of significance. The meek Jesus says: "Here am I, send me." Jesus will come in majesty, and we will hail him for his loving-kindness. If we love him, we must so love one another.<br><br>He is risen, and the symbol of Christianity might well be the empty tomb that bespeaks the fullness of the great Atonement of which I testify to you tonight in love and in appreciation and in recognition of who you really are. I bear this witness to you humbly, lovingly, but, most important, in the holy name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Neal A.

<h1>I Have Somewhat to Say unto Thee”: Judgment and Condemnation in the Parables of Jesus - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
<i>Then drew near unto him all the publicans and sinners for to hear him.</i><br><br><i>And the Pharisees and scribes murmured, saying, This man receiveth sinners, and eateth with them.</i><br><br><i>And he spake this parable unto them, saying,</i><br><br><i>What man of you, having an hundred sheep, if he lose one of them, doth not leave the ninety and nine . . . and go after that which is lost, until he find it?</i><br><br><i>And when he hath found it, he layeth it on his shoulders, rejoicing.</i><br><br><i>And when he cometh home, he calleth together his friends and neighbours, saying unto them, Rejoice with me; for I have found my sheep which was lost.</i><br><br><i>I say unto you, that likewise joy shall be in heaven over one sinner that repenteth, more than over ninety and nine just persons, which need no repentance.</i>[Luke 15:1–7]<br><br>For his purposes in this parable, the Lord divides us into three groups: shepherds, sinners, and "just persons who need no repentance." Surely he speaks with some exaggeration here, for excepting himself, the Good Shepherd, we all--shepherds and just persons--are sinners alike. In some ways, in fact, the Lord seems in this parable to speak not from his own perceptions, but from our perceptions of ourselves. We tend to place sin in categories, to rank it as greater or lesser, and then to see ourselves as better or worse, depending on which sins we commit. Thus, the flexible nature of parable form allows us to identify with shepherd, with lost sheep, or with the ninety and nine.<br><h2><b>"Rejoice with Me"</b></h2><br>Today I address these remarks to the ninety and nine, or rather to those among us who, for instance, attend church even in good weather; go visiting or home teaching even in bad weather; not only bake cookies for the ill, depressed, or lonely, but try to bake them with love; all the while working to keep harmony in our homes.<br><br>If you find yourself even temporarily in this group, I would direct your attention once again to verses 6 and 7 of Luke, chapter 15.<br><br><i>And when he cometh home, he calleth together his friends and neighbours, saying unto them, Rejoice with me; for I have found my sheep which was lost.</i><br><br><i>I say unto you, that likewise joy shall be in heaven over one sinner that repenteth, more than over ninety and nine just persons, which need no repentance.</i><br><br>Two ideas emerge from these verses: that the shepherd anticipates his friends' excitement to be as great as his own over the found sheep, and that the heavens do not rejoice as much over ninety-nine continually faithful people as they do over one repentant sinner. The emphasis God places in other contexts on keeping the commandments and enduring to the end leads us to suppose that the Lord again exaggerates, though for what purpose he does not explain immediately. But surely it cannot have escaped him that such an exaggerated statement would make us feel uncomfortable--or more specifically, ignored, undervalued, and consequently angry. But instead of softening his language, he restates the concepts again in the next parable, this time ignoring completely the faithful ninety-nine:<br><br><i>Either what woman having ten pieces of silver, if she lose one piece, doth not light a candle, and sweep the house, and seek diligently till she find it?</i><br><br><i>And when she hath found it, she calleth her friends and her neighbours together, saying, Rejoice with me; for I have found the piece which I had lost.</i><br><br><i>Likewise, I say unto you, there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner that repenteth.</i>[Luke 15:8–10]<br><br>Immediately following this we receive what we have come to call the parable of the prodigal son. In the context of rejoicing over sinners repentant, it seems entirely appropriate that we call it this, thus focusing on the father's joy at the return of his no-longer-wayward son and his complete willingness to reintegrate the son back into the family without further thought for his past sins. As the context of Luke, chapter 15, suggests, surely this is one aspect of the parable. It joyfully reminds us that at the center of all our faith sits the Savior's atoning blood that can wash us as free from sin as if we had never committed it: "though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool" (Isaiah 1:18); "Behold, he who has repented of his sins, the same is forgiven, and I, the Lord, remember them no more" (D&amp;amp;C 58:42). However, calling this the parable of the prodigal son may lead us to forget that the story concerns two sons, not just one.<br><br>Unlike the earlier parables of the lost sheep and coin, the Lord chose not to end this story with the prodigal's happy homecoming. Instead, he complicates its interpretation by focusing in the latter half of the parable on the elder son, who complains about the mercy extended to his younger brother.<br><br>The literary nature of parable form invites ambiguity and multiple interpretation. Thus its meaning is flexible and unfixed, and our interpretations must rely on thorough reading under the guidance of the Holy Spirit. We have all had the experience of finding new meaning in a familiar scripture; frequently parables go even beyond this and mean more than one thing at the same time. The elder brother in this parable is a case in point. As many scriptural scholars--Elder Talmage among them--have suggested, on one level this elder son represents the Elder Son, the spiritual Firstborn and Only Begotten of the Father. He alone can say to his Father as this son says to his, "Lo, these many years do I serve thee, neither transgressed I at any time thy commandment." And to him alone can the Father reply, "Son, thou art ever with me" (Luke 15:29, 31). Reading the elder son in this context, it seems entirely appropriate that the father should promise him all his inheritance and make no further mention of reward for the younger son.<br><br>But on another level the elder son must represent not the Savior, but us, or at least some of us. Surely we cannot imagine the Lord who atoned for our sins complaining when the Father grants us mercy. Rather, in this context the plaintive whining of the parable's elder son sounds somewhat like me, and perhaps like you:<br><br><i>Now his elder son was in the field: and as he came and drew nigh to the house, he heard musick and dancing.</i><br><br><i>And he called one of the servants, and asked</i><br><br><i>what these things meant.</i><br><br><i>And he said unto him, Thy brother is come; and thy father hath killed the fatted calf, because he hath received him safe and sound.</i><br><br><i>And he was angry, and would not go in: therefore came his father out, and intreated him.</i><br><br><i>And he answering said to his father, Lo, these many years do I serve thee, neither transgressed I at any time thy commandment: and yet thou never gavest me a kid, that I might make merry with my friends:</i><br><br><i>But as soon as this thy son was come, which hath devoured thy living with harlots, thou hast killed for him the fatted calf.</i>[Luke 15:25–30]<br><br>Several things stand out in this passage. For one thing, the father wants the elder son to share his joy in the younger son's return; he wants it enough to leave the party and go plead with him to come in. For another thing, the elder son judges the sins of the younger son by making them explicit. In verse 13 of the King James translation we learn that the younger son "wasted his substance with riotous living"; in the mouth of his brother this becomes "hath devoured thy living with harlots" (v. 30). And finally, he distances himself from the former prodigal by calling him "this thy son," rather than "this my brother."<br><br>The father's response is instructive. He does not remind the elder son of his own sins, but instead acknowledges his faithful continuance: "Son, thou art ever with me, and all that I have is thine" (v. 31). But he does, gently but undeniably, rebuke the son's unkindness: "It was meet [necessary, appropriate] that we should make merry, and be glad: for this thy brother was dead, and is alive again; and was lost, and is found" (v. 32). The rebuke comes most clearly, I think, in his reminder of the young man's relationship to the other: "this thy brother was dead, and is alive again"--not "this my son," but, "this thy brother." The elder son should rejoice not simply because someone his father loves has returned, but because of his own intimate link with another soul.<br><h2><b>The Lord's Rebuke</b></h2><br>Let us turn now to a familiar episode in the Lord's life, recorded in Luke, chapter 10, verses 38–42:<br><br><i>Now it came to pass, as they went, that he entered into a certain village: and a certain woman named Martha received him into her house.</i><br><br><i>And she had a sister called Mary, which also sat at Jesus' feet, and heard his word.</i><br><br><i>But Martha was cumbered about much serving, and came to him, and said, Lord, dost thou not care that my sister hath left me to serve alone? bid her therefore that she help me.</i><br><br><i>And Jesus answered and said unto her, Martha, Martha, thou art careful and troubled about many things:</i><br><br><i>But one thing is needful: and Mary hath chosen that good part, which shall not be taken away from her.</i><br><br>Those of us with more of Martha than of Mary in us have long felt that this rebuke is unjust. While we do not doubt the overriding importance of listening to the Lord, does the listening have to be done during dinner preparations? Would it have hurt Mary to have joined us in serving, then we all could have sat down to hear the Lord together? And furthermore, what about the value of our work in the world? If it weren't for us Marthas cleaning whatever we see and fussing over meals, there would be a lot of dirty, hungry people in this world. We may not live by bread alone, but I've never known anyone to live without it. Why, oh, why couldn't the Lord have said, "You're absolutely right, Martha. What are we thinking of to let you do all this work alone? We'll all help, and by the way, that centerpiece looks lovely"?<br><br>What he did say is difficult to bear, but perhaps somewhat less difficult if we examine its context. In the same way that the father in the parable of the prodigal son acknowledges his elder son's faithfulness, the Lord acknowledges Martha's care: "Martha, Martha, thou art careful and troubled about many things" (v. 41). Then he delivers the gentle but clear rebuke. But the rebuke would not have come had Martha not prompted it. The Lord did not go into the kitchen and tell Martha to stop cooking and come listen. Apparently he was content to let her serve him however she cared to, until she judged another person's service: "Lord, dost thou not care that my sister hath left me to serve alone? bid her therefore that she help me" (v. 40). Martha's self-importance, expressed through her judgment of her sister, occasioned the Lord's rebuke, not her busyness with the meal.<br><br>An instant that crystallizes the Lord's displeasure at our judging others occurs in Luke, chapter 7. One of the Pharisees, Simon, invited the Lord to a meal at his home:<br><br><i>And, behold, a woman in the city, which was a sinner, when she knew that Jesus sat at meat in the Pharisee's house, brought an alabaster box of ointment,</i><br><br><i>And stood at his feet behind him weeping, and began to wash his feet with tears, and did wipe them with the hairs of her head, and kissed his feet, and anointed them with the ointment.</i><br><br><i>Now when the Pharisee which had bidden him saw it, he spake within himself, saying, This man, if he were a prophet, would have known who and what manner of woman this is that toucheth him: for she is a sinner.</i><br><br><i>And Jesus answering said unto him, Simon, I have somewhat to say unto thee. And he saith, Master, say on.</i><br><br><i>There was a certain creditor which had two debtors: the one owed five hundred pence, and the other fifty.</i><br><br><i>And when they had nothing to pay, he frankly forgave them both. Tell me therefore, which of them will love him most?</i><br><br><i>Simon answered and said, I suppose that he, to whom he forgave most. And he said unto him, Thou hast rightly judged.</i><br><br><i>And he turned to the woman, and said unto Simon, Seest thou this woman? I entered into thine house, thou gavest me no water for my feet: but she hath washed my feet with tears, and wiped them with the hairs of her head.</i><br><br><i>Thou gavest me no kiss: but this woman since the time I came in hath not ceased to kiss my feet.</i><br><br><i>My head with oil thou didst not anoint: but this woman hath anointed my feet with ointment.</i><br><br><i>Wherefore I say unto thee, Her sins, which are many, are forgiven; for she loved much: but to whom little is forgiven, the same loveth little.</i>[Luke 7:37–47]<br><br>The Lord could hardly have said anything more disturbing. "Her sins, which are many, are forgiven; for she loved much: but to whom little is forgiven, the same loveth little." The way he has phrased it, the woman loved the Lord much because she needed him much, and it was her sins which created that need. In other words, the greater our sins, the greater our capacity to love? And the fewer our sins, the less we need the Lord, and therefore the less our capacity to love him? This sounds like an even more disturbing version of "joy shall be in heaven over one sinner that repenteth, more than over ninety and nine just persons, which need no repentance" (Luke 15:7).<br><br>We need, as before, to examine the context of the Lord's reply. As the woman begins weeping on her Savior's feet, Simon makes at least two judgments: one, that the woman is a sinner, and two, that Jesus is no prophet or he would know her to be a sinner. Both of these judgments remain unvocalized; Simon speaks them "within himself," not aloud. Interestingly, though, the scriptures continue, "And Jesus answering said unto him" (v. 40). In other words, in a wonderfully ironic demonstration that he was indeed a prophet, the Lord answered Simon's unspoken thought. Further, Simon expected that the Lord should perceive the woman's sins; instead, he perceives and voices Simon's unkindness.<br><br>As we might expect, his rebuke follows the pattern of those we examined earlier. The Lord might have responded as he does in the story of the woman taken in adultery, where he reprimands the crowd for their judgment of the woman by reminding them of their own sins. In both that case and this case the Lord does not argue over the sins of the woman; rather, the issue concerns the onlookers' right to assess--or even to notice--those sins. But this time, as with the elder son in the parable, he acknowledges Simon's at least relatively successful efforts at righteous living by associating him with the debtor who owed less and by suggesting that Simon's sins may indeed be fewer than the woman's. And then, with the exaggerated phrasing we heard in the parables of the lost sheep and coin, he follows this not with praise of "the just person," but with a reaffirmation of his love for the repentant sinner. Again, the rebuke comes after the Pharisee's silent condemnation of both the Savior and the weeping woman; Simon's judgment was no less present for being unspoken. And the Lord's displeasure was no less keen.<br><h2><b>"Judge Not, That Ye Be Not Judged"</b></h2><br>Having established a context of judgment preceding rebuke in these cases, let us return briefly to the parables of the lost sheep and the lost coin in Luke, chapter 15. The first three verses establish the context that prompted them:<br><br><i>Then drew near unto him all the publicans and sinners for to hear him.</i><br><br><i>And the Pharisees and scribes murmured, saying, This man receiveth sinners, and eateth with them.</i><br><br><i>And he spake this parable unto them.</i><br><br>These verses, in fact, establish the context for everything that occurs in chapter 15, including the parable of the prodigal son. Seen in this light, the portion of the parable dealing with the elder son's unkindness becomes central to its interpretation, since the Lord directed the story not only to the publicans and sinners present, but to the scribes and Pharisees who judged them. Thus the message is multiple and complex, leaving no one room for self-satisfaction.<br><br>It would seem then that the Lord meant it when he said,<br><br><i>Judge not, that ye be not judged.</i><br><br><i>For with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged: and with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again.</i>[Matthew 7:1–2]<br><br>In the parables and incidents we have explored, we have seen the Lord return their sharp judgments to the heads of those who made them, so that, quite literally, they were measured by their own standards and found wanting.<br><br>We might note that when the Prophet Joseph Smith reached Matthew, chapter 7, in his translation of the Bible, he changed the wording to "Judge not unrighteously, that ye be not judged: but judge righteous judgment" (JST Matthew 7:1–2). At first glance this seems a liberating change: we need not refrain from judgment, but merely judge righteously. But what constitutes righteous judgment, and who qualifies to make it? Simon, or the elder son? Martha, or the Pharisees, or me, or you? While there are many things we must make judgments about, the sins of another or the state of our own souls in comparison to others seems not to be among them. In his translation of the Sermon at the Temple in 3 Nephi, chapter 14, the Prophet chose to leave the Lord's words as they appear in the King James version of the Sermon on the Mount, "Judge not, that ye be not judged" (v. 1). Luke phrases his version of the passage even more explicitly:<br><br><i>Be ye therefore merciful, as your Father also is merciful.</i><br><br><i>Judge not, and ye shall not be judged: condemn not, and ye shall not be condemned: forgive, and ye shall be forgiven:</i><br><br><i>Give, and it shall be given unto you; good measure, pressed down, and shaken together, and running over, shall men give into your bosom. For with the same measure that ye mete withal it shall be measured to you again.</i>[Luke 6:36–38]<br><br>In the familiar passage that follows, the Lord reiterates his message not to judge by explaining why we should not:<br><br><i>And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye, but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye?</i><br><br><i>Or how wilt thou say to thy brother: Let me pull the mote out of thine eye--and behold, a beam is in thine own eye?</i><br><br><i>Thou hypocrite, first cast the beam out of thine own eye; and then shalt thou see clearly to cast the mote out of thy brother's eye.</i>[3 Nephi 14:3–5]<br><br>In other words, our own sins, no matter how few or seemingly insignificant, disqualify us as judges of other people's sins. If, therefore, we wish to judge our associates, we might wisely observe the Savior's advice to the Nephite Twelve:<br><br><i>And know ye that ye shall be judges of this people, according to the judgment which I shall give unto you, which shall be just. Therefore, what manner of men ought ye to be? Verily, I say unto you, even as I am.</i>[3 Nephi 27:27]<br><br>Here the Lord links judgment with the individual doing the judging, and concludes that only those who are like him can make his judgments. In the meantime, perhaps we would do better to cast ourselves as the repentant prodigal rather than as the elder son and to sit weeping for our own sins at the Lord's feet rather than to look over his shoulder judging another's. That we may do this, I pray, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Catherine Corman Parry was an associate professor of English at BYU when this devotional address was given on 7 May 1991.</i><br><br><i>© Brigham Young University.

<br>
<br>
Once upon a time, in a ward you know, a visitor attended on an average Sunday. It was a happy, pleasant ward, with great diversity. Children, youth, and adults of many ages sat together in sacrament meeting. The building seemed well kept, the leaders well organized, the lessons well taught. The visitor thought as she observed, "What lucky people live in this ward. What a warm, inviting place this must be. They must truly love one another." She decided to come again, not to look but to listen to what these people said about their relationships.<br><br>This is what she heard the next Sunday.<br><br>One Relief Society counselor said to the other, "I've decided our singles bring their problems on themselves. We reach out to them, but they don't respond. Sometimes I wish we didn't have so many in our ward."<br><br>One young adult asked another, "Don't you just hate Relief Society? It is always so boring. The women are all old, and they only talk about married women's stuff."<br><br>A grandmother said to her friend, "I hear they're reorganizing the Primary. I hope they don't call us. We've raised our families. It's the young mothers' turn to work in Primary."<br><br>The Laurel advisor told the Beehive advisor, "Since I have been in Young Women, I feel Relief Society ignores me. They've forgotten those of us who aren't in class every Sunday."<br><br>A recently returned missionary complained to his friend, "The girls in this ward are the worst. Why do they expect me to attend Young Adult activities in this stake when the female population is so bad?"<br><br>The Primary president said to her counselor, "I wish they would quit stealing our best teachers. We just get them trained, and the bishop gives them another calling."<br><br>An elder who taught the gospel doctrine class told the Sunday School president, "These manuals are awful. What is wrong with the people at Church headquarters? Just because some areas of the world are new to the gospel doesn't mean the rest of us should be stuck with these outlines."<br><br>A visiting teacher commented to her friend, "I can't believe the new district they gave me. Two of the women are my friends, and I feel stupid giving them a spiritual message. I don't even know the rest of my district, so I really feel stupid trying to give a spiritual thought to these strangers."<br><br>The Relief Society president said to the bishop, "We work so hard, and the sisters just don't appreciate it. They don't seem interested. They don't even seem to care. I don't feel the sisterhood in the Relief Society I used to feel."<br><br>The visitor left the ward feeling downhearted. "Why?" she mused. "Why do these fine people label each other? Why do I hear so much talk of 'them and us' and so little 'my sister and my brother'? Why do they miss the joy of loving one another?"<br><br>My dear sisters and brothers, I am that visitor, and I have asked those questions many times as I've heard all those comments in wards I've visited this past year. Happily, in those same wards I've heard and seen much of love and rejoicing in the restored gospel. I never return home that I don't thank our Heavenly Father for the good people who populate this earth. But to my dismay, the "them and us" mentality is alive and well, pervasive and limiting.<br><h2><b>Value the Individual</b></h2><br>This way of thinking and talking about each other hurts my soul. I'm concerned about the divisiveness it creates. I'm concerned that so often the Saints inadvertently label others in our ward families as "them," somehow not like "us." Let me share an example of how some of us lapse into "them and us" talk without even realizing it.<br><br>Recently I visited with Relief Society leaders who have many single women in their stake. The Relief Society president began our conversation by saying, "Sister Jack, our single women are a real problem for us." What I noticed immediately was the labeling of all single women as a problem. But this good president did not realize what she had said. She continued, "I feel our singles bring so many of their problems on themselves."<br><br>I asked, "Have you talked with any of your sisters who are single about their problems?"<br><br>She said, "Well, no. Not formally. But the ward presidents bring me reports, and I never feel very warm or good when I speak to them. I don't think they want to speak with me."<br><br>"When have you spoken to these single sisters? Are any of them your friends?" I queried.<br><br>"Not really. I do speak to singles at stake conference or at stake leadership meeting. But, as I said, that's always so unsatisfying," she responded.<br><br>I asked further, "Have you invited any of the singles in leadership positions to discuss their points of view in your meetings so all the sisters might get better acquainted with them?"<br><br>"I have never thought of doing anything like that," she responded.<br><br>My friends, do you get the point? This very conscientious president does not know these sisters as individuals. It's no wonder she calls these sisters "them." Not one of them is her friend. Not one has been asked to participate in a meeting.<br><br>Please consider this point for a moment.<br><br>Think about an experience you've had when your first impression of someone changed dramatically after you got acquainted. Maybe you couldn't stand your spouse when you first met. Perhaps your bishop has become one of your favorite people now that you've served together. In some cases roommates don't start off well--even missionary companions can be a pain on occasion. Yet, sharing experience and conversation can improve the whole world, can't it?<br><br>The Savior told us very directly, "If ye are not one ye are not mine" (D&amp;amp;C 38:27). There are some people I consider to be great souls. In every case these sons and daughters of God value the individual. They make it a point to get to know people--to be "one" with them. Not surprisingly, these great women and men tend to avoid making judgments about others, or putting them in categories by religion, race, gender, marital status, or age. I think both elements--loving others and judging gently--are suggested by the Savior's direction to us. When we do love others, we can become one. When we become one, we can be in the Savior's fold. It sounds so simple. And I know well it can be hard to do. But, it can be done.<br><h2><b>The View from Rameumptom</b></h2><br>For me, one of the most instructive stories in the Book of Mormon is that of Alma the Younger's mission to the Zoramites. In Alma 31 the scripture records:<br><br><i>Alma ... received tidings that the Zoramites were perverting the ways of the Lord, ... his heart again began to sicken because of the iniquity of the people.</i>[v. 1]<br><br><i>And now, as the preaching of the word had a great tendency to lead the people to do that which was just--yea, it had had more powerful effect upon the minds of the people than the sword, or anything else, which had happened unto them--therefore Alma thought it was expedient that they should try the virtue of the word of God.</i>[v. 5]<br><br><i>Now, when they</i>[Alma and his missionary team]<i>had come into the land, behold, to their astonishment they found that the Zoramites had built synagogues, and that they did gather themselves together on one day of the week ... ; and they did worship after a manner which Alma and his brethren had never beheld;</i>[v. 12]<br><br><i>For they had a place built up in the center of their synagogue, a place for standing, which was high above the head; and the top thereof would only admit one person.</i>[v. 13]<br><br><i>Therefore, whosoever desired to worship must go forth and stand upon the top thereof, and stretch forth his hands towards heaven, and cry with a loud voice, saying:</i>[v. 14]<br><br><i>Holy God, we believe that thou hast separated us from our brethren; and we do not believe in the tradition of our brethren ... ; but we believe that thou hast elected us to be thy holy children; and also thou hast made it known unto us that there shall be no Christ.</i>[v. 16]<br><br><i>...and thou hast elected us that we shall be saved, whilst all around us are elected to be cast by thy wrath down to hell; for the which holiness, O God, we thank thee; and we also thank thee that thou hast elected us, that we may not be led away after the foolish traditions of our brethren, which doth bind them down to a belief in Christ.</i>[v. 17]<br><br>Alma responded:<br><br><i>Behold, O God, they cry unto thee, and yet their hearts are swallowed up in their pride. Behold, O God, they cry unto thee with their mouths, while they are puffed up, even to greatness, with the vain things of the world.</i>[v. 27]<br><br><i>O Lord God, how long wilt thou suffer that such wickedness and infidelity shall be among this people?</i>[v. 30]<br><br>Two things strike me about this Rameumptom story.<br><br>1. The Zoramites' prayer was such a complete perversion of the Lord's most central teachings about love. These Zoramites repeated over and over their disbelief in the Savior while they extolled their superiority to their neighbors. It is significant that those two apostate concepts appeared together. First, they claimed no belief in the Savior. Second, they claimed to be apart from and better than those around them.<br><br>2. Alma was so concerned about his Zoramite brethren. He prayed, "O Lord, my heart is exceedingly sorrowful; wilt thou comfort my soul in Christ" (Alma 31:31). Alma brought them the best medicine available to cure their spiritual illness. He brought the word of God.<br><br>One of the reasons I am always so distressed when I hear the Saints talk about "our problems with singles" or "the irresponsible youth of the Church" or "the difficulties with the aged" is that all such comments reflect a distance from the word of God. "Them and us" talk like this distances us from each other, too.<br><br>The Zoramites perverted correct worship by designing "a place for standing" in the "center of their synagogue" (v. 13). While we would never create such a pulpit or entertain their false doctrine, do we inadvertently enter a form of that Rameumptom when we speak of "them and us," as if such artificial designations were in keeping with the Lord's teachings? Do we ignore the word of God by judging each other when we don't even know each other?<br><br>We in Relief Society commonly hold focus groups as we travel. These are informal gatherings that allow us to hear from our sisters throughout the world. We generally sit in a circle and let our sisters tell us what is on their minds and in their hearts. One of our single general board members recently reported the following episode. A sister about the same age as our board member said, "These single women. I am convinced they simply do not want the responsibilities of children. They don't get married because they take all their satisfaction from a paycheck."<br><br>I know well what is in the heart of this board member. No one could want a husband and family more than she. She went up to our sister after the meeting and said, "On behalf of the single women of the Church, I want you to know I'd do anything to have your two children, and I do not take satisfaction from my paycheck." Giving no response, the other sister turned away and started talking to someone else.<br><br>My single friend was wounded and angry. She fumed, "Elaine, what our sister said was so untrue. She must never have talked to a single woman if she thinks that. Why do we make false accusations about each other?"<br><br>It's a good question, isn't it? In fact, it's a lot like Alma's question about the "wickedness and infidelity" of the Zoramites. My friend asked the kind of question that each of us might profitably ask when obvious insensitivity and unkindness inflict pain. Why do we do things like that? I believe that as members of the Church we do not intend to inflict pain on others. I think generally our forays into "them and us" talk and action come because of poor vision.<br><br>In some cases we simply are blind to the feelings of brothers and sisters close to us because we do not share their experience. A woman recently wrote me:<i>As a single adult I feel I have been forgotten. Perhaps you are thinking that I should be more</i><br><br><i>faithful, that by trusting in the Lord I will overcome this feeling of being left out and not being cared about. Deep down inside there is a need in me that is not being filled. When I have spoken with those in leadership positions I am ... forgotten as soon as I have left the room because they are at a loss. I don't think it is intentional. I think they are in a quandary.</i><br><br>Sometimes when we're in a quandary, we don't know what to say or do, so we turn away. Lots of times that is the most hurtful thing we can do. A friend of mine says, "Disagree with me. Speak to me curtly. But don't ignore me." I feel the same way. When I talk with someone else, I can learn. I won't always fully understand. I may not always completely agree. But I will always learn. Sisters and brothers, let us learn from each other by opening our eyes to other perspectives and people.<br><br>Sometimes "them and us" occurs because we lose sight of how good we really are. Then we may climb a step or two up that ladder to the Rameumptom, thinking we'll have a better vista, hence, a clearer view. Instead we may create even greater distance between ourselves and our neighbors. One of the reasons the tragedy of the homeless Kurdish people has been so gripping is that we've all seen so many pictures of the faces of individuals. Those men, women, and children are human beings, our fellow travelers on earth. We feel for each of them as we witness their plight. Think about the difference in your reactions to photos taken from the air of the troops dropping food to those people and the photos taken at ground level of individuals struggling to reach that food. My heart has always been touched by the pictures of the one; the long distance shots of the many are much less personal to me.<br><br>I think the difference is that opportunity to look eye to eye with another person. When we step up that Rameumptom ladder, we lose that blessed chance to look at one person and see who she or he is. Now I know there are challenges to such personal interaction. It can be uncomfortable to be so "up close and personal." In certain cases we just don't see eye to eye or even hear ear to ear with members of our families, let alone members of our wards. And, of course, everywhere there live people who challenge us, sometimes verbally, sometimes emotionally. The temptation can be great to look away when we disagree or feel hurt or don't like what someone says to us. I know. I feel those things, too.<br><br>Yet, the Savior, who loves and understands each of us, teaches, "Look unto me, and be ye saved" (Isaiah 45:22).<br><br>Another reason we lapse into "them and us" is that we may get a little disoriented and look in the wrong direction. The prophet Jacob explained that much of the trouble that came to the Jews was the result of looking at the wrong target. He wrote, "Wherefore, because of their blindness, which blindness came by looking beyond the mark, they must needs fall" (Jacob 4:14). Moses set a fiery serpent upon a pole that the children of Israel who had been bitten by serpents might look upon it and live.<br><br>The solution was so simple. All they had to do was look in the right direction, but not all of them did (see Numbers 21:8).<br><br>This looking and seeing is critical, my brothers and sisters. We can lose spiritual clarity in our vision in lots of ways. Whether we are blind to some experiences and feelings of others, forget how good we are, or look beyond the mark, we are missing the big picture, and no hike up to a Rameumptom erected in honor of "them and us" will refocus our spiritual lenses.<br><br>Remember what the Zoramites said when they climbed to their place alone in the synagogue? We are different and better, and it is a foolish tradition to believe in Christ. What do we say when we start up that same ladder? Things like: "I don't have anything in common with parents of little children" or "I know the Savior said to love everyone, but he didn't know my brother-in-law" or "Roommates are impossible. I've never had a good one."<br><h2><b>"I Say unto You, Be One"</b></h2><br>When we choose to pattern our lives on the Savior's, that is, to really try to love others and to see eye to eye with them, good comes. I recently returned from a trip to Australia and Tahiti. Carol, my general board traveling companion, and I were especially careful to take luggage we could carry on the plane with us. Neither of us could think of anything worse than spending several days waiting for errant bags to catch up with us. When we arrived in Sydney, luggage in hand, we joined the area presidency and their wives for a lunch overlooking beautiful Sydney harbor. We returned to the car to find it had been broken into. Carol's luggage--personal belongings, training materials, books, everything--had been stolen. She was left without purse or scriptures, lipstick, or even a change of shoes. All she had were the clothes on her back. Our fears had been of waiting two days for luggage. Now Carol faced three weeks on the road in Australia without even a toothbrush. This was a problem, especially for Carol.<br><br>She called home to cancel some credit cards and told her family that Wati Martin, the wife of Area President Douglas Martin, had offered to help us get some toiletries and clothes. Wati knew we had only an hour to shop before the first series of meetings. She whisked us to a local mall, took us into the right stores, and in forty minutes Carol had some toiletries, cosmetics, and one new outfit.<br><br>When we got to the Martins' home late that night, Wati went through her own closet, picking out blouses and other items she thought Carol could use. Thanks to her, by the next morning Carol had enough clothes and sundries to get her by and a useful bag in which to carry them. Carol called home the next day to report that things were much improved, and her family in Utah told her that a friend of Wati's had heard about the theft already and called them to say, "Don't worry about Carol. Wati will take care of her." Nothing could have been more correct. Wati took us under her protective, loving wing and cared for our needs. In this case they included all the basics--food, shelter,<i>and</i>clothing.<br><br>Can you imagine how grateful we were to Wati and Elder Martin and to the others who helped us turn a disaster into an experience of love at its best?<br><br>Word does travel fast in the Church. I must also report that by the time we reached Melbourne a sister arrived at the training meeting with a pair of hose for Carol. Women in Alice Springs offered money, and everywhere we went, women assured Carol that they were confident the thieves would benefit from exposure to her scriptures.<br><br>In the weeks since I returned home, I've studied my scriptures, looking for examples of what happens when people live their lives according to our Savior's teachings about love. Let me share a short series of these, so you can hear from the prophets about how these truly converted peoples lived.<br><br><i>And Alma and Amulek went forth preaching repentance to the people....</i><br><br><i>And as many as would hear their words, unto them they did impart the word of God, without any respect of persons, continually.</i><br><br><i>And ... the establishment of the church became general throughout the land, in all the region round about, among all the people of the Nephites.</i><br><br><i>And there was no inequality among them.</i>[Alma 16:13–16]<br><br>The Lamanites who became the Anti-Nephi-Lehites "began to be a righteous people; and they did walk in the ways of the Lord" (Alma 25:14). Ammon reported of them,<br><br><i>We can witness of their sincerity, because of their love towards their brethren and also towards us....</i><br><br><i>...has there been so great love in all the land? Behold, I say unto you, Nay, there has not, even among the Nephites....</i><br><br><i>...And they were also distinguished for their zeal towards God, and also towards men; for they were perfectly honest and upright in all things.</i>[Alma 26:31, 33; 27:27]<br><br>Alma the Elder identified his people as "ye [who] are desirous to come into the fold of God, and to be called his people, and are willing to bear one another's burdens, that they may be light" (Mosiah 18:8).<br><br>Of the people of Alma the scripture records, "And they did walk uprightly before God, imparting to one another both temporally and spiritually according to their needs and their wants" (Mosiah 18:29).<br><br>The Lord called the people of Enoch "Zion, because they were of one heart and one mind, and dwelt in righteousness; and there was no poor among them" (Moses 7:18).<br><br>After the Savior's visit, the people on the American continent "had all things common among them; therefore there were not rich and poor, bond and free, but they were all made free, and partakers of the heavenly gift" (4 Nephi 1:3). Time passed, life went on, yet after one hundred more years had passed away, the scriptures tell us:<br><br><i>And it came to pass that there was no contention in the land, because of the love of God which did dwell in the hearts of the people.</i><br><br><i>...and surely there could not be a happier people among all the people who had been created by the hand of God.</i>[4 Nephi 1:15–16]<br><br>Finally, let me quote more of what I mentioned earlier that the Savior said to us in this dispensation:<br><br><i>And let every man</i>[woman]<i>esteem his</i>[her]<i>brother</i>[sister]<i>as him</i>[her]<i>self, and practice virtue and holiness before me.</i><br><br><i>...I say unto you, be one; and if ye are not one, ye are not mine.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 38:24, 27]<br><br>Do you see a pattern? I do, and I am so grateful for these ideas:<br><br>1. The people of God love him.<br>2. They love each other.<br>3. They are greatly changed by their love.<br>4. They deal justly with one another.<br>5. They hold all things in common.<br>6. They are pure in heart.<br>7. They live peacefully together.<br><br>We could sit together and find dozens of other scriptures that echo these messages. Having heard these words of the prophets and of the Lord himself, can you see why I am so distressed when I hear or witness "them and us" in our language and our treatment of one another? Simply stated, nothing is more destructive to our personal spiritual growth than these small wedges we drive between us--and sometimes into each other.<br><br>How can we clarify our vision and become one?<br><br><b>First,</b>we must take off our blinders. Recently a prominent family in my neighborhood suffered a great tragedy. Their troubled teenage son committed suicide. Under the influence of drugs and alcohol, he apparently sought peace in this desperate way. His fine family felt his loss intensely. Despite an enormous level of effort and outpouring of love to this son throughout his life, his parents agonized, wondering if they'd done everything. His siblings probably wondered the same. Neighbors and friends, in and out of the Church, responded with love, sympathy, and support.<br><br>The family sat together at stake conference just days after this tragic experience. The main speaker, who knew of this incident, gave a long talk about the problems families get into when they spend too much time on Church duties and not enough time with each other. Some members of the congregation visibly winced as they thought of this family and how the message might affect them. Right message. Wrong time. How we wished our speaker had taken off the blinders and seen the needs of our brothers and sisters.<br><br>This same sort of thing can happen in less dramatic ways. A bishop announces that all families are invited to the ward party. A single man living alone might feel less than welcome.<br><br>A Relief Society president invites sisters and their husbands to a special homemaking event. A recent widow withers a little, a newly divorced mother withdraws.<br><br>Sometimes our blinders limit our understanding of others. Sometimes they limit our understanding of ourselves. Recently I visited two of my sons in California. On Saturday night I was sitting in the car with a sleeping grandchild while they took care of some Church business. While I sat there right in front of the ward, I watched a few people walk into the building. I knew a single-adult fireside would begin in about forty-five minutes, so I assumed these early arrivals were in charge of the meeting. A young man walked in alone, and about ten minutes later he walked back out. He had his hands stuffed in his pants pockets and looked very alone. I called to him, "Hey, are you leaving before the meeting starts?"<br><br>He looked quite directly at me and responded, "Does it matter?"<br><br>"Well, yes, it does. I know you've got some guest speakers, and I think you'd enjoy hearing them," I said. I knew that two Relief Society representatives would be speaking at that meeting. I encouraged him to stay and listen to them. "Have you ever heard Sister Okazaki or Sister Clark speak?" I asked.<br><br>"No," he said, "And I won't tonight, either."<br><br>My heart dropped as he walked off. How I wished he could have joined me for a few minutes so I could have learned more of him. How I wished he had felt at home.<br><br>Blinders are good for horses. They keep them looking straight ahead at the road. Blinders are not so good for people, for we must look not only at the road ahead, but also at the sky above and into each other's eyes. My brothers and sisters, please remove your blinders.<br><br>It is not hard. But it does require effort. The great thing about the scriptural examples I just read you is that they are all real, and they point us in the right direction. They tell us why taking the blinders off is so useful; they also tell us how we will know when we've been successful in our efforts to do so. Most of all, they repeat over and over this truth: Love is the greatest teacher of all.<br><br>When Christlike love becomes our main motivator, when we really get serious about truly demonstrating our love for the Lord, good things happen. During this past year I have felt an increased need to learn how to love others. I have prayed many times that the Lord would help me understand the many needs and circumstances of women throughout the whole world. In essence, I've been praying that the Lord would help me remove any blinders. I can testify to you that my prayers have been answered. I am different than I was before I received this calling. I am different now because I see more broadly, I love more profoundly, and I feel gratitude more abundantly. The Lord has been good to me. These insights have not come instantaneously, but they have come as I have applied myself to prayerfully trying to love more and understand better. I continue to pray for greater wisdom and for insight, thanking the Lord all the while for his goodness to each of us.<br><br><b>Second,</b>to clarify our vision, we must think, and then act, inclusively, not exclusively. A Ricks College student recently said to me, "You know, when President Bennion meets you on campus, he treats you like he was your home teacher instead of the president of Ricks." I cannot imagine a nicer tribute. Truly Steve Bennion and so many others know the art of making people feel valued, equal, loved.<br><br>To learn to think and act inclusively requires thoughtfulness and good old common sense. A missionary I know recently wrote his family:<br><br><i>We had a zone conference tonight. It seems that some missionaries from another district have been taking the meetings a little less seriously than other people feel they should. They were openly rebuked for it, and it gave me some thoughts on the relationship we place between the gospel and people. ... It's so easy to notice what other people do wrong and how we would do things differently. Can you imagine how different the world would be if that trend was reversed and if we all noticed the positive of others and set these qualities as our goal to work for rather than comparing ourselves to the negative?</i>[Letter from Elder Adam Wilcox to MarJean Wilcox]<br><br>Yes, Elder Wilcox, I can imagine. In fact, in my fondest dreams we treat each other in the kind ways that heal and soothe the bruises and rebuffs of life. This wise young elder reminds us that if we will acknowledge successes and think of ways to bring everyone in, rather than emphasizing the errors or differences that leave some out, life will be better all around.<br><br>My grandmother used to say, "You can catch more flies with honey than vinegar." I say, "Life ought to be a grand party with everyone sitting around the same round table."<br><br>Our Church experiences together should particularly be sources of happiness and harmony. When we're together, we should feel we belong. How did you feel when you arrived at the last ward party you attended? Did you come alone? Did you dread entering the building because you didn't know who you could sit by? Did you come with another friend? Did you spend the whole time visiting with everyone in the room? Did you leave feeling happy?<br><br>Even our casual experiences together are something to ponder. Do we enter our chapels feeling and thinking inclusively? Do we come to the party ready to help others feel they belong? As we spiritually prepare for our Church assignments, do we ask the Lord to help us understand those we are called to serve? Do we pray to love and understand our family members? Our co-workers? Our neighbors? Our roommates?<br><br>Sisters and brothers, please think--then act--inclusively, that all love may abound among us, despite our weaknesses, mistakes, and spiritual distance from each other.<br><br><b>Third,</b>avoid offense. A friend often quotes me this truth: "She who takes offense when no offense is intended is a fool. He who takes offense when offense is intended is usually a fool."<br><br>The Golden Rule is a much underrated commandment, in my opinion. The Savior said on both continents on which he ministered, "Therefore, all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them, for this is the law and the prophets" (3 Nephi 14:12). This simple injunction could make life happier for thousands. I mean it--you probably deal with thousands of people annually who could be blessed if you took this commandment to heart, head, and tongue.<br><br>Now, to avoid offense, we must be serious about neither giving it nor taking it. We will always have to deal with thoughtless people. Sometimes our own lack of experience makes us insensitive when we would intend to be otherwise. Some days are so busy, and because we're tired or in a hurry, we speak before we think. Unquestionably, opportunities to give and take offense are plentiful.<br><br>I suggest, however, that you never intentionally litter the lives of your associates with offenses. And don't pick up an offense when others drop it. This is your mother speaking: Don't pick it up!<br><br>I know a woman of Mexico who joined the Church, the only person in her family to do so. She subsequently went on a mission, did graduate work at BYU, and took a responsible position in government. To take this job meant a move, so off she went to a new community where she had no friends.<br><br>The first week in her new, suburban, North American, family ward, she introduced herself to the bishop. He promptly responded with a calling to serve in the ward library and with a husband and wife to serve as her home and visiting teachers.<br><br>Because she was so new to the ward, she felt she should have been called to serve in a position that would let her mingle with the ward members. She said nothing to the bishop, but she resented being asked to serve in such an isolated environment as the library. Weeks came and went, and she got angrier and angrier about what she felt was a real slap in the face from an insensitive bishop.<br><br>About the time she got up a good boil about her Church job, her home/ visiting teachers called. They were elderly, the husband explained. They had often come by to visit, but she was never home. He complained that he could never get her on the phone and told her she should have bought an answering machine months ago, if she expected him to ever check on her.<br><br>He continued: His knees were bad--so were his wife's--and they would no longer climb the three flights of stairs to her apartment. If she wanted them to come, she'd have to call them first.<br><br>After that phone conversation, she got up a really fine head of steam. "These Anglos," she thought. "Who do they think they are? First, they shove me in a closet at the ward, then they offend me by expecting me to meet their schedule. I'll show them. I just won't come at all." True to her word, she stopped going to church. All because well-meaning people dropped offense.<br><br>Now she could have disposed of that offense in several ways. She could have picked up the ugly thing and thrown it in the garbage. She could have asked, "What is the intent of their actions and words" before she heated to such a hard boil. She might have stepped over the offense, laughing at the difficulty all of us have sometimes as we try to communicate. She could have explained her needs to the bishop in the first place. She could have chosen a street-level location to meet the home/ visiting teachers. She could have counseled with an understanding friend. She could have stomped and fumed until she was able to turn the heat off and let her feelings simmer down. She could have said, "This is my Church, too, and no one will drive me out of it no matter what they do or say." She could have determined to be more understanding so she never did something similar to others. She could have done a lot of things. Most of all, I wish she had never taken offense in the first place.<br><br>A friend of mine recently came to visit, looking like the loser of a twelve-round prize fight.<br><br>"What is wrong?" I asked, as she burst into tears. The trouble was that one of her neighbors had lambasted her repeatedly over a matter concerning their daughters, who were best friends. It seems my friend's daughter had offended the neighbor's daughter, and the neighbor had marched right over and let my friend have it. What offended her was first being treated as if she were responsible for her daughter's comments and finally being talked to as if she were a child herself.<br><br>My friend said, "Elaine, it's bad enough to have such an unpleasant encounter once, but she won't let it go. She's talked to me four times about the same trouble, even though the girls have forgotten the whole episode. What should I do?"<br><br>My answer: "Bob and weave."<br><br>"What do you mean?" my confused friend asked.<br><br>I suggested, "Don't take offense at this. Isn't this the same neighbor who was so angry when your son cracked her kitchen window with a baseball? He paid for the damage, but she insisted on telling you several times how distressed she was. After she'd vented her feelings, she was fine.<br><br>"She apparently needs to vent when she's angry, and it seems she doesn't get it all out the first time. Just because she needs to say it more than once doesn't mean you have to stand there like a punching bag waiting for her to hit you again. Don't stand there flatfooted--keep moving. Bob and weave like champion prize fighters. They don't just stand in one place when someone approaches with boxing gloves on. They take some initiative, and so should you. Write her a nice note explaining your feelings. Invite them over for a family picnic. Go shopping together. Tell her the next good joke you hear. Bake her some brownies and take them to her while they're still warm. Pour her a nice glass of milk, and when she takes that first mouthful, hurry and explain how much you'd like to be her friend. Then treat her as if she were your best friend. No matter what she does, keep moving. Do what you can, maintain a sense of humor, then let it go."<br><br>Having received this counsel from another friend when I was a young mother, I know it's sound. I share it with all of you. Take initiative, do good, enjoy humor. And, please, avoid offense.<br><br>My friends, "them and us" are not the words the Lord uses to talk about us. He has called us his children, his friends, his sheep, his lambs. He has admonished us to be one with each other, to follow the pattern he and his Father have set for us.<br><br>May we do so. The prophet Isaiah wrote, "They shall see eye to eye when the Lord shall bring again Zion" (3 Nephi 16:18). May we work to see eye to eye, may we become one as we treat and speak of each other as the sons and daughters of God, sisters and brothers in the gospel of Jesus Christ, I pray, in the sacred name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Elaine L. Jack was the Relief Society general president of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when this fireside address was given at Brigham Young University on 2 June 1991.</i><br><br><i>© Intellectual Reserve, Inc.

<h1>Sweet Counsel” - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I appreciate the opportunity to share some ideas with you and would like to invite you to explore with me some ways of applying gospel truth. I prefer to define this process as exploring avenues of application rather than as a mere erudite academic inquiry. The kingdom of God is not a spectator sport. It is an action process requiring learning, commitment, and a special kind of understanding in order to translate truth into action. So I ask<i>you</i>to engage in that process--exploring ways of applying gospel truths.<br><h2><b>Organizations and Relationships</b></h2><br>As a focus for our discussion, I would like to emphasize one important area of gospel truth. Of the many ways to define the purpose of the gospel, let me suggest one for your consideration--the idea of the gospel as a mechanism that (1) defines the meaning of certain organizations, and (2) establishes a set of criteria for quality relationships within those organizations. Now, if this sounds suspiciously close to my academic field, it is. But after all, what else is there besides people behaving, relating, making mistakes, learning, changing, growing?<br><br>We have many scriptures and pronouncements from prophets that emphasize the significance of a series of organizations: the family, the neighborhood, the community, the state, the occupational world, the Church, and, ultimately, the kingdom of heaven. The value of the individual is defined and worth is measured in terms of the quality of the relationships we develop in each of these organizational settings: husband and wife, parent and child, individual and neighbor, individual and community, individual and state, individual and occupational setting, individual and the Church, and, finally, individual and God. The principle and ordinances of the gospel are geared not indirectly, but directly, to teaching us what it takes to develop quality relationships in each of these settings. The degree to which we attain those quality relationships is a determinant of our place in the kingdom of God.<br><h2><b>Counseling with God</b></h2><br>I would like to suggest as a text the book of Psalms, where David, reflecting on the challenge of reconciliation with God, cries and struggles as he attempts to escape the consequences of his behavior. In the Twenty-third Psalm David pleads for solace, peace, safety, and protection, but in the Fifty-fifth Psalm he attempts to redefine his relationship with God. In his appeal, he expresses the wish "Oh that I had wings like a dove! for then would I flyaway, and be at rest" (Psalms 55:6). Of course he found he could not. He couldn't hide. It wasn't like a military encounter, where he could prove himself by leading the armies of Israel. He had to come to terms with himself. He had to accept God's definition of a quality relationship both with others (some of whom he had mistreated) and, most significantly, with God. In so doing, he described God as "a man mine equal"--an interesting term--as an acquaintance, as a guide, as a friend (see Psalms 55:13). Then he used a metaphor that I find extremely compelling. He said, in reference to God, "We took sweet counsel together, and walked unto the house of God in company" (Psalms 55:14).<br><br>In the quest to take sweet counsel with God--or with a friend, superior, subordinate, enemy, student, teacher, parent, or child--what are we describing? What is the nature of this interaction? What do you need to do to prepare yourself to reach that level of sweet counsel in your relationships? Both parties in a reciprocal relationship need to do a series of things in order to have sweet counsel rather than bitter counsel as the criterion of the relationship.<br><br>As I reflect on many of my students over the years, I am not sure that all of them would regard as sweet counsel the responses I gave to papers or to comments in class. I may intend to give sweet counsel, but it doesn't always come out that way. I have tested this empirically with my children, and they do not regard all of my counsel as sweet. My colleagues do not see all of my comments as sweet counsel. Neither does my wife. One time I gave a talk on leadership, and at the conclusion of the talk, an individual who had been in the Ann Arbor ward where I served as bishop came up to me and said, "You talk a lot better than you behave." I have the sweet counsel<i>theory</i>down, but it doesn't always translate into behavior. We need to understand what it takes to apply this important principle. For many of us, that may require some changes.<br><br>Sweet counsel first requires trust. Counsel is never sweet unless a relationship has been developed in advance that identifies the love, the care, the commitment, and the concern that transcends bureaucratic encounters, or that transcends an explosion of anger when something goes wrong. For example, it is not useful to tell people that God is disappointed in their behavior unless they care about God. Until they trust that God's love is something significant and important in their lives, they won't be interested in obeying God's commandments. Unless people have a desire to grow, to learn, and to change--counsel is not sweet. Only when both parties bring to the encounter a commitment to explore feelings honestly is it likely to be sweet counsel.<br><br>The counseling process is often troublesome. Listen to these two scriptures from the Book of Mormon. Jacob wrote, "Wherefore, brethren, seek not to counsel the Lord, but to take counsel from his hand. For behold, ye yourselves know that he counseleth in wisdom, and in justice, and in great mercy" (Jacob 4:10). As Alma was instructing his son Helaman, he said, "Counsel with the Lord in all thy doings" (Alma 37:37). Notice the emphasis: Do not seek to counsel the Lord, but counsel<i>with</i>the Lord. There is a difference.<br><br>We do not receive counsel from God until we are prepared to engage in counsel with him. Do you remember the following plea?<br><br><i>O God, where art thou? And where is the pavilion that covereth thy hiding place?</i><br><br><i>How long shall thy hand be stayed, and thine eye, yea thy pure eye, behold from the eternal heavens the wrongs of thy people and of thy servants, and thine ear be penetrated with their cries?</i><br><br><i>Yea, O Lord, how long shall they suffer these wrongs and unlawful oppressions, before thine heart shall be softened toward them, and thy bowels be moved with compassion toward them?</i>[D&amp;amp;C 121:1–3]<br><br>This was Joseph Smith crying out his honest feelings from Liberty Jail. His cries preceded one of the sweetest, tenderest, and most poignant instructions regarding human relationships and leadership ever given. This was Joseph Smith honestly and emotionally counseling with God--not telling God what he should do in a programmatic sense, but telling God how he felt. God seldom acts without that counsel, without that honest expression of an individual in need.<br><br>Recall Christ's plea: "O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me" (Matthew 26:39). And then his cry: "My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?" (Matthew 27:46). This is not a weak sinner struggling with reconciliation, but rather a perfect individual expressing his feelings. If Christ had those feelings and felt it relevant to express them to God, what are your feelings that must precede the sweet counsel<i>between</i>you and God?<br><br>The preparation for counsel is a process of asking. This is a dynamic, not a passive process. It is not "Lord, what should I do?" or "Who should I marry?" or "What major should I select?" or "Where should we move?" Whenever people have engaged in this type of asking, the response has been rather clear:<br><br><i>Behold, you have not understood; you have supposed that I would give it unto you, when you took no thought save it was to ask me.</i><br><br><i>But, behold, I say unto you, that you must study it out in your mind; then you must ask me if it be right, and if it is right I will cause that your bosom shall burn within you; therefore, you shall feel that it is right.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 9:7–8]<br><br>In this attempt to simply ask for the translation of the Book of Mormon, an important lesson was taught: Revelations don't just follow questions, they follow proposals. They follow proactive behavior on the part of individuals who care enough to study, who care enough to trust, and who care enough to formulate proposals. These people may even ask if "God has forgotten them" or if he has gone to sleep (see Psalms 10:11; 42:9). The issue is to communicate the intensity of the concern and to propose alternative actions.<br><br>Does God need to know how we feel, or do we need to be humble enough to express how we feel? First, we need to determine how we feel. There is no sweet counsel without honest self-examination and assessment. The human mind is a most remarkable instrument of self-deception that may suppress our true feelings. Honest inquiry requires analysis, criticism, perspective, and a genuine statement of feelings. And if it is important to express these feelings to God, who knows us well, it is even more critical to express them to each other.<br><br>We need honest expression, but that only comes after careful self-inquiry and perhaps tears. Almost all revelation starts with a prophet crying unto the Lord, pleading, sometimes criticizing--not telling God what to do, but saying, "God, maybe I don't understand very well. If you understood the situation the way I do, you would surely take action. Help me understand." The difference between counseling God and counseling with God is that when we counsel God, we tell him how he should run the Church or the world. When we counsel<i>with</i>him, we tell him how we feel, and then he responds after we trust him enough to have an honest relationship.<br><h2><b>Counseling with Each Other</b></h2><br>Now, let us move from sweet counsel with God to sweet counsel with each other. In dealing with each other, we can learn many lessons from the way God expects us to deal with him, and from the way he deals with us. The fact that we may not be perfect yet shouldn't deter us from striving for sweet counsel.<br><br>When we deal with each other, however, there are many potential dangers. In Ecclesiastes 8:9 we read, "There is a time wherein one man ruleth over another to his own hurt." There is great danger in a relationship when power is seen only as a means to rule or to gain control. Of the scriptures I read that have foreboding consequences for those who abuse relationships, section 121 of the Doctrine and Covenants is the most poignant for me: "Amen to the priesthood or the authority of that man" (v. 37).<br><br><i>We have learned by sad experience that it is the nature and disposition of almost all men, as soon as they get a little authority, as they suppose, they will immediately begin to exercise unrighteous dominion.</i><br><br><i>Hence many are called, but few are chosen.</i><br><br><i>No power or influence can or ought to be maintained by virtue of the priesthood.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 121:39–41]<br><br>Many are called to serve, to learn, and to grow. Many are given opportunities. Of those many who are called, why are so few chosen? Why do so few avoid the pitfalls and traps that come in relationships as we give bitter counsel, rather than sweet? We all need to carefully consider those situations where our well-intended administrative behavior results in abuse or exploitation. As an example, how many of the following words do you use in describing leadership, authority, power, influence, and management?<br><br><i>• only by persuasion</i><br><i>• long-suffering</i><br><i>• gentleness</i><br><i>• meekness</i><br><i>• love unfeigned</i><br><i>• kindness</i><br><i>• pure knowledge</i><br><i>• without hypocrisy</i><br><i>• without guile</i><br><i>• reproving only when inspired, then showing increasing love</i><br><i>• charity towards all</i><br><i>• virtue garnishing thoughts unceasingly</i><br>[See D&amp;amp;C 121:41–45]<br><br>These are the characteristics that lead to sweet counsel in administrative and personal relationships.<br><br>In the process of trying to develop these characteristics, we can use another analogous word. I think it is fortuitous that we spell "counsel" with an "-sel" and with a "-cil." The Lord's answer to the exploitation that "almost all" will be subject to in administrative and bureaucratic relationships is found in the concept of a council.<br><h2><b>The Concept of a Council</b></h2><br>A council is instituted as the dominant unit of organization in the Church. The highest unit in the Church is referred to very explicitly: the Council of the First Presidency. Councils exist at every organizational level of the Church and, most important, are supposed to exist at the family level as family council.<br><br>Some time ago I was asked to write a section in the new Encyclopedia of Mormonism on councils. I wrote that the concept of a council in the Church is both an administrative unit and a philosophy of administrative behavior. The administrative units are clear: a ward council, a high council, the Council of the Twelve, the First Presidency. If employed properly, councils prevent the exercise of unrighteous dominion. Used as an administrative guideline or principle in church or in any other administrative, leadership, or relationship context, councils prevent bitter counsel and create sweet counsel.<br><br>For example, why did we have a<i>council</i>in heaven? Why did we not just have an assembly or meeting in heaven? Why not have a committee? If God is omniscient, why does he need a council? Consider the following scriptures, which provide a glimpse of divine councils:<br><br>"[Actions are taken] according to that which was ordained in the midst of the Council of the Eternal God of all other gods" (D&amp;amp;C 121:32).<br><br>"And the Gods said among themselves: On the seventh time we will end our work, which we have counseled" (Abraham 5:2).<br><br>"The Gods took counsel among themselves" (Abraham 4:26).<br><br>"And this shall be your business and mission in all your lives, to preside in council" (D&amp;amp;C 90:16).<br><br>The presidency of the high priesthood is the "highest council of the church" (D&amp;amp;C 107:80).<br><br>It is the duty of the president of every priesthood quorum to "sit in council" with members of that quorum (see D&amp;amp;C 107:85–90).<br><br>On one occasion, Church leaders were sent to Missouri to implement a plan for taking care of the poor--a plan necessary for individuals of the Church to achieve salvation. The scripture says, "Let my servant Newel K. Whitney and my servant Joseph Smith, Jun., and my servant Sidney Rigdon sit in council with the saints which are in Zion" (D&amp;amp;C 78:9). The cost of not doing so was that leaders, members, and the Church would fail to achieve their objectives.<br><br>Why did these objectives need to be achieved in a council, rather than in other bureaucratic forms of organization? President Joseph F. Smith stated, "In the midst of counsel there is wisdom" (<i>GD,</i>p. 130). And in his first sermon after being sustained as President of the Church, he said,<br><br><i>I propose that my counselors and fellow presidents in the First Presidency shall share with me in the responsibility of every act which I shall perform in this capacity. I do not propose to take the reins in my own hands and do as I please, but I propose to do as my brethren and I agree, and as the spirit of the Lord manifests to us. . . . The Lord never did intend that one man should have the power</i>. [<i>GD,</i>pp. 176–77]<br><br>The definition of autocracy is a government where all power resides in the sovereign ruler. That ruler may be benevolent, like Benjamin, or evil, like Hitler--but the ruler decides everything. The power resides in the sovereign, in the dictator, in the king.<br><br>In a democracy, power resides in the people. People vote. They may not vote righteously, they may not vote to do the best thing, but the power resides in the people. In a council, the primary means of decision making is not a vote--instructions are explicit, decisions are unanimous. And in a council, rather than power residing in the sovereign ruler or in the voice of the people--<i>power resides in truth.</i>Truth can only be found by an honest exchange of committed people, and when values transcend bottom-line outcomes.<br><br>I think it is interesting that in the Council of Heaven, God listened to alternative proposals and allowed people to choose. I often rhetorically ask the question "If God is such a good teacher and such a good leader, how come he lost a third of his followers?" For those who measure organizational effectiveness in terms of universal attainment of a single standard, I would recommend God as a leader. For him, principle is more important than performance. Freedom of choice and honoring the right of others to speak in the council, even though they may not have supported the plan, was more important than universal salvation. Of course there is an implicit contradiction here, because universal salvation can never be forced. In his councils God taught that the process of honoring every individual and their right to choose, unimpeded by manipulative good intent of obsessive administrators, is of the highest value.<br><br>It is this process that is most important. This higher principle of administration is learned in a council. It is not learned in bureaucracies, in kingdoms, in autocracies, or even in democracies. In councils we learn the correct principle that no one person is good enough to take full responsibility for the decision making or the outcome. But even if one leader does have consistent success, there is another problem. When we take full responsibility for the outcome, and when that outcome is good, there is an arrogance of power that corrupts the process by which future decisions will be made.<br><br>For example, it is never a bishop's ward. It is never a parent's family. Ownership undercuts equality and shared responsibility. Councils teach that we should have honest expression of feelings and not phony facades that seem to conform to a bureaucrat's or leader's definition of goodness. An honest expression of doubt can be made with a reciprocal agreement that those who hear it will honor it and will not punish those struggling to apply truth in a way that may not be shared or understood by others.<br><br>In a council we organize to accomplish objectives. Even if truth is understood by a perfect leader, decisions on implementation are not given by virtue of the truth pronounced. The original decision, understanding of relevant facts, and implementation of assignments must be agreed upon by the people. Those in a council have to verbally and visibly commit themselves to the project or the program that the council chooses. The commitment requires participation, acknowledgment, and action. That does not happen with just an executive pronouncement.<br><br>In research that I did some years ago, I learned that half of the decisions made in the corporate world are never implemented. Some of them are bad decisions and shouldn't be implemented anyway, but some are good decisions that should be carried out. But in the absence of commitment on the part of the implementors, it is an exercise in futility. If there is doubt as to the commitment, then there needs to be understanding and teaching prior to the continuance of the process.<br><br>Another issue deals with the simple decisions of organization. Roles must be assigned, rules delineated, and procedures and criteria for a particular activity decided. In the council setting, people agree that other people are important and everyone must understand what is being decided. Unilateral decision making does not fit a council. It may get things done, but it undercuts God's purposes. We should learn to tolerate those we disagree with, and to honor them, as God demonstrated in his councils. We must learn not to honor sin, but to honor people attempting to understand and apply truth. And in the event of a mistake, we still can learn.<br><br>It is instructive that the most telling and sensitive scriptures follow the most emotionally distraught expressions to God, such as previously mentioned in the hundred and twenty-first section. Karl Barth said, "He who takes the role of counseling must be prepared to be counseled in turn by his brother, otherwise he attempts too much and becomes a lawgiver. That should be reserved to God."<br><br>As we learn the lessons from councils, as we learn that sweet counsel can only be given in a council, as we prepare relationships that enable us to grow and experiment without fear, and as we test without sanction and learn with confidence, we will find ourselves creating organizations that are modeled on God's councils. It is not an easy task; it is a very difficult process. We must learn that principles are more important than control, that honest feelings are more important than smooth facades, and that understanding new information benefits the individual expressing it as well as the receiver.<br><br>By participating in organizations we decide who we are and who we are going to become. If we do not have a council, we increase the risk of becoming victims of the decision-making process, leaving us both cynical and resentful. We will fight back, we will be abused, and will likely abuse others. As leaders and followers, the only protection from these negative side effects is an understanding of the council as a form of organization with sweet counsel as the criterion of interpersonal exchange.<br><h2><b>That We Might Find Sweet Counsel</b></h2><br>In the final analysis, the only things that last, the only things that stay with us throughout eternity, are knowledge and relationships. We especially need knowledge of God's organizations and an awareness of how human organizations can either get in the way or facilitate God's purposes.<br><br>I've been at BYU a long time, and as I look around, I don't always find the ideal of sweet counsel among teachers, students, or administrators. One reason I do not find it is because we are not perfect. But sometimes, I'm afraid, we don't even want it. I hope that we will want God's form of organization and learning--even if we're not quite prepared, even if some of us have short-term explosions that turn the counsel bitter.<br><br>The relationships we develop will only last if they are predicated on the sweet counsel that eliminates the abuse and unrighteous dominion we are warned of. I pray that you and I might find within us the capacity to translate theology and understanding into sweet counsel. In each of the relationships in which we participate--with superiors, with subordinates, in occupational settings, in the university setting, in our homes, and in our church--may we find the way to engage in sweet counsel.<br><br>I bear testimony that it is worth it. I bear testimony that the Church has within it the mechanism to teach and bring us to God; that our leaders, while human, also need support; and that we need to do what we can do both as followers and as leaders to create an environment where, as David cried, we may take sweet counsel together and walk unto the house of God in company. I say this in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>J.

<br>
I am grateful to be with you at the beginning of this education week. It is inspiring to be with so many people who are intent on learning, progressing, and improving. I believe you have discovered the fountain of youth. Roger G. Baker described what I mean when he wrote:<br><br><i>There are some needs that we as humans can satisfy and call it done. We can feel safe with an enjoyable but humble shelter and know that we will have enough food for tomorrow. There are other needs that can never be satisfied. The fact is that the more we get the more we want. When people understand love, the need is never completely satisfied. The more they get the more they give and need to give.</i><br><br><i>Education is a similar human need. Some people find that learning just opens more doors of an insatiable appetite to know. Those who find pleasure in new ideas just keep discovering new ideas. . . .</i><br><br><i>I expect that urge to know is the Fountain of Youth for many people. Those who can get up each day and learn something new and exciting will always be young.</i>[Roger G. Baker,<i>Deseret News,</i>30 June 1991, p. P5]<br><br>I am particularly pleased to address the theme of this education week, "Education: Molding Character." This theme directs us to the true objective of education--the development of godlike characteristics and attributes. What we call<i>character</i>on a worldly level has parallels with what we call<i>faith</i>on a spiritual level. As I speak about character, I would like to point out some of these parallels.<br><h2><b>The Purpose of Life</b></h2><br>The Lord revealed to Joseph Smith that "it is impossible . . . to be saved in ignorance" (D&amp;amp;C 131:6). The education we pursue should free us from the shackles of ignorance so that we can receive the salvation promised by the Lord. The Prophet observed that the great example of a saved being is the Lord Jesus Christ. In the Prophet's words, Jesus "is the prototype or standard of salvation" (Joseph Smith,<i>Lectures on Faith</i>7:9). Since proper education ultimately leads to salvation, we can also say that the Savior is the prototype of an educated person, one whose character has been molded to conform to eternal principles. To be educated, therefore, is to be like Christ.<br><br>A proper education should provide a meaning for life. That meaning should be the fundamental purpose of our existence and should shape the building of our characters. It should be important enough to us to motivate our every action.<br><br>I am impressed with the number of wise men in various fields who have stressed the importance of discovering a meaning for life. For example, Viktor Frankl, a survivor of the Holocaust, stated, "Ever more people today have the means to live, but no meaning to live for" (Viktor Frankl,<i>The Unheard Cry for Meaning</i>[New York: Simon and Schuster, 1978], p. 21). He noted that "The will to meaning is . . . a reliable criterion of mental health. . . . Conversely, lack of meaning and purpose is indicative of emotional maladjustment" (Frankl,<i>Unheard Cry,</i>p. 34). Peters and Waterman stated in their popular book,<i>In Search of Excellence,</i><br><br><i>We find it compelling that so many thinkers from so many fields agree on the dominating need of human beings to find meaning and transcend mundane things.</i>. . .<i>So strong is the need for meaning, in fact, that most people will yield a fair degree of latitude or freedom to institutions that give it to them.</i>[Thomas L. Peters and Robert H. Waterman, Jr.,<i>In Search of Excellence</i>(New York: Harper and Row, 1982), pp. 76–77]<br><br>It is interesting that most of these same authors, while emphasizing the need for meaning, have had no universal meaning to give. Frankl stated, "A logotherapist cannot tell a patient what the meaning is, but he at least can show that<i>there is</i>a meaning in life" (Frankl,<i>Unheard Cry,</i>p. 41). And another author awaits a new faith to provide meaning:<br><br><i>If a new faith is to capture our imagination, it must . . . be a system of beliefs that will marshal our psychic energy toward meaningful goals.</i>[Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi,<i>Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience</i>(New York: Harper and Row, 1990), pp. 238–39]<br><br>The restored gospel is that new faith. I am so grateful for revealed principles that provide eternal meaning for everyone. These principles are based on truth, which is "knowledge of things as they are, and as they were, and as they are to come" (D&amp;amp;C 93:24). The true meaning of life, however, must be accepted on faith, which is "the assurance which men have of the existence of things which they have not seen" (Smith,<i>Lectures on Faith</i>1:9).<br><br>In recent years the Church media have focused on the purpose of life as one of three major themes. A Church videotape,<i>Our Heavenly Father's Plan,</i>explains the plan of happiness. The videotape includes a montage of people pondering the question "What is the purpose of life?" I am always struck by the answers these people give:<br><br>"I'm not sure there is a purpose to life. I have no idea. You tell me."<br><br>"I'm trying to figure it out."<br><br>"I've been trying to figure that out all my life."<br><br>"I'm just living it to live."<br><br>These sentiments are not fabricated. Many people struggle with this question. Let me share a few of the thousands of responses we received from people who viewed this videotape.<br><br>From a young woman: "I believe in God, but I don't understand the pain we experience in our daily lives. I need to understand."<br><br>From a young man: "At this point and time in my life it seems like my world is falling apart. Sometimes I cry myself to sleep at night, wondering, where does it stop? How can I ease the pain?"<br><br>From an inactive member: "After listening to the tape, I had a warm, wonderful feeling deep inside of me. I have been straying away from the Church, and hearing 'I Am a Child of God' again reminded me of why I am here on earth. The purpose of life is to learn to be happy."<br><br>This member has discovered that man is that he might have joy (see 2 Nephi 2:25), and that "happiness is the object and design of our existence" (<i>Teachings,</i>p. 255). Happiness is to be found, however, by pursuing the path that leads to it, which is the path of spiritual education--a path that cannot be walked without effort. When we recognize that God is the source of all knowledge, we will seek to live worthy of having the Holy Spirit with us to guide us to truth.<br><br>Joseph Smith taught:<br><br><i>A person may profit by noticing the first intimation of the spirit of revelation; for instance, when you feel pure intelligence flowing into you, it may give you sudden strokes of ideas, so that by noticing it, you may find it fulfilled the same day or soon; (i.e.) those things that were presented unto your minds by the Spirit of God, will come to pass; and thus by learning the Spirit of God and understanding it,</i>you may grow into the principle of revelation,<i>until you become perfect in Christ Jesus.</i>[<i>Teachings,</i>p. 151; emphasis added]<br><br>Elder John Widtsoe explained:<br><br><i>It is a paradox that men will gladly devote time every day for many years to learn a science or an art; yet will expect to win a knowledge of the gospel, which comprehends all sciences and arts, through perfunctory glances at books or occasional listening to sermons. The gospel should be studied more intensively than any school or college subject. They who pass opinion on the gospel without having given it intimate and careful study are not lovers of truth, and their opinions are worthless.</i>[John A. Widtsoe,<i>Evidences and Reconciliations</i>(Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1943), p. 8]<br><h2><b>The Aim of True Education</b></h2><br>Developing character in harmony with the purpose of life is another great aim of education, and the path to happiness. We must understand the proper objective of education and approach learning with humility, sincerity, spirituality, and a keen desire for truth. President Joseph F. Smith named false educational ideas as one of three dangers that threaten the Church within (see<i>GD,</i>pp. 312–13).<br><br>He also stated that<br><br><i>this knowledge of truth, combined with proper regard for it, and its faithful observance, constitutes true education. The mere stuffing of the mind with a knowledge of facts is not education. The mind must not only possess a knowledge of truth, but the soul must revere it, cherish it, love it as a priceless gem; and this human life must be guided and shaped by it in order to fulfil its destiny. The mind should not only be charged with intelligence, but the soul should be filled with admiration and desire for pure intelligence which comes of a knowledge of the truth. . . .</i><br><br><i>Educate yourself not only for time, but also for eternity.</i>[<i>GD,</i>p. 269]<br><br>President David O. McKay stated:<br><br><i>True education</i>--<i>the education for which the Church stands--is the application of knowledge to the development of a noble and Godlike character. . . .</i><br><br><i>Character is the aim of true education; and science, history, and literature are but means used to accomplish the desired end. Character is not the result of chance work but of continuous</i>right thinking<i>and</i>right acting. [<i>GI,</i>pp. 440–41; emphasis added]<br><br><i>Right thinking,</i>the ability to control our thoughts and direct them into productive channels, is fundamental to a godlike character. The mind is a wonderful thing. Joseph Smith said, "We consider that God has created man with a mind capable of instruction, and a faculty which may be enlarged in proportion to the heed and diligence given to the light communicated from heaven to the intellect" (<i>Teachings,</i>p. 51).<br><br>Note that the mind will be enlarged according to the heed and diligence we give to God's revealed truth. An educated mind is one that can focus attention, and focusing attention is an act of will requiring effort. One writer observed that "attention is an act of will, of work against the inertia of our own minds." He continues,<br><br><i>As Rollo May says, "When we analyze</i>will . . . ,<i>we shall find ourselves pushed back to the level of attention or intention as the seat of will. The effort which goes into the exercise of the will is really effort of attention; the strain in willing is the effort to keep the consciousness clear, i.e., the strain of keeping the attention focused.</i>[M. Scott Peck,<i>The Road Less Traveled</i>(New York: Simon and Schuster, 1978), pp. 120–21; emphasis added]<br><br>Those who have faith in the Lord deliberately expend effort to focus attention on unseen things. As Paul taught, we are to bring "into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ" (2 Corinthians 10:5).<br><br>Orson Hyde, one of the early apostles in this dispensation, taught,<br><br><i>Let the mind be concentrated, and it possesses almighty power. It is the agent of the Almighty clothed with mortal tabernacles, and we must learn to discipline it, and bring it to bear on one point, and not allow the Devil to interfere and confuse it, nor divert it from the great object we have in view</i>. [<i>JD</i>7:153]<br><br>This focus or concentration is captured in these three scriptures from the Doctrine and Covenants:<br><br>"Remain steadfast in your minds" (D&amp;amp;C 84:61).<br><br>"Treasure up in your minds continually the words of life" (D&amp;amp;C 84:85).<br><br>"Sanctify yourselves that your minds become single to God" (D&amp;amp;C 88:68).<br><br>I have observed throughout my life that the great men of the world, especially the great Saints, are always thinking--about the Lord, about others, about how they can serve. Their minds are fertile fields for the seeds of inspiration, and their thoughts naturally spawn actions. This principle is illustrated in a simple story of love that I read recently: An elderly widow gathered some windfall apples, prepared and bottled applesauce, and then presented twelve quarts of applesauce to a young single mother who was depressed because of her struggles. The elderly widow said simply, "I've been thinking about you." The effect on the young single sister was dramatic and miraculous. This act of kindness helped her conquer her depression (see Kathy England, "Quarts of Love,"<i>Ensign,</i>July 1991, p. 40).<br><br>As I observe missionaries, who are dedicating their lives to service, I am struck by how often they fall short of their potential because, as they say, "I didn't think of it." Education disciplines the mind to think, to ponder, to pray; and thus it becomes a receptacle for inspiration.<br><br>The real tragedy of negative emotions and thoughts, such as anger, envy, lust, or fear, is that they dissipate our energy, limiting our ability to experience the power of faith and the gift of charity.<br><br>Right thinking must be translated into<i>right acting.</i>Thomas Henry Huxley reminded us that "the great end of life is not knowledge but action" (<i>Technical Education,</i>1877). Joseph Smith taught that faith is a principle of action as well as a principle of assurance. "It is faith, and faith only, which is the moving cause of all action. . . . And as faith is the moving cause of all action in temporal concerns, so it is in spiritual" (Smith,<i>Lectures on Faith</i>1:10, 12).<br><br>Gaining an assurance of the existence of unseen things is a profoundly satisfying experience. We often refer to this as testimony. But feelings will fade and even die unless they are converted to action. Carlyle said, "Conviction, were it never so excellent, is worthless till it convert itself into Conduct" (Thomas Carlyle, "The Everlasting Yea,"<i>The Victorian Age: Prose, Poetry, and Drama,</i>ed. John Wilson Bowyer and John Lee Brooks [New York: Prentice Hall, 1954], p. 168).<br><br>Similarly, the true test of education comes in how it affects our behavior. Elder William H. Bennett, speaking at an area conference, said:<br><br><i>I have learned a great lesson from the letters of the alphabet. . . . We can repeat them frontwards or backwards, but when we do they have little meaning because they have not been put together with purpose and direction. When we put them together with real purpose and direction the result is sacred hymns, the scriptures, great poetry and prose, wonderful songs, and so on.</i><br><br><i>As it is in the letters of the alphabet, so it is in our lives. . . . Action is important . . . the right kind of action--purposeful action.</i>[William H. Bennett, Tonga Area Conference Report, 1976, p. 15]<br><br>In a classic address on service, President Hugh B. Brown taught:<br><br><i>Every man's religion should have practical issue, not merely emotional responsiveness which delights in hearing the gospel, but lacks diligence in living it. We must remember that religion is action, not diction. Let us pray that God will deliver us from our dullness of conscience, from a feeble sense of duty, from thoughtless disregard of others, and from all half-heartedness in our work. . . .</i><br><br><i>Let everyone get under the load of responsibility, and realize that every doctrine has its associated duty, that every truth has its task. The gospel when the Master first proclaimed it, was not intended primarily for preaching--it was intended for action. . . .</i><br><br><i>No man can truly assimilate Christianity by impression alone, there must be expression as well.</i>[Hugh B. Brown, "Service,"<i>Relief Society Magazine,</i>December 1969, pp. 884, 888]<br><br>Action is a fundamental purpose for our existence and an integral part of our mortal probation. The Book of Mormon teaches this doctrine: "And because that they are redeemed from the fall they have become free forever, knowing good from evil; to<i>act</i>for themselves and not to be acted upon" (2 Nephi 2:26; emphasis added).<br><br>Brigham Young said: "As we grow up we receive strength, knowledge and wisdom, some more and some less; but only by keeping the commands of the Lord Jesus can we have the privilege of knowing the things pertaining to eternity and our relationship to the heavens" (<i>DBY,</i>p. 222).<br><br>Character, the consequence of proper education, is manifest through its influence. Men and women of character see through the mists of conformity and move the world to greater spiritual and moral heights. Character is virtue such as that which went out from Christ to heal all who touched him. It is a commanding presence, a power.<br><br>Faith is<i>character</i>that is matured and adapted to spiritual quests. Joseph Smith taught that "faith is not only the principle of action, but of power also, . . . whether in heaven or on earth" (Smith,<i>Lectures on Faith</i>1:13). An assurance born of the Spirit that is translated into action results in marvelous power--a divine gift, a reward for righteousness. Such power achieves where lesser influences fail or do not even try.<br><br><i>Indeed, the possession of power constitutes the test whereby we can measure and determine the quality and the degree of faith we possess. Our faith consists of the degree of power and influence we have with God our Father whereby we work works of righteousness and do many miraculous things.</i>[Bruce R. McConkie, "Lord, Increase Our Faith,"<i>Brigham Young University Speeches of the Year</i>(Provo, 31 October 1967), p. 3]<br><br>Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote of character:<br><br><i>This is a natural power,</i>[like]<i>light and heat, and all nature cooperates with it. The reason why we feel one man's presence, and do not feel another's, is as simple as gravity. Truth is the summit of being; justice is the application of it to affairs. All individual natures stand in a scale, according to the purity of this element in them. The will of the pure runs down from them into other natures, as water runs down from a higher to a lower vessel.</i>[Ralph Waldo Emerson,<i>Character,</i>1844]<br><br>Ironically, this powerful influence is often quiet and subdued. As the priesthood, it distills upon the soul as the dews from heaven (see D&amp;amp;C 121:45). Emerson also stated, "We shall one day see that the most private is the most public energy, that quality atones for quantity, and grandeur of character acts in the dark, and succors them who never saw it" (Emerson,<i>Character,</i>1844).<br><br>How is such character developed? Education, secular and spiritual, is a necessity. But a higher process of education is suggested by the brochure for this education week. It included this description of the theme:<br><br><i>The skilled hands of the sculptor move deftly over the clay, molding and shaping, bringing the masterpiece to life. So too, people take their experiences in life--what they learn and what they do with what they learn--molding and shaping, bringing to life their own characters.</i>[BYU Campus Education Week brochure, August 1991]<br><br>This description brings to mind images of artistry involving the skills of the teacher and of the learner: creativity, intuition, caring, a vision of the beautiful, experience, work, patience, endurance. All of these qualities and more go into the process of creating the educated person. If our education is to help us conform to the image of Christ, however, our Lord and Savior must be the "author and the finisher of [our] faith" (Moroni 6:4).<br><h2><b>To Become Like Him</b></h2><br>We must voluntarily submit the process of molding and shaping of our characters to our Redeemer, who is, ultimately, the sculptor. As Isaiah suggested, we should learn to say, "But now, O Lord, thou<i>art</i>our father; we<i>are</i>the clay, and thou our potter; and we all<i>are</i>the work of thy hand" (Isaiah 64:8; emphasis added).<br><br>C. S. Lewis frequently taught the need to submit our growth to the will of God. He wrote,<br><br><i>Christ says, "Give me All. I don't want so much of your time and so much of your money and so much of your work: I want You. I have not come to torment your natural self, but to kill it. No half-measures are any good. I don't want to cut off a branch here and a branch there, I want to have the whole tree down. . . . Hand over the whole natural self, all the desires which you think innocent as well as the ones you think wicked--the whole outfit. I will give you a new self instead. In fact, I will give you Myself: my own will shall become yours</i>." [<i>Mere Christianity</i>(New York: Macmillan, 1960), pp. 166–67]<br><br>What a giant leap of faith is required to say, honestly and sincerely, "Lord, I do not want to do what I want to do, I want to do what you want me to do. I want to become what you want me to become." Implied in that statement is all of the effort required for right thinking and right acting, as well as the incomprehensible grace of Christ, without whom we can do nothing. C. S. Lewis also wrote, "There are only two kinds of people in the end: those who say to God, 'Thy will be done,' and those to whom God says, in the end,<i>'Thy</i>will be done'" (<i>The Great Divorce</i>[New York: Macmillan, 1946], p. 72; italics in original).<br><br>If we yield ourselves to the Spirit, subduing the natural man, we can expect rewards.<br><br>The Lord said, "If thou shalt ask, thou shalt receive revelation upon revelation, knowledge upon knowledge, . . . that which bringeth joy, that which bringeth life eternal" (D&amp;amp;C 42:61). The great latter-day scholar Orson Pratt expressed his experience with learning:<br><br><i>There is a joy, a satisfaction, existing in the mind of the righteous man, in the discovery of every additional truth. . . . It matters not how or in what way or manner he obtains this new truth, it is calculated to inspire his heart with joy and happiness.</i>[Orson Pratt,<i>Masterful Discourses and Writings of Orson Pratt</i>(Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1962), p. 523]<br><br>Joy in<i>learning,</i>however, must mature to joy in<i>doing,</i>or it will be short-lived. The seed, which is miraculous in itself, must sprout, grow, and bear fruit, or it will end in itself; it will not reproduce after its kind. Christ defined happiness in terms of doing: "If ye know these things, happy are ye if ye do them" (John 13:17).<br><br>The Book of Mormon states that the Nephites lived after the "manner of happiness" (2 Nephi 5:27).<i>Manner</i>is a characteristic or distinctive way of living or mode of acting.<i>Happiness,</i>or joy, is an attribute developed over time. People have the talent for happiness in varying degrees, but our challenge in this life is to learn to be happy.<br><br>As I mentioned earlier, Joseph Smith said that "happiness is the object and design of our existence."<i>Object</i>in this context means end or goal, and<i>design</i>means a mental project or scheme in which means to an end are laid down; deliberate, purposeful planning; an underlying scheme that governs functioning, developing, or unfolding (see<i>Webster's Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary</i>[Merriam-Webster: Springfield, Massachusetts, 1983], pp. 343, 814).<br><br>Happiness, then, is not only our end goal; it is the path we choose to get there. It is learning to enjoy<i>now</i>the kinds of things that we will enjoy in eternity. Emerson said, "Rectitude is a perpetual victory, celebrated not by cries of joy, but by serenity, which is joy fixed or habitual" (Emerson,<i>Character,</i>1844).<br><br>It is this attribute of happiness that we carry with us in death. The Book of Mormon teaches that when we are raised in the Resurrection, "He that is happy shall be happy still" (Mormon 9:14), and "the righteous shall have a perfect knowledge of their enjoyment" (2 Nephi 9:14). We will be "raised to happiness according to [our desires for] happiness" (Alma 41:5). On the other hand, many will receive a lesser reward because they were "not willing to enjoy that which they might have received" (D&amp;amp;C 88:32).<br><br>God is the embodiment of the attribute of happiness. To be like him is to experience a fulness of joy. If we go contrary to that sacred nature, we go contrary to the nature of happiness (see Alma 41:10–11).<br><br>I remind you that the nature of eternal life is to learn to live the quality of life that God lives.<br><br>Joseph Smith said, "When men begin to live by faith they begin to draw near to God; and when faith is perfected they are like him" (Smith,<i>Lectures on Faith</i>7:8). He also said, "Here, then, is eternal life--to know the only wise and true God; and you have got to learn how to be gods yourselves" (<i>HC</i>6:306).<br><br>And Elder Bruce R. McConkie gave this insightful commentary on John 17:3:<br><br><i>It is one thing to know about God and another to know him. . . . To know God is to think what he thinks, to feel what he feels, to have the power he possesses, to comprehend the truths he understands, and to do what he does. Those who know God become like him, and have his kind of life, which is eternal life.</i>[Bruce R. McConkie,<i>Doctrinal New Testament Commentary</i>(Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1972), 1:762]<br><br>I would emphasize one sentence from Elder McConkie: "We know [him], in the sense of gaining eternal life, when we<i>enjoy and experience</i>the same things [he does]." If our customary mode of acting is in harmony with the nature of God, we will be like him; we will enjoy and experience what he does.<br><br>What is God's characteristic mode of acting? What do we know about the experience of godhood? The Lord answers, "For behold, this is my work and my glory--to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man" (Moses 1:39). Our Father is fully devoted to sharing happiness with his children. Actually, the plan of salvation is referred to by Alma as the "plan of happiness" (see Alma 42:8), adding another dimension to our understanding of that great plan.<br><br>Elder John A. Widtsoe gave us additional insight into the quality of life God lives. He said,<br><br>[Offering salvation]<i>is the Lord's self-imposed duty, this great labor his highest glory. . . . Under the Gospel, what is man's highest ideal? Under the Gospel it must be to become like the Father. If the Lord's concern is chiefly to bring happiness and joy, salvation, to the whole human family, we cannot become like the Father unless we too engage in that work. . . . Likewise, it is man's duty, self-imposed, his pleasure and joy, his labor, and ultimately his glory.</i>[John A. Widtsoe,<i>Utah Genealogical and Historical Magazine,</i>October 1934, 25:189–90]<br><br>Thus, to become like God we must learn to love and enjoy offering salvation to his other children. It must become our characteristic mode of acting.<br><br>As I stated in the beginning, the prototype of a truly educated person is the Lord Jesus Christ. A proper education consists of allowing our Lord and Savior to mold in us a godlike character, habitually attuned to right thinking and right acting. Then, through his grace, we can be like him and his Father, enjoying power and influence now, and eternal life, which is the kind of life God lives, hereafter. This is what the theme of this conference suggests to me: "Education: Molding Character."<br><br>May God bless all of you during this eventful week to examine the meaning of education and to understand what God expects of us as his children that we might return to his presence and share in his glory. I am grateful for this marvelous institution, which provides this opportunity for so many of us to continue our education, and pray that the zeal and desire that we feel here might be carried with us into our everyday lives and reflect in our every activity, that we might truly be found to be disciples of Jesus Christ, which I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Robert L.

<h1>d Dreams of an Even Better Brigham Young University - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
My fellow members of the faculty, I appreciate this opportunity to speak to you for a few minutes as we begin a new academic year. This occasion gives me a chance to reflect for a moment on some of the things that I care most about in my own assignments at the university. I promise not to use all of the 1.5 hours allocated for this meeting, at least in part because I regularly remind myself of the graffiti scribbled by a student on a classroom desk: "If I had but one life to live, I'd spend it in this class because it lasts forever." I promise that this talk won't last forever.<br><br>Earlier in the summer as I was beginning to grapple with the question of what to talk about in this meeting, I came across some lines from<i>The Devil and Daniel Webster</i>(Benét, 1943):<br><br>"You have made great speeches," said the stranger. "You will make more."<br><br>"Ah!" said Daniel Webster.<br><br>"But the last great speech you will make will turn away many of your own against you," said the stranger. "They will call you Ichabod; they will call you other names . . . and their voices shall be loud against you 'til you die."<br><br>"So it is an honest speech, it does not matter what they say," said Daniel Webster.<br><br>I do not aspire to a great speech, but I hope it will qualify as an honest one. If I step on a toe or two, it is done in the spirit of challenging us all to do better. It is also done because I care deeply about the things of which I speak.<br><br>During those times when I have a few quiet moments, I like to think about the kinds of changes I would make in this university so that it might even more completely fulfill all of my expectations of what it might be. If you could create your own ideal university in which to spend this important part of your life, what would it look like? How might it be different than it is now? Let me share with you some of the hopes, dreams, and expectations that would contribute to making Brigham Young University, for me, an even better place than it now is.<br><br>I quickly acknowledge some sense of impotence in talking about the changes I would like to see. My friend and colleague Howard Bahr recently summarized what for him have been the major frustrations that have accumulated over 25 years in academic settings:<br><br>(1) When the powers that be know what's wrong with a system but are afraid to fix it.<br><br>(2) When the powers that be don't know what's wrong with a system and don't try to find out.<br><br>(3) When the powers that be try to fix something that's already working quite well.<br><br>I would probably add a fourth frustration to Howard's list: When the powers that be know what's wrong with a system but are constantly frustrated in their efforts to fix it. Of course, this may simply mean that the powers that be aren't really the powers that be.<br><br>Though more perfect worlds are often difficult to achieve, there are six areas where I would have us focus more of our efforts in order that we might continue the progress that we have observed in recent years. The first states an overarching, more basic goal under which I will address two major issues that are of central importance, I believe, to our effort to climb to higher plateaus. The remaining five, though discussed separately, would also contribute in important ways to the achievement of the first.<br><br>Let me quickly add one other point by way of introduction. Whereas some of the issues that will follow are designed to make us even stronger in the eyes of the world, I am not in any way proposing a secular model for this university. We will continue to do well many of the things the world does, but we must, at the same time, retain the uniqueness that is such an important part of our mission. We will do things our own way, with our own religious values and traditions firmly in place and with our unique culture and history clearly in mind. We will have the character of a great university, but with our definition of greatness including, at its core, the spiritual values that have always been our primary purpose in being.<br><br><i>1. My first wish for us is continued progress and even greater pace in achieving the Mt. Everest status that was prophetically outlined for this institution by President Kimball.</i><br><br>We have become a very good university; we are not yet a great one. We have climbed, I believe, some of the hills that President Kimball described and, having climbed, can glimpse horizons that we didn't even know about a few years ago. There are further horizons that can only be seen as we climb even higher. But, as Todd Britsch recently noted, "We have been asked to<i>become</i>a towering mountain, not just climb one." There is work enough for all of us in achieving this goal. We must reaffirm our commitment to become an even better university than we now are through increasing the excellence of our performance in all that we do.<br><br>I was deeply moved by the tribute that was read this spring at commencement when Jeffrey Holland was awarded an honorary degree. In reminiscing about his work as president of this institution, he observed: "I had one preeminent principle--that cardinal supposition, that consuming vision--that we could be an excellent university, indeed a truly great university, . . . and still be absolutely, unequivocally, forever faithful to the gospel of Jesus Christ. In fact, we would accomplish the one because of the other, never in spite of it."<br><br>This statement from Elder Holland, together with the challenge from President Kimball, has provided for us a well-defined destination. But, recognizing that a destination is not enough, they have also given us guidance in how to get there. It is up to us to stay the course and to increase our effort and commitment to achieve all that is expected of us.<br><br>Mt. Everest status requires a continuing and very substantial infusion of resources, along with wise stewardship in how these resources are managed. We continue to receive strong support from those who have primary responsibility for our direction. In fact, as I will note shortly, when it comes to support, we sit with relative calmness in a troubled sea. We also continue to receive much-needed and much-appreciated assistance from those of our colleagues who work in other parts of the university. This fall we have awarded almost $600,000 in permanent program improvement grants to the academic colleges. Most of this money comes from a reallocation of resources from the physical plant. We are deeply grateful to President Andersen and his colleagues for making very difficult cuts in their programs in order to provide this additional support to the academic areas. Substantial amounts in year-end funds have also been reallocated in order to meet major program needs. Over the last three years, approximately 28 positions have been added to the faculty. These positions have come in a variety of ways, including significant cost-cutting in other areas of the university.<br><br>Most of the easy decisions have now been made, and most of the fat has been trimmed. Additional changes will prove even more difficult. To continue to become stronger, we must now concentrate thoughtfully and even fearlessly on two areas--faculty hiring and program reviews. What we must do in each of these areas will not be easy, but let me outline some parameters that I feel must guide our decisions.<br><br>Let me speak first about program reviews. All involved in university decision making come quickly to learn that change in the university is always slow and, often, quite painful. Academic folklore holds that changing a curriculum is more difficult that moving a cemetery, and other parts of the university may be at least as resistant to change as is the curriculum. It is another generally accepted maxim that in a university setting it is extremely difficult to do less in order to do more. This applies specifically to the work of program reviews. I have learned that there is no more difficult task than that associated with careful, thoughtful evaluations of academic programs. Emotional attachments to programs become very powerful, and objectivity in recognizing that we might need to discontinue doing something in order to do something else better becomes a rare commodity, especially when it is one's own program that is discontinued so that someone else's might be enhanced. Here, probably as much as anywhere in the university, Chisholm's Fourth Corollary applies: If you do something which you are sure will meet with everybody's approval, someone won't like it.<br><br>The general intent of academic program review is to make programs stronger. However, in some instances, the conclusion might be that a program should be radically altered, or even discontinued. Many institutions succumb to the temptation of trying to do too much, of trying to be the best in every possible field. The outcome of such an approach is usually across-the-board mediocrity. Neither BYU nor any other institution can afford to try and be the best in every field. We must choose those areas where we have competitive advantages for whatever reasons--reasons consistent with our unique mission, reasons that are historical, reasons that are associated with the concentration of particularly strong faculty--and make them as strong as we possibly can. This means making tough budget cut choices. It also means moving resources from some areas to others.<br><br>I emphasize that these decisions are not made just on the basis of current strength of programs; there may be areas where we are relatively weak, but where we should be strong. In such instances we may find it necessary to move resources to strengthen weaker programs. While the movements of resources from one area to another is never done without pain and criticism, we must continue to look carefully at what we are doing in order that we might establish excellence in those areas where we have the greatest need and opportunity. Opportunities for deans and department chairs to make the changes that will allow them to build stronger programs should constantly be sought. We invite faculty and administrators at all levels to continue to assist in this important process.<br><br>Perhaps even more important than program reviews are decisions on faculty hiring. Let me comment on that briefly. We have made some truly exceptional additions to our faculty in recent years. Some who have joined us are or will become world-class teacher/scholars who will bring increasing recognition and stature to themselves, their departments, and the larger university. We are justly proud of these additions. On the other hand, too often we find some departments continuing to advance candidates who will not really strengthen programs or boost us to higher plateaus. I agree with Peter Flawn that one of the real tests of a dean or a department chair is how insistent he or she is in maintaining higher standards for new appointments (Flawn, 1990). First-rate departments tend to hire first-rate people. Second-rate departments tend to hire third-rate people because they are threatened by people who are as strong or stronger than they are. As Flawn notes, truly the greatest legacy of an academic administrator at any level is to leave the faculty stronger than he or she found it.<br><br>Because of the critical importance of faculty hiring, I would have us establish as a general governing rule that--and here I employ an analogy from the sports world--we will not pass up a first-round draft pick in one area in order to hire a forth- or fifth-round draft pick in another. We cannot afford to give up the opportunity to add to our faculty a world-class musicologist or neuropsychologist in order simply to fill a slot in another unit. I know that there are classes that must be taught and other assignments that must be met in all of our departments, but this is not sufficient justification for making weak hires. We will urge deans to evaluate carefully every hiring opportunity and, when needed, to move lines where weak hires would be made to areas where opportunities for more exceptional hires can occur. We will exercise the same kind of review at the academic vice president's level. If there are continuing patterns of departments advancing mediocre candidates, we will conclude that the line is needed more desperately in another area and will be willing to make that move. Faculty positions are our most precious resource; we must exercise exceptional stewardship and judgment in using them.<br><br>Though I have referred to the responsibilities of deans, department chairs, and the central administration, I remind you that the role of making the decisions that will allow us to climb above the foothills to higher peaks is primarily a faculty role. We urge strong departmental faculties to make the programmatic changes and to demand the kind of faculty hires that will allow us to become better than we now are. We hope that those of us in administrative assignments can assist along the way as you do the work that will make the real difference.<br><br><i>2. My second wish is for a much greater sense and feeling of community among members of the university family.</i><br><br>Universities should be places of debate and discussion, places where ideas can be developed and sharpened through their submission to others for review and comment. The excitement of living in a university community comes, frequently, from the open exchange of ideas, from the challenge of presenting the best of what we have to offer for others to assess and evaluate. "Intellectual community [is] found where people talk, argue, imagine, create, and cooperate about and around central concerns, important ideas, significant problems, and vexing issues that are not confined to the boundaries of determinate groups of disciplines" (Warch, 1990).<br><br>But discussion and debate needn't be acrimonious, and disagreements needn't be presented in ad hominem fashion, as is too often the case. Incivility need never characterize our dialogue, particularly as we deal with one another across departmental lines, or across differences in generation, gender, or race. In their recent survey of 500 college and university presidents, Ernest Boyer and Robert Atwell asked presidents what would most improve the quality of life on their campuses. Eighty-six percent responded with a request for greater civility and more respect for others (Boyer, 1990).<br><br>Unfortunately, the academy can, on occasion, "be a small-minded, mean-spirited, stupefyingly bureaucratic, profoundly alienating place" (Wright, 1991). These sins of the academy have been well documented in recent months by Page Smith, Bruce Wilshire, Edward Fiske, and many others. I think that, generally, we are able to avoid many of the worst of these problems here. But we have work yet to do. Men and women in university settings who find stereotyping, prejudice, and discriminations in the larger society to be absolutely reprehensible sometimes turn around and reflect those same reactions in their behavior toward one another. Religion teachers, for example, are sometimes characterized by their brethren and sisters across campus as self-righteous, close-minded, and anti-intellectual. In turn, in other areas of the university, some would classify the science faculty as secularized, godless destroyers of faith. These kinds of categorizations are never helpful. As one of our strong faculty recently noted, in the ultimate sense the work of the Widtsoe Building should be the same as the work of the Joseph Smith Building. I remember some years ago a student wondering aloud to me if he should change his sociology major since a faculty member in another department had warned him that it would be impossible for him to complete a degree in sociology and retain his testimony. At that time we had on our faculty in sociology a couple of stake presidents, several bishops, and one or two returned mission presidents.<br><br>Despite the basic goodness of this place and the people who work here, we see too many emotional attacks on those who serve on university faculty committees and councils whose work is difficult, but essential. We fail more often than we should to celebrate the accomplishments of colleagues. Too often we take comment and criticism too personally.<br><br>I'll say just a bit more about the current debate on political correctness in a moment, but let me emphasize here that I am calling for greater attention to the things that bring us together. As Donn Miller recently observed, achieving diversity is not our goal so much as is achieving a real sense of community, a community that can be experienced by individuals with diverse backgrounds, diverse heritages, and diverse interests (Miller, 1991). If true community is achieved, concerns about diversity will become secondary.<br><br>There is one other related tendency that limits our progress toward greater community. I refer specifically to the inclination among some to wrap themselves and their work in the flag of assumed gospel truth. I am not suggesting that this tendency is limited to any particular area of campus; it is more pervasive than that. Those who wrap themselves in the protective coating of their own special interpretation of the gospel foreclose discussion. For them, life becomes a holy war in which the infidels who come from other areas of campus or who appear to have alternative interpretations and views must be turned back. When it becomes a holy war, one constantly fears exposing to question one's faith and commitment to the gospel by the very work one does. Everything one says or writes becomes a measure of devotion to the kingdom. There are basics to which we all must and should pledge allegiance; there are other areas where all of the answers are not yet in. In the latter instances, we must allow greater flexibility of understanding and interpretation.<br><br>There are naturally many things that we do at the university that are largely solitary, such as working in our studios or our laboratories. Some of our research is shared, but much of it is individual. Yet we can do more to increase the sense of common purpose, the sense of oneness in mission. Cross-disciplinary symposia, brown-bag luncheons where someone from another college or department is invited in to discuss h is or her work, collaborative research projects--all of these things can help us build both greater awareness of what others are doing and greater appreciation of that contribution. We can also participate more openly and more broadly in the shared rituals and traditions of the campus community such as forums, commencements, and the annual Distinguished Faculty Lecture. I urge broader faculty participation in all of these activities. I also urge that we all become more generous in our attitudes toward one another, that we become more willing to suspend judgment, that we be more open-minded, that we be more tolerant of the risk-taking of others, and that, as I will suggest in a moment, we exhibit greater humility in the limitations of our own work and judgment (Wright, 1991).<br><br>The benefits of such an attitude are obvious. We will support and encourage and even celebrate the strong work of our colleagues wherever that occurs. We will eliminate the propensity to stereotype and judge and categorize because we will understand that some quite exceptional things are being done in every corner of the university. Dedicated women and men are changing lives through effective teaching, and they are making a difference in their chosen profession through the quality of their scholarship. Let us do more to celebrate together these accomplishments.<br><br><i>3. Third, I would urge a greater willingness on the part of us all to see the life of a scholar more as a calling than merely a job, a trade, or a way to make a living.</i><br><br>This is the way it was once perceived. Why not again? Camille Paglia has observed that today's system of higher education is "geared to producing careerist academics rather than scholars and intellectuals" (Paglia, 1991). But, as Henry Rosovsky notes, "The best of us do practice our profession as a calling and consider ourselves not employees but shareholders of the university: a group of owners" (Rosovsky, 1986). As owners, we all have an important stake in making the place the very best it can be. This means not sitting on the sidelines and watching others take the most difficult assignments or, worse, sitting there and carping about the kind of job they are doing. Rather, it means that we acknowledge our stake in what this place is all about and that we work our hardest to make it the very best.<br><br>In terms of my more ideal university, I would have a faculty who, individually and collectively, recognize how important it is to teach effectively, to be good department citizens, and to carry on programs of meaningful and important research. I would wish for a faculty who did these things because that was who they were, that was what they wanted to do. They would not do these things because, as someone observed, they expected some human equivalent of a dog biscuit for standing, sitting, rolling over, or barking on command. Instead, this ideal faculty would want to teach well, to create strong departments, to maintain a strong program of research and scholarly achievement because that was what they had chosen to do. To complain because a department chair, or a dean, or a faculty rank advancement council expected it of them would be incomprehensible.<br><br>I have been interested in the level of emotion with which some of us object to being called employees. Our new activity card will identify us as faculty, not as employees. The symbolic significance of this is readily evident. Its actual significance will only be reflected in our behavior. I hope our behavior will demonstrate, even more than it now does, the real value we place on what is, indeed, a calling, a calling of scholarship. In our spring leadership conference, I quoted Sanford Pinsker as follows: "Seek dissatisfaction and you will surely find it. There is no end of volunteers. They will recite litanies about the papers they must grade, articles they must write, the books they must read, the harried life they must lead. Such tales tell everything but the truth; for all its problems, there are people in academe who count themselves fortunate--and, yes, lucky--to wear the academic gown" (Pinsker, 1986). I count myself among that number, as most of you do.<br><br><i>4. Fourth, I would ask for greater humility in our own work and greater appreciation for the work of others.</i><br><br>Humility about the relative importance of our individual contributions is more rare than we might hope. Maybe we all need to be reminded of that more frequently. Someone once observed that you become greater by having humility toward the great things. We see around us many great things--the wonder of a physical plant that meets our needs, the contributions and discoveries of our colleagues, the privilege of working in an environment where we are surrounded by great minds, the challenge of being called teacher by students whose own capacity and accomplishment is far beyond where ours may have been at that point in our lives.<br><br>I hope we appreciate the blessing of the marvelous physical environment in which we work. New additions to our campus will further enhance and facilitate our work world. These include the addition of the new Joseph Smith Building, the fine arts museum that is currently under construction, the opportunity to begin soon a new science building and, following that, a new addition to both the Lee and Law School libraries. We will soon complete a new language house and additional married student housing.<br><br>Like Henry Rosovsky in his descriptions of Harvard, as I come onto this campus in the quiet of early mornings, it is indeed an oasis, it pleases the eye and the mind in all seasons, it is a refreshing start to any working day (Rosovsky, 1986). What a special opportunity it is to work at a university. Here, perhaps more than anywhere else, we can continue to invest daily in ourselves. We are paid to read the things we love to read, to create, to share what we learn with bright and eager young students. We can constantly satisfy our intellectual curiosity and we can take continuing joy in the wonder of discovery. Going to work does not have to be a chore; it can be a joy and an opportunity. I truly feel that we should more willingly view these things with a sense of humility rather than treat them as an entitlement.<br><br>When we get caught up in fighting the daily fires, life does tend to become a bit grim, and we do go home tired without feeling much joy in our service. On the other hand, planning, dreaming, and trying to establish institutional vision is exciting and rewarding and results in great satisfaction, as does taking joy in the accomplishments of our fellows. If we can be motivated by the hopes and dreams that led to the establishment of this place, if we can concentrate on what can be rather than just on what is, then we will have much more satisfaction in what we are doing and much more to look forward to. And our own contributions can be placed in the more meaningful context of the contributions of all those who have come before us and who labor with us now.<br><br><i>5. Fifth, I would have us all develop greater vision in accomplishing the tasks that universities are all about and, particularly, that this one is all about.</i><br><br>We are at a very interesting time in the history of higher education in America. As Robert Rosenzweig, president of the American Association of Colleges, has recently noted, universities have now lost their immunity from public criticism and, in the eyes of many, there is no longer a presumption in favor of their virtue (<i>Administrator</i>, 1991). Or, as Tamar March (1991) has stated, "The public is cross. It has lost confidence in higher education." For much of higher education, the mixed metaphor I heard recently seems to apply: The future is an uncharted sea full of potholes.<br><br>Several recent conferences have addressed the general perception among the larger public that universities have lost their integrity. Questionable overhead charges contributed to the recent resignation of the president of Stanford University. Stanford, like several other highly successful research universities, has returned millions to the government in excessive overhead charges. The Ivy League schools and several of their sister institutions have had to confront serious antitrust charges. The June 3, 1991, issue of<i>Time</i>talked about this under the headline "Cracking the Ivy Cartel." Problems of plagiarism and doctored research data appear in the newspaper almost daily. The result is that universities are now ranked no higher in the public mind than many other institutions when it comes to perceptions of integrity.<br><br>What all of this means is that we have fallen from a high perch in terms of public perceptions. Stephen Trachtenberg (1991) notes that the ancient Greeks had a formula for what has happened: "After hubris, nemesis." Or, in more Newtonian terms, "What goes up must come down." Many are taking delight in the fall. The result is that Congress and state legislatures get more points with the public for cutting funding for educational programs than by providing additional funding.<br><br>Many universities are now facing extremely harsh economic realities. Because of this, some institutions are having to wonder what is more essential to their mission and what is less essential. Almost half of the nation's colleges and universities suffered midyear cuts in their 1990-91 operating budgets, and many institutions are now facing a long period of fiscal retrenchment (<i>Bulletin</i>, 1991). To deal with these cuts, half of the affected public colleges reduced the number of courses or sections of courses offered or increased class size. Half raised tuition and student fees. Two-thirds said they held off on expenditures for buildings and equipment. The proportion of administrators who judged the financial well-being of their institutions to be excellent or very good has declined to about one-third of all institutions. We are very fortunate in that we remain relatively unaffected by these and other problems that are tearing at the very heart of many institutions.<br><br>As you are aware, many of the criticisms directed against universities are based on the claim that they have lost their focus on undergraduate teaching. More and more states, including our own, are jumping on the bandwagon of requiring audits of faculty assignments under the assumption that if faculty are not in the classroom, they must not be working. We all have a challenge in educating our publics on this matter. Many of you are being asked this semester to respond to a survey we have developed on faculty time usage. We will use the data from that survey to help us with this educational process. We hope you will respond willingly and honestly to our request to participate in this important task.<br><br>Increased national attention to the quality of the undergraduate experience is welcome and healthy. Increased attention at BYU to the quality of the undergraduate experience is equally welcome and healthy. We have important challenges in this regard, including a need for substantially more effort in improving the quality of the freshman year. As Provost Hafen noted this morning, you will see us focus much more on this during the coming months.<br><br>The reaffirmation of our commitment here, however, shouldn't detract from our other important missions. We need not apologize for the contributions that come from faculty research. Certainly many of the benefits of these efforts flow into the undergraduate classroom where faculty members who are active in their own scholarly agendas transmit to their students a sense of the process of discovery that could occur in no other way. In many of our disciplines, research is the primary mode of teaching at the college level and, as Frieda Stahl has recently noted, "Research is as necessary for student development in the sciences as performance is in the arts" (Stahl, 1991). The same assessment applies, I believe, to the social sciences.<br><br>Stahl further notes that:<br><br><i>The professor's disciplinary practice is indispensable to college teaching. Again, in the arts this precept is obvious: A music professor must be and must function as a musician, helping students develop as musicians by involving them in performance, composition, and conducting. To do so, the professor must also create and perform, and thereby continue to grow as a musician in order to grow correspondingly as a teacher. In the sciences, the research project is the means for involved, integrative learning by students, and by the professor, who is enabled to grow as a scientist in order to grow as a teacher.</i><br><br><i>Students learn more than the ideas and techniques. They watch the professor think, make mistakes, determine what's been decided or tried is improper, and work out of such errors to arrive at new, verifiable information. Thus, the student members of the team learn the essential reasoning of their discipline, the checks and balances as well as the nuts and bolts, in ways that can never be transmitted didactically.</i><br><br>Some of those who are most critical of the research mission of universities exhibit an embarrassing lack of understanding of the role that university research has played in important developments in this country in science, medicine, and numerous other fields. I believe that t commitment to undergraduate education is shared by many of the institutions that stand at the forefront in these areas. There is nothing wrong with all of us feeling some pressure to do even better than we are doing in this part of our mission. But we should not obscure the leadership our major universities often provide and the contribution they make to undergraduate, as well as graduate, education (Traina, 1991).<br><br>I believe these universities have returned an impressive yield on the investment that this country makes in their laboratories and classrooms. I am pleased that BYU's contribution to this work has increased. Funding for undergraduate education<i>and</i>funding for research and graduate education is not merely an expenditure, it is an investment and, I believe, an investment that bears dividends that are substantially greater than would be true in many of the alternative places where these monies could be spent.<br><br>In terms of this particular part of the mission of this institution, my own views are straightforward. I do believe that the issue of the relative balance between teaching and research has probably been talked about enough, but because it continues to come up in a variety of different settings, let me reiterate my position.<br><br>I believe that ours is a dual obligation both to transmit to our students the best of what is known and to contribute to the creation of that which is new and better. This is not a dichotomy; we are talking simply about the parts of a unified whole. Neither is this an either/or proposition; it is both. I know that I am sometimes rather slow, but I must admit that I struggle with why such a conclusion should be either revolutionary or controversial. All of our faculty should be teacher/scholars. We can comfortably note that some will do more of one thing than of another, or even that some will be better at one than the other, but this does not remove the basic expectation that for most of us it is not a question of dual loyalties or a question of holding citizenship in two different camps. Teaching and scholarship are simply what universities, including this one, are all about. We expect it of one another; it is what our reward systems are based on; it, simply, is what we do. Those working most closely with the faculty, especially department chairs and deans, can work on the proper balance in each individual case.<br><br>This means that becoming a great undergraduate institution does not mean abandoning the important research we are doing or failing to offer graduate degrees in areas where we are appropriately prepared. Our uniqueness as an institution can come from our ability to offer a truly exceptional undergraduate experience, one that is truly exceptional because our faculty are engaged in quality scholarly pursuits and, frequently, graduate instruction, that can supplement and enhance the things that are occurring in the undergraduate classroom.<br><br><i>6. Finally, and very briefly, I would wish for us a total commitment to providing equal opportunities for all of those who have a BYU experience without regard to race, generation, gender, or other characteristics.</i><br><br>I fully endorse what Provost Hafen said on this issue this morning and add the following brief comment: Far too much attention is being given nationally to the concept of political correctness, particularly since, contrary to what you would conclude from the level of media attention, relatively few colleges and universities have actually experienced any real controversy over the political and cultural content of the courses, speeches, or faculty lectures (<i>Bulletin</i>, 1991). But whatever is going on in the larger world of universities and colleges, we must reaffirm on this campus our basic respect for whatever differences May exist among us. We must acknowledge openly and publicly our commitment to provide opportunities and to reward performance independent of an individual's gender, race, or any other factor or characteristic that is irrelevant to participating in the life of the university. Randall Kennedy, a law professor at Harvard, referred to this in a recent article as a scholar's "skeptical attitude towards all labels and categories that obscure appreciation of the unique feature of specific persons and their work" (Kennedy, 1990).<br><br>Now if we are serious about what I have just described, we have difficult challenges ahead of us. In addition to reviewing our individual behavior, we must review our programs. I don't think we can justify programs designed primarily for young women if those programs are developed with the expectation that we needn't worry about giving all that much substance because we expect them to marry without graduating or, if they do graduate, we don't expect that they will intend to pursue either graduate studies or professional excellence. As one of our recent graduates indicated, without debating the morality of women choosing such an educational path, it is wrong for a university of this caliber to offer dead-end courses of study. All programs offered must openly and honestly demonstrate what type of professional and post-graduate opportunities the students will be prepared for upon graduation.<br><br>The standard we must demand is that all we do, in the classroom and out, must reflect our respect and appreciation for our differences. There must be no room on this campus for anything that is demeaning in any way to any member of our university community.<br><br>I will conclude now on what will be much more of a personal note. Some of the things I have talked about today may have sounded a little critical or harsh. Administrative roles often demand difficult decisions, and the most difficult of these are the ones that affect the personal lives of the faculty. Occasionally, members of the university family are hurt and disappointed by particular administrative actions. It is these that I anguish over most. Sometimes it would be a great deal easier just to approve each name advanced for faculty hiring, or to avoid creating discomfort by asking for a higher level of performance, or to continue programs just because we have had them in the past.<br><br>But we will continue to press for further progress in our efforts to build a better university. As we do that, I acknowledge that whatever else may come from my own time in this assignment, the things I will carry with me, the things I will treasure most, will be the more personal things. I include, specifically, the dedicated and selfless service of my colleagues in the academic vice president's office. I express my deep sense of appreciation to each of them. I include the ever-increasing sense of gratitude I feel for the service that each of you give as members of the faculty. I include, as well, the great admiration I feel when I watch the president of this university carry out his assignments with vigor, enthusiasm, commitment, grace, and good humor while coping with physical challenges that would cause a lesser man to throw in the towel. One of my sweetest memories will be of the opportunity to stand with other members of the President's Council and two members of the Twelve to participate in a priesthood blessing the day President Lee learned of the new medical challenges that he described to you in this auditorium a little over a year ago.<br><br>There are countless other experiences like these that have brought meaning and purpose to the most difficult of days. For example, I will always appreciate the response of Martin Hickman, who served this university so effectively for 17 years as dean, when President Lee and I invited him to be last year's commencement speaker. With tears in his eyes, Martin told us how he had prayed for some affirmation that his years of service in difficult administrative assignments had been accepted by the Lord. He saw this invitation as the affirmation he sought.<br><br>A few weeks ago, I attended funeral services for Merlin Myers. Merlin was one of the finest scholars this university has had. Though I knew him for many years, it was only in his role as university teacher and scholar. At his funeral, one of his daughters described a much more personal Merlin Myers. She talked of the many evenings when she walked with her father in the foothills of Pleasant Grove, where he taught her simple things like how to identify the footprints of a deer or the names of plants and flowers. Probably that was the Merlin Myers who mattered most.<br><br>On a beautiful fall Saturday a couple of years ago, in fact on a day much like today, I drove to my hometown to spend a few hours with my father, who was in poor health. I pushed his wheelchair out onto the back lawn and then sat on the grass beside him. Together we watched the farmers, with whom he had worked all his life, as they brought loads of baled hay to their yards to stack for winter. His condition was such that he could not talk much, but silently we shared special feelings and memories. Only a few days later, my phone rang and a good neighbor told me that my father had just died. How grateful I was for those few hours we had spent together.<br><br>I contrast that with a different set of feelings I experienced two weeks ago. I arrived home from a research conference at about two a.m. on the morning of commencement to find in the newspaper an obituary for a member of our university family. A couple of weeks earlier, this man's wife had called me to report that her husband's health wasn't good. At the end of our conversation, she said, "He thinks so much of you. I hope you can find a moment to visit him one of these days." I had thought of that call almost every day, but I had not taken the time to make the visit. For as long as I live, I will regret allowing other things to cause me to feel too busy to do what mattered most.<br><br>In one of the most poignant of all sections of scripture, we read of a dialogue between Enoch, that man of great personal righteousness, and God. At one point, as God looks upon the works of his children, we read:<br><br>"And it came to pass that the God of heaven looked upon the residue of the people, and he wept."<br><br>Enoch, puzzled, asks: "How is it that thou canst weep, seeing thou art holy, and from all eternity to all eternity? . . . How is it thou canst weep?"<br><br>The Lord then responds to Enoch: "Behold these thy brethren; they are the workmanship of mine own hands, and I gave unto them their knowledge, in the day I created them; and in the Garden of Eden, gave I unto man his agency."<br><br>The Lord then shows Enoch a sampling of the weaknesses and failings of Man. The account continues:<br><br>"And it came to pass that the Lord spake unto Enoch, and told Enoch all the doings of the children of men; wherefore Enoch knew, and looked upon . . . their misery,<i>and wept</i>and stretched forth his arms, and his heart swelled wide as eternity; and his bowels yearned; and all eternity shook" (Moses 7:28–32, 41; emphasis added). As Enoch came to see as the Lord saw, he did as the Lord did; he wept.<br><br>Let's you and I work hard the build the kind of university we must build. Let's demand of one another even greater levels of performance. Let's not rest just because we have reached the foothills, and it is evident that the climb to the higher peaks will require even more effort than we have yet given. But let's not lose sight of those things that matter most. Whatever the joys, sorrows, and challenges that lie before us, whatever the twists and turns that might be in the path ahead, let's never forget to do those things that will really count. For this I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Stan L.

<h1> Use All Those Books, and the Spirit, Too - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
This month marks exactly 20 years since I began to work at BYU. In that time, I have sensed a stirring vision of what this university is becoming. Parenthetically, that word "vision" makes me conscious of certain risks. At a football game in Laramie, a BYU fan was supposedly seated behind a Wyoming fan who was wearing a 25-gallon cowboy hat. The BYU fan couldn't see the playing field because of the Wyoming fan's hat. So he tapped the man on the shoulder and said, "Excuse me, sir, but your hat is blocking my vision." The Wyoming fan turned around and recognized the Cougar blue. Then he said, "Blocking your vision? I'm sorry--I didn't realize you were having one."<br><br>I first read Brigham Young's teachings on education 20 years ago, including his injunction to "learn everything that the children of men know, and be prepared for the most refined society upon the face of the earth." I thought then of those brave pioneers whose names adorn our buildings. They cared passionately for education. Here in the desert, they began building schools as soon as they began building temples. Can you imagine with me that perhaps on one of those pioneer evenings, some who loved books (or even Brigham himself, who loved books) might have sat beneath the stars and asked one another, "Do you think that one day there might be a great university in Zion? A fine school, with books, and laboratories, and teachers, where the saints might come from all around the world to learn together? Just think--all those books and the Spirit too!" An impossible dream? They might have thought so. But the dream is coming true, the dream of true freedom: gospel-flavored education that liberates the mind and a religious life that frees the soul. "Where the Spirit of the Lord is,<i>there</i>is liberty" (2 Corinthians 3:17).<br><br>In 1957, Thomas O'Dea, a Catholic sociologist, published<i>The Mormons.</i>After describing us sympathetically, O'Dea addressed what he called the Church's "sources of strain and conflict." The major conflict he foresaw was that the Church had heavily committed its members to the pursuit of higher education, which fosters critical thinking; yet the Church also maintained an authoritarian, literalistic religion that seemed to discourage critical thinking. "Upon [the] outcome" of this conflict he wrote, "will depend in a deeper sense the future of Mormonism" (O'Dea, p. 240).<br><br>Now, over 30 years later, the conflict O'Dea described has hardly disappeared. Each new student, and each of us, must continually struggle with the natural tension between faith and skepticism. As Richard Bushman eloquently reminded us recently, those who "join the world of scholarship" will "henceforth never be entirely free from the dangers" of that world; for we cannot, nor should we, seal ourselves off from "the skepticism that underlies much of scholarship" (BYU August Commencement Address, 1991). Yet the dilemma of whether "all those books" are fundamentally compatible with "the Spirit, too" is now resolved. As evidence for that conclusion, look not only at Richard Bushman; look all across this campus. It is filled with faculty and staff who have grappled successfully with intellectual and professional world at its most demanding level, only to find that their literalistic religious commitments have been strengthened rather than weakened by the encounter. I see all around me partakers of Abraham's covenant who earnestly desire just what Father Abraham did: "I sought for the blessings of the fathers, . . . desiring also to be one who possessed great knowledge,<i>and</i>to be a greater follower of righteousness" (Abraham 1:2). On the foundation of that resolution, despite or even assisted by its ongoing dynamic tensions, I sense for the 1990s a quantum leap of<i>quality</i>for BYU.<br><br>For me, four themes flow from this vision. The first I call authentic religion. This campus is a living monument to the religious and educational philosophy of President David O. McKay. In same ways the BYU, BYU--Hawaii, and Ricks College campuses we see today owe their very existence to his influence. His vision of higher education therefore deserves our closest attention. President McKay once told the BYU faculty that this is "primarily a religious institution. It was established for the<i>sole purpose</i>of<i>associating</i>with facts of science, art, literature, and philosophy the truths of the gospel of Jesus Christ" (<i>Messenger,</i>BYU, October 1937). Thus, our religious education faculty does<i>not</i>constitute the largest institute of religion in the Church, situated "across the street" (symbolically or actually) from the largest secular university in Utah. The primary mission of the BYU religion faculty is to teach faith, testimony, and practical religion, but those faculty also nourish our commitments to serious, university-level education in all the academic disciplines. At the same time, all BYU faculty and staff must seek to integrate the gospel and its teachings into everything we do. We must all be truly bilingual, speaking fluently both the language of our disciples and the language of the scriptures, yet our priorities are clear: our professional credentials may have earned us passports to Athens, but our citizenship must always remain in Jerusalem.<br><br>Clayne Pope has observed that many BYU personnel fall into one of two groups. One group "clusters in the familiar surroundings of their disciplines," looking for "cues" to "the best graduate programs in [their] field." This group sometimes views the Church with "embarrassment." The other group "shuns the disciplines and gathers in the comforting shade of the Church," where they at times "belittle the hard-won knowledge of the world," implying to Church members that "there is nothing of much importance in all that scholarship." "Neither of these groups," he correctly continued, fulfills BYU's mission, which "requires a<i>fusion</i>of the secular and the sacred into a mountain of truth" (Phi Kappa Phi Address, March 7, 1991).<br><br>Here is one crucial reason why this kind of fusion matters: Thomas O'Dea postulated that authentic religion and genuine intellectual inquiry simply may not be compatible. As our increasingly bright students struggle with that challenge, they will find their best resolution not in abstract debates, but in the lives of their teachers, their campus job supervisors, or the leaders in their student wards. BYU offers something the institutes of religion cannot fully offer. LDS professionals highly trained in all the major fields who have worked through the O'Dea issues with wonderfully productive outcomes. This makes BYU the ideal place for the Church's most promising young people to be tutored by role models who have achieved professional and religious harmony. Please let our students get to know your hearts as well as your minds. Share with them, build them. Reach out to touch them. Reach out to teach them.<br><br>No one at BYU is making a more significant contribution than those of you whose thoughts and example reach the hearts of BYU students in ways that stir them to a sense of the sacred. As one of Merlin Myers' students said recently at Merlin's funeral, "What was that feeling we sensed at times in his anthropology classes? It was not like sacrament meeting--it was almost like the temple because he made us forever conscious of the difference between the sacred and the profane." The parents of these young men and women send them here for that very purpose. Many of those parents are on their knees every night, praying that you will touch their hearts. Thank God, literally, so many of you do. Many, many people in the permanent BYU community take the spiritual mission of this school with utmost seriousness. Whether in the boiler room, a dormitory, a counseling session, a faculty office, or a student ward, you work, you fast, and you pray for our students and for all the rest of us.<br><br>Because this element of the BYU experience is so crucial, people who have an anti-Church agenda really don't belong here, no matter how able they may be in other ways. Those who accept employment here accept the responsibility of being role models for a life that combines the quest for intellectual rigor with the quest for spiritual values and personal character. Faculty and staff who are members of the Church also accept the spiritual and temporal expectations of wholehearted Church membership.<br><br>At the same time, I plead for our commitment to authentic religion. A friend from another faith reports that the main criticism he hears of BYU and its people is the charge of arrogance and self-righteousness. According to one apocryphal story, someone from Salt Lake City was talking with a longtime friend from BYU. The Salt Lake person said, "I really apologize for telling you this, but something bothers me: you are just too condescending and self-righteous." The BYU friend replied cheerfully, "Oh, that's okay--I forgive you."<br><br>More seriously, I recall the question a little boy supposedly asked his grandfather: "Was that a true story, Grandpa, or were you just preaching?" I am haunted by the assumption behind that child's innocent question, because it touches a point of terrible vulnerability for an institution so boldly identified with religion as this one is. In the minds of that little boy and many other people, "religion" is "just preaching." Religion isn't real life--it is mostly hypocrisy: an artificial facade of posturing and dogmatizing.<br><br>Herbert Schneider has described how the severe doctrines of Calvinism receded to the harmlessness of "just preaching" while the American Puritans lived out the "true stories" of their lives at another level: "The preachers continued to preach [Calvinism] and the laymen continued to hear it; not because either of them believed it, but because they cherished it. Beliefs seldom became doubts; they become ritual . . . themes of public celebration . . . cherished in the imagination long after [they have] been surrendered in practice" (<i>The Puritan Mind,</i>1930, p. 98). May that never describe our condition. may we, rather, be as A.J. Cronin wrote: "You've got inquisitiveness and tenderness. You're sensible of the distinction between thinking and doubting . . . and, quite the nicest thing about you, my dear boy, is this--you haven't got that bumptious security which sprints from dogma rather than [truth]" (A. J. Cronin,<i>The Keys of the Kingdom</i>[Boston: Little, Brown &amp;amp; Co.], 1941, p. 144).<br><br>My second theme is the need to foster student quality. President Lee will shortly tell us in more detail about a significant meeting of the BYU Board of Trustees last June 5, but I will make a few preliminary observations. It was not lost on any of us that day that we were meeting with a group that included those we wholeheartedly sustain as apostles and prophets. We had the blessing of a long and candid conversation with them regarding some fundamental BYU issues. I came away from that meeting with a strong sense that we understood one another, and that we now have a strong, clear mandate regarding our student admissions strategy and the role of our faculty--two issues that go a long way toward defining the very nature of the university.<br><br>As ever-growing numbers of students apply for admission here, the board has now authorized an approach that will inevitably result in the qualitative improvement of the student body, both academically and personally. The board has long been uncomfortable about admissions decisions made only on the basis of academic factors. Thus we have always required a bishop's endorsement, and for nearly a decade we have used a "reparation index" that favors applicants who enroll in demanding high school courses, regardless of the grades they earn.<br><br>We will now add further elements designed to identify those among the best academically prepared students who are<i>also</i>the most likely to contribute to the BYU environment and to sue their education to influence others for good. These ideas build upon a concept urged by President McKay 70 years ago, when the Church first began the process of reducing its sponsorship of higher education. Having been both a faculty member and president of Weber Academy, President McKay knew that education on a Church campus was richer and more complete than a state-sponsored education supplemented by religion courses. Thus, he told the board that the Church had sponsored schools not "merely because the state didn't [provide education]; rather, we<i>"establish[ed] the schools to make Latter-day Saints"</i>(Church Board of Education, 1964, Special Committee Report). But when it became clear in the 1920s that the Church couldn't afford to educate all the Saints, President McKay proposed an expansion of<i>teacher</i>education so that the students who<i>were</i>privileged to enjoy the fully integrated vision of "a BYU experience" could later extend the influence of that vision as public school teachers.<br><br>Our admissions office has drawn on a rich base of experience and creativity to project such an admissions strategy into the modern era. For example, the process used to select Benson scholars has helped us identify the personal qualities that incline young people toward altruistic service as well as toward spiritual and intellectual leadership. We also profited this past year from asking each applicant to submit a self-revealing essay, and we will be asking bishops and high school counselors to describe our applicants more fully. Academic preparation will continue to be the dominant single factor in admissions decisions, but these new criteria will provide enough additional basis for selection that we can safely predict future student bodies of increasingly strong educational<i>and personal</i>quality.<br><br>Now we must face the implications of such qualitative growth amid intense enrollment pressure. For instance, our inability to enroll all who would come here suggests the need for a creative vision of continuing education programs that will extend the influence of a BYU education. If we can't get the people into BYU, perhaps we can find better ways to get BYU into the people. Another implication is that we must address the issues of student attrition and low graduation rates. Given a strategy of educating those who will pass along the influence of that education to others, persistence to graduation is critical.<br><br>We must also help students move through the university faster. The board underscored that need in unmistakable terms last June. We have begun an empirical study of the factors that slow student progress and will be reviewing anew all major and general education requirements. In addition, we must increase spring and summer enrollments to maximize our use of faculty and campus resources. We are already working on options that include financial incentives or perhaps requiring newly admitted students to attend during some spring/summer terms.<br><br>The increasing quality of our students also demands that we increase the educational quality of their experience here. Joseph Smith said, when the Spirit directed him to Newel K. Whitney's store, "Well, Brother Whitney, you've prayed me here--now what are you going to do with me?" These precious and gifted young people have the right to ask us the same question: we've prayed them here, now what<i>are</i>we going to do with them? As one step, we announce the creation of a new Faculty development Center. Stan Albrecht will tell the faculty more about the new center, but it is primarily a resource to the academic colleges to strengthen teaching, augmented by attention to faculty scholarship and professional development. Our vision of "a quantum leap of quality" has no more significant aim than the enhancement of teaching quality in the best, broad sense.<br><br>We are especially concerned about the experience of freshmen and sophomore students, who too often feel lost and overwhelmed by a mega-environment that can be intimidating and impersonal. We must examine our entire approach to "the freshman year," including student/faculty ratios. William Butler Yeats wrote, "Education is not the filling of a pail; it is the lighting of a fire." At BYU, we must ignite the sparks of that fire within each entering student, then fan it to a roaring blaze.<br><br>My third theme is faculty quality. As I tried to say last year, high-quality faculty scholarship and creative work are essential if we are to have a first-rate teaching institution. Therefore, every faculty member should energetically pursue a creative scholarly agenda designed at a minimum to keep him or her intellectually alive and current in the field. Natural constraints at BYU will necessarily limit the fraction of our collective time given to scholarship, which unavoidably limits the<i>quantity</i>of our creative output. But we need not limit our aspirations for scholarly<i>quality.</i>These constraints include our high student/faculty ratio, our high percentage of undergraduate students, our comparatively low level of total expenditures per student, and the sheer variety of our academic programs.<br><br>Hoping to open a campus dialogue on this subject last year, I suggested several steps designed to ensure both realism and fairness in meeting our scholarly aspirations. These steps included a more flexible definition of scholarship, an emphasis on scholarly and creative work that enhances teaching, customized faculty load arrangements, and the rewarding of individual assignments equally when performed with equal quality. We have enjoyed a spirited and constructive campus dialogue on these issues since last year, including an all-faculty conference in January on the meaning of "scholarship," a series of meetings between university administrators and small groups of faculty, a study an discussion by the Faculty Advisory Council, a seminar for department chairs, and, finally, our recent discussion with the BYU Board of Trustees. As one result of this interaction, the academic vice-president's office will soon distribute for review a proposed new statement of policy and procedures for rank advancement and continuing status. This will go first to department chairs and deans, to be followed by an open hearing for all faculty. A final document that reflects this intensive process of input should be effective by next spring.<br><br>One other significant outcome of this discussion was the response of our trustees in June. We described for the board the university's academic development over the past generation. Before 1960, BYU was essentially a "comprehensive college" with a focus that was more regional than national, and the faculty did only occasional scholarly work. We have now become a "major university" with a national and even international focus for both students and faculty. Scholarship and teaching now interact to create a professional quality that is nationally competitive. However, we also showed the board how we can fulfill this role without creating the expectation of becoming a "research university." We can do this by stressing both the flexible definition and the teaching orientation we propose for faculty scholarship. We explained the concept of variable faculty loads and noted that, although we need significant additional faculty-related resources to serve our students better, we can continue our present level of research without massive increases in external government funding.<br><br>After full discussion, the board unanimously endorsed this understanding of our faculty's mission. A "major university" occupies a legitimate middle ground between a comprehensive college and a research university. Cultivating that ground with the utmost quality is our faculty agenda for the '90s. This perspective matches the emerging quality of our faculty with the emerging potential of our students.<br><br>My fourth theme is our need to continue building a campus work environment full of professional competence, harmony, and personal nurturing. Regarding competence, I express my gratitude for the overall quality of the staff and administrative support services on this campus. We aren't perfect, but this massive and complicated institution shouldn't operate successfully for fifteen minutes without the dedication and attention to detail that typically characterize BYU personnel. Time magazine said recently that "Utah now boasts the nation's youngest, best-educated, and most productive work force" (July 19, 1991, p. 22). It occurs to me that the cream of that very impressive crop works right here on these 638 acres. Along with our other aspirations for higher quality, we must continue aspiring to uncompromising professional quality in everything we do, from repairing the air conditioning and keeping track of student files to serving delicious food and monitoring the expenditures of BYU funds. As Elder Neal A. Maxwell once said, we cannot let the world condemn our value system by pointing to our professional mediocrity.<br><br>Let us also work in harmony together. Our vision seeks not only "all those books" but "the Spirit, too"; thus the Savior's teachings to the Nephites have special meaning for us: we desire his influence and even his presence here. We must therefore be very cautious about "disputations" and "contentions" that arise from hearts stirred up in anger. This does not mean we expect a suffocating conformity. As to matters of personal style and choice, the Lord clearly has more than one cookie cutter. For me, the ideal metaphor is a musical one: with our many voices, we could all sing in unison, in harmony, or in dissonance. Of these three, I prefer harmony, because it enables a variety of voices to blend into a fuller, richer sound than mere unison.<br><br>In the spirit of that harmony, I invite our attention to the matter of diversity and gender. BYU's mission supports the mission of the Church in teaching the crucial importance of marriage and family life, not only as a matter of social desirability but as a matter of religious doctrine. At the same time, our mission and the doctrines of the gospel affirm the inherent worth of female and male alike. The status of both women and men here should therefore reflect our twin commitments to family life<i>and</i>individual worth. Thus the day-to-day speech and behavior of university personnel must demonstrate the value of women in every facet of campus life. It is our policy to follow up on any reliable report alleging that BYU personnel have engaged in demeaning behavior toward women employees or students. As then-President Dallin Oaks said here in 1975, "We make no distinction between young men and young women in our conviction about the importance of an education." In every way, we value the contributions of women and men equally at BYU, and we are committed to an environment and a reward system that reflects what we value.<br><br>Drawing on the work of several excellent committees on women and gender over a number of years, we seek to implement this commitment through normal campus channels. For example, we have conducted internal salary reviews to ensure gender-based equity. And to raise our awareness of gender issues, we have invited professors Kate Kirkham and Marie Cornwall into an ongoing series of conversations with Assistant Vice President Carolyn Lloyd, Associate Vice President Dennis Thompson, and members of the President's Council. We hope deans, chairs, and directors will find similar opportunities to talk with women colleagues.<br><br>Our desires for competence, harmony, and nurturing apply in everything we do here, but they apply especially in the relationships each one of us has with students. The most important part of any organization is its "customers"--those for whom the institution was created. For us, that group is our students and, ultimately, their families. As Page Smith said in a paper quoted by BYU's Don Jarvis: "If we do not love and care for [our students], if we do not place them in the center of our thinking and doing, if we persist in thinking that they are merely incidental to or distracting from our [other serious] concerns, then there is, quite literally, no hope for higher education" (<i>Junior Faculty Development,</i>p. 68).<br><br>With thousands of students bustling constantly around the campus in more directions than we can comprehend, and with hundreds more hammering on our doors and telephones because we cannot admit them to study, it is all too easy for us to develop callouses around the entry to our hearts. A frustrated mother whose child was turned away from a full BYU program said to me in tears, "When you people turn us down, you could at least no seem so smug about it." Perhaps the sheer number of people paying attention to BYU makes some BYU personnel pay less attention to the feelings of those people. In a recent survey, one BYU graduate expressed his sadness at having sensed here "an attitude that it is not important to treat people with respect."<br><br>When we hear complaints--and I know in some offices that seems like all you hear--I hope we can view each concern as an opportunity to learn how to improve our routine processes. I realize how difficult it is when people have unrealistic expectations of us. I still remember an irate phone call I received at home late one evening from a father in a faraway state. We had just implemented a new computer program in some phase of registration, and a bug in the program had fouled up the paperwork for this man's daughter. After listening to me briefly, the man said, "I might have expected that kind of problem someplace else, but this is a Church school!" What could I say? I just replied, "I'm sorry. We buy our computers the same place as everybody else does."<br><br>Those are the four themes that for me flow from that pioneer vision of Brigham Young University: all those books, and the Spirit, too. I conclude with one thought about our relationship with those early pioneers and with today's Saints of the latter days. When Joseph Smith went to Washington, D.C., to seek redress for the Saints' grievances, he and Elias Higbee wrote a letter to the Church members in Nauvoo. They opened that letter with a phrase that suggests what it means to be at BYU: "Your fellow laborers and servants, sent by you to perform one of the most arduous and responsible duties, and<i>to labor in the most honorable cause that ever graced the pages of human existence"</i>(<i>History of the Church,</i>vol. 4, pp. 39, 40).<br><br>It is our blessing, sustained by the tithes and the prayers of the Saints all across the world, to work in "the most honorable cause that ever graced the pages of human existence." In an inescapably significant sense, we<i>belong</i>to the Church. We sometimes say to one another, "Yes, I belong to the Church." Ordinarily that means "I'm a Church member. I belong to the Third Ward." But there is quite another meaning to the phrase, and it applies to only a select few people who serve on a daily basis, as we do, the interests of the entire Church. In an almost sacred sense, we<i>belong</i>to the Church.<br><br>Who are those people we serve? Some would say they are just a friendly bunch of college students. But they are also the Saints of the Most High, the true followers of Christ, those for whom he pleaded to his Father as "those whom thou hast given me." Our relationship with them is more than a simple business contact. Our highest desire should be to think of them--and of each other--even as the Savior does. Remember his words: "He that is not the shepherd, [but an hireling] whose own the sheep are not, [he] seeth the wolf coming, and leaveth the sheep, and fleeth . . . because he is an hireling, and careth not for the sheep . . . [But I,] I lay down my life for the sheep" (John 10:12–15).<br><br>May his love for his sheep fill each of us, no matter where we work on the campus. may we lay down our lives for those sheep, a day at a time, in a service that partakes of the most honorable cause that ever graced the pages of human existence.<br><br><i>Bruce C.

<h1> BYU: Spiritually, Academically, &amp; Financially Sound - Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I have now served as your president for two years and two months, and this is my third university conference. I have enjoyed the experience immensely, more than I thought I would. Part of the reason is that for me this is more than another employment. It is an affiliation with an institution for which I deeply care and whose mission I am convinced is a very important one. Another reason the experience has been such a good one is the supportiveness that I have felt from all of you. On a daily basis, I can observe and seethe benefits of the outstanding efforts and dedication of the members of our President's Council. Each is just right for the position, and each discharges it magnificently. And my gratitude for similar dedicated efforts runs through the entire university community, administration, faculty, and staff. We are a team, and we are a good one. I thank you, and I look forward to our further united efforts.<br><br>For several reasons, this seems like an appropriate time to review generally the state of our university, including where we are and where we ought to be going.<br><br>Let me begin with the big picture. In my opinion, Brigham Young University is as sound spiritually, academically, and financially as at any time in our history. The two most important components for an institution with a teaching mission are its faculty and its students, because good teaching occurs when you put good teachers in a classroom with good students. We have had an excellent faculty recruiting year, which will materially strengthen our quality as a university, and every objective criterion available to us indicates that this year's incoming student class may be the strongest ever.<br><br>The central mission of this university--indeed our sole reason for being--is now quite clear to me. Brigham Young University is an integral part of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. It exists because it can contribute to kingdom building in ways that can be done by no other organization or entity within the Church. The most obvious and most important of these is the university's ongoing contribution to creating and maintaining a core of well-trained young professionals and others with great faith who will provide tomorrow's leadership and role models. Other distinctive contributions relate principally to the general enhancement of the Church's reputation, and therefore to its long-range ability to spread the message of the Restoration and perfect the Saints.<br><br>Everything that we do should be measured by our place within the larger kingdom. In order to fulfill our role, we must first be a very good university, measured by the standards applicable to universities generally. Neither our students nor our academic contemporaries will take seriously our efforts to combine technical learning with higher values--to blend learning by study and also by faith--unless we have first satisfied both those we teach and our peers at other universities of our technical competence and accomplishments within our own fields.<br><br>Against that background, then, let me turn to a brief review of some of the things that have happened over the past year, and some of the directions in which I see us going.<br><br>The most significant BYU event that has occurred over this past year was a special four-hour meeting with the board of trustees held just a little over two months ago, on June 5. as you know, our board is composed of the First Presidency, seven members of the Quorum of the Twelve, a member of the Presiding Bishopric, and the presidents of the Relief Society and Young Women organizations. The June 5 meeting was unusual in that all of the members of the Quorum of the Twelve (not just our board members) were invited. The results were, in my opinion, correspondingly significant for the future of BYU.<br><br>The central focus of that June 5 meeting was, what kind of university BYU should be, not just right now, but over the balance of this decade, and even beyond. We also touched at several points on what would be required to reach where we want to be, though most of those issues remain to be developed.<br><br>Neither time nor propriety permit me to review in detail everything that happened at that meeting, but I will discuss what I believe were its three most significant conclusions. Each of the three is important not only in its own right, but also as an applied subset of our existence as an integral part of the larger Church.<br><br>The first concerned the matter of our long-range governance and the preservation of our uniqueness within the larger community of American institutions of higher education. The premise from which we began that discussion two and a half months ago, and from which I begin this one with you this morning, concerns the importance of maintaining our traditional governance structure and the relationship that that structure bears to preserving our religious anchorage. Historically central to our governance has been the personal involvement and attention of the First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve. To me the advantages to that kind of representation on our board of trustees are obvious. Let me explain why.<br><br>We are distinctive among American universities, because we are not only a good university, but also because we can combine our academic mission with a set of values that are unique to us. Literally unique. Our goal is to blend technical traditional academic training with restored truth into a single whole that develops not just the mind, but the entire eternal soul. Obviously, our effectiveness in carrying out that central objective, and making our distinctive contribution to the total process of kingdom building, is not only well served by a board of trustees that includes people whom we recognize and sustain as prophets, seers, and revelators; I doubt that over the long run we could sustain our mission in any other way. In short, the responsibility for the university must remain with the same people who are entitled to divine inspiration for the entire Church of which we are an inseparable part.<br><br>The other, and to me equally obvious, side of that same coin is that with a Church whose active membership is growing at an astounding rate, and a First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve whose memberships are set by scripture at three and twelve, the ability of the members of those quorums to continue to give our large policy concerns the attention that thy need in order to preserve our uniqueness and our strength could be at stake over the long run. What the board agreed to in our meeting of June 5 was a set of procedures that I am confident will give us the kind of continuing input that will not only assist us in preserving our identity, but will also give us more focused policy guidance where we need it. The past 26 months have led me to the view that policy guidance by the Brethren on some of our larger issues will do more for the health and welfare of this university and its people than any other single development that could occur. I do not make that assertion loosely, and while I cannot give you all the details as to why, I am convinced that it is true. Continuing involvement of the First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve is absolutely essential to the preservation of our uniqueness and our quality, and I believe that the procedures to which the board agreed on June 5 will give us that continued attention, even in the face of other and ever-increasing demands.<br><br>Let me respond just briefly to the opposing point of view, expressed from time to time by thoughtful people, that the governing boards of universities such as ours should be educational experts and not ecclesiastical leaders. I mention in passing that, as Elder Packer noted in an address he gave here last February, we do in fact have among our present board members a rather impressive number who are highly experienced in college and university matters. But beyond that, our entire American experience teaches that the strongest institutions, and those that have withstood the test of time, are those in which the ultimate decision makers on large policy matters are generalists rather than specialists. This is true of all three branches of our constitutionally ordained republic. In the executive branch, we have legions of experts on almost all conceivable issues, from taxes to transportation, from international trade to international health. But the final reviewing authority over all of those experts is vested in generalists, and ultimately in one generalist, the president of the United States. The same is true of Congress, whose members are the final authority over their more expert staffers. The most prominent example in the judicial branch is taxation, which is highly technical and specialized. Many proposals have been made that the decisions of the tax court, which deals only with tax matters, should be reviewed by an equally specialized court of tax appeals, instead of the existing appellate courts, whose jurisdiction sweeps across the spectrum of federal law from bankruptcy to bank robbery, from discrimination to defense. None of those proposals has ever succeeded. In my opinion, they never will, though they will continue to be made from time to time. And why will they not succeed? Because of the soundness of this general principle that the work of specialists should be ultimately reviewed by generalists and not by other specialists.<br><br>The second significant development coming from our June 5 meeting was the board's general approval of the standards and criteria by which we are currently administering the admission of new and transfer students. This approval followed a rather careful and detailed explanation of those standards and criteria, because our board understands, as we do, that few if any subjects are more sensitive to our total constituency and to us than how we allocate the scare admission slots available to us each year.<br><br>In brief, what we seek to do through our admissions system is to admit those persons who will gain the most from a BYU educational experience and will contribute the most in the ways that we want our graduates to contribute. It is not an easy task, and no set of admissions criteria can perfectly draw the kinds of distinctions that ultimately need to be drawn. But we have given a lot of attention to this matter, and the criteria we now use reflect our consciousness of the importance of the underlying issue.<br><br>Our current criteria focus on three things: (1) the applicant's worthiness and willingness to abide by our standards of personal conduct; (2) preparation to do academic work of the quality we offer, ultimately leading to graduation; and (3) personal characteristics suggesting that the applicant an BYU have something to offer each other in terms of our broader mission. The first and third of these general inquiries are quite subjective, and therefore partake of both the strengths and the weaknesses of subjective criteria generally. They are more difficult to apply, more difficult to understand, and therefore subject to greater criticism, particularly by those who are not admitted. They are also much more consumptive of time and resources. But they reflect our present conclusion that we can reach beyond strictly numerical criteria in making our admissions decisions, and that those decisions affect so many people in so many important ways that the risks of departure from strict objectivity may be warranted. At least we are willing to give it a try, and our experience this year was encouraging.<br><br>On June 5, the board reviewed these and other admission challenges that we face, and approved our present approach.<br><br>The third major issue with which the June 5 board meeting dealt concerned the relationships between our teaching and the research, scholarship, and other activities that support our teaching and also have value in their own right. First, the board reaffirmed that our dominant emphasis is to be undergraduate teaching. This was nothing new, in light of our history and the board's previous determination of about a year earlier. My own reasons for believing it is exactly the right general approach are set forth in the remarks that I gave to this body at our last annual conference. It is at the undergraduate level that we have the greatest impact on values that are important to us.<br><br>This year the board went a significant step further and determined not only that our major focus is to be undergraduate teaching, but also that the quality of that teaching effort should be commensurate with the quality of our student body and with the broader objectives that we have set for the university as apart of the total kingdom-building effort. We discussed, and all present understood, that that kind of teaching involves more than disseminating information to students by teachers who have little time for anything else. More specifically, we reviewed again the Carnegie Foundation's categories of American higher education institutions and gave a few well-known examples that fit in the categories on each side of us. Specifically, we made some comparisons between what BYU has done in recent years and what is done by schools that Carnegie classifies as "comprehensive." The Carnegie folks will never classify us as a research university, because research for us is a means to an end, and because the measuring rod for that classification is the amount of annual federal grants. But neither will they classify us as comprehensive, because we do more than just teach classes.<br><br>The board specifically determined and approved our continuing to function at a level beyond the comprehensive category. They understand, as we do, that this means a continuing commitment to the importance of high-quality research and creativity, as well as participation in activities beyond the campus, including seminars, conferences, another activities generally that will keep our faculty intellectually alive and at the forefront of what is happening in their fields. The end objective of these involvements is not only to enhance our ability to provide a high-quality undergraduate education, but also to solidify further BYU's emergence as a respected, first-rate university.<br><br>I hasten to add that in my view we are not yet there. We have made remarkable progress in that direction in recent years and we must continue that progress. In some respects, it will require additional resources, and we continue to consider ways that those can be obtained. But both over the long run in which we continue to work on obtaining them, and over the shorter run, this board decision means that we will continue to place our faculty recruiting emphasis on people who understand what it takes to give our students the very best possible education; people who are committed to keeping themselves at the forefront of their fields; people who regard research, scholarship, and creative work as an essential part of their professional lives; and people who not only have intellectual capacity and curiosity, but are also willing to work hard and use that capacity to its maximum potential. In short, the board understands the direction in which we have been going for the past couple of decades and has approved both the direction and the momentum.<br><br>We intend to take full advantage of that momentum as we replace the unusually large number of retiring faculty members over the remainder of this decade. As I indicated at the outset, I have been very impressed with most of the results that we have had in this respect during the past year, and I look forward to working with you in the future.<br><br>Finally, the board also understands that being a major undergraduate teaching university does not mean that we have no graduate programs. Indeed, the quality of undergraduate education that is our major objective could not be achieved without some graduate programs, and as you know, these presently account for about 10 percent of our student body. From time to time, we may and probably will add some programs and discontinue others, as in fact we already have. But these decisions will not be driven principally by whether they are located at the undergraduate or graduate levels, but by their total effect on, and contribution toward or university and its mission. These decisions, particularly decisions to discontinue, are very painful, and for that and other reasons are not lightly undertaken. But however painful, if we as an administration are to carry out our stewardship in a responsible way, those are the kinds of decisions that we will have to make. There are two crucial components to President Holland's statement that we cannot do everything, but what we choose to do, we will do very well. Both parts are equally important. The first requires a continuing analysis into whether things that are not essential to the university's mission are standing in the way of things that are. And the second requires that our programs be of very high quality. To that end we must have available both the resources and the people that will move us steadily ahead in our effort to become the very best Church university that we can. On June 5 of this year, our board of trustees reaffirmed that they understand these objectives and principles and will work with us toward their achievement.<br><br>The next subject I would like to discuss with you concerns our campus buildings, including those that presently exist, those that are under construction, and those that have been either formally or effectively authorized.<br><br>Over the past two years or so I have reflected with interest on the relationship, both historically and also at the present time, that our university buildings have borne on the achievement of our larger mission. I have concluded, incidentally, that probably the only time in our history when building needs did not occupy a substantial portion of the administration's attention and efforts was in 1875, when we first opened our doors to 29 students in the Lewis Building on Center Street and Third West. I believe it is literally true that over the entire period since then, my predecessors and I have always had to be concerned with space and building needs.<br><br>I am also sure that building concerns were a principal motivation behind our enrollment ceiling, and certainly our enrollment ceiling has had and will have a limiting effect on new building needs. Part of the folklore of our university is that President Wilkinson once assured the board that with the enrollment ceiling, and some then-recently completed structures, the "campus was complete" and that we would never again have to be worried about new bricks and mortar. Whether that story is true or apocryphal, the fact is that in just the two decades since the end of the Wilkinson administration, we have added nine new buildings, including four major academic buildings, for a total of 1,400,000 net additional square feet. How can that possibly be, given the fact of our enrollment ceiling? Is it just a wasteful quirk of universities generally, in which we also participate? Or is it an academic extension of a principle that Parkinson never precisely articulated, but maybe should have? For starters, there are three categories of reasons why, even with a stable enrollment, we will always have a need periodically for new buildings on this campus. There are familiar examples for each of the categories. The first is represented by our beloved old Joseph Smith Building, soon to be replaced by another one that is located nearby and looks very much like its predecessor. As central to our hearts and our university history as the Joseph Smith Building has been, it has now reached the point that it is structurally, mechanically, and in other ways worn out, and as a practical matter cannot be fixed. From time to time, that may happen to other structures as well.<br><br>The second category is represented by another building that played a very prominent role in my own days here as a student, the Eyring Science Center. Unlike the JSB, it need not be torn down, and as a building will still be useful for decades. But not for many of the science functions that it was originally intended to serve. Its category is that of buildings whose academic disciplines--the sciences are probably the classic examples--have changed so significantly that the building can no longer serve its intended purpose. The simple truth of the matter is that if we are going to continue to function as a university, we must continue to teach science, including chemistry and molecular biology, and these can no longer adequately be taught in the Eyring Science Center, which was designed and constructed for a quite different kind of teaching and learning. Accordingly, one of the more significant events that has occurred in the past two years was the board's approval of a new science building, whose architectural and other planning is now well under way, and which will be located on the edge of campus, on the hill just south of our Nicholes Building.<br><br>The third category of university realities that periodically require new buildings, even with an enrollment ceiling, is library expansion. We have not totally solved the dilemma of the university library. The heart of any great university such as we are determined to be is its library. Given our commitment to the kind of school we must be, it is unthinkable that our library should lag behind other aspects of our development. Within the limits of existing understanding and technology, this means that about every 15 to 20 years a university of our quality will be compelled to undertake a major expansion of its library buildings. We have two major libraries on this campus, one of them considerably larger than the other, and both are coming up on the twentieth anniversaries of their most recent building construction. The available other steps that can be taken to relieve the space needs--including satellite storage, microfilm, collapsible shelving, and interlibrary loans--have been exhausted. The options before us now are either to add significantly to existing library space, or start burning books. The board's approval of these library projects is at a stage preliminary to the authorization for the science building, but planning money has been authorized, and we are moving ahead with consultant reports, analysis of long-range needs, and other aspects of the planning that the board has approved. I am grateful, as we all must be, that our board of trustees understands that if we are to continue in the university business, we must not only teach the sciences according to today's standards, but we must also maintain adequate libraries. With them, I can only hope that by the time the next 20-year cycle rolls around, we will have found some better answer to the problem of continually escalating library costs.<br><br>Aside from these categories, we will periodically have other building projects of lesser and different magnitudes. You are all aware of the construction now under way on our foreign-language-house complex and the additions to our married-student housing. The Wilkinson Center needs some major renovations, but the Wilkinson Center also produces a reserve from its operations that should suffice for the purpose.<br><br>Clearly the most ambitious building project presently under construction is our new museum of fine arts, scheduled for completion by about the end of next year. While that one will have definite academic benefits, it is not a classic academic building such as the new JSB or the science building or the library additions. Neither will it produce self-sustaining revenues, as will the foreign-language-house complex and married-student housing facilities. It is an enrichment building. Because it is an enrichment building, it has been financed entirely by donated funds, and the donations have had to include enough to provide an endowment for its continuing maintenance and operation. I am delighted at the prospect of bringing this welcome addition to our campus. And I stand in admiration of the work that has been done by our development people, by Dean Mason, and by others in raising the money to build and operate it. But I have had sufficient involvement in that particular effort to realize just how difficult it is to finance a building in that way. It has left me with skepticism about undertaking such an effort unless there is solid indication of strong financial interest and an equally compelling need.<br><br>Before I leave the subject of buildings, I want to make one more observation about what I consider to be one of the strengths of our traditions, as reflected in our physical plant. Over the decades, our board has followed a policy for financing academic buildings that for the most part has permitted us to incorporate those buildings themselves as part of the teaching process. Let me explain. Our objective is to train people not just to be technically competent, but also to incorporate into their professions and other work the larger values that are the bedrock principles of the gospel. Precisely because of the names that almost all of our academic buildings bear, the buildings themselves, I believe, can and in some instances do play a not inconsequential role in that teaching process. We teach our business and finance classes in a building named for N. Eldon Tanner. No one in our history has better combined Christian values and sound business principles. The same can be said for so many buildings on this campus. We teach science in buildings named for people like Eyring, Martin, and Nicholes, math in a building that bears the name of James E. Talmage, and law in the J. Reuben Clark Building. We teach educators in the David O. McKay Building, humanities in the Jesse Knight Building, religion in the Joseph Smith Building, and military science and physical education in buildings named after Daniel H. Wells and Stephen L Richards. And there are other examples.<br><br>I want to discuss next the role of athletics at BYU. Unlike today's other subjects, this one is not central to the performance of our larger mission. But while not essential, it is important, and I believe makes our university a more interesting and attractive place in which to work and live. I also believe, frankly--though I cannot empirically support it--that the winning traditions of our teams, especially in recent years, have contributed to upgrading the quality of both or faculty and our students. I have little doubt that they have contributed toward the general sense of pride and community spirit that are important to us. Again, to quote President Holland, "It's a little hard to rally round the math building."<br><br>The United States is apparently the only nation in the world that incorporates competitive athletics as an integral part of its college and university programs. Competitive sports certainly exist in other countries, but the major programs are sponsored through clubs, whereas college and university involvement in sports is more on the order of what we would regard as intramural. And even within this country, there are prominent examples of very successful institutions of higher learning whose academic achievements appear not to have been affected adversely by the absence of participation in intercollegiate athletic competition. Over the past 26 months, I have talked to several people who are convinced that in this respect, other countries got it right and the United States got it wrong. Several thoughtful university presidents have expressed to me in private that they would get out of the intercollegiate athletic competition business altogether if there were any way they could. Though they have not put it in these terms, I get the impression that they would compare it to drug addiction: Don't ever get started, because once you do, it's almost impossible to stop it.<br><br>I want you to know that I do not feel at all that way about our program at BYU. On balance, I believe that the effect of athletics on this campus is very positive, for reasons that I mentioned earlier. It is also a source of some pride, not only because of our accomplishments on the field, the court, and the track, but also related to higher objectives for which we stand. Just this last summer, I was pleased to learn that this university is one of only six Division I schools (out of 296) that has never been assessed with a major penalty by the NCAA. The number of university administrators who are aware of this fact is not inconsequential, and this contributes to our university character image in just exactly the right way. It is a tribute to our school and particularly our athletic administration and coaches that we have been able to sustain a program that is highly successful (consistently ranking in the top twenty in total team sports) while still being financially self-sustaining and free of major NCAA violations.<br><br>The final entry in this necessarily limited review of important events that have happened over the past year is the valuable work that has been done by our Honor Code and Dress and Grooming Standards Review Committee, under the able chairmanship of R. J. Snow. Some have asked whether our standards have been relaxed. They have not. The work of that committee has been to reaffirm and to strengthen. Most of the strengthening will come through implementation procedures, involving principally student honor councils, whose effort will be to help all of us understand that the ownership of these standards is university-wide and that all have a stake in them. I assume that the questions about possible relaxation relate to the fact that we now permit knee-length shorts. What we should all remember is that knee-length shorts are, if anything, more modest than knee-length skirts, which have long been permitted. I think that our basic challenge is to educate some of our students as to exactly where the knee is, and for this purpose I have prepared a visual aid. [Slide 1: President Lee in casual wear, including knee-length shorts.] Note the happy, satisfied look on this particular person's face because he knows he is in conformity with BYU's dress and grooming standards. Note also the versatility with which these knee-length shorts can be used as part of a carefully chosen wardrobe. [Slide 2: President Lee in formal wear, except for the same knee-length shorts.] My personal views about the importance of both an honor code and dress and grooming standard such as the ones we have and are trying to build are strongly held and rooted in years of experience at BYU. Some of the requirements are to trivialize, and even demean, as inconsistent with a serious academic undertaking such as the one in which we are engaged. I see the total package, both honor code and dress and grooming standards, as lying at the core of what we are trying to do, because both relate to our spiritual and intellectual tone and to the environment in which we teach and learn and live. Some of the provisions are solidly based on scripture. Others are rooted in considerations of basic honesty, including academic honesty. All of those, I assume, are beyond any question.<br><br>There are other provisions that vary significantly in the degree of enthusiasm they attract. But one of the hallmarks of any civilized society is that lines must be drawn, decisions must be made, and one they are, reaction to them will range from enthusiasm on one end to antagonism on the other, with indifference in the middle. But it is also one of the marks of a civilized society--indeed one of its absolute prerequisites--that once environmental or any other kind of rules are adopted they should be followed, especially when those rules have been adopted by a reasonable process with opportunity for input by representatives of those interested. There are in our society many who disagree with many of our rules, ranging all the way from taxes to safety to defense. But we obey them, including the ones with which we disagree. The alternative, ultimately, is anarchy.<br><br>One of the most important lessons that I hope we are trying to teach here is what it takes to be a good citizen and a to function as a contributing member of society. The importance of rules of conduct is central to that effort, and we promote it by helping not only our students but all members of the BYU community to respect our honor code and dress and grooming standards. It follows that the implementation of these standards is the business of everyone at BYU: the faculty in the classrooms; our auxiliary services people in the dorms, cafeterias, and the bookstore; our librarians; student leaders; everyone. For reasons that I have just stated, I take these issues very seriously, and I hope that each of you will also. I hope that all of us can come to regard these honor code and dress and grooming standards as involving no lesser values than environmental issues of the most elementary quality, as issues of right and wrong that go beyond environmental preservation. The code and standards belong to all of us, and I hope we will take our ownership seriously. Toward that end, permit me to point out two things.<br><br>First, this campus is the place where we live and work and study and learn. There is no other place like it in the world, and that is by design rather than by accident. Our ability to do what we want to do here depends in no small part on the environment in which we operate, and the honor code and dress and grooming standards play a significant role in maintaining that environment, including not only its physical aspects, but also its intellectual and moral. Second, ours is a teaching mission. Among the things that we teach is the responsibility of each citizen within a society or community to live by the rules that hold the society together. In any society of any complexity and any sophistication, many of its members will disagree with some of those rules. And one of the lessons of life and citizenship that we absolutely must teach at this university is that responsible citizenship does not permit individuals to pick and choose among those rules that he or she elects to follow. We can try to get them changed, through the regularly designated processes. But failing that, we obey the rules, including the ones we think are silly. If you like, I can give you a long list of rules that I follow every day just because they are rules, notwithstanding my conclusion that they are silly.<br><br>We are dealing here with principles that are far more important than hair lengths, earrings in male ears, beards, and knee-length shorts. At stake are issues of morality and good citizenship. Some are issues that lie at the core of restored truth, and all lie at the core of the ability of any society, including the family, the university, and the nation, to sustain itself as an institution, rather than degenerating into a collection of free-wheeling self-expressionists.<br><br>Every member of the groups has an interest in the continuing health and vitality of that principle. If we see someone polluting our environment, or killing our neighbor, or defacing public buildings, we are just kidding ourselves if we think that the highest principles of morality require us to say or do nothing. And so I invite every member of our university community to join with us in a special effort throughout this coming year to help educate our students not only where on the human body the knee is really located, but also about honesty and morality and that fundamental principles of good citizenship require obedience to the rules by which society exists, including those rules with which we agree and those with which we do not.<br><br>I will also at this time express my conviction that we are engaged here at BYU in something very worthwhile, something that has both intellectual and also spiritual dimensions of great significance for us and our students. That each of us will lend an effort commensurate with the importance of what we are about is my prayer in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Rex E.

<h1>: a Moral Act - Henry B. Eyring - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
<h2>You Are All Teachers</h2><br>I am grateful to have been invited here tonight for many reasons. One reason is that I was able to bring my wife and my daughters. My wife Kathy loved the years I was a university professor. Wistfully, from time to time she asks, "Will we ever go back to the campus?" So every time you invite me here with her, you are moving forward my courtship. I am delighted that she could be here and that we are with you, as teachers, tonight.<br><br>Now, some of you may wonder if I know that you are not all on a list of the faculty; but you all are teachers. My two sons, the first two that came here, probably feel as close to and as cared about by the people in the admissions office as they do their teaching faculty. I have another son who decided what this university was like from the way he was treated in the dorms, before he ever went to a class.<br><br>I once was the janitor in the Mines and Mineral Industries Building at the University of Utah. My supervisor there may have given me more lasting lessons than I got from the Physics Department. And the Physics Department did a lot for me.<br><h2>What It&#39;s Like to Be a Student</h2><br>My wife Kathy may not think of herself as having been a teacher at Ricks College. While I was there, I taught a class each term. I keep meeting our former students; occasionally they will say they attended one of the classes I taught. More often they will say, " Do you remember when we came to your house?" Then they will describe an evening. Those students remember, and they appreciate Kathy. So I'd say to the spouses who are here, and to all of us: When we so much as speak to a student, we are teachers. Tonight I would like to try, if the Spirit will allow me, to help us all remember what it is like to be a student. Do you remember starting at some school? Each of us could tell a story. I grew up in Princeton, New Jersey. I can remember how my cousins helped me. When I moved from New Jersey to Salt Lake City to go to public school, my cousins from the West said the kids would stone me with my New Jersey accent. I got rid of it quickly, out of fear. I remember terror as I walked up to the junior high school on the first day.<br><br>A few years later--I don't know how it happened--but after basketball season I left high school and went without my high school classmates to the University of Utah. I can remember those first days--the Physics Department and the Mathematics Department didn't seem very friendly to me. I remember my fear.<br><br>I went from there to the United States Air Force and somehow decided that physics would not be my life's work. I thought I needed something else for education so I tried a place I had heard of called the Harvard Graduate School of Business. I was so naïve I didn't know it might be hard to be admitted. I know now that it was a miracle that I was accepted.<br><br>I can remember parting from my father on a street corner in New York City. For some reason he was there for scientific meetings. I was on my way to the Harvard Business School in my Ivy League suit, or so I thought. That suit was later borrowed by my roommate, who had been a Harvard undergraduate. He wore it to a costume party as a gangster suit, which offended me some. He wore a black shirt and a white tie with it.<br><br>When I parted from dad in my new suit, it was one of those great moments in life when I was going off to school. I looked back at him. Later he said to me that I looked forlorn, but I remember feeling sorry for him. To him I was a frightened student. I didn't know what a balance sheet was. I didn't know what a pro-forma cash flow looked like. I was a physics student about to be lost in the Harvard Business School.<br><br>From there I went to Stanford University. Kathy was nice enough to marry me. Her first adventures in cooking for us were to find some morning menu that I could keep down on my nervous stomach as I went off to meet those apparently confident Stanford students. I wondered how I could teach them, until I found out that they were scared, too.<br><br>You remember the interesting contrasts of your life as a student. I have emphasized the fear, which is probably a better thing to think about when you were with students. But the other side is there, too. I can remember sometimes when I thought I knew a very great deal. Sometimes I thought I knew so much that I bordered on feeling I could "know for myself," as the scriptures say. I suppose all of us as students and as teachers see that interesting swing, which we all seem to make at times. Sometimes we feel so overwhelmed that we are sure we can't learn; at other times we know so much that almost no one can teach us. I don't think we are looking for some middle ground; that is not what we are looking for. Rather, there is another place, almost a magic place, not halfway between being terrified and being vain, but another place where both vanity and fear are muted, not simply balanced.<br><br>I saw it once in a meeting of the American Chemical Society in New York City. Some of you would perhaps not know my father was a well-known chemist. At one time he was president of the American Chemical Society. I thought he was quite a fellow and would be immune to any sort of criticism.<br><br>My father was presenting a paper at this meeting. In the middle of his presentation, someone stood up and interrupted him. I didn't think that was the way things were done, but apparently this man stood up in front of everyone and said, "Professor Eyring, I have heard you on the other side of this question." I am not reproducing the sting that it had to it. It had a cut to it. I could feel the electricity. I thought: "Oh, I am seeing my father attacked in public, and I know he has a temper. Oh dear, oh dear. What might happen here." At least I knew if I had spoken to him that way, I would have had quite an experience. But Dad laughed in the most pleasant way. He chuckled and said: "Oh, you are right. I have been on the other side of this question. Not only that, but I have been on several sides of this question. In fact, I will get on every side of this question I can find until I can understand it." And on he went in his presentation, as happily as could be. Now that was much more than a clever rejoinder. That was a glimpse for a moment of that happy place which I think is best described this way: He took delight in struggling with what he didn't know because he had no feeling of limits on what he might know. That made him not only a powerful learner, but someone who was not in much danger of quitting because he was afraid or fearful. He was also not in much danger of feeling that he knew so much he couldn't be taught.<br><br>When people would call him humble, my mother would respond: "You don't know him. He is the most self-assured man I have ever known." And both descriptions were true. I don't know if it was the magic of his mother's rearing. I think she had something to do with it. She always told him he was perfect. His sisters are here this evening, and they know he wasn't. They also know their mother said that to him, and that he believed it. Isn't that strange that he would. My mother didn't' say it as often, if at all, which bothered him a little. He took "perfect" in an interesting way. He always thought of himself as a little boy, as a child with so much to learn. He was always willing to put aside the last theory he had propounded. He regularly felt, "I have been on every side of this question, and I will get on every side I can discover until I get a better answer."<br><br>My guess is that what matters most, as you and I try to help our students, will not be so much whether they master a particular subject or pass our exam. That will matter some, but what will matter most is what they learn from us about who they really are and what they can really become. My guess is that they won't learn it so much from lectures. They will get it from feelings of who you are, who you think they are, and what you think they might become.<br><br>Let me describe to you a teacher. He is someone I would like very much to be like. I got a book from him recently. Some of you in the room know him, and you may have gotten the book, too. It is called<i>Education for Judgment</i>. He is one of the editors. His name is C. Roland Christensen.<br><br>I wish he were here tonight. I wish I had the chance to sit again at his feet. Let me give you the feeling of what that would be like by reading to you a few lines. One is not in the book itself. It is in the flyleaf. Now remember, this was written to me. I am reading it not because I deserve the praise, but because he makes me believe that someday I will. You can't get the flavor of this unless you realize that this is a man who is a university professor at Harvard. That is not simply a professor in the university, but one of the few that Harvard names what they call university professors, with the right to teach a course anywhere they choose to in the university. As far as I know, he is the first ever appointed by the university from the Business School.<br><br>I was his student more than 30 years ago. I have seen him only twice in the years since. I am one of thousands of his students, and yet listen to what is in the flyleaf.<br><br><i>To: Hal Eyring</i><br><br><i>Friend</i><br><br><i>Colleague</i><br><br><i>Teacher--not simply to the mind but to the spirit and soul of his many students. With respect, admiration, and appreciation.</i><br><br><i>Chris</i><br><br><i>Harvard University</i><br><br><i>July 10, 1991</i><br><br>He tried to get me to call him Chris. Others do, but I never will. It isn't just a mark of respect for me. It is that I am afraid that if I did I might lose the magic spell of his faith in me, which still draws me on.<br><br>Let me read to you a few lines from what he wrote in the book. I have chosen these lines at random. As I read them. I would like you to think of a scripture. Professor Christensen may have seen it once. I don't know if he really knows what it means as well as you do, but somehow he has discovered its meaning. Listen to the scripture.<br><br>"Let no man deceive himself. If any man among you seemeth to be wise in this world, let him become a fool, that he may be wise" (1 Corinthians 3:18).<br><br>That scripture describes that special place I want to be in, and you want your students to be in, where you are a fearless learner and also not in much danger of being vain. If that is what it means to give a student a great education, and I think it is, then listen to the words of C. Roland Christensen about how that can be done. I have taken them out of context, but they stand well alone.<br><h2>Teaching as a Moral Act</h2><br>"I believe that teaching is a moral act" (C. Roland Christensen,<i>Education for Judgment</i>, p.117).<br><br>Then, in another place: "To me, faith is the indispensable dimension of teaching life. Why, then, is it so rarely mentioned?" (p. 116).<br><br>And then this: "I believe in the unlimited potential of every student. At first glance they range, like instructors, from mediocre to magnificent. But potential is invisible to the superficial gaze. It takes faith to discern it, but I have witnessed too many academic miracles to doubt its existence. I now view each student as 'material for a work of art.' If I have faith, deep faith, in students' capacities for creativity and growth, how very much we can accomplish together. If, on the other hand, I fail to believe in that potential, my failure sows seeds of doubt. Students read our negative signals, however carefully cloaked, and retreat from creative risk to the 'just possible.' When this happens, everyone loses" (p. 188).<br><br>Now may I say simply that I think he is right. Teaching is a moral act. Faith is indispensable to teaching. We hardly know the potential of our students, but we send them signals each time we doubt and each time we believe. You might ask, "What does that have to do with this fall, my classes, my students, and the people that I will see." I would answer that this way.<br><br>I wish I could have been here for President Lee's talk that he gave at the beginning of this conference. He was nice enough to send a copy to me. I read it very carefully. I assume it will be published. I saw in it opportunity of the most exciting kind. There are three things, particularly, I wanted to point out tonight. Not only did he sketch, at least for me, all the opportunity anyone could ever want who sees teaching as a moral act, but also he did it in a way that makes me admire him even more. Let me take them one at a time.<br><br>One of the things that he said had to do with admissions of students. I, as a member of the board of trustees, was blessed to be in the room where some of the things that he mentioned in that talk were decided. I would say two things. One is that he was accurate in describing not just the acquiescence of the board but the complete sharing of the desires he described with you. Also, I must say to President Lee and to those around him that that happened in an almost miraculous way. The board includes busy men with much to be concerned about in their sacred callings. A meeting was called to deal with issues of a rather intricate kind. It was lengthy. It would be so easy for them not to have the experience, which they did have, which I really believe brought down the powers of heaven. I have been in many meetings. I don't think I have ever seen the unanimity and the feeling of confidence that "this is right" any more clearly and firmly than I felt in that meeting.<br><br>Let me choose two of the things he talked about that came from that meeting, and one other that he planned to use in his talk. The first one had to do with students being admitted. Here is what I read in President Lee's talk. He described how we would admit students. "We can reach beyond strictly numerical criteria in making our admissions decisions, and that those decisions affect so many people in so many important ways that the risks of departure from strict objectivity may be warranted. At least we are willing to give it a try, and our experience this year was encouraging" (President Rex E. Lee, Annual University Conference Address, August 26, 1991).<br><br>What that is saying in practical terms is that there was, with the board's enthusiastic support, a commitment to find a way to admit some students who will have done less well on tests and will have done less well on high school grades than their fellow students, with whom they will compete. There will be a wider range of what we call academic abilities. To some extent that has always been true. There have always been students here who have struggled, and you have all worked with them in various ways. This is a decision to seek to admit more students who will feel--at least as they begin with you--almost overwhelmed.<br><br>It is for that reason perhaps that I see such a great opportunity. Think of Professor Christensen and think of the signals that you can send.<br><br>I would like, if I might, to suggest a simple scripture that perhaps you may never have applied before in quite the way that I think you can. Do you remember what it was like to be told you were wrong or that you didn't understand when you weren't sure you could do the work at all? My life was marginal, as I viewed it, in the Physics Department of the University of Utah. Some of those professors had a way of emphasizing to me my inadequacies. And some didn't. May I make a suggestion that you can be one who can lift, not crush. May I suggest a scripture to guide you. It is one you know well.<br><br><i>Reproving betimes with sharpness, when moved upon by the Holy Ghost; and then showing forth afterwards an increase of love toward him whom thou hast reproved, lest he esteem thee to be his enemy.</i>[Doctrine and Covenants 121:43]<br><br>I have done what a number of you have probably done. I have tried different dictionaries on the word "betimes." I found at least three meanings that might give some encouragement to you.<br><br>One interesting meaning for betimes is "early." Might I suggest that if you will watch and if you will seek to be moved upon by the Holy Spirit, you will know which of your students are in trouble. Don't wait too long. Many of them will dig holes so deep they will never get out. Go to them early with help.<br><br>A second meaning of the word betimes is "timely," or "at the right time." Might I suggest that generally, particularly for the very fragile, the right time is when others aren't around. I know how busy you are. I know that you are saying: "Oh, Brother Eyring, come on. With the load I have, with the number of students, with the things I have to do, don't you know you are asking an impossible thing?" I know it is hard, but I will give you this encouragement. You don't have to have a private interview with every student in trouble, every time. In fact, for many of those students it will be rare that anyone ever did it. If you reach out, now and then, and just enough of you do, the university will be for them a different place. And the help may matter less than that the help was offered.<br><br>Now I would give you this other suggestion that "betimes" sometimes means "not too frequently." I suppose what that means is be careful as you visit with them that you don't always talk only about their failures. You see, what touched me about that inscription from Professor Christensen is that he left out all of my weaknesses and instead described the hints he sees in me of what I might become.<br><br>In a few years people may ask: "Well, did the experiment work? Did the attempt to admit students with a wider range of abilities work?" The answer is: It all depends on you. If you simply drop them in the caldron of competition, give them the same kinds of tests, do the same kinds of things that perhaps made them predict to be a little poorer students, then the will turn out not to be good students. And you can brand them failures very easily. On the other hand, if you really believe that they are children of God, and that they are not that much below you, because you also are a child of God, then when you are with them, they will feel it. They will get your signal, and you will do something for them that goes beyond what the world calls teaching. You will have performed a moral act that will last a lifetime and into eternity.<br><br>There is another thing that President Lee was going to talk about. I was absolutely entranced by a part of the manuscript I read that he never reached because he ran out of time. So I need to do this very carefully because he may want to use that part sometime. In fact, I encourage him to use it sometime. The nature of it is personal enough that I must do this carefully. He issued a rebuke, with authority, as skillfully as I have seen it done. I believe, President Lee, that you were inspired not to have time to include it. If the first thing I said about how to correct people is true, then you will probably want to do that masterful teaching in a private setting. What he planned to do was this.<br><br>Apparently something was written in the student newspaper that took a position. I understand it said something along the line that it is a higher moral standard to let other students make their own choices without interference, including breaking the rules of the university. President Lee's comments, which he planned to make, had a happy tone. Always give a rebuke with a smile when you can. This one was jolly. He said something to the effect: "We really believe in free speech, and one of the benefits of free speech is that others will speak freely to you. And so they expressed an opinion, and I will now give you mine." He did it in the nicest way. Bt it wasn't just the manner, it was the content. He said in essence: "Let's take your argument and see where it leads. Let's consider the position you took and see what it would lead people to do." He then piled example upon example of how it would lead to things that surely the writer would see as terrible. Then, rather than saying "aha" or "gotcha," he ended by saying essentially, "Well, the responsibility you must take for the likely results of your position is something you would want to consider very seriously."<br><br>One of the things that you and I exert is authority. In that moment I thought the president was planning to send, and perhaps will in private, the most wonderful signal. It is a signal that has been used on me over and over again, and it has blessed my life. The signal that he planned was really a simple one. It was that you can trust most people who have the right to the Holy Ghost. You can point out to them the results of their behavior, at least the likely results of their behavior, and then you can gently say, "You really are responsible." Then, they will likely correct themselves.<br><br>The theme for this conference is, "Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty" (2 Corinthians 3:17). In an interesting paradox, I would say, "And where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is real authority," because if you believe enough, and communicate that belief, the Holy Spirit will rebuke better than you could with all your human authority.<br><br>I have lived in some fairly dictatorial situations, and yet I have not felt oppressed. I was once in a situation where I was invited to join a coup in an academic situation. Other people, who were working in the same situation I was, decided that they had had enough of what they saw as a dictator. They wanted me to help him get ousted. I remember getting the phone call and being absolutely stunned because oppression had never occurred to me. I told the caller that I was not interested in the coup. I literally did not feel oppressed. And I tried to figure out why.<br><br>I will tell you what I learned about myself and about you. Somebody, somewhere along the line, must have trusted me and said: "Look, Hal, I will exert my authority upon you this way. I believe in you. I believe that God can correct you, so I will point out the consequences of your behavior and then not push you very hard." As a result, I have always felt free, even when some people tried to push me.<br><br>I believe not so much in the perfection of my bosses or my critics as I believe that I am still a child with lots to learn. Most folks can teach me something. No one can really talk away the freedom that matters to me, and most criticism from human beings awakens an echo of a rebuke I've already felt from the Holy Ghost.<br><br>You can turn out students who spend their lives rebelling at authority. Many universities do. The riot police in most major cities in the world spend their time near universities for good reasons. But you could help students as your great president was going to do, and now will probably do in some private setting, by saying: "I believe in you. I believe in you enough to give you a different opinion. Here it is. Look at the implications of your opinion. You are responsible for our opinion and I am responsible for mine. And I believe that you can receive correction from the Holy Ghost. Ask for it." The person may not agree, but, oh, what you will have told them about themselves, and about authority, and about the gift of the Holy Ghost. When someone does it that way to you, what a compliment they have paid you.<br><br>President Lee talked about one other thing. He said: "This board decision (he is now speaking about the nature of the university) means that we will continue to place our faculty recruiting emphasis on people who understand what it takes to give our students the very best possible education . . . people who not only have intellectual capacity and curiosity, but are also willing to work hard and use that capacity to its maximum potential. In short, the board understands the direction in which we have been going for the past couple of decades and has approved both the direction and the momentum.<br><br>"We intend to take full advantage of that momentum as we replace the unusually large number of retiring faculty members over the remainder of this decade" (President Rex E. Lee, Annual University Conference Address, August 26, 1991).<br><br>Now, let me tell you the little I know about how you make universities better places to get an education. I had the blessing of being invited to join the faculty at the Stanford Graduate School of Business. For many years it had been thought of as a nice graduate school of business, but Harvard and some others were the stars. At that time, the faculty made a decision to make their school as good as any other business school in the world. They got the financial resources together. They got Dean Arbuckle, who hired me. I came in the first wave of hiring. He hired others. I will name names: Jerry Sharp, who has won the Nobel Prize in economics; Lee Bach, who had been the founding dean of the Management School at the Carnegie Institute of Technology, which pioneered the use of mathematical techniques in business; Hall Leavitt, who had been at Chicago and MIT; and others you might not know. They were stars in the world of business schools.<br><br>I watched the results. I don't know if you believe the rankings, but we got ranked number one just after I left. But something happened quite apart from rankings. We got better students, but we also provided them a better education. That came only partly because we hired stars.<br><br>To those of you who are here I urge: Don't wait for the new arrivals. What happened at Stanford occurred, I believe, because the stars, when they came, found a solid core of real teachers. Let me describe them to you. By the way, this is my answer to the question of how research and teaching relate. My answer is that there are all kinds of teaching and there are all kinds of research, and the best of both have the same process at their centers.<br><br>Students, when they learn, have an experience like discovery. It can be frightening to them. To them, that first course in a subject is an unknown continent, strange and frightening and threatening, because not only is it hard to learn, but exploring it may convince them that they can't learn. It may tell them something about themselves that can devastate them. The teachers who will make the difference are the ones who somehow can enter into that world with the student and feel what they feel, know what they fear, care about their fear, and help them move through the fear to learning. Research, of the right kind, can take a teacher into a world like the one a student must enter.<br><br>I will say something that could offend, but I will run that risk. I know how hiring gets done in some places where I have been. Although we always tried to look for broad criteria, we counted the number of published papers. Then we looked at the number of published citations a paper got in other people's work to see who was paying attention. We looked at the quality of the journal it was published in and how tough the referees were. We, and you, might not admit we were doing it mathematically, but we added it up to decide who were the best researchers.<br><br>We had some great researchers by those standards at Stanford. Some were great teachers and some were not. I think we were blessed that the ones who saw research wholly or largely as a private enterprise left. They went to more congenial places. The ones who stayed to bless students saw their research not as a path to fame, but as exploration. Many of them didn't keep writing they same paper three different ways with different data. They tried new things. Some of them even tried understanding what it was like to be a student. They cared about studying their own experience in research to find how to help students experience learning.<br><br>Rarely was the research they were doing something that went directly into the classroom, even at the graduate level. The kinds of things they were publishing did not generally go directly into the curriculum. I have heard the argument made that faculty research will bring the newest ideas to the students. That is rarely so at the undergraduate level. But a teacher who sees research as learning can come to care more about how students learn.<br><br>Again let me tell you one more story about dad. This last year my son Matthew was a student in a course on creativity at another university. He said, "Dad, I need an example of something creative." I scratched my head and said, "Well, I think I remember that as your grandfather (that is my father) was dying, he kept talking to me about a new way to teach introductory calculus." He was by that time not very well. He was excited about this new way to learn calculus." I said to Matthew: "Maybe if you asked some of the people who worked with him, you would find something about it. Then you could use that as an example of creativity in teaching."<br><br>Matthew, who idolizes grandpa, dug around and, sure enough, found a written record in dad's papers. He was so excited. He said, "Well, now what do I do with it?" I said: "I don't know. What do you want to do?" He said, "If I am going to write a paper about this creative thing of Grandpa's, I had better find out what a mathematician thinks of it."<br><br>Matthew made an appointment with a professor of mathematics. The professor first would not see him; then he didn't want to read the paper. Finally Matthew persuaded him to read the paper. The professor responded that it was trivial. Only those who have been in mathematics would know that trivial is a real cut. It is almost better to be wrong than to be trivial. Matthew, who is not very experienced in cutting techniques, likely did not know that the professor's intent was to crush him. But the professor succeeded: Matthew wrote a paper on something else.<br><br>Let me tell you the lesson in that story about creativity, research, and teaching. I don't know how many papers Dad turned out, hundreds perhaps, that were published in the most distinguished journals. If you had hired him for that reason at this university, you would have been mistaken. His reputation would have given you some help. You would have had a famous chemist, but you would have hired him for the wrong reason.<br><br>Think of what Professor Eyring was doing with his precious time. Dad was not an amateur mathematician. He knew mathematics. And so, surely he knew that his approach to teaching calculus was not completely novel. My guess is he was open enough and garrulous enough that he probably tried it out on some mathematics professors, probably including the one who would have told him it was "trivial."<br><br>Dad's blessed weakness was that he didn't know failure when it was labeled for him. Isn't that interesting that he was still talking about it as he was dying. "Maybe if I just go back to that one more time. Maybe if I just get on another side of the question, I will see it." Could he ever have published it? No. Feeling like a little child, and being sympathetic to students, he was trying to understand a way to help them. That's the distinguished researcher you'd hire, but find you'd hired a teacher.<br><br>That answers for me the question of how teaching best relates to research. I would suggest to you that you take a chance this year. Some of you are wonderful researchers. I don't want to tell you about your research programs, but I will simply say this: Look at how to present material in a way a young person can understand it better. Try to understand better how young people feel or think. Or perhaps just look at a different problem in your own research. Do whatever will make you feel what they feel, as if they were little children, as they try to learn.<br><br>"Behold, ye are little children and ye cannot bear all things now; ye must grow in grace and in the knowledge of the truth" (Doctrine and Covenants 50:40).<br><br>If your research makes you feel very, very bright or very, very good, or very, very famous, or very, very valuable, that could get in your way as a teacher. If, on the other hand, your research makes you feel very, very vulnerable, very, very anxious to know more, and if you read other people's papers as often as you read your own, if you thrill when someone else gets an idea that makes yours look a little less important or even wrong, if all this seems like a wonderful game to you, then think how you can bless your students.<br><br>If you are someone who doesn't do much research or hasn't done much, don't despair. Anything that you do that makes you feel like a learner, a little frightened but eager to try, and where you can feel the hand of God on you saying, "Don't worry, you can be like me someday"--think what that can do for your teaching. I can't tell you what kind of research or writing or creative work to do, but I can tell you the blessing it can be to our students when it helps you understand how they really feel, how they really fear, how they really struggle, how they wonder what limits there are on what they can become.<br><br>There is a little risk in closing in the way I now intend to do, because I don't want to suggest that what you do and I do approaches what the Savior did. But we can still learn from him. Listen, from Alma:<br><br>"And he shall go forth, suffering pains and afflictions and temptations of every kind; and this that the word might be fulfilled which saith he will take upon him the pains and the sicknesses of his people.<br><br>"And he will take upon him death, that he may loose the bands of death which bind his people; and he will take upon him their infirmities, that his bowels may be filled with mercy, according to the flesh, that he may know according to the flesh how to succor his people according to their infirmities" (Alma 7:11–12).<br><br>If you can feel what it is like to be a student and feel their pains and afflictions, you can make a great difference, a moral difference, in how they feel about who they really are and what they can become.<br><h2>Testimony</h2><br>I bear you my testimony that God lives. He is our Father. Every student of yours, every student of mine, is equally, with us, a child of God. God has promised that all can be like him if we can do some things a child can do. I don't know how that will work in the spirit world in terms of chemistry, mathematics, botany, or whatever we try to teach. I don't know whether it is possible to skip over the hard work that you and I have done. I doubt it. But the people who stop trying to learn because they believe they are incapable are wrong. They, and we, can learn all truth. Be careful what signal you give about where you think the limits are on anyone, including yourself.<br><br>I bear you my testimony that Jesus is the Christ. He understands us. That I know. In this room tonight are people, as there will be in every class you ever teach, who are struggling. Someone here has a dying parent or a dying child. Someone here has a health problem. Someone here is in financial difficulty. Someone here has some other difficulties that I don't know anything about nor could I relieve. But God knows. He not only knows, but Jesus the Christ has felt your infirmities. I pray that you may know that. Think of that when you teach. Perhaps the most important thing you can know is that you are a child of God and that he provided you a Savior. The Savior, in addition to paying the price of all our sins, suffered enough to understand all our pains and all our fears.<br><br>I bear you my testimony that Ezra Taft Benson is a prophet of God. I bear you my testimony that he loves us. If I should not meet with him again, the last incident I will remember is his hand on mine, reaching out to thank me for holding a door. He noticed me. He felt for me. He understood me. I think that is a gift of God, not available only to a prophet but to all of God's children who exercise their faith to receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.<br><br>I am grateful for you. I pray that you may feel God's gratitude and his confidence as you go to teach his children who someday can be like him. Of this I testify in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Henry B.

<h1>Point You in the Right Direction - Janet G. Lee - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
About three months ago, Rex and I attended a commencement exercise for our oldest son Tom, who was graduating from law school. On graduation day, as I strained to get a glimpse of Tom in the sea of caps and gowns, my eyes searched for his face, but my heart and mind were traveling through time to years gone by. My momentary vision was blurred by a flood of memories mixed with tears. Let me share just one of those memories with you.<br><br>I remembered a little boy of three who was trying to write his name. I had written<i>T-O-M</i>out for him on a piece of paper and then left him to practice while I bathed the baby. A little later he proudly showed me his finished product.<i>MOT,</i>it clearly read. Because of my experience as a school teacher, I was aware that young children often read and write in reverse, a condition that sometimes continues into adulthood. Fortunately, it turned out that Tom's problem was easily solved, but at that moment my mind was full of possibilities and solutions.<br><br>I suggested that he write the<i>T</i>first. He came back again a few minutes later with the same result:<i>M-O-T.</i><br><br>I put my hand on his to guide him, explaining that we would begin with the<i>T</i>first, but he pulled away from me insisting, "I always start with the<i>T,</i>and you always say it's wrong. I just can't do it." And with that, he tore the paper into little pieces and threw them away. He was in no mood for a writing lesson, so we went for a walk. Later that night, when he felt like trying again, we got out a new sheet of paper. He wrote his name in big letters (this time for his dad). I watched him from across the room, and he was right. He did start with the<i>T.</i>His problem was that he then moved to the left with the next two letters instead of to the right!<br><br>Before I had a chance to explain that our child's self-esteem was at stake, his dad teased, "Oh, I didn't know we had a little boy named Mot." Well, at that point, the evening was all over for Tom. No amount of praise for the well-formed letters or suggestions that we would help him do it right consoled him. Right there, at age three, Tom believed he was a failure. As I sat by his bed and soothed him to sleep, I knew better. I saw potential in him that he could not see in himself. I knew, though he did not, that he would learn to write his name, but that was not the important point. Even if he never learned to write his name, he would not be a failure in my eyes.<br><br>As I watched his little body relax into sleep and reflected on the day's events, I felt very much the protective parent, and I wondered how often our Heavenly Father sees us in just the same way. Hasn't he told us, "As one whom his mother comforteth, so will I comfort you. . . . And when ye see this, your heart shall rejoice" (Isaiah 66:13–14). How many times when we see ourselves as failures does Heavenly Father wish he could pick us up from despair, hold us in his arms, and tell us that we are not failures and that if we will have faith, he will help us overcome our trials.<br><br>Certainly it would have been easier for me to have written Tom's name correctly every time he wanted it on something, but I knew that the only way he would learn would be for him to do it himself. My job was to show him how, to point him in the right direction. In the same way, our Heavenly Father wants us to grow through our own experiences. This means he probably won't solve our calculus problems for us, pay our tuition, write our English papers, study our chemistry, or turn our roommates into perfect people. But he will help us and give us direction. As<i>we</i>do the work, our Father in Heaven will help lift our burdens. You might think of it as a joint effort. Remember the Lord's promise to us: "Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest" (Matthew 11:28).<br><br>Eventually, Tom was writing his name everywhere (yes, all three letters in the correct order). We found<i>Tom</i>written in chalk on the sidewalk in front of our house, on a piece of paper taped to his bedroom door, in crayon on the kitchen countertop, and written in the dust over and over on our unwashed car. With that last accomplishment he proudly took me outside to show off what he had done. The look of triumph in his eyes made me certain that no amount of three-year-old spit and dust could possibly harm the finish on our car. I gave him a hug and didn't even suggest that we would need to wash the car soon.<br><br>You, too, are on the brink of new and challenging experiences this year, full of wonderful opportunities. Take advantage of them. Work hard to grow and learn. And when you are frustrated and feel like a failure--or want to tear your life into little pieces--just remember our son Mot. At that frustrating moment look for someone who can help you. It might be a parent, a friend, a roommate, a professor, a bishop. Most important, never forget to get on your knees and ask your Heavenly Father to point you in the right direction. In the most loving way he can, the Lord has told us, "Fear not, little flock [for I am with thee]. Look unto me in every thought; doubt not, fear not" (D&amp;amp;C 6:34, 36).<br><br>Our Father in Heaven knows our fears. But he has not left us alone without direction. He has sent his Only Begotten Son to this earth to give us an example of a perfect life--the ultimate visual aid! He has also given us ancient and modern-day scriptures that we can read and reread to keep us on the right path, along with a prophet and apostles to point the way. We have been given all that we need to see clearly which direction we should go, and even if we falter or fall, he is there to lift us up. If we lose our way, he has provided a way back. And when we need direction and reassurance (which we do every day), we can communicate through prayer. Use this source, and never doubt its power. Sometimes when you are discouraged (and we all are from time to time), he may be your only source. He is the right source for a good beginning, and good beginnings can lead to great successes. Our Father in Heaven sees our potential--just as I saw Tom's--and wants us to succeed. He will do everything that he can to see that we do. We need only to do our part.<br><br>Whether it is your first semester or your last, we're glad you're here and pray for your success and happiness, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Janet G. Lee, wife of Rex E. Lee, gave this devotional address at Brigham Young University on 10 September 1991.</i><br><br><i>© Brigham Young University. All rights reserved.</i>

<h1>ities for Learning: Education, Environment, Etiquette - Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
From the time I started the first grade, the early fall season has always held a special fascination for me because it marks the beginning of a new school term. And now it's here again, carrying the same set of pleasant reactions. With you, I look forward to this school year. For some of you this will be your first BYU experience, others are just returning from missions, and for many the next few months will be your last at BYU. But for all of us the year holds great promise, and, like you, I look forward to it.<br><br>I want to talk to you today about three words that begin with the letter<i>e:</i>education, environment, and etiquette.<br><br>The value of education is that, if properly done, it leads to learning, which is one of life's most intriguing processes. Learning can happen in organized, systematic ways with carefully planned classes and curricula. And that's what BYU is all about. I still remember my own experiences on this campus as a student years ago when I learned from inspiring teachers who opened my eyes, my mind, and my spirit to new corners of knowledge. Some of the information that I gained during those times I have continued to use over the years. But most interesting of all was the learning process, the acquisition of new information, and the gaining of new insights.<br><br>Learning can also happen in unexpected ways. Let me tell you of my own recent experience.<br><br>Last May Janet and I spent some time with the Young Ambassadors as they toured the Soviet Union. One morning in the town of Yaraslavl, when we went out for a morning jog, it occurred to me that we would be in real trouble if we got lost. On more than one occasion I have lost my way when I've jogged in a strange town. But it could be a serious problem in a place where we didn't speak a word of the language. My solution, a very logical one, was to memorize the name of our hotel. So, as we left that morning, I saw in big letters across the entrance to our hotel the following letters: P-E-C-T-O-P-A-H.<br><br>Pectopah. I promptly committed the word to memory, and Janet and I left on our sojourn through Yaraslavl confident in the fact that we had an effective safety valve. If we got lost, I would just put on my best inquisitive demeanor, give the name of our hotel, and follow the hand signal directions we would be given.<br><br>Fortunately, we did not get lost, and so I had no need to ask anybody how to get to the Hotel Pectopah. But the next day, in Moscow, I began to notice that same word, again in very prominent letters, across the awnings in front of many of the buildings that I saw. At first I concluded that it must be a chain. Hotels have been named for people like Willard Marriott and Conrad Hilton. Maybe these were in honor of someone named Anatoly or Boris Pectopah. But further observation revealed that my now favorite Russian word (indeed, other than "spaciva," which means thank you, my only word) appeared on establishments that quite clearly could not be hotels. So I asked President Gary Browning, who, when he is not serving as mission president in that part of the world teaches Russian at BYU, what my word really meant. His answer: "Restaurant." The Cyrillic alphabet's<i>p</i>sounds like our<i>r.</i>The<i>c's</i>are always s's, and the<i>h's</i>are<i>n's.</i>And so it isn't<i>Pectopah</i>at all. It's<i>restoran.</i><br><br>I had several reactions to that simple little experience. First, I realized that if we had lost our way that morning, Janet and I would still be wandering around the city of Yaraslavl, where by now we would probably be famous as those crazy people who speak a language that consists of only two words:<i>Hotel Pectopah.</i>Second, I had come up with a rather nice English/Russian cognate:<i>restoran, restaurant.</i>But most important of all, the experience stirred my curiosity, and I started looking for some other words that perhaps I could recognize. The next one, frankly, was easy, because of the logo that appeared right underneath it. Here is the word that I saw: ПЕПСИ. Not so easy, you say? Well, let me show you the logo, and you will see why it was easy. Obviously, the word was<i>Pepsi.</i><br><br>That one, for me, was the real break-through. Substantively, it added only two letters to my growing bundle of knowledge. The Greek letter<i>pi,</i>which is the first letter and the third, is a<i>p,</i>and the backwards<i>n</i>at the end is a vowel that sounds something like our double<i>e.</i>And I could figure that out from the fact that I knew it was<i>Pepsi.</i>But this gave me just enough--partly in information, but more important, in desire to know--to start me looking for all the cognates I could find. There are not, incidentally, very many; indeed, the count is minuscule if compared to Spanish, the one foreign language that I know something about. But my sense of satisfaction and accomplishment grew as I began recognizing words like<i>Pravda, Kremlin, sport,</i>and two very common ones,<i>gastronome and product,</i>both of which, I am told, are roughly equivalent to our word for groceries. Here is a nice one that you should now be able to figure out: РЕКС. That's right, it's my first name.<br><br>Interestingly enough, my greatest satisfaction came from this four-letter word: СТОП. You now have enough information (because I'm sure you've all been carefully following everything I've said) to pronounce that word. Moreover, it's short and fairly easy. And the only place that I saw it was on traffic lights. But I said to myself, "That just can't be. That would make it not just a cognate, but the identical English word." And that, President Browning informed me, is exactly what it is. The word is<i>stop, S-T-O-P,</i>and it is the same in Russian as in English. Same meaning, same usage, and same four-letter spelling--I assume because they borrowed it from us as a total package.<br><br>At one level, what I have just recounted can be viewed as a trivial series of events--of passing interest to me at the time they occurred, but having no lasting value to you or me or anyone else. For the rest of my life, the stop signs with which I will deal will have markings other than the ones I saw in Moscow. But I wish I could tell you how enthused I became each time one of those seemingly inconsequential events unfolded. The reason was, I was learning something--something entirely new--and I believe that learning as a process has its rewards wholly aside from the substance of the thing learned. These occurrences were similar to other experiences that I have had at other times in my life as I have delved into new subjects or discovered new applications or significances to existing ones.<br><br>Some of these have involved the scriptures. I remember how excited I became when several years ago I saw for the first time evidence in the book of Alma that a rule of constitutional law, which represents fifty years of evolving United States Supreme Court jurisprudence and was finally settled in the late 1960s by a case called<i>Brandenburg v. Ohio,</i>had actually been set forth with rather astounding clarity over 2,000 years earlier in the thirtieth chapter of Alma, which gives an account that lawyers might characterize as<i>City of Zarahemla v. Korihor.</i>Another such experience occurred just last January, when I saw for the first time some implications of the Eleventh Amendment to the United States Constitution that I had never before perceived, notwithstanding years of teaching, reading, and arguing Supreme Court cases involving that particular provision of the Constitution. The same thing can happen when I read good books, when I help my daughter with her math, or in an almost endless variety of activities. Janet's recounting of the satisfaction our son Tom felt when he finally learned to write his name so it didn't say "MOT" is a classic example.<br><br>The opportunities for learning are all around us, and when those opportunities materialize, we always have a sense of accomplishment and joy. Two weeks ago, Bishop Eyring, in an address to our faculty, staff, and administrators, said of his father, Henry Eyring, who was a scientist of international repute: "He took delight in what he didn't know, because he saw no limits to what he could learn."<br><br>There are many other things that we could discuss about education, but I'm going to leave you with just that one and move on to my other two<i>e's,</i>environment and etiquette. As applied to us, there is a strong tie between the two.<br><br>The physical environment at BYU is as pleasant and as conducive to living and learning as you will find anywhere. Visitors to our university uniformly comment on it. In part, the attractiveness of our physical surroundings is due to the outstanding work by the many people, including hundreds of students, who care so meticulously for our buildings and grounds.<br><br>But our BYU environment consists of more than green lawns and clean buildings. The people are also part of it, especially the students. Ours is a campus where cleanliness, modesty, orderliness, and general physical appearance count for something. They are important to all of us--important enough that we should put forth some effort to maintain them.<br><br>Our honor code and dress and grooming standards are an integral and essential part of this unique environment. They in fact involve more than just environmental considerations. They are anchored in principles of morality and good citizenship. Some of those moral principles are found in revealed truth, such as our sexual morality and Word of Wisdom standards. Others are based on considerations of cleanliness, modesty, and general appearance, but all are grounded in morals, because they are standards that we committed to keep as a condition of our being here, and keeping commitments is a moral issue of the highest order.<br><br>One of this coming year's activities for which I have the highest hopes is the plan of your student leaders to provide opportunities for all of us to come to a fuller appreciation of why these honor code and dress and grooming standards are such an integral part of what makes BYU what it is. It is my fervent hope that we can all develop not only an understanding, but also a feeling of ownership--that is, a shared stake--in the success of our honor code.<br><br>My final<i>e</i>is etiquette, and it relates to how we treat other people. Every day on this campus there are literally tens of thousands of opportunities for someone to be nice to someone else, or to be not so nice--either to put into practice or to ignore our Savior's most fundamental of all admonitions to be concerned about other people and their welfare and happiness and not just our own. Truly, that admonition is central not only to Christianity and restored truth, but also to human happiness. I am sure that its centrality to human happiness is the reason the Savior made it the cornerstone of his teachings.<br><br>Frankly, I think that with three times as many people on this campus as when I was here as a student, we may have to work at it three times as hard. But I believe it is worth doing. The etiquette to which I refer--a Christ-like niceness, concern--of course includes the maintenance of our environment, including keeping our campus clean and observing the Honor Code and dress and grooming standards. But it also includes elementary principles of Christian living. I can think of no better lesson that all of us could learn from our experience at BYU than the importance of genuinely caring for our neighbor. We have so many opportunities for that here--in the classroom, in our private learning efforts, and in preserving our BYU environment, which is unlike any other.<br><br>These three values that begin with<i>e</i>(education, environment, and etiquette) constitute the tissue of life at BYU. Education is our business, though our scope is broader than at other institutions, and is concerned with the total soul and not just the mind.<br><br>A headline in yesterday's<i>Universe</i>said, "BYU is not so unique after all." The support for this proposition w as that there are other universities that are also founded on religious values. Of course there are, but that fact is irrelevant to our uniqueness. We yield to no one in our respect and our admiration for the strong values, including religiously based values, held by many of our sister institutions. And we of course share many of those same values. Those religious schools help us, and we help them. But those similarities will never make us the same. BYU will always be different--and therefore unique--for the same reasons that the restored kingdom of Jesus Christ is different from other churches and religious endeavors. By definition, there is and can be only one restoration of all things in this dispensation. And only one four-year university is anchored to that restoration. Is it true then that BYU is "not so unique after all"? It is not. Absolutely, we are unique--not in the sense of having<i>a</i>value system or<i>a</i>religious value system, but the principles on which we are built are the principles of restored truth, and they are unique to us for the simple reason that the restored gospel itself is in a class alone. I am grateful that we share values with other universities. I am also grateful that our package has some elements of our own that set us apart from all others.<br><br>Finally, I want to tell you how proud I am of you and how honored I am to count myself among your number. Pride can be a serious defect, but not, I think, the kind that I feel for the overwhelming majority of our students. It thrills me to contemplate the great leadership and other strengths that you represent as part of the restored kingdom of Jesus Christ. We have so much to give, and we can give more abundantly. I look forward to joining hands with you in this endeavor, both over the coming school year as well as in the years ahead. That we may do it well is my prayer, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Rex E. Lee was president of Brigham Young University when this devotional address was given on 10 September 1991.</i><br><br><i>© Brigham Young University. All rights reserved.</i>

<h1> Diligently and Teach One Another Words of Wisdom” - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
My dear young friends in the gospel of Jesus Christ, I am grateful for the opportunity of being with you this evening in the company of my sweetheart of fifty years, whom I met and fell in love with at the BYU.<br><br>My being invited to speak to you provides an opportunity for you to see that spending one's professional life in scientific research does not preclude the development of faith in our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and a firm testimony of the truth of his gospel. It may be useful to you if I share some of the experiences I have had as a professor, as a participant in and director of graduate research in physical chemistry and fuels engineering, as well as experiences twice as an elders quorum president, three times as a bishop, as a Regional Representative, and, currently, as a General Authority.<br><br>One of the very important basic concepts restored through the Prophet Joseph Smith was the concept of the intelligence being eternal. Some of the quotations with which you are very familiar are:<br><br><i>The glory of God is intelligence, or, in other words, light and truth.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 93:36]<br><br><i>Man was also in the beginning with God. Intelligence, or the light of truth, was not created or made, neither indeed can be.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 93:29]<br><br><i>Whatever principle of intelligence we attain unto in this life, it will rise with us in the resurrection.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 130:18]<br><br>The Lord also gave to the Prophet Joseph Smith several revelations concerning the importance of study and learning. For example:<br><br><i>And as all have not faith, seek ye diligently and teach one another words of wisdom; yea, seek ye out of the best books words of wisdom; seek learning, even by study and also by faith.</i><br><br><i>Organize yourselves; prepare every needful thing; and establish a house, even a house of prayer, a house of fasting, a house of faith, a house of learning, a house of glory, a house of order, a house of God.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 88:118–19]<br><br><i>And do thou grant, Holy Father, that all those who shall worship in this house may be taught words of wisdom out of the best books, and that they may seek learning even by study, and also by faith, as thou hast said;</i><br><br><i>And that they may grow up in thee, and receive a fulness of the Holy Ghost, and be organized according to thy laws, and be prepared to obtain every needful thing.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 109:14–15]<br><br>With this sharp focus on the importance of education, the prophet Brigham Young organized within three years of the arrival of the first company in the valley of the Great Salt Lake the University of Deseret, which, since 1892, has been known as the University of Utah. Individual stakes throughout Utah and southern Idaho organized stake academies that later became junior colleges and parts of the states' higher education systems. One interesting consequence of that devotion to the ideal of continuing education was an observation made from a study of people listed in<i>American Men of Science</i>that the state of Utah had the highest per capita percentage of representatives of any state in the union.<br><h2><b>Counsel of the Prophet</b></h2><br>Upon receiving the call from President Benson to be a member of the Quorum of the Seventy, I received a document that contained a statement he had made to the General Authorities two or three years earlier. It is:<br><br><i>The gospel can be viewed from two perspectives. In the broadest sense, the gospel embraces all truth, all light, all revealed knowledge to mankind. In a more restrictive sense, the gospel means the doctrine of the Fall, the consequences of the Fall of man that brought into the world physical and spiritual death, the atonement of Jesus Christ which brings to pass immortality and eternal life, and the ordinances of salvation.</i><br><br>It is most important that you young folks understand the parameters that govern the two methods of truth discovery. Let me share with you my understanding of the "scientific method" and of the "revelation method" of discovering truth.<br><br>The objective of the scientific method is to determine "what" happens in a given system and "how" it happens by making objective, reproducible measurements. The same results must be obtained each time the same set of conditions prevail or the validity of the work is in question. No subjective data or feelings are admissible as valid data. Things that we know by our feelings (like love for our family or impressions from the Holy Ghost) are not discounted as being nonexistent, untrue, or unimportant. They simply lie outside the framework of the rules of the objective scientific method.<br><br>The revelation method of discovering (or rather of communicating) truth is subjective. It depends upon additional senses to those we use to measure our objective data by--it uses our feelings and our emotional networks rather than only our "external" senses, which are the basis for quantitative scientific measurement. The knowledge provided frequently answers the question "why"--a question outside the purview of the scientific method. The receipt of revealed information is not reproducible at will by the investigator since it requires the positive action of a second individual, usually the Lord, which is beyond the control of the investigator.<br><br>It is important to recognize that the body of truth we call the gospel, in the narrow sense--including the things we need to know and to do to obtain eternal life--were given to mankind by the revelation method. The Lord chose to reveal these basic truths directly to prophets, who recorded them for our use as scriptures. He wisely chose to insure that these truths were clear and correct through direct communication, and has so testified.<br><br>The Lord wisely left a vast set of truths for man to discover through experience and through experimentation using the scientific method approach. It is necessary for each of us to develop our mind and our intelligence, recognizing the principle of eternal progress, to achieve our potential as full participants in the celestial kingdom. Thus, a large body of useful truths that are external to strict gospel truths has been accumulated over the ages to bless and improve our lives.<br><h2><b>Maintain a Balance</b></h2><br>We need balance in our lives. It was apparent to Sister Hill and me when we were married fifty years ago that the happiest people we knew had maintained a balance in their lives. They had worked hard to be successful in earning a livelihood, in developing good family relations, and had also maintained their testimonies of the gospel by being of service to others--by accepting and magnifying calls to serve.<br><br>I had grown up in a home where all three areas received sincere attention. The academic side was very strong. My father was the dean of agriculture and mother was the dean of home economics at USAC in Logan when they met, fell in love, and were married.<br><br>The scriptures "Seek learning ... by study and faith," "The glory of God is intelligence," "Man is saved no faster than he gets knowledge," and study "things in the earth, and under the earth" were a part of my upbringing. As a matter of fact, I can't remember when I didn't know that I was going to get a Ph.D. This was not ever a matter of conscious teaching--more a matter of example.<br><br>I also can't remember a time that I didn't enjoy the blessing of faith. Doubts and questions periodically arose and were discussed with my parents and were resolved; the underlying basic faith in the Lord was always there.<br><br>With this realization of the need for balance, it was easy for Sister Hill and me to agree to accept calls from our Church leaders at the same time that we worked hard on our studies, on our research, and on our secular pursuits. Her constant support and encouragement have been wonderful.<br><br>Early in the fall of my first year as a graduate student candidate for the Ph.D. in chemistry at Cornell, I was called to be a counselor in the branch presidency. My LDS student peers and some of the faculty members advised me not to dilute my academic efforts by taking on this assignment since our future success depended upon doing well in course work and in research. Together, my wife and I prayed for guidance. I accepted the call as I did the subsequent call to serve as branch president.<br><br>Interestingly, toward the end of my doctorate research, several of my colleagues in the lab, individually, came to me with a complaint that I "goofed off" every weekend, yet when I came to the lab on Monday I seemed to have more success in my experiments and exams than they enjoyed, even though they worked hard seven days a week. I explained to them that I was not goofing off in my church duties but was busy on Saturday and Sunday doing other useful work. Even the Lord rested from his labors on the Sabbath.<br><br>A special event also verified our belief that the Lord blesses those who serve. Two years before I completed my Ph.D. requirements, our first child, Richard, scheduled his advent. Since Sister Hill was providing most of our income getting her P.H.T. (putting hubby through) as a secretary, we began plans for leaving the graduate work for a year or two for me to earn enough money to then come back and finish the program. At a propitious moment, the chairman of my Ph.D. committee, who was responsible for teaching the freshman chemistry courses, asked if I would mind becoming a part-time freshman chemistry instructor to teach the influx of navy and army specialized training program students, alternating terms with him--at a salary that turned out to be one and a half times what Sister Hill was earning. After a respectable overnight consideration, I consented to help out. This enabled me not only to continue my research and complete the program, essentially on time, but to cover the doctor and hospital bills for Richard and also for Margaret, who arrived just two weeks before I was scheduled to begin my forty-year career at the University of Utah.<br><h2><b>Make Decisions Beforehand</b></h2><br>Another important bit of counsel that I received from my father as a young man was that we should decide what we would do in various situations where temptations were served up--while able to think rationally and unemotionally rather than waiting until the actual situation developed and the pressure of peers, or of emotions, made making the right decision difficult.<br><br>I'd like to give two illustrations of the value of this counsel--the first was when I was about thirteen. Two of my closest friends wanted me to try smoking with them behind their garage. I solved that problem by serving as their "lookout" rather than as a participant.<br><br>Almost forty years later the second example occurred. I was a member of a scientific team sent to Moscow, in the USSR, to work out an exchange agreement with the Russians in the field of magnetohydrodynamics. The research and development were going on simultaneously in both our nations. The Office of Coal Research, which I then directed, was charged with the responsibility by President Nixon to establish a "bridgehead of understanding" in this nonmilitary field.<br><br>Our agreement, which was very one-sided in the Russians' favor, included our furnishing their twenty-five megawatt experimental power plant with a special superconducting magnet, to be made at the Argonne National Laboratory, and also to build for them a special channel for collecting the generated electric power using electrodes developed after a great deal of research at MIT. In return for our giving them this equipment, they agreed to permit our technical people to come to Russia at their invitation to observe the equipment in action.<br><br>On the evening prior to our signing the protocol agreement, I was invited to attend a dinner at the Bolshoi Theater Ballet Restaurant not far from Red Square with the president of the Kirzhinsky High Energy Institute, his wife, his vice president (who spoke good English), and his wife. I was the only American invited to the dinner. It is traditional at dinner meetings in Russia for the host to offer a toast to be accepted by drinking a small glass of vodka. Then the other party would propose a toast, consuming a second small glass of vodka in the process. This toasting procedure continues until everyone has had an opportunity to have his or her particular moment on the stage.<br><br>As my host presented the first toast for good relations between the United States and the USSR, I picked up, instead of the vodka glass, my glass of water and had a sip from it to complete the toast. I then proposed a toast and capped it off by taking another sip of water from my glass. I noticed that the wife of my host was becoming very agitated, and as her turn came to offer a toast she picked up a fresh glass of vodka, walked clear around the table to where I was seated, and put it in my hand. She then said, "Doctor Hill will drink with us." She then went back to her place, lifted another glass of vodka, and offered a gracious toast. She then watched me closely to see that I responded by drinking the vodka. Quickly through my mind flashed the idea that since I was the only American there, no one would know that I had participated in drinking the alcoholic beverage and that if I did not do it I risked offending this beautiful lady and her husband. But I also recalled an agreement I had made with my father years before that I would never drink alcohol as well as my covenant with the Lord to keep his commandments. So, I gently put down the vodka glass and had another sip of water.<br><br>The lady became furious. She got so upset that her husband had to take her out of the room. I thought, "Uh oh, I have probably ruined our chance to complete this mission. They likely will not sign the agreement at the meeting tomorrow."<br><br>After the dinner was over I retired to the hotel and spent a fitful night wondering if I had jeopardized the whole purpose of our mission.<br><br>The following noon we had a small luncheon before the protocol agreement was to be signed. The vice president of the institute made it a point to sit next to me, next also, to his boss, for the meal we were to partake of before we signed the agreement.<br><br>He posed a question early in the meal asking why I had not drunk the vodka when his boss's wife had made such an issue of it. I explained carefully that it was a matter of religious conviction.<br><br>He said, "Religious conviction, what's that?"<br><br>So I responded that I belonged to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and that through a prophet the Lord had indicated that alcohol was not good for man and that I had agreed as a boy not to use it.<br><br>And then I said, "Why do you ask?" He responded, "My boss's wife has an alcoholism problem, and he wants to know what it was that made it possible for you not to drink alcohol when under that heavy social pressure."<br><br>Needless to say, I was relieved and elated, particularly as we finished signing the protocol agreement and I was able to return to the United States with the mission a success.<br><h2><b>Resist Evil Thoughts</b></h2><br>I received another important truth as a young man in a meeting in the tabernacle when President David O. McKay was giving one of his memorable addresses. In his talk he made the statement, "Sow a thought, reap an act, sow an act, reap a habit, sow a habit, reap a character, sow a character, reap an eternal destiny." Then he proceeded to explain that no one ever commits any sin or wrongdoing unless they have thought about it ahead of time; and it is the mulling over or retaining in our minds the evil thoughts that ultimately result in our carrying them out. This statement worried me because my friends would occasionally tell dirty jokes, and the ideas expressed would stick in my mind and I would mull them over. I did not want to do the things that they suggested, remembering that they were contrary to the will of the Lord. Again, having an understanding father was a real asset to me because, as I explained my concerns to him, he told me that it needn't be a problem if I recognized that you cannot think of two different things at the same time. He said that while we can't keep out of our sight and hearing things that are evil, we can kick them out of our minds if we are willing to think of something else to displace them, like being in some special place doing the kind of thing we would most rather be doing at that particular time.<br><br>I decided to test this. The next time such a thought was planted in my mind, I began to think of being carried in an airplane over Mount McKinley in Alaska with all my ski gear on and with a parachute attached. I would bail out of the plane and gracefully land on top of that majestic mountain, take off the parachute, and then begin to ski down through the magnificent snow fields, spraying powder snow up behind me as I made elegant turns and enjoyed the special joy of making "galaenda sprungs" off mighty cliffs, landing safely in the snow below as I made my way down the mountain. Needless to say, the original thought vanished. As a matter of fact, as I've recounted this technique I have found it difficult to refocus on the basic theme of my talk!<br><br>Other ways of accomplishing the same thing, advocated by many of the Brethren, include thinking of a hymn that you love very much and running the words and the music through your mind, or reciting a scripture that you have learned or are trying to learn. All of these techniques are valid in that they displace the original thought and enable you to avoid thinking so long about something evil that you will do it.<br><h2><b>Theory of Evolution</b></h2><br>There has been much attention in the news recently about the teaching of evolution. While serving as the dean at the University of Utah's College of Mines and Mineral Industries, I had interesting discussions with my faculty members in the departments of geology, geography, and geophysics concerning the evidences for evolution and concerning the misunderstanding many people have about the scientific method.<br><br>In the process of discovering new scientific truths and in trying to find ultimate answers to specific questions, it is essential that we develop theories that relate the experimental observations to each other. The theory as enunciated will then suggest additional tests that can be made to determine the validity of the theory or to modify it, which is generally the case.<br><br>Competent scientists recognize that theories are not laws but serve the function of testing the ideas and of pursuing new relationships. As Elder John A. Widtsoe said:<br><br><i>Facts are harmless enough; but the inferences drawn from them, sometimes true, often false, may involve serious consequences. The biggest questions before the modern world concern themselves with the inferences drawn from the recently accumulated body of truth.</i>[p. 15]<br><br><i>In this scientific age men and women should understand the processes and limitations of science; and should be able to test for themselves the doctrines drawn from scientific investigation. Confusion of thought lies back of most of our human discord; clarity of thought is a saving issue in any day.</i>[p. 15]<br><br><i>To gather existing knowledge; to discover new knowledge; to give man an increasing control over natural forces; and to make love of truth the greatest human passion</i>--<i>these are the objects of science.</i>[p. 21]<br><br><i>A natural or scientific law is the statement of the recognition of the regularity that appears when like facts ... are grouped together.</i>[p. 29]<br><br><i>Facts based upon verifiable and verified observations form the basis of science. They are the building blocks of science, and there are no other. Failure to recognize facts as the only foundation of science is the cause of most controversies .</i>. .<i>between science and religion.</i>[p. 32]<br><br><i>The Gospel of Jesus Christ accepts all truth. ... There is no limitation placed upon the truth that may be accepted by the members of the Church.</i>[p. 33]<br><br><i>Facts never change, but the inferences from them are changeable.</i>[p. 41]<br><br><i>The careful man does not become so enamored of an hypothesis or a theory that he cannot distinguish it from a fact.</i>[p. 46]<br><br><i>Theories of science can no more overthrow the facts of religion than the facts of science. ... One cannot build a faith upon the theory of evolution, for this theory is of no higher order than any other inference, and is therefore in a state of constant change.</i>[pp. 110–11]<br><br><i>Whoever would find truth must:</i><br><br><i>(1) Desire truth,</i><br><i>(2) Pray for it,</i><br><i>(3) Study, and</i><br><i>(4) Practice it.</i><br><br><i>Those who ... find truth ... will receive the glorious and priceless possession called a testimony.</i>[p. 120]<br><br>[John A. Widtsoe,<i>In Search of Truth</i>(Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Company, 1930)]<br><br>The theory of evolution as presently taught involves the gradual development of higher forms of life from lower stages of living matter. The changes in the genetic makeup that the offspring inherit are assumed to be random changes rather than having been arranged or directed by forces external to the system. These changes would be termed "spontaneous" in the scientific sense. This theory poses a major difficulty for one who understands the laws of chemistry, in particular the second law of thermodynamics. This law is based on observations over several hundred years and states,<br><br><i>Any spontaneous process occurs with an increase in the randomness or the disorder of the system. It is not possible for a spontaneous process to produce a system of higher order than the system possessed at the beginning of the change.</i><br><br>One example of such a spontaneous process would be the observation that a boulder at the top of Mount Timpanogos once dislodged will roll down the mountain; however, we know that we could wait a very, very long time and never see a rock at the base of the mountain spontaneously roll back up to the top of the mountain to increase its height, thus increasing the order in the system. The only way to increase the order in the system (i.e., to get the rock to the top of the mountain) is for energy to be expended from outside the system or for someone to direct the process by seeing that the rock is carried to the top of the mountain.<br><br>One of the current explanations of the improvement in plant and animal species with time is that they have been subjected to cosmic radiation, which caused genetic changes that resulted in a higher order of offspring survivability than the parent possessed.<br><br>While taking a course at Argonne National Laboratory a number of years ago, I heard a lecture from a Dr. Thamisian, a renowned biologist-geneticist, who told us of his research findings. He had personally directed the irradiation of grasshoppers in their egg, larva, pupa, and adult stages with every kind of radiation that grasshoppers have received in the hundred million years or so of their existence, at levels of radiation greater than that insect family had received during the total period of its existence. He said he<i>had</i>caused many genetic changes. Some of these included the loss of a foreleg or an antenna, or some other change, which<i>was</i>inheritable. However, not one of these changes gave a<i>greater</i>viability or survivability to the offspring than was possessed by the parent. He further added that, while he still believed in evolution, the radiation-induced genetic change mechanism was evidently not the one that caused the development of higher order in species.<br><br>As Latter-day Saints, many of us recognize that the processes involved in evolution are valid as we see improved strains and varieties of plants and of animals developed through judicious selection of their parents. But we would have to agree with those who understand the second law of thermodynamics limitation that such changes can only occur if<i>guided</i>or if energy from outside is available to improve the system.<br><br>We are in the very fortunate position of understanding that the Lord is in charge of the universe and that with his direction positive genetic changes can in fact occur. Improvements of the spontaneous type hypothesized by the devotees of the current theory of evolution have not been found to support that theory.<br><br>Thus, as Latter-day Saints, we are in the very favorable position of making contributions to genetics and to the understanding of evolution by knowing that there is a mechanism for this kind of long-term development, provided one recognizes the hand of the Lord in a guiding sense during the changes.<br><br>I have a basic hope in the back of my mind that many of us were involved in the design of what has come on the earth. And I hope to learn that I had something to do with the design of the praying mantis, that interesting, fascinating insect.<br><br>We are also blessed, as members of the Church, with the knowledge that Adam and Eve, our first parents, as they were placed in the Garden of Eden were not subject to death until they partook of the forbidden fruit. They and all of their descendants are spirit children of God, created in his image, and are thus different from all other forms of life on the earth. As literal children of God, we possess the inherent capability of becoming as he is.<br><br>Those of you desiring additional understanding of what I have spoken about here should read the address "The Earth and Man," delivered in the Tabernacle by Dr. James E. Talmage of the Council of the Twelve in 1931.<br><h2><b>Foreordination</b></h2><br>It is vitally important that you young people recognize your uniqueness in time and place in this world. On a statistical basis, the probability that you would be here at this time as a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints with your understanding of the gospel and of the accessibility of inspiration and guidance is very small. It is the order of one in a thousand. Now, since we know the Lord loves all of his children, we need to inquire whether our being here at this time with these blessings is by chance or whether there might be a purpose to it.<br><br>The Prophet Joseph Smith, after translating the book of Abraham, noted that Abraham was told that he was chosen before the foundation of this world and was among those foreordained to complete a particular mission. He also recalled Alma 13:3:<br><br><i>And this is the manner after which they were ordained--being called and prepared from the foundation of the world according to the foreknowledge of God, on account of their exceeding faith and good works.</i><br><br>The Prophet pondered and prayed about the concept. In one of his talks, Joseph Smith made this interesting statement concerning the foreordination of man: "Every man who has a calling to minister to the inhabitants of the world was ordained to that very purpose in the Grand Council of heaven before this world was" (<i>Teachings,</i>p. 365). To me this means that each one of you, in all probability, was foreordained or foredetermined to accomplish very specific things in your lifetime here on earth. Each of you has received and will receive callings, and each of you will be set apart to perform certain acts for the benefit of our brothers and sisters. Since that is the case, we have a special responsibility to keep the commandments of the Lord so that we can fulfill all of those foreordinations given to us in that Grand Council in Heaven.<br><br>It is also important that we know why we are rotated in service in the Church. It might be your calling to be a teacher in the Primary or a home teacher to particular individuals you can bless if you are sensitive to the inspiration of the Spirit. In the future you will enjoy other opportunities to serve. Callings we receive can have one of two purposes most frequently. One of them is that you are the individual who can bless someone or accomplish a specific purpose for the Lord. Or it may be that the calling is to train you to be ready for another opportunity in the future. In either event, we need to accept the calls prayerfully, qualify through study to accomplish the assigned work, and then pray for guidance that we will say and do those things that will assist the Lord in his program of bringing to pass the immortality and eternal life of man.<br><br>May each of you do your very best to tune in to the spirit of the Holy Ghost by studying, by praying, by keeping the commandments of the Lord. We need to study the scriptures on a regular basis to be sure that our mental reservoir will contain those things that the Lord can impress us, through the Holy Ghost, to say or to do at the propitious moment. May the Lord bless you to be effective in all that lies before you, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>George R.

<h1>o Be Good; Choose Quality - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
More than thirty years ago I stood beside the desk of Professor Richard Rosenbloom, who taught courses in manufacturing management. In those days they called the field "production." I was a research assistant, and Professor Rosenbloom had just stood up to welcome one of his students into his office. The student, of medium height, was dressed in a dark suit and tie. He stood before the desk, bowed deeply, and handed to his professor a beautifully wrapped gift. He had completed his studies and was returning to his home in Japan.<br><br>The professor murmured thanks and then, to demonstrate his appreciation, he unwrapped the gift. It was a black fountain pen with gold trim. He sat down at his desk, took out a piece of paper, filled the pen from an ink bottle, took the pen in his hand, and began to write. The student beamed. But then he looked stunned, as we all did--the pen was not writing. Professor Rosenbloom pressed harder. The student frowned more deeply. Nothing. Professor Rosenbloom tried swirling the pen. Still, no ink flowed. Finally, in exasperation, the student reached across the desk, grabbed the pen, shook it forcefully, and said with great feeling, "Cheap Japanese pen!"<br><br>I realize now that the chuckle Professor Rosenbloom and I repressed, out of civility, came from a perception you today would not even recognize: In those faraway times, much of what then came marked "Made in Japan" was shoddy. It often would not work and was seldom expected to last.<br><br>Oh, how the world has changed. You were nice to smile at my recounting that incident because the story seems strange in the world in which you live. The words<i>Made in Japan</i>now almost mean "made with quality." But more than that, the entire world is chasing the goals of quality set by products from Asia.<br><br>You, and all of us, have become quality conscious. When a model of a car is recalled because of a defect, we notice it. When sales for that car decline after the defect is described in the press, we are not surprised. If we shop for a car, including an old one, we check the rankings of quality from someone like J. D. Powers and Associates. If the car isn't in their top ten, we feel we are taking a chance--the price better be low.<br><br>How have we come to expect and demand such quality? Well, some manufacturers in Japan, back there in the 1950s, made a choice. They made a choice for quality. They worked at it. They learned how to achieve it, much of it from Americans who found no one would listen in their own country. And now we are all trying to learn about quality because we must. Listen to this prediction from a leading business publication:<br><br><i>As trade barriers come down, worldwide competition will turn white-hot. Only companies with the finest quality will thrive--and not because of quality alone. Two by-products of making or doing things better are almost always lower costs and higher productivity.</i>["The Quality Imperative: Overview,"<i>Business Week,</i>25 October 1991, p. 10]<br><br>Did you catch that mention of a by-product? Higher quality products cost less to make.<br><br>"Wait a minute," you say. "High quality always costs more, doesn't it?"<br><br>Some manufacturers have priced their product high and have tried to make you believe that a high price ensures quality.<br><br>But, no, we've learned that it usually costs less to make a product right in the first place rather than paying the cost to catch the errors later and fix them.<br><br>Now, one other thing we've learned is that when you make the decision to build a quality product, or give a quality service, you must make the choice early and then stick with it. Here is the way Genichi Taguchi, one of Japan's quality masters, put it: "To improve quality, you need to look upstream in the design stage. At the customer level, it's too late" ("A Design Master's End Run Around Trial and Error,"<i>Business Week,</i>p. 24).<br><br>Well, a revolution is being made in the temporal world in which we live, and in which we will live. On the cover of a recent issue of<i>Business Week</i>there is the word<i>Quality,</i>and then a headline, "Manufacturing: The Next Goal Is Perfection." In that issue it is reported that "Motorola Inc., for example, may soon adopt an unheard-of goal--60 defects or less for every billion components it makes" ("Quality: Overview," p. 8). If that happens, it will be because someone made a decision to choose to design a product so good that the chance of a defect approaches zero.<br><br>But there is a paradox--and that is my message. At the very time more and more of us are choosing quality in the products and services created and used, a strange thing is happening: More and more people are making the opposite choice for their lives. They choose to design lives for themselves that put the chance of a moral failure high, coolly accepting the expectation that sin will come with the hope that they will somehow take care of it easily, at little cost. There is even a phrase for that choice, borrowed from the world of cars: "Live in the fast lane."<br><br>Because those choices seem to be made consciously and seldom out of raw emotion, they must appear to the people making them to be reasonable. A professor of mine, Ray Bauer, years ago corrected me when I put the label of "irrational" on someone's behavior. He said: "Hal, you'll understand people better if you assume that people's behavior is rational, at least from their point of view. Try to see what they see."<br><br>Well, then, if people are choosing to make sin--moral defects--highly likely, they must see the world in a way that makes that choice reasonable. Why would people choose to put themselves in the places, listen to the sounds, see the sights, be with the people, entertain the thoughts, and do the things that will require them to face the effects of sin?<br><br>First, they might believe that there is no God, and therefore no moral law, and thus no sin. A second possibility is that they believe we are so good by nature, and God so kind, that whatever we do is right. You remember King Lamoni, the missionary contact of Ammon from the Book of Mormon? He believed that--at least he believed it at first. In Alma 18:5 we read:<br><br><i>Now this was the tradition of Lamoni, which he had received from his father, that there was a Great Spirit. Notwithstanding they believed in a Great Spirit, they supposed that whatsoever they did was right.</i><br><br>But Lamoni, even with all that tradition, could feel the Spirit of Christ. You remember the next phrase: "Nevertheless, Lamoni began to fear exceedingly, with fear lest he had done wrong in slaying his servants."<br><br>A third reason to risk sin would be to believe that the Atonement makes correcting the effects of sin, even of the most terrible kind, a simple matter. There seem to be more and more people who act as if they believe that. They believe the "eat, drink, and be merry" promise. They must think easy forgiveness can come from their bishop, now, in the same way the deceivers described in 2 Nephi said it would come from God in the next life. Here is the lie, which the Book of Mormon prophesied would be said by many. I feel it is being believed by many.<br><br><i>And there shall also be many which shall say: Eat, drink, and be merry; nevertheless, fear God--he will justify in committing a little sin; yea, lie a little, take the advantage of one because of his words, dig a pit for thy neighbor; there is no harm in this; and do all these things, for tomorrow we die; and if it so be that we are guilty, God will beat us with a few stripes, and at last we shall be saved in the kingdom of God.</i>[2 Nephi 28:8]<br><br>My testimony is that the facts are contrary to each of those assumptions. First, there is a God. I testify to you that the Prophet Joseph Smith was accurately describing God and sin with these words in D&amp;amp;C 76:22–26. I pray that when you hear them you will know that they are true:<br><br><i>And now, after the many testimonies which have been given of him, this is the testimony, last of all, which we give of him: That he lives!</i><br><br><i>For we saw him, even on the right hand of God; and we heard the voice bearing record that he is the Only Begotten of the Father--</i><br><br><i>That by him, and through him, and of him, the worlds are and were created, and the inhabitants thereof are begotten sons and daughters unto God.</i><br><br><i>And this we saw also, and bear record, that an angel of God who was in authority in the presence of God, who rebelled against the Only Begotten Son whom the Father loved and who was in the bosom of the Father, was thrust down from the presence of God and the Son,</i><br><br><i>And was called Perdition, for the heavens wept over him--he was Lucifer, a son of the morning.</i><br><br>And then, these chilling words in verse 29:<br><br><i>Wherefore, he maketh war with the saints of God, and encompasseth them round about.</i><br><br>I further testify that even God, with all his power and with all his love, cannot take you and me home to live again with him, unclean. And you, and I, and all of our Father's children will someday know that being with God is being home. And that everywhere else, however beautiful it may be, will be a place where you long for home. Here is a description of the terrible fact that our Father in Heaven cannot let us be with him again without our being washed clean:<br><br><i>Wherefore, if they should die in their wickedness they must be cast off also, as to the things which are spiritual, which are pertaining to righteousness; wherefore, they must be brought to stand before God, to be judged of their works; and if their works have been filthiness they must needs be filthy; and if they be filthy it must needs be that they cannot dwell in the kingdom of God; if so, the kingdom of God must be filthy also.</i><br><br><i>But behold, I say unto you, the kingdom of God is not filthy, and there cannot any unclean thing enter into the kingdom of God; wherefore there must needs be a place of filthiness prepared for that which is filthy.</i>[1 Nephi 15:33–34]<br><br>This is my warning to you today. It is a bad estimate of your personal costs to believe that a choice to commit sin is made so free by the power of the Atonement that we can have painless forgiveness. Listen to these words from President Spencer W. Kimball:<br><br><i>To every forgiveness there is a condition. The plaster must be as wide as the sore. The fasting, the prayers, the humility must be equal to or greater than the sin. There must be a broken heart and a contrite spirit. There must be "sackcloth and ashes." There must be tears and genuine change of heart. There must be conviction of the sin, abandonment of the evil, confession of the error to properly constituted authorities of the Lord. There must be restitution and a confirmed, determined change of pace, direction and destination. Conditions must be controlled and companionship corrected or changed. There must be a washing of robes to get them white and there must be a new consecration and devotion to the living of all of the laws of God. In short, there must be an overcoming of self, of sin, and of the world.</i>[<i>The Miracle of Forgiveness</i>(Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1969), p. 353]<br><br>That is not a description of an easy fix justifying a purposely flawed life. That is not a description of a "few stripes." How much better to choose to be good, early, a long way upstream from the terrible effects of sin.<br><br>Those who are now in serious sin will, upon hearing that description of the effort repentance requires, have a thought delivered to their minds something like this: "Well, if it is that difficult to repent, I might as well go on in sin. Later, when I need forgiveness, I'll just go through that once."<br><br>That is so unwise. Let me tell you why. First, you may run out of time. And second, you will find<i>more</i>misery in more sin, not the happiness you hope for, but can't find. Remember the warning from Helaman 13:38:<br><br><i>But behold, your days of probation are past; ye have procrastinated the day of your salvation until it is everlastingly too late, and your destruction is made sure; yea, for ye have sought all the days of your lives for that which ye could not obtain; and ye have sought for happiness in doing iniquity, which thing is contrary to the nature of that righteousness which is in our great and Eternal Head.</i><br><br>Now those of you who have avoided serious sin may be thinking, "None of this applies to me." But it does. The choice to be good is the same and is as necessary for us all. The choice to be good, which is what repentance includes, must be made by all of us. It is more difficult and more urgent for those in serious sin, but these words apply to us all:<br><br><i>And the days of the children of men were prolonged, according to the will of God, that they might repent while in the flesh; wherefore, their state became a state of probation, and their time was lengthened, according to the commandments which the Lord God gave unto the children of men. For he gave commandment that all men must repent; for he showed unto all men that they were lost, because of the transgression of their parents.</i>[2 Nephi 2:21]<br><br>I know I don't need to persuade you to choose to be good. The fact that we are here together is pretty fair evidence that we all want to make a lasting choice to be good. But the fact is that most of us have made that choice more than once. We're a little like some of the companies who have made a commitment, a serious choice, to pursue quality. Somehow, after a vigorous start, the effort peters out.<br><br>Since I've had that experience, too, of fading resolutions to be good, I've thought some about why it happens. The problem is this: We all need a standard, something to compare our behavior with, to help us decide what a practical goal of goodness is. And most of us choose people to compare ourselves with. I learned long ago that it matters who you choose for that comparison. Let me tell you how I learned.<br><br>Years ago, before adolescence hit me, I read a book called<i>Gospel Ideals.</i>It was a collection of excerpts from the talks of President David O. McKay. One chapter described how you would know when you were in love and, therefore, how you should view and treat women. His lofty words more than touched my heart: I felt a confirmation that they were true. Without telling anyone, I took David O. McKay's words as one of my standards of goodness. Five or six years later, I was playing basketball with a very fine team in a league in a city. Our team was composed of returned missionaries, plus me, the kid. Up to that point, I had never had a date. And I had no sisters, so what I thought I knew about girls and how to treat them came mostly from the visions I got from<i>Gospel Ideals.</i>I remember riding home one night from a game with those returned missionaries. I sat in the back seat of the car. They talked about girls. I can still remember a moment, even where the car was, on which street, with the street lights flashing into the car as we passed under them. I can remember, as I listened to them, the thought coming into my mind: "I have been wrong. Those ideals about girls and how you should feel about them, how you should treat them, they are unrealistic."<br><br>Luckily, in a few years I learned that they were wrong and President McKay was right. Or perhaps, in fairness to those young men, I learned that what I<i>thought</i>they had said, what I thought they had felt, what I thought they actually did, were not the true standard of goodness. But, you see, that's the problem with using people as the standard or your guide--they may be wrong, and you may be unable to discern what they really think and what they really do.<br><br>That is particularly true about the best of people. You see, the Lord said, "Do not your alms before men" (Matthew 6:1). And the best people don't. They do good very privately. Now and then I get a glimpse, always by accident, of the way some people live the simple commandments of the gospel of Jesus Christ. They don't know more than I know; they just do more of the simple things you and I have already been taught as children in a Primary class. I discover acts of kindness, of forgiveness, or of moral endurance beyond what I had thought we could do. And when those invisible lives become visible to me for a moment, a fear runs through me and with it the thought: "Maybe what I thought was good enough, when I get to the other side, won't be. Maybe some humble people--maybe lots of them--are living better than I thought I could." That underlines for me again the risk in taking my standards from other people.<br><br>But in this struggle to use people as our guide to what is good enough, I've found this clue. The best guides, the safest source of standards, have always been the people called by God to lead me. As I've told you, one of the lodestars of my life came from a book by President David O. McKay. I've noticed that the truest guides have been prophets and parents and bishops and teachers--good people called of God to help me. And while sometimes the Spirit has told me to use their lives as guides, more often it has been to set my course by their inspired words.<br><br>The reason for that, it seems to me, is that the only safe standard to guide our choice to be good is God. Those who can speak for him, under authority, are holding up the true standard of goodness. God told us that this way:<br><br><i>Old things are done away, and all things have become new.</i><br><br><i>Therefore I would that ye should be perfect even as I, or your Father who is in heaven is perfect.</i>[3 Nephi 12:47-48]<br><br>You might well object by saying that human examples are so much more accessible for observation. No, humans are more available but, at least in my experience, their lives are not more accessible. Our Father in Heaven and the Savior have revealed themselves in detail through prophets, heavenly visitations, and in person since man was created. There is a clearer description of the goodness of God than you will get of any mortal you can observe. And you need not be concerned with this fear: "But won't using God as my standard overwhelm me?"<br><br>On the contrary--God asks only that we approach him humbly, as a child. He does not require that we master some difficult doctrine. A child can enter the kingdom of heaven. Remember the description of that surrender in Mosiah 3:19:<br><br><i>For the natural man is an enemy to God, and has been from the fall of Adam, and will be, forever and ever, unless he yields to the enticings of the Holy Spirit, and putteth off the natural man and becometh a saint through the atonement of Christ the Lord, and becometh as a child, submissive, meek, humble, patient, full of love, willing to submit to all things which the Lord seeth fit to inflict upon him, even as a child doth submit to his father.</i><br><br>That submission, that simple desire to do what he would have us do, makes available to you and me the sure guide for knowing what is good. If you want to believe in Christ, if you want to do good, the Spirit of Christ and the Holy Ghost will prompt you. Here's the promise, from Moroni, chapter 7:<br><br><i>For behold, my brethren, it is given unto you to judge, that ye may know good from evil; and the way to judge is as plain, that ye may know with a perfect knowledge, as the daylight is from the dark night.</i><br><br><i>For behold, the Spirit of Christ is given to every man, that he may know good from evil; wherefore, I show unto you the way to judge; for every thing which inviteth to do good, and to persuade to believe in Christ, is sent forth by the power and gift of Christ; wherefore ye may know with a perfect knowledge it is of God.</i>[Moroni 7:15-16]<br><br>Two ways of applying that invitation to be guided have worked for me. One is to read the scriptures to try to feel what the Savior feels. For me, that happens most often when I read the description of the resurrected Savior among the Nephites. Here is a single verse that helps me:<br><br><i>And it came to pass that when they had knelt upon the ground, Jesus groaned within himself, and said: Father, I am troubled because of the wickedness of the people of the house of Israel.</i>[3 Nephi 17:14]<br><br>Now, for me, at the right moment, I can begin to feel the pain the Savior felt for sins, yours and mine. His groan within himself came after he had paid the price for us, after the Atonement. His being troubled was not some abstract grief for our sins and those of the house of Israel. His was real pain, recently felt, as he took upon him the sins of the world. I can't experience that, but I can sense it enough to have sorrow for what I have added to it. I can resolve to add no more. And I can feel determination that I will help offer the full blessings of the Atonement to as many as I can, because that passage helps me feel, in a small way, what taking upon him the sins of all mankind cost the Savior.<br><br>Now, for you, other scriptures will help you feel what the Savior felt. As I try to feel what he felt, I've tried to do another thing, both as I read and in prayer: I've tried to know what he would do if he had my opportunities. You might try that. If you have had trouble getting answers to your prayers, try asking today, "What is there that you would have me do?"<br><br>That prayer will be answered if you are sincere and if you listen like a little child, with real intent to act.<br><br>I must be careful about what I promise you as you try choosing to be good. It won't be all roses. President Benson has spent a lifetime trying to be good. Every time I'm with him I feel his goodness. As nearly as I can tell, he has used the Savior as his standard about as well as anyone I know. And yet, in his advanced years, life is getting harder, not easier. If he could be here, he would surely smile and tell you he loved you, but his joy would have the edge of reality I found in his words in 1989:<br><br><i>I leave you my testimony of the joy of living--of the joys of</i>full<i>gospel living and of going through the Refiner's fire and the sanctification process that takes place. As the Apostle Paul so well said, "We know that all things work together for good to them that love God" (Romans 8:28).</i>[Ezra Taft Benson, "To the Elderly of the Church,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 1989, p. 8]<br><br>A choice to be good--even with the trials that come, or perhaps because of the trials that come--will allow the Atonement to change your heart. In time and after persistence, your wants and even your needs will change. You remember that the people who believed King Benjamin's talk found such a change had come to them:<br><br><i>And they all cried with one voice, saying: Yea, we believe all the words which thou hast spoken unto us; and also, we know of their surety and truth, because of the Spirit of the Lord Omnipotent, which has wrought a mighty change in us, or in our hearts, that we have no more disposition to do evil, but to do good continually.</i>[Mosiah 5:2]<br><br>If we stay at it long enough, perhaps for a lifetime, we will have for so long felt what the Savior feels, wanted what he wants, and done what he would have us do, that we will, by the Atonement, have gotten a new heart filled with charity. And we will have become like him. That promise is in the seventh chapter of Moroni, too:<br><br><i>But charity is the pure love of Christ, and it endureth forever; and whoso is found possessed of it at the last day, it shall be well with him.</i><br><br><i>Wherefore, my beloved brethren, pray unto the Father with all the energy of heart, that ye may be filled with this love, which he hath bestowed upon all who are true followers of his Son, Jesus Christ; that ye may become the sons of God; that when he shall appear we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is; that we may have this hope; that we may be purified even as he is pure. Amen.</i>[Moroni 7:47–48]<br><br>You can make the choice to be good early. You can use the Savior as your standard for goodness. And you can stay with it. President Benson gave you this assurance. And I give it to you, testifying that it is true. He said:<br><br><i>Attaining a righteous and virtuous life is within the capability of anyone of us if we will earnestly seek for it. If we do not have these character traits, the Lord has told us that we should "ask, and ye shall receive; knock, and it shall be opened unto you." (D&amp;amp;C 4:7.)</i><br><br><i>The Apostle Peter tells us that when we possess these traits we are not "unfruitful in the</i>knowledge<i>of our Lord Jesus Christ."</i>(<i>2 Peter 1:8</i>;<i>emphasis added.)</i><br><br><i>To</i>know<i>the Savior, then, is to be</i>like<i>Him.</i><br><br><i>God will bless us to be like His Son when we make an earnest effort.</i>[Ezra Taft Benson, "What Manner of Men Ought We to Be?"<i>Ensign,</i>November 1983, p. 43]<br><br>I add my testimony that God the Father lives, that we will want to be with him forever, that eternal life requires that we be clean, without spot, and that the Atonement of Jesus Christ and the restoration of the keys to the earth through the Prophet Joseph Smith make that possible. I pray that we will choose to be good, take the Savior as our standard, and make the earnest effort, persistently, however difficult the way, until we may someday see him and find that we have become like him. For this I pray, for all of us, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Henry B.
