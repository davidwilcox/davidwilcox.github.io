<h1>es, Visions, and Dreams - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I was just handed a great note here: "Attention, Elder Perry: Could you please look toward the choir just once--all we ever get to see is the back of your head. No offense!" Now, take a good look; and after that, you will probably be sorry and wish that I had kept my face the other direction all evening.<br><br>It was just two years ago that we had the glorious privilege of coming to this first fireside of the new year. At that time I brought with me my son, my daughter, and my wife to assist me in occupying this position. After the fireside was over, the boys rushed to congratulate my wife, and I just stood there left out of the whole thing. So in order to eliminate the competition this year, I decided to try it alone.<br><br>As the ministry of the gospel of Jesus Christ continued after the death of the Savior, the book of Acts records that most remarkable and significant event that happened on the day of Pentecost:<br><br><i>And when the day of Pentecost was fully come, they were all with one accord in one place.</i><br><br><i>And suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind, and it filled all the house where they were sitting. . . .</i><br><br><i>And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance. . . .</i><br><br><i>But Peter, standing up with the eleven, lifted up his voice, and said unto them, Ye men of Judea, and all ye that dwell at Jerusalem, be this known unto you, and hearken to my words: . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . This is that which was spoken by the Prophet Joel;</i><br><br><i>And it shall come to pass in the last days, saith God, I will pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh: and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall dream dreams</i>. [Acts 2:1–2, 4, 14, 16–17]<br><br>Peter began his great discourse on the day of Pentecost by quoting from the Old Testament prophet Joel. Joel is generally considered one of the earliest of the prophets of Judah; he lived probably in the period from 830 B.C. to about 750 B.C. This was the time after the division of the tribes of Israel, with Judah and some of his brethren being separated to the south and the other tribes to the north, and it was a difficult time for both Israel and Judah. The Assyrians had taken Israel into captivity, and Judah was soon to have its difficulties with Babylon. Joel, in that period of great trial, prophesied of the coming of the Lord and taught the people how to prepare for that great day. He must have been excited about this period and must have looked forward to it with fond hope.<br><br>Peter, filled with the Holy Ghost, was caught up in that same spirit of Joel on the day of Pentecost. He wanted the people to be caught up in the spirit of prophecy, vision, and dreams as they contemplated the mission of our Lord and Savior. He testified to them of Jesus Christ, saying, "Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly, that God hath made that same Jesus, whom ye have crucified, both Lord and Christ" (Acts 2:36). As we pause tonight to contemplate another new year, I would hope that for a few minutes we could catch the spirit of Joel or of Peter as we reflect on prophecy, vision, and dreams.<br><br>It was interesting to me, as I considered these three words while reading the scriptures, to find that they have a variety of meanings. The dictionary tells us that<i>prophecy</i>means declaration or prediction uttered under the influence of divine guidance, or prediction of any type, or preaching or teaching of religious matters. It also states that vision is the act of seeing with the eye something supposedly seen by other than normal sight: a mental image, an imaginative contemplation, a force of the imagination,or (I don't know how this one got in there) something or someone--especially a woman--extraordinarily beautiful. Finally, the dictionary defines<i>dreams</i>as a sequence of sensations, images, and thoughts passing through a sleeping person's mind, a fanciful vision, a fancy of the conscious mind, or a fond hope or aspiration.<br><br>Because the great day of the Lord is not quite yet upon us, for the purpose of this gathering tonight could I use those definitions that would be most easily understood by us regular mortals? Let us use the portion of the definition with which we can most easily associate: prophecy--teaching or preaching of religious matters; vision--an imaginative contemplation; dream--fond hope or aspiration.<br><br>My daughter, Linda Gay, is always concerned when I receive one of these assignments at Brigham Young University. She worries about my preparation and tries to see that I start early enough. So right after Christmas she came to me and said, "Have you started on your Fourteen-Stake Fireside talk yet?" I remarked to her that I had decided on a subject; she wanted to check it out for approval. When I told her the subject, she went over and picked up the<i>Good Housekeeping</i>magazine for the month of November, opened it to page 96, and said, "Read this. This is the kind of dreams BYU students will appreciate." It was a series of dreams of little children, ages six to twelve, compiled by Bill Adler; a sampling of them follows.<br><br>First, from Janice R., age ten: "The difference between a dream and a nightmare is like when you dream about vacation it is a dream, and when you dream about school it is a nightmare."<br><br>Or Jennifer P., age seven: "Once I dreamed that I was a mommy, but I know that I can't be a mommy yet because I can't even cross the street by myself."<br><br>Or Alice R., age nine: "Sometimes I have happy dreams and sometimes I have sad dreams. I think everybody has sad dreams sometimes--even President Carter."<br><br>This is one I especially liked from Marvin B., age nine: "I dreamed my mother was the best cook in the whole world and then when I had dinner I knew it was only a dream." ("'Mommy, Wanna Know What I Dreamed?'"<i>Good Housekeeping</i>, November 1978, pp. 96, 98, 100.)<br><br>Now, as we are assembled here to consider the beginnings of another new year, let us take time to teach religious matters, time to indulge in imaginative contemplation, and time to entertain fond hopes and new aspirations.<br><br><i>First</i>, time to teach religious matters: At the beginning of 1979 we find The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in the strongest position it has held in all of its 149 years' history since the Restoration. Last year we experienced unprecedented growth. During the period from 1830, the year the Church was organized, to 1930, the hundredth birthday of the Church, the great sum of 104 stakes were organized. During the just-concluded year of 1978 alone, we organized 105 stakes--one more than was accomplished in the first hundred years. To me this is historically significant. The prophecy of the Prophet Joseph Smith is literally being fulfilled at an ever-accelerating rate. As he said,<br><br><i>Our missionaries are going forth to different nations, and in Germany, Palestine, New Holland, Australia, the East Indies, and other places, the Standard of Truth has been erected; no unhallowed hand can stop the work from progressing; persecutions may rage, mobs may combine, armies may assemble, but the truth of God will go forth boldly, nobly, and independent, till it has penetrated every continent, visited every clime, swept every country, and sounded in every ear, till the purposes of God shall be accomplished, and the Great Jehovah shall say the work is done</i>. [<i>History of the Church,</i>4:5–40]<br><br>The members of the Church today have taken upon them by covenant the obligation of preparing the world for the return of the great Jehovah. We have been delegated two special assignments. One is to be a missionary Church; we have an obligation to teach the gospel. Sometimes I wonder why, with all the talents with which the Lord has blessed us, we always seem to go about missionary work in the most difficult way. It seems that every time we think of missionary work, we think of tracting. We do not think of using the great talents that our Father in Heaven has given us to start and continue this onward growth of the gospel.<br><br>A few years ago I was visiting in Brazil, where a new mission president had just arrived. He was excited about returning to his old field of labor in the mission field, the same area in which he had served as a nineteen-year-old missionary. He told us he would never forget his first day in the mission field, for it taught him a great lesson about using his talents to teach the gospel.<br><br>He and his senior companion were assigned to open a new city some distance from the mission headquarters. As they arrived in this new city and walked down the street, they passed a church with a minister standing at the front door. As they walked by the church, the minister went in and called to his whole congregation to follow him out into the street. There they followed the missionaries and started calling them names; then they became more violent and started to throw rocks at them.<br><br>The young elder was excited about this experience--his first day in the mission field and already he was being stoned, he thought. Then, a big rock suddenly hit him squarely in the middle of the back, and his feeling changed to anger. Before entering the mission field he had been quite a baseball pitcher; and in the flush of anger he wheeled around, grabbed the first rock he could find on the ground, reared back in his famous pitching pose, and just ready to let the rock fly at the crowd when suddenly he realized why he was there. He had not been sent all the way to Brazil to throw rocks at people; he was there to teach them the gospel. But what was he to do with the rock in his hand? If he dropped it to the ground, they would think it a sign of weakness and probably continue to throw rocks at them. Yet he could not throw it at the crowd. Then he saw a telephone post some distance away. That was the way to save face! He reared back and let the rock fly directly at the telephone post, hitting it squarely in the middle.<br><br>The people in the crowd took a couple of steps back. They suddenly realized that that rock probably could have hit any one of them right between the eyes. Their mood changed; instead of throwing rocks at the missionaries, they began to throw them at the telephone post. After this incident, every time the elder went down that street he was challenged to a rock-throwing contest. The rock-throwing contests led to discussions of the gospel, which led to conversions, which led to the establishment of a branch of the Church in that community. Do you see the talents that we have but we never consider using to help build the Kingdom? I think we ought to use the talents our Father in Heaven has given to us to help this great work grow.<br><br>Another important assignment, as President Kimball recently said, is "The monumental challenge. . . to provide trained leadership for the fast-multiplying units of the Church." If growth continues at the rate of the past year, what a challenge this is! If that rate continues, during the next ten years we will need 300 new Regional Representatives, 700 new mission presidents, 1,000 new stake presidents, 19,600 new bishops, 49,000 new elders quorum presidents, and 150,000 new ward and branch clerks. The number of Young Women, Relief Society, and Primary presidents will increase by about 100,000 during the next ten years. Can you start to see the vision and the impact of this tremendous growth on you as you prepare for your responsibility in building our Father in Heaven's kingdom?<br><br>I used to watch my father during the time he served as a bishop; he carried that responsibility during the Great Depression, when he had an added welfare burden. How often I remember going out with him, night after night, to deliver a sack of flour, a sack of sugar, or some other commodity to someone in need. We always had difficulty managing an uninterrupted vacation. I remember particularly one time when we had had an exciting day fishing on Lake Yellowstone. As I passed the lodge at Fishing Bridge, I saw a sign in the window: "A telegram for L. Tom Perry." Without reading it, I knew what that meant. I was right--a widow had passed away, and we had to leave our vacation early and return home so that Dad could conduct the funeral. I saw him also during tithing settlement, interviewing hour after hour, day after day, until he completed his assignment.<br><br>Then the time came for his release after serving as bishop for eighteen years. That day I caught a little of the vision of true service and the joy it brings. It had been indicated to him that he was going to be called to the high council, but as stake conference approached no one issued a call to him. As we sat in stake conference that day my father's heart was heavy; he realized that his great service as a bishop was about over, and he had not received a new call to replace it. Then, without any previous warning, the visiting General Authority, in reorganizing our stake presidency, called my father into that presidency. He served in it as a counselor or as stake president for the next twenty years, all of that time filled with joy at the opportunity of service.<br><br>It was not much longer in my own life, having seen the burden that my father carried so joyfully, until I too found the thrill and joy of gospel service. In fact, when I returned to the States after completing my assignment in Japan with the occupation troops after World War II, I discovered that one month before I was due to return my name had been presented in stake conference and I had been called to be a counselor in the stake MIA. This was a great blessing to me, for in this position, as I presided at one of the stake meetings one night, I saw a beautiful lady in the congregation who later became my wife.<br><br>We moved to Boise, Idaho, and shortly after our arrival I was called to be an elders quorum president. This position built in me the confidence to stand on my feet and express myself. We moved from Boise to Lewiston, Idaho; a month after we arrived the bishopric was reorganized, and I was called to be a counselor in that bishopric. This blessed me with an understanding of organization. We moved to California, and soon after our arrival I was called to the high council. This position taught me how to stand in front of a group and train leaders. After several years in the high council, I was called to be a member of the stake presidency at a time when we were constructing many chapels in that area. The position taught me finance. Then we moved to New York, and a day or two after our arrival I was called to be the stake mission president during the time of the New York World's Fair. I had the opportunity of meeting literally hundreds of thousands of people in that assignment.<br><br>After the fair I was called back into the high council, again an opportunity to learn how to train. We moved from New York to Massachusetts; two weeks after we arrived our bishopric was reorganized, and I was called again to be a counselor. The bishop and I had such an enjoyable time together that we just hated to think of anything interrupting that great association. Then came time to reorganize the Boston Stake. He was called in for an interview just ahead of me by the General Authority present there. When I followed him in for my interview, the first question that was asked of me was, "What do you think of the bishop as a leader?" I started giving glowing reports about what a leader he was. Then it dawned on me that they might call him to be a stake president if I made him look too good, and our service would be interrupted--and we were having such an enjoyable time together! So I said, "He is a great leader, but under pressure he goes home and beats his wife."<br><br>The General Authority leaned back in his chair and a smile came over his face. He said, "Isn't that funny? He was just in here ahead of you, and he accused you of going out behind the barn and smoking cigars."<br><br>In that reorganization I was called to be a counselor in the stake presidency and later a stake president. This call had a special way of teaching me closeness to the Lord.<br><br>As I look back over my Church experiences, each one has had a special meaning in my life. They have brought me great growth and development that I could have found in no other way. What great joy and happiness comes with service in our Father in Heaven's kingdom! May you resolve this day to prepare yourself for a lifetime of teaching in religious matters.<br><br><i>Second</i>, time to indulge in imaginative contemplation: In all the history of the world there has never been a group of young adults with a greater opportunity to prepare for the life ahead of them than you who are here at Brigham Young University today. The Church is investing more in you and your education than it has in any other group of our Father in Heaven's children in any age or time. Think of that: the greatest investment is being made in you.<br><br>I gained an appreciation for that investment about a month ago. My wife and I were on assignment to Turkey, and we visited the home of one of the good members there. Living conditions were deplorable. There was no floor covering. There were no closets in the house. When it rained, the rain poured in through the windows. One side of the home was a barnyard, the backyard a cesspool, the front yard a mud puddle. But the branch president assured me that even in these humble conditions that family paid a full tithe. That is the type of sacrifice that is helping keep you at this University.<br><br>I weep a little inside once in a while when I see some of you fight against the gospel standards which each of you had solemnly pledged on your honor to uphold at this institution. Let me give you an example. Some time ago I was on Brigham Young University campus on a Sunday evening near one of the apartment complexes where car after car was pulling in. All of the students were dressed in grubby jeans. It was evident that they had been to the canyons or some other place for a Sunday afternoon activity. Now at any other university in the world, no one would think much of this; it is commonplace. But here it was not the atmosphere for the Sabbath day. You are different; you have accepted the responsibility of setting a standard for the world, a standard different from that of any other university. We expect that from you. If the widow's mite is putting you through school, surely you should do your part.<br><br>The Lord is expecting from you a return on the investment he is making in you. If you put forth the effort, he will reward you openly and abundantly. If you rob him of that which you have been asked to do and fail to give him that return of academic excellence, of high moral standards, of preparation for service in his Kingdom, and of the integrity required of you at this institution, you will pay the price. His judgments are just and absolute.<br><br>This experience that you are having at Brigham Young University also gives you an opportunity to prepare for the life ahead of you, a life that could give you one of the greatest roles our Father in Heaven had designated for his children here: that of husband, wife, father, mother.<br><br>Our greatest gift this Christmas season was a telephone call announcing the birth of a new granddaughter, born on Christmas Day. My son excitedly called from his apartment in New Haven, Connecticut, where he is a student at Yale, to tell us of the arrival of a baby girl. A few days later we called him to see what kind of a father he was and to see if everything was all right. It happened to be just a few hours after he had brought the mother and the new infant home from the hospital, and you cannot imagine the excitement in his voice. He had been sitting in the rocking chair, rocking the little babe. He said, "You know, Dad, I've never felt like this over anyone before. Why, she's just beautiful." And I thought of the great blessings that come from starting to build eternal family relationships. That relationship between him and his wife began here at Brigham Young University, right after they graduated, and has matured and blossomed as he has gone on to advanced education. What opportunities there are for you to have imaginative contemplation as you prepare for your time of fulfillment here on earth!<br><br><i>Third</i>, time to entertain fond hopes and new aspirations: may this new year be for you a time of their fulfillment. As you look over the world in which we live at the beginning of 1979, the hope for a better world looks very bleak. Two great forces are locked in a dreadful struggle; one of these forces would destroy the agency of man and lead him captive to the desires of those who wish to dominate the world. A few million lives are expendable to them so long as their selfish aims are fulfilled.<br><br>But the other force believes in the dignity of man. What is done on earth must be for his good; his life and happiness are all-important. Each year we see more of a dominance of the first force.<br><br>I wonder if we are not sitting in a position similar to that of the ancient prophets of the Old Testament. They could see that their brethren to the north were already in slavery because they had failed to heed the word of the Lord. The prophets among Judah cried continually to the people to repent and thus avoid the same fate that had befallen the members of the other tribes. Is there a similarity between that which we see today and this far-off time in Israel?<br><br>How important it is that we heed the voice of a living prophet and conform our lives to the gospel of Jesus Christ! Even though the outlook for peace is bleak in the world today, it is not a time for despair. We live in a day when change can be effected very rapidly. The Lord has blessed us with a knowledge of the gospel of Jesus Christ and has also led us to an understanding of the technology that can bring about this change. This is a time not for despair but for preparation, courage, and action. Think of the glorious changes that have occurred in our lifetime.<br><br>We were out on our ranch in Wyoming over the New Year's holiday. It was bitter cold--the temperature stood between thirty and forty degrees below zero. As my brother-in-law was bundling up one morning to go out and feed the cattle, I thought, "What a terrible chore on such a cold day!" I reflected back to my childhood, when I would see the men with their pitchforks go up on top of the haystacks, throw the hay down on the hayrack, get on the hayrack, and drive out to throw the hay to the cattle--handling every forkful of hay twice. I thought how much better it was the last time I assisted in the process. I rode in the back of a pickup truck already loaded with bales that had been loaded in the truck from a conveyor system. As we rode along, we would cut a string and drop the bale off the back end of the truck. It was still hard work, but much easier than handling it with a pitchfork twice.<br><br>Then I watched my brother-in-law go out into the cold, climb into a heated tractor cab, turn on his stereo music, and drive over to pick up a whole haystack at one time with his machine. Then I watched him go out to the field, with his machinery throwing the hay out the back end to feed his very large herd as he drove in the comfort of his heated cab and listened to beautiful music. How conditions have changed!<br><br>In the ninth grade I developed the habit of carrying a slide rule around with me almost continuously. Any time I had difficulty solving a question in multiplication or division, I could whip out my slide rule and figure the answer instantaneously and accurately up to three digits. I do not carry the slide rule around with me any more; but I have something exactly the same size--a little calculator. All I have to do is turn up the lever here and I can add, subtract, multiply. Divide--now up to eight digits. Not only that, but it has the time of day. When I press this button, it gives me the date. When I'm traveling overseas, it will keep track of two times for me--one at home and one abroad. It has two alarms to wake me up in the morning. It will count down from twenty-four hours to zero or up from zero to twenty-four hours for me, and then give me a little buzz to let me know that it is time to stop or continue. It is powered with an energy source, not like a slide rule.<br><br>We live in a great day. Are we the type that is just sliding by, or are we powered with the energy source of the Spirit of our Father in Heaven, knowing no limitation to the power or effort that we can generate? This is not an age for the "also-ran." This is not an age for those who "almost made it." I liked Coach Arnold's "Number One" button; and, Danny [Ainge], I hope that we are soon there, because we should be second in nothing. We have a source of power within us that we should understand, and we should realize the potential of that power that burns within our soul. This is an age for<i>number ones</i>, for winners! If we are to stem the tide and start building a better world, we must get in the habit of being winners. This is the time for fond hopes and new aspirations.<br><br>William James, the famous author, quotes this anonymous verse:<br><br><i>Sow a thought, and you reap an act;</i><br><i>Sow an act, and you reap habit;</i><br><i>Sow a habit, and you reap a character;</i><br><i>Sow a character, and you reap a destiny.</i><br>[<i>John Bartlett, Familiar Quotations, 14<sup>th</sup>ed</i>. (Boston: Little, Brown and Co., 1968), p. 1100]<br><br>How important it is that we think right beginning thoughts! It is interesting to note that the mind can comprehend only one thought at a time. Therefore, our destiny may be determined by a single thought. It is up to each of us to make certain that that thought is positive rather than negative. Our actions, attitudes, and life should be directed accordingly. Once we get our minds right, we get in the habit of winning--the success habit--and we start succeeding a little more every day.<br><br>This is why success is not luck. Success can be predictable. If every day is successful, the results will be a successful week, a successful year, and a successful life. Live one hundred percent for the day, as though each day were a building block. Do each day that which needs to be done.<br><br>The poet has written:<br><i>Look to this Day! . . .</i><br><i>For Yesterday is but a Dream,</i><br><i>And To-morrow is only a Vision:</i><br><i>But To-day well-lived makes</i><br><i>Every Yesterday a Dream of Happiness,</i><br><i>And every To-morrow a Vision of Hope.</i><br><i>Look well therefore to this Day!</i><br>[Quoted in James Dalton Morrison, ed.,<i>Masterpieces of Religious Verse</i>(New York: Harper and Brothers, 1948), p.301]<br><br>I give you my witness that you are a child of God, born with an immortal spirit. Each one of you possesses great talent and ability waiting to be trained, harnessed, and engaged in the greatest of all responsibilities: the building of our Father in Heaven's kingdom here on earth, and preparation for life eternal that is to follow.<br><br>God bless each of us this new year that we may realize our great potential, that we may take time to teach religious matters, to indulge in imaginative contemplation, to entertain and achieve fond hopes and new aspirations. God lives; Jesus is the Christ, and his Church has been established on the earth in this day. That witness I give to you tonight in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>L.

<h1>Not Blind: Faith and Ambiguity - Bruce C. Hafen - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Thank you, President Oaks. It feels good to be back on this campus. If you were to ask our children where they are from, they would still say Provo. I do not know how many more years that will continue; we hope that they will become acclimated to Rexburg soon. Provo and Rexburg have much in common, not the least of which is that in these two cities are two great colleges. It has been a source of great satisfaction to me to notice the support and concern that BYU people have for Ricks College. I want you BYU people to know that the people at Ricks appreciate your interest.<br><br>I also would like to share with you something I recently heard about students in the Church schools, so that we can be alert to what the enemy is saying. A friend of mine, a graduate from another school in this state, recently asked me if I knew the difference between a rooster, a patriot, and a coed who goes to an LDS college. I said that I did not know the difference, but that I had always wondered about that very question.<br><br>He said, "A rooster says 'cock-a-doodle-doo,' a patriot says 'Yankee Doodle-doo,' but a coed at Ricks or BYU says 'Any dude'll do.'" This obviously does not apply to us, except for the occasion on which I proposed to my wife here in Provo a number of years ago. At that time, at least, I was glad that there was some truth in that observation.<br><br>The title for my remarks today, brothers and sisters, is a simple one that will leave you wondering what I mean; I hope it will be clear by the time I have finished. The title is "Love Is Not Blind."<br><br>When I was a law student, my wife and I attended a student ward in which most of the members were graduate students. We developed close friendships with many of those who were experiencing, as we were, the great expanding of our minds as we learned the tools of intellectual analysis and the expanding of our spirits as we drew close to the Lord through such experiences as marriage and the bearing of our first children.<br><br>One Sunday morning, the Elders Quorum in our ward held a special testimony meeting characterized by spiritual warmth and personal openness. During that meeting, a fellow law student related a boyhood experience that had occurred just after he had been ordained a deacon. He lived on a farm and had been promised that a calf about to be born would be his very own to raise. One summer morning when his parents were away, he was working in the barn when the expectant cow began to calve prematurely. He watched in great amazement as the little calf was born; and then, without warning, the mother suddenly rolled over the little calf. He could see that she was trying to kill it. In his heart he cried out to the Lord for help. Not thinking about how much more the cow weighed than he did, he pushed on her with all his strength and somehow moved her away. He picked up the lifeless body of the calf in his arms and, brokenhearted, the tears running down his cheeks, he looked at it, wondering what had happened and what he could do. Then he remembered, he told us, that he now held the Priesthood and had every right to pray for additional help. And so he prayed from the depths of his boyish, believing heart. Before long the little animal began breathing again, and he knew that his prayer had been heard.<br><br>After relating the story, the tears welled up in his eyes and he said to us, "Brethren, I tell you that story because I don't know that I would do now what I did then. I think I might not expect the Lord's help in that kind of situation. I am not sure that I would believe now, even if I relived that experience, that the calf's survival was anything more than a coincidence. I don't understand what has happened to me since that incident, but I sense that something has gone a little bit wrong."<br><br>My friend in the Elders Quorum was not saying that he had lost faith in the Lord; rather, he was simply being very honest with us, I think, in sharing both the childlike and the sophisticated dimensions of his experience. This story reflects the thoughts and feelings that many of us experience, in our own way, during the college years. These thoughts and feelings are an important part of growing toward spiritual and intellectual maturity, as well as an important part of understanding both the strengths and the limitations of a college education.<br><br>Before entering college, most of us think of things for the most part in terms of black and white--there is very little gray in either the intellectual or the spiritual dimension of our perspective. Thus, most of the freshmen at places like BYU and Ricks have a wonderfully childlike optimism and loyalty that makes them more teachable and more pleasant than any other group of students. I consider it one of the great blessings of my life to be associated with so many young people at this point in their lives at Ricks College. It is typical of these young men and women to trust their teachers, to believe what they read, and to respond with boundless enthusiasm to invitations for Church service. Where else but in a student ward composed mostly of freshmen would you find a Church member so thrilled to be called by the bishop as the songbook coordinator, or perhaps the Relief Society Sunday morning orange juice specialist? As one returned missionary put it, one of the best things about a student ward composed mostly of freshmen and sophomores is that when a topic such as faith or repentance is raised for discussion nobody yawns.<br><br>As time goes on, however, new experiences may introduce a new dimension to a student's perspective. In general, I would characterize this new dimension as a growing awareness that there is a kind of gap between the real and the ideal--between what is and what ought to be. To illustrate, I ask you to picture in your mind two circles, one inside the other. The inner boundary is the real, or what is; the outer boundary is the ideal, or what ought to be. We stand at the inner boundary, reaching out, trying to pull ourselves closer to the ideals to which we have committed ourselves. We become aware of the distance between these two boundaries when we sense that some things about ourselves or the circumstances we witness are not all we wish they were. At that point, some frustrations can arise. Let me offer some illustrations of what I mean.<br><br>Students at a large Church college may suffer disillusionment when they lose some great battle with the giant red-tape machine, or when they remain unknown and nameless to their student ward bishop for weeks or even months, or when they brush up against a faculty member whose Church commitments seem to them to be in doubt. At a more personal and spiritual level, perhaps an important prayer goes too long unanswered, or they suffer some devastating setback with grades, good health, or the prospects for marriage; and the heavens may seem closed in a time of great need. They may also become increasingly conscious of the imperfections of others, including parents, other Church members, or even a bishop or a stake president. As the historians say, when we become more familiar with those who have been our heroes we may begin to see their human limitations. Students may also begin to confront such controversial issues as the role of women in the Church and differing political views among Church members.<br><br>It is not uncommon for missionaries, too, to encounter this gap between the real and the ideal, perhaps because new missionaries generally make more idealistic commitments than they have ever before taken upon themselves. And yet, in spite of their most valiant efforts, they may find themselves more than once fighting back the tears of disappointment when the promised fruits of a positive mental attitude somehow elude them. There is a kind of poignancy in those moments when we first discover that there might be some limitations to the idea that we can do anything we make up our mind to do. I once gave everything I had to that proposition, in my determination to be the greatest shot-putter in the history of my junior high school. But I simply was not big enough--it really was hopeless.<br><br>Experiences such as these can produce confusion and uncertainty--in a word, ambiguity--and one may yearn with nostalgia for simpler, easier times when things seemed not only more clear but more under our control. Such experiences may bring about the beginnings of skepticism, of criticism, of unwillingness to respond to authority or to invitations to reach for ideals that now truly seem beyond one's grasp. Not everybody will encounter what I have been describing, and I do not mean to suggest that everyone<i>must</i>encounter such experiences. But college students are probably more likely to encounter "ambiguity" than almost any other group.<br><br>The fundamental teachings of the restored gospel are potent, clear and unambiguous; but it is possible, on occasion, to encounter some ambiguity even in studying the scriptures. Consider for example the case--known to all of us--of Nephi, who slew Laban in order to obtain the scriptural record (see 1 Nephi 4:5–18). That situation is not free from ambiguity until the reader realizes that God himself, who gave the commandment "Thou shalt not kill" (Exodus 20:13), was also the origin of the instructions to Nephi in that exceptional case.<br><br>Consider also the case of Peter on the night he denied any knowledge of his Master three times in succession (see Matthew 26; Mark 14; Luke 22; John 18). We commonly regard Peter as something of a coward whose commitment was not strong enough to make him rise to the Savior's defense, but I once heard President Spencer W. Kimball offer <span style="color: #00ccff;"><a style="color: #00ccff;" href="http://speeches-alpha.byu.edu/talks/spencer-w-kimball_peter-brother/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">an alternative interpretation of Peter's situation</a></span>. In a talk on this campus in 1971, President Kimball, then a member of the Quorum of the Twelve, said that the Savior's statement that Peter would deny him three times before the cock crowed might have been a request to Peter, not a prediction. Jesus just might have been instructing his chief apostle to deny any association with him in order to insure strong leadership for the Church after the Crucifixion. As President Kimball asked, who can doubt Peter's boldness and willingness to stand up and be counted when he struck off the ear of the guard in the garden of Gethsemane. President Kimball did not offer this view as the only interpretation, but he did point out that there is enough justification for it that it ought to be considered. So what is the answer--was Peter a weakling, or was he so crucial to the survival of the Church that he was prohibited from risking his life? We are not sure. This is a scriptural incident in which there is some ambiguity inhibiting our total understanding.<br><br>Let us compare some other scriptural passages. The Lord has said that he cannot look upon sin with the least degree of allowance (D&amp;amp;C 1:31), yet elsewhere he said to the adulteress, "Where are ... thine accusers? ... Neither do I condemn thee: go, and sin no more" (John 8:10, 11). There is indeed a principle of justice, but there is also a principle of mercy. At times these two correct principles collide with each other as the unifying higher principle of the Atonement does its work. Even though God has given us correct principles by which we are to govern ourselves, it is not always easy to apply them to particular situations in our lives.<br><br>We face concrete examples of that process every day as we attempt to fulfill our duties to family, Church, community, and professional concerns. A young mother who lives in this community and who has several children, a responsible Church position, and a busy and faithful husband, expressed her dismay as she tried to decide what should come first in her life and when. She was told, "Well, just be sure you put the Lord's work first."<br><br>Her reply: "But what if it is all the Lord's work?"<br><br>Similarly, my wife and I have often wondered how we should deal with our children in one of the four thousand incidents not anticipated by any of the books on childrearing. Sometimes one of us has a clear feeling about what should be done, but often I find myself simply telling her, with great conviction and total confidence in her, "Well, my dear, just be sure you do the right thing."<br><br>Church and family life are not the only areas where the right answer is not always on the tip of the tongue. If you would stretch your mind about the implications of ambiguity, you might think once again of the Vietnam War. Should our nation have tried to do more than it did, or less than it did? Or perhaps you could consider whether we should sell all we have and donate our surplus to the millions of people who are starving. You might also ask yourself how much governmental intervention in business and private life is too much. The people on the extreme sides of these questions convey great certainty about what should be done. However, I think some of these people are more interested in being certain than they are in being right.<br><br>Turning to one more fertile field to illustrate the naturalness of ambiguity, I remember Arthur King's statement that most truly great literary works will raise some profound question about a human problem, explore the question skillfully and in depth, and then leave the matter for the reader to resolve. He added that if the resolution seems too clear or too easy either the literature is not very good or those reading it have missed its point. Take, for example, Dostoevsky's novel<i>The Idiot</i>, which seriously raises the question of whether it is possible for a true Christian to love unselfishly. The main character of the story is a pure and good person who loves two different women in two different ways. One he loves as most men love women--she cares for him, she helps him, he is attracted to her romantically, and she could make his life very happy. The other woman, a pathetically inadequate person, he loves primarily because she needs him desperately and because he has a compassionate heart. Posing the dilemma of which of these two women the man should marry, Dostoevsky seems to ask if it is possible for mortal men to be honestly devoted to the unselfish ideals of Christianity. As you might expect, he leaves the huge question unresolved, forcing the reader to ponder if for himself.<br><br>I have intentionally tried to suggest a wide variety of instances in which the answers we seek are not as quickly apparent as we might expect. My suggestion is that some uncertainty is characteristic of mortal experience. The mists of darkness in Lehi's dream are, for that very reason, a symbolic representation of life as we face it on this planet. Many things are, of course, very certain and very clear, as is so beautifully represented by the iron rod in Lehi's dream; but, particularly to those who pursue a college education, there is enough complexity to make the topic of ambiguity worthy of discussion.<br><br>Given, then, the existence for most of us of a gap between where we stand and where we would like to be, and given that we will have at least some experiences that make us wonder, what are we to do? I believe that there are three different levels of dealing with ambiguity. There may be more, but I would like to talk in terms of three.<br><br>At level one there are two typical attitudes, one of which is that we simply do not--perhaps cannot--see the problems that exist. Some seem almost consciously to filter out any perception of a gap between the real and the ideal. Those in this category are they for whom the gospel at its best is a firm handshake, an enthusiastic greeting, and a smiley button. Their mission was the best, their student ward is the best, and every new day is probably going to be the best day they ever had. These cheerful ones are happy, spontaneous, and optimistic, and they always manage to hang loose. They are able to weather many storms that would seem formidable to more pessimistic types, though one wonders if the reason is often that they have somehow missed hearing that a storm was going on.<br><br>A second group at level one has quite a different problem with the gap between what is and what ought to be. Those in this category eliminate the frustration created as they sense a distance between the real and the ideal in their world by, in effect, erasing the inner circle of reality. They cling to the ideal so singlemindedly that they are able to avoid feeling the pain that would come from facing the truth about themselves, others, or the world around them. I suppose it is this category that is sometimes represented in the letters to the editor of the school papers at BYU and at Ricks where such shock is expressed that some person or some part of the institution has fallen short of perfection, leaving the writer aghast--"surely not at the Lord's university." One of the problems experienced by those in this group is that they seem unable to distinguish between imperfections that matter a great deal and those that may not matter so much. I think Hugh Nibley must have had them in mind when he spoke of those who think it is more commendable to get up at 5 A.M. to write a bad book than it is to get up at 9 A.M. to write a good book. It is obvious to Brother Nibley that the exact hour at which we arise is not as important as what we do once we are up.<br><br>I recall listening to a group of students as they discussed which of the two types of people I have just described offered the most appropriate model for their emulation. They felt that they had to choose between being relaxed and happy and carefree about the gospel, or being intense perfectionists. After listening to the discussion, I felt that both of these types suffer from the same limitation. It is not much of a choice to select between a frantic concern with perfection and a forced superficial happiness. Both perspectives lack depth, and their proponents understand things too quickly and draw conclusions from their experience too easily. Neither type is very well prepared for adversity, and I fear that the first strong wind that comes along will blow both of them over. This, I believe, is primarily because their roots have not sunk deep enough into the soil of experience to establish a firm foundation. Both also reflect the thinness of philosophy untempered by common sense. In both cases, it would be helpful simply to be more realistic about life's experiences, even if that means facing some questions and limitations that leave one a bit uncomfortable. That very discomfort can be a motivation toward real growth. As someone has said, the true Church is intended not only to comfort the afflicted, but to afflict the comfortable.<br><br>I invite you, then, to step up to level two, where you see things for what they are; for only then can you deal with them in a meaningful and constructive way.<br><br>If we are not willing to grapple with the frustration that comes from honestly and bravely facing the uncertainties we encounter, we may never develop the kind of spiritual maturity that is necessary for our ultimate preparations. It was Heber C. Kimball who once said that the Church has many close places through which it must yet pass and that those living on borrowed light will not be able to stand when those days come. Thus, we need to develop the capacity to form judgments of our own about the value of ideas, opportunities, or people who may come into our lives. We will not always have the security of knowing whether a certain idea is "Church approved," because new ideas do not always come along with little tags attached to them saying whether the Church has given them the stamp of approval. Whether in the form of music, books, friends, or opportunities to serve, there is much that is "lovely, ... of good report, [and] praiseworthy" (Article of Faith 13) that is not the subject of detailed discussion in Church manuals or courses of instruction. Those who will not risk exposure to experiences of life that are not obviously related to some well-known Church work or program will, I believe, live less abundant and meaningful lives than the Lord intends. We must develop sufficient independence of judgment and maturity of perspective that we are prepared to handle the shafts and whirlwinds of adversity and contradiction that are so likely to come along in our lives. When those times come, we cannot be living on borrowed light. We should not be deceived by the clear-cut labels some may use to describe circumstances that are, in fact, not so clear. Our encounters with reality and disappointment are in fact vital stages in the development of our maturity and understanding.<br><br>Despite the value of this level-two kind of awareness about which I have been talking, some serious hazards still remain. One's acceptance of the clouds of uncertainty may be so complete that the iron rod fades into the receding mist and skepticism becomes a guiding philosophy. Often, this perspective comes from erasing the<i>outer</i>circle representing the ideal, or what ought to be, and focusing excessively on the inner circle of reality. When I was a teacher at the BYU Law School, I noticed how common it was among our first-year students to experience great frustration as they discovered how much our legal system is characterized not by hard and fast rules but by legal principles that often appear to contradict each other.<br><br>I remember, for example, one student in his first year who approached me after a class early in the semester to express the confusion he was encountering in his study of law. He said that he had what he called "a low tolerance for ambiguity" and had been wondering if part of his problem was that he had returned only weeks before from a mission, where everything was crisp and clear and where even the words he was to speak were provided for him. To feel successful, all he had to do was follow the step-by-step plan given him for each day and each task on his mission. Law school was making him feel totally at sea, as he groped for simple guidelines that would tell him what to do. His circumstance was only another example of what I have previously tried to describe as typical of college and university students early in their experience.<br><br>However, by the time our law students reached their third year of study, it was not at all uncommon for them to develop such a high tolerance for ambiguity that they were skeptical about everything, including some dimensions of their religious faith. Where formerly they felt they had all the answers but just did not know what the questions were, they now seemed to have all the questions but few of the answers. I found myself wanting to tell our third-year law student that those who take too much delight in their finely honed tools of skepticism and dispassionate analysis will limit their effectiveness in the Church and elsewhere, because they become contentious, standoffish, arrogant, and unwilling to get involved and commit themselves.<br><br>I have seen some of these people try out their new intellectual tools in some context like a priesthood quorum or Sunday School class. A well-meaning teacher will make a point that they think is a little silly, and they will feel an irresistible urge to leap to their feet and pop the teacher's bubble. If they are successful, they begin looking for other opportunities to point out the exception to any rule anybody can state. They begin to delight in cross-examination of the unsuspecting, just looking for somebody's bubble up there floating around so that they can pop it with their shiny new pin. And in all that, they fail to realize that when some of those bubbles pop, out goes the air; and with it goes much of the feeling of trust, loyalty, harmony, and sincerity so essential to preserving the Spirit of the Lord.<br><br>If that begins to happen in your ward, in your home, or in your marriage, you might have begun to destroy the fragile fabric of trust that binds us together in all loving relationships. People in your ward may come away from some of their encounters with you wondering how you can possibly have a deep commitment to the Church and do some of the things you do.<br><br>I am not suggesting that we should always just smile and nod our approval, implying that everything is wonderful and that our highest hope is that everybody have a nice day. That is level one. I am suggesting that you realize the potential for evil as well as good that may come with what a college education can do to your mind and your way of dealing with other people.<br><br>The dangers of which I speak are not limited to our relations with others. They can become very personal, prying into our own hearts in unhealthy ways. The ability to acknowledge ambiguity is not a final form of enlightenment. Having admitted to a willingness to suspend judgment temporarily on questions that seem hard to answer, having developed greater tolerance and more patience, our basic posture toward the Church can, if we are not careful, gradually shift from being committed to being noncommittal. That is not a healthy posture. Indeed, in many ways, a Church member who moves from a stage of commitment to a stage of being tentative and noncommital is in a worse position than one who has never before experienced a basic commitment. The previously committed person who developed a high tolerance for ambiguity may too easily assume that he has already been through the "positive mental attitude" routine and "knows better" now, as he judges things. He may assume that being submissive, meek, obedient, and humble are matters with which he is already familiar, and that he has finally outgrown the need to work very hard at being that way again. Brothers and sisters, those are the assumptions of a hardened heart.<br><br>I once had an experience that taught me a great lesson about the way a highly developed tolerance for "being realistic" can inhibit the workings of the Spirit in our lives. When I had been on my mission in Germany about a year, I was assigned to work with a brand new missionary named Elder Keeler, who had just arrived fresh from converting--or so he thought--all the stewardesses on the plane from New York to Frankfurt. Within a few days of his arrival, I was called to a meeting in another city and had to leave him to work in our city with another inexperienced missionary whose companion went with me. I returned late that night.<br><br>The next morning I asked him how his day had gone. He broke into a big smile and said that he had found a family who would surely join the Church. In our mission, it was rare to see anybody join the Church, let alone a whole family. I asked for more details, but he had forgotten to write down either the name or the address. All he could remember was that the family lived on the top floor of a big apartment house. "Oh, that's great," I thought to myself as I contemplated all those flights of stairs. He also explained that he knew so little German that he had exchanged but a few words with the woman who answered the door. But he did think she wanted us to come back--and he wanted to go find her and have me talk to her that very minute. I explained to him that the people who do not slam the door in missionaries' faces are not all planning to join the Church. But off we went to find her, mostly to humor him. He could not remember the right street either, so we picked a likely spot in our tracting area and began climbing up and down those endless polished staircases.<br><br>After a frustrating hour, I decided that I really needed to level with him. "Based on my many months of experience," I said, "it is simply not worth our time to try any longer to find that woman. I have developed a tolerance for the realities of missionary work, and I simply know more about all this than you do."<br><br>His eyes filled with tears and his lower lip began to tremble. (That elder was no dummy--he recently graduated from Boalt Law School at Berkeley.) I remember it so well--he said to me through those tear-filled eyes, "Elder Hafen, I came on my mission to find the honest in heart. The Spirit told me that that woman is going to join the Church, and you can't stop me from finding her."<br><br>I decided that I had to teach him a lesson. So I raced him up one staircase after another until he was ready to drop, and so was I. "Elder Keeler," I asked, "had enough?"<br><br>"No," he said. "We've got to find her."<br><br>I began to smolder. I decided to work him until he pled with me to stop--then maybe he would get the message.<br><br>Then, at the top of a long flight of stairs, we found the apartment. She came to the door. He thrashed my ribs with his elbow and whispered loudly, "That's her, elder. That's the one. Talk to her!"<br><br>Not long ago, brothers and sisters, up on Maple Lane a few blocks from here, that woman's husband sat in our living room. He was here for general conference because he is the bishop of the Mannheim Ward. His two boys are preparing for missions; his wife and daughters are pillars of the Church. That is a lesson I can never forget about the limitations of the skepticism and the tolerance for ambiguity that come with learning and experience. I hope that I will never be so aware of "reality" that I am unresponsive to the whisperings of heaven.<br><br>It seems to me that the most productive response to ambiguity, then, is at level three, where we not only view things with our eyes wide open but with our hearts wide open as well. When we do that, there will be many times when we are called upon to take some action when we think we need more evidence before knowing just what to do. Such occasions may range from following the counsel of the Brethren on birth control to accepting a home teaching assignment. Based on my experience, I believe that it is always better to give the Lord and his Church the benefit of any doubts we may have when some such case seems too close to call. I stress that the willingness to be believing and accepting in these cases is a very different matter from blind obedience. It is, rather, a loving and knowing kind of obedience.<br><br>The English writer G. K. Chesterton once addressed questions similar to those I have raised today. He distinguished among "optimists," "pessimists," and "improvers," as he called them, which roughly correspond to my three levels of dealing with ambiguity. He concluded that both the optimists and the pessimists looked too much at only one side of things, and observed that neither of them can be of much help in improving the human condition, because people cannot solve problems unless they are willing both to acknowledge that a problem exists and yet retain enough genuine loyalty to do something about it.<br><br>More specifically, Chesterton wrote that the evil of the excessive optimist (level one) is that he will<br><br><i>defend the indefensible. He is the jingo of the universe; he will say, "My cosmos, right or wrong." He will be less inclined to the reform of things; more inclined to a sort of front-bench official answer to all attacks, soothing everyone with assurances. He will not wash the world, but whitewash the world.</i><br><br>On the other hand, the evil of the pessimist (level two), wrote Chesterton, is<br><br><i>not that he chastises gods and men, but that he does not love what he chastises ...</i>[In being the so-called 'candid friend,' the pessimist is not really candid.]<i>He is keeping something back--in his own gloomy pleasure in saying unpleasant things. He has a secret desire to hurt, not merely to help. ... He is using the ugly knowledge which was allowed him</i>[in order]<i>to strengthen the army, to discourage people from joining it.</i><br><br>In going on to describe the "improvers" (level three), Chesterton illustrates by referring to women, who tend to be so loyal to those who need them.<br><br><i>Some stupid people started the idea that because women obviously back up their own people through everything, therefore women are blind and do not see anything. They can hardly have known any women. The same women who are ready to defend their men through thick and thin ... are almost morbidly lucid about the thinness of</i>[their]<i>excuses or the thickness of</i>[their]<i>head</i>[s]. ...<i>Love is not blind; that is the last thing that it is. Love is bound; and the more it is bound the less it is blind.</i>[G.K. Chesterton,<i>Orthodoxy</i>(Garden City, N.Y.: Image Books, 1959), pp. 69–71.]<br><br>Perhaps President Harold B. Lee was thinking of Chesterton's point about women when he used to say, "Behind every great man, there is an amazed woman."<br><br>Chesterton's arranging of these categories makes me think of one other simple way to compare the differing levels of perspective that people bring to the way they cope with ambiguity. I think of the metaphorical image described in the hymn, "Lead Kindly Light." At level one, people either do not or cannot see that there are both a "kindly light" and an "encircling gloom" or, if they perceive both, do not see any great difference between the two. At level two, on the other hand, the difference is acutely apparent, but one's acceptance of the ambiguity between the light and the gloom may be so wholeheartedly pessimistic as to say, "Just remember that the hour is darkest just before everything goes completely black."<br><br>How different are these responses from that calm but honest prayer of level three:<br><br><i>Lead, kindly Light, amid the encircling gloom;</i><br><i>Lead thou me on! ... I do not ask to see</i><br><i>The distant scene--one step enough for me.</i><br>[<i>Hymns</i>, no. 112]<br><br>May I conclude with a simple little illustration of the response of one who stood at level three. He had passed from level one because his eyes were fully open to the reality, including some of the pain, of seeing things for what they were. Yet he had moved from a level two kind of realism to a third level where his mature perspective permitted what he saw with those wide-open eyes to be subordinated to what he felt in a wide-open heart.<br><br>The man in this case is my own father, who died about fifteen years ago. At the time of this incident, he was in his mid-fifties and was very involved in his professional life and in other heavy obligations that frequently took him out of his hometown for several days at a time. He was tired. At a much earlier time in his life, he had served for ten years in a stake presidency and had fulfilled numerous other assignments for the Church. One day his friend Brother Whitehead approached him to say the stake presidency had called him, Brother Whitehead had told the presidency he would accept the assignment only if my father would act as his first counselor.<br><br>It is one thing to be called as a counselor in the bishopric when one is young and full of fresh enthusiasm to learn about leadership in the Church, and when one's time is not heavily committed. One might understandably have a somewhat different attitude at a later time in life. Let me share with you the inner thoughts of my father's heart as he wrote them that day in his personal journal:<br><br><i>My first reaction was, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me ... I know something of the work required of a bishopric; it is a constant, continual grind; there is no let up ... I am busy and my state affairs demand what spare time and energy I have. In some respects I am not humble and prayerful enough; I have not always been willing to submit unquestioningly to all the decisions of the Church ... but neither do I feel that I can say no to any call that is made by the Church, and so now I add to my first reaction, 'nevertheless, not as I will, but as Thou wilt.' I will resolve to do it as best I can. There will be times when I will chafe under the endless meetings, but I am going to get in tune with the program of the Church in every way. I do not intend to get sanctimonious, but I know there must be no reservations in my heart about my duties and responsibilities. The work of the Church will have to come first. It will not be hard for me to pay my tithing and attend regularly, as I have been doing that. But I will have to learn, I suppose, to love the</i>Deseret News<i>, or at least the Church Section, as much as I love the</i>Tribune<i>... I will have to get to the temple more often ... I will have to become better acquainted with the ward members and be genuinely interested in them and their problems ... I will have to learn to love every one of them and to dispose myself in such a way that they might find it possible to feel the same toward me. Perhaps in my weak way I will have to try and live as close to the Lord as we expect the General Authorities to do.</i><br><br>Perhaps my appreciation for understatement and my personal knowledge that my father was an honest man makes that statement seem to me a more striking example of dealing humbly with ambiguity than it really is. But his statement stirs me to want to be as childlike as my education has taught me to be tough-minded--wise as serpents and harmless as doves, I believe the Savior called it.<br><br>All I ask, then, brothers and sisters, is that we who go to college may be honest enough and courageous enough to face whatever uncertainties we may encounter, and that we try to understand them and do something about them. Perhaps then we will not be living on borrowed light. We love the Church; we love our faith. We may not understand everything in the universe, but that does not diminish our love. "Love is not blind; that is the last thing it is. Love is bound; and the more it is bound, the less it is blind." In the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Bruce C.

<br>
<br>
This is always a pleasant sight and a special experience. I visited the missionaries last week in the Missionary Training Center and told them the story of a person who was imposed upon by a bully after a traffic accident. When the police found the victim he was in pretty rough condition.<br><br>They asked him, "can you describe the man who hit you?"<br><br>He said, "That's what I was doing when he hit me."<br><br>Well, describing to others the situation in which I find myself now would be an unsuccessful endeavor. I shall not try to do it, but I do congratulate you on the special privilege you have of being here, and I am quite anxious this morning that my visit--an opportunity I always treasure--may be useful to you and to me. I am particularly prayerful that I may be directed among the many thoughts that have crossed my mind to those that may be particularly important to you. I do not have a manuscript but do have some notes. One of the notes reminds me of something on a tombstone in England--it really is--that may be interesting to you. It consists of a single line that reads, "I told you I was sick." We do not always listen wisely or well.<br><br>I remember also, for some reason, a long-forgotten account of a man who wanted to go hunting on property that had theretofore been posted against it. So he talked with the owner of the property who granted permission on one condition--that the prospective hunter do him a favor and shoot his mule. It was in a very sad condition, and really needed to be dispatched, but the owner had such a long and loving relationship that he did not want to do it himself. So he said, "If you'll just shoot my mule for me, then you may hunt here."<br><br>The petitioner went back to his group and, thinking to have a little fun, said, "The man won't let us hunt here today. That makes me very angry after we have come so far and I intend to do something about it. You wait here. I am going to get even with him." So he crept up to the mule and , upon reaching it, shot it.<br><br>Just after he did, he heard two shots from behind him. "What are you doing?" he shouted at his two companions, who had also crept up behind him. They answered, "We got his horse and his cow; let's go!"<br><br>That leads me into my central idea, which I suspect you will remember not because I say it but because it is so very important.<br><br>In the twenty-third chapter of the book of Matthew are some lines to which I would invite you to listen carefully as I establish a theme for these few moments.<br><br><i>Then spake Jesus to the multitude, and to his disciples,</i><br><br><i>The scribes and the Pharisees sit in Moses' seat:</i><br><br><i>All therefore whatsoever they bid you observe, that observe and do; but do not ye after their works: for they say, and do not.</i><br><br><i>For</i>[he is going to give some examples]<i>they bind heavy burdens and grievous to be borne, and lay them on men's shoulders; but they themselves will not move them with one of the fingers.</i><br><br><i>But all their work they do for to be seen of men: they make broad their phylacteries, and enlarge the borders of their garments.</i><br><br><i>And love the uppermost rooms at feast, and the chief seats in the synagogues,</i><br><br><i>And greetings in the markets, and to be called of men, Rabbi, Rabbi....</i><br><br>[Then he counsels that no one is to be called master save He.]<i>But he that is greatest among you shall be your servant.</i><br><br><i>And whosoever shall exalt himself shall be abased; and he that shall humble himself shall be exalted.</i><br><br><i>But woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For ye shut up the kingdom of heaven against men: for ye neither go in yourselves, neither suffer ye them that are entering to go in.</i><br><br><i>Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye compass sea and land to make one proselyte, and when he is made, ye make him twofold more the child of hell than yourselves....</i><br><br><i>Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For ye pay tithe of mint and anise, and cumin, and have omitted the weightier</i>matters<i>of the law, judgment, mercy and faith: these ought ye to have done, and not to leave the other undone.</i><br><br><i>Ye blind guides, which strain at a gnat, and swallow a camel.</i><br><br><i>Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye make clean the outside of the cup and of the platter, but within they are full of extortion and excess.</i><br><br><i>Thou blind Pharisee, cleanse first that which is within the cup and platter, that the outside of them may be clean also.</i><br><br>[Finally,]<i>Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye are like unto whited sepulchers, which indeed appear beautiful outward, but are within full of dead men's bones, and of all uncleanness.</i><br><br><i>Even so ye also outwardly appear righteous unto men, but within ye are full of hypocrisy and iniquity</i>. [Matthew 23:1–7, 11–15, 23–28]<br><br>That terrible indictment to the Pharisees came because they were addicted to the policy and program of<i>seeming</i>instead of<i>being</i>. It is said that one of the magnificent leaders in ancient times did what he did with such grace and graciousness and goodness because he had early adopted a motto--a guiding principle--which was inscribed inside his shield. Only he, but repeatedly he, saw it in the midst of his deeds of bravery, courage, and kindness. Inscribed there were these words: "To be and not to seem."<br><br>The Pharisees, fastidious and meticulous in their adherence to the letter of the law, were seemers. "Pretense," "say and do not"--these were the words the Lord used to describe them; and repeatedly He used that terrible word which makes all of us cringe--"hypocrite." Many who have understood what the Lord meant have given us additional counsel in consequence of what He said; and of them all, I choose one that has been of special meaning to me for many years. Thomas å Kempis was born nearly six hundred years ago. He wrote these words, to which I invite you to listen carefully in context of our theme:<br><br><i>The doctrine of Christ exceedeth all the doctrines of holy men; and he that hath the Spirit, will find therein an hidden manna.</i><br><br><i>But it falleth out, that man y who often hear the Gospel of Christ, are yet but little affected, because they are void of the Spirit of Christ.</i><br><br><i>But whosoever would fully and feelingly understand the words of Christ, must endeavour to conform his life wholly to the life of Christ.</i><br><br><i>What will it avail thee to dispute profoundly of the Trinity, if thou be void of humility, and art thereby displeasing to the Trinity?</i><br><br><i>Surely high words do not make a man holy and just; but a virtuous life maketh him dear to God.</i><br><br><i>I had rather feel compunction, than understand the definition thereof.</i><br><br><i>If thou didst know the whole Bible by heart, and the sayings of all the philosophers, what would all that profit thee without the love of God and without grace?</i><br><br>[I think that I shall read part of this next paragraph also, still from Thomas å Kempis.]<br><br><i>Vanity therefore is to seek after perishing riches, and to trust in them.</i><br><br><i>It is also vanity to hunt after honours, and to climb to high degree.</i><br><br><i>It is vanity to follow the desires of the flesh, and to labour for that which thou must afterwards suffer grievous punishment.</i><br><br><i>Vanity it is, to wish to live long, and to be careless to live well</i>. [Thomas å Kempis,<i>Of the Imitation of Christ,</i>chapter 1]<br><br>Vanity it is, I add, and foolishness indeed, to pretend--to say and not to do, to seem and not to be.<br><br>In its worst form, that is hypocrisy. In its best form, I suppose, it might be thought to be pursuing the "as if" principle--that is, to say to oneself, "I will behave as if I were honest, decent, moral, courteous, gracious, sensitive, and courageous; and in so behaving, I will acquire the capacities, make the habits, and become capable of being all those things."<br><br>I suspect that most of us fall some place in between. We do not savor, and in fact sicken at, the thought that we are hypocrites, and yet we do so much to be seen of men. We sometimes say that which will tickle the ears of men. We pretend, knowing that in our own quiet places--our closets or, wherever the place, our minds--we are not what we seem.<br><br>That is not to suggest that only the perfect may act with credibility in matters of important principles. All of us fall short and are inevitably visited with the pangs and pains of our own failures; there is a universal understanding of that, since none of us is exempt from it. But to deliberately pretend, to put on a show, to give long prayers when we have devoured the widow's house, to do less than we can and should and pretend to do, to go through motions--not because they are honest efforts to do better, but simply to try falsely to fit somebody's conception of what we are--all of this is vanity and foolishness indeed. Christ's life, His instruction, and His testimony centered in being what we ought to be. And there is great room in His holy heart to forgive when we fall short in genuinely trying to be what we ought to be.<br><br>Early this morning, under the heading "be and not seem," I noted for myself an idea or two about Him, and I share them with you. These thoughts are not a pretense at comprehensive scholarship but simply an expression of what in Him seems to me at this hour to be so admirable and beautiful and worthy of emulation. I noted first His acute awareness and sensitivity to the lives and needs of others, to the point that the woman in the mob who touched the hem of His garment found response, not only in her own well-being but in His knowledge of the incident. He knew He had been touched, though ever so lightly. And when He mentioned it, His disciples, seeing the thronging multitudes, wondered how He could ask such a question. Who had touched Him? Many were touching Him. But one touched Him with a special need and a heart ready for the response, and He knew it. (See Mark 5:25–34; Luke 8:43–48.)<br><br>Another characteristic of the Lord was His acceptance of others as they were without the intention to leave them as they were. He could heal the body, bless the mind, and help change the soul of one who was willing--the prodigal, Zaccheus, Magdalene. Remember also that moment on the cross when He forgave. Most of all, I am touched by that tender time when a father who loved his ailing son, and who had sought help from the disciples and had not received it, presented himself to the Lord pleading for help. To him the Lord said, "If thou canst believe, all things are possible to him that believeth." Do you think that one who has not loved a son might have a little less sensitivity to this. But with his heart and his life hanging on his son's well-being, when he was asked if he had faith he answered, "Lord, I believe; help thou mine unbelief." He did not have perfect faith, but he knew to whom he spoke and trusted in Him. (See Mark 9:17–27.) Oh, how I love and need that!<br><br>The Lord's courage--while it was not political, not always persuasive, and did not, in terms of this life and the immediacy of the Cross, prevail--was clean, strong, noble, and godly. He spoke the truth and He acted in conformity with it. He also had great humility. He made full use of His power to serve, heal, help, and teach, always making it clear that He relied on His Father and the Spirit. He did it all in the spirit of "the least among us," knowing always who He was and what powers He might have invoked.<br><br>We should not have favorite stories at the expense of many others that another time, another day, more prayers, more tears, and more living may make favorites; but over many years I have loved this one.<br><br><i>He spake this parable unto certain which trusted in themselves that they were righteous, and despised others;</i><br><br><i>Two men went up into the temple to pray; the one a Pharisee and the other a publican.</i><br><br><i>The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself, God, I thank thee that I am not as other men are, extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even as this publican.</i><br><br><i>I fast twice in the week, I give tithes of all that I possess.</i><br><br><i>And the publican, standing afar off, would not lift up so much as his eyes unto heaven, but smote upon his breast, saying, God be merciful to me, a sinner.</i><br><br><i>I tell you, this man went down to his house justified rather than the other: for every one that exalteth himself shall be abased; and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted.</i>[Luke 18:9–14]<br><br>Finally, Christ possessed the love that was greater than faith and greater than hope, that never faileth, that expresses itself in service, in sacrifice, in giving--the love that opened to mankind the door to all that is good here and all that is creative, progressive, challenging, exciting, satisfying, and sweet hereafter. This love was not just language or example but was also specific instruction. In what to me may have been the high point of His instruction about love, He said--and you know the exact words that I could quote, but let me paraphrase--there are those who are hungry and thirsty, who lack sufficient clothing, who are strangers or feel as such, who are sick, who are in prison. Love means doing something for them. "Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me" (Matt. 25:40). This is not a catalog of His virtues, but a testimony of His great heart.<br><br>We who do not want merely to seem but would really like to be will find that the path He laid out in His instruction, in His example, in His testimony--in His life--is one not beyond our capacity to follow. There are those who need to touch us and feel a response of acceptance, affection, and mercy. There are those who are hungry--hungry for food; and we have a little, though perhaps not much. There are many among us who still feel strange in this great institution and who need to be brought in. There are people in hospitals and prisons who are not beyond our capacity to reach.<br><br>I shall give you an example or two as I try to make this meaningful; and I risk a little because one of the examples is the latest and sweetest and loveliest of my own blessings and in sharing I shall spoil it in a sense.<br><br>First let me share with you what I experienced overseas as I listened to a modest, gentle, manly father wearing the uniform of his country, leading and doing a job of importance while he gave great service to the Kingdom and his fellowmen. He told me of his work among many other officers in the prosecution arm of the United States Army--men who were not like him, who were not living the kind of life he was living. They had not been very much interested in the fact that he was a Mormon leader, or that he had a strong sense of loyalty to his wife and children and to God, or that he had control of his tongue and a way of speaking different from their own. None of that impressed them very much. He and his wife found themselves leaving required social events early quite frequently because the activities of the evening were not wholesome. As such an evening would progress, other guests occasionally became ugly as they imbibed additional spirits, lost their normal restraints, and sometimes acted less like men and women than like animals. He was not one to judge lightly or readily, and he was not expressing harsh judgments against them; he was simply presenting a setting for an incident that I shall not forget.<br><br>He said that they went to a Christmas party, more happily this time because the host family was a fine family who had little children of the same general age as their own. The children came in their pajamas by invitation and, joining the host family children, played together in another room while the adults ate their dinner. Periodically the children came out and interrupted proceedings with childish playing or questioning until finally the Mormon father, his sense of humor tried a little bit, said, "Now, look--you kids go on in the other room and stay there and don't come out again or<i>else</i>."<br><br>They sat at dinner in peace for a time; then the bedroom door opened and a little line of children filed out, the two-year-old in the vanguard. (They were sure daddy would not do too much violence to him.) The older brother had him by the shoulders and was egging him on. As the father, disturbed and feeling that he had to do something because he had said he would, began to push back his chair, the two-year-old said, "Daddy, you and mama forgot family prayer."<br><br>Instead of expressing embarrassment, the mother said, "Honey, we did forget." She pushed her chair back, he rose from his, and they excused themselves and quietly took their children and the other children into the bedroom where they performed this simple act of family unity and faith. Then they quietly came back to the table, seated themselves, and went on with the dinner.<br><br>"It was a different night," he said to me, "and it's been a different office. That party didn't end like all the rest. And at the office things are different now."<br><br>To be and not to seem brings great blessings.<br><br>To conclude, here is my own recent experience. There sits a man on this stand today who I admire very much. He has a brother who is a physician and a medical researcher. I had the great honor to visit that brother and his family and others in a stake presidency in another place. The visit was beautiful and sweet, but not extraordinary. We met the families--the wives and children--and conversed with them, got to know and love them, and left the stake feeling like brothers to these choice people.<br><br>After some months had passed, I met the physician on the street in Salt Lake City and we talked for a little while. He seemed pleased that I would remember him, and I got the feeling that there was something he would like to have told me; but both of us had to hurry and so we just put our arms around each other and parted. A few days later a letter came. I shall read it to you just as it is written. If I had any inkling that you would misunderstand it or the purpose I have in reading it, I would not share it. I plead with you, let your hearts tune in for just a moment.<br><br><i>Dear Brother Hanks:</i><br><br><i>Meeting you on the street the other afternoon was a very pleasant surprise for me, and I'm sorry we were in such a hurry because I wanted to share an experience with you that's been very dear to me. Thus, I thought I'd take the opportunity to write you this note and tell you. Perhaps you remember when you visited our stake, the lunch was served by my wife and my young daughter. You asked my daughter her name and she replied, "Mary." You told her that that was the most beautiful name for many reasons. You told her that you also had a daughter named Mary and told her about your Mary. That episode changed Mary's attitude about her name. Up to that point, she had not liked her name very well because she thought it so plain. Thereafter, she thought of her name in a different light. I don't know exactly what you told her or what message she received from you, but I must tell you that it changed her life. My wife and I have reflected on that experience a great deal during these past few months and it has brought back such pleasant and very choice memories. We will be forever grateful to you for that brief encounter and for what it did for Mary. I'm sure that you had no way of knowing that Mary passed away a short time after that. Her death was very sudden and due to medical reasons that are not yet explained. I wanted you to know how you touched her life and thank you for it.</i><br><br>Can we really believe that we have nothing to give? That we are so weak and so simple, you and I? That our consciousness of our personal failings and inadequacies disqualifies us from helping others? That we really cannot expect anybody to care very much or respond to us? Oh, God help us to be and not to seem--to give, to love, to be humble. If we cannot lift up even our eyes unto heaven, then God help us to have sense enough to cry, "God be merciful to me, a sinner." But you have so much to give. Let this simple incident say what I could not say if I had tried for an hour, and tell you that I know this is God's work and that we are really neighbors, brothers, sisters--His children. There is in the least of us--even in the most dependent--that which is better than we understand; shared, it can bring more than we know to those who seek. In the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Marion D. Hanks was a president of the First Quorum of the Seventy of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when this devotional address was given at Brigham Young University on 23 January 1979.</i></i><br><br><i>© Intellectual Reserve, Inc.

<h1>rth to Serve - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
This is a glorious sight indeed. I received a letter just last week from an individual who asked, "Why do the General Authorities have to be so hard-faced?" I do not know how to answer him.<br><br>Following general conference, where I was speaking, someone called my secretary and asked, "Does President Tanner ever smile?" Well, I feel like smiling, but it is hard for me.<br><br>But it is a glorious sight to see all you people assembled here in this student center, and to know that you realize that the glory of God is intelligence, and that you are here to increase your knowledge and understanding so that you can go forth to serve the Lord and your fellowmen. President Kimball has asked me to bring his greetings and his blessings to you people assembled here today--in fact, wherever I go he asks me to do that. But he most particularly loves the youth of the Church, is interested in them, and expects much from them.<br><br>It has been my privilege, as President Oaks has just said, to serve as a counselor to four Presidents of the Church, and it has been interesting to me to note how each had a special message to emphasize. Early in my association with President David O. McKay, he said to me: "Wherever you go, President Tanner, remind those people to remember who they are and then to act accordingly." I am not going to take time to tell you who you are, because you know who you are: Spirit children of God belonging to the Church of Jesus Christ. And how important that is!<br><br>I have given this message many times, and I cannot think of a better one than to remember who you are and then, knowing who you are, to act accordingly wherever you are; to remember that you have an individual responsibility to live so that you influence the lives of others for good and help to strengthen them.<br><br>Just after he became President of the Church, Joseph Fielding Smith gave this message to the press--and it became his clarion call to the Church: "We are living in the Saturday evening of time, and we must prepare ourselves for the second coming of Christ and help the world by teaching the restored gospel, which is the plan of life and salvation."<br><br>President Harold B. Lee, when asked at a press conference what his message would be to his people and to the world, said simply: "Keep the commandments." It is a tremendous thing to consider the impact this message would have if all the people in the world would just keep the commandments. We would then be prepared for the Second Coming, and for salvation and exaltation.<br><br>We are all aware of President Kimball's oft-repeated instruction to "lengthen our stride." (I do not think that he really felt it would become a slogan when he said it, but it is being used all over the Church, throughout the world.) He leads the way for all of us. Someone asked me the other day, "What is your greatest responsibility?" and I said, "Trying to keep up with the President." He is very anxious to see that the gospel is taken to all the world--every nation, kindred, tongue, and people--and that temples are built so that we may perform the saving ordinances for those who have gone before us. While much of the world is at war, the way is opening in more and more new areas where our twenty-seven thousand missionaries can share the gospel message with the world.<br><br>It is awesome to me as I contemplate the influence another twenty-seven thousand of you students as you leave this University are now having and will have on the affairs of the Church, governments, industry, business, economics, and the moral and social aspects of life throughout the world. Your influence is bound to be felt, for good or bad, regardless of where you are or what you are doing. Set out with a determination that you will make your influence positive and good. People are looking to and keeping an eye on members of the Church more than they ever have before in our history.<br><br>The other day I read some statements written by the sports columnist of the<i>Tucson Citizen Sports</i>. I should like to share them with you:<br><br><i>It happens every time I visit that beautiful campus at Brigham Young University. I walk away feeling that I have just brushed up against cleanliness.</i><br><br><i>In Provo last Saturday I sat on BYU's sidelines directly in front of the studentbody section. It's easy to exude good sportsmanship when your team is shellacking the opponent; but you get the feeling that win or lose BYU students have class; and that they are the best-groomed students on any campus in this area. When you walk the campus at BYU with snow-capped mountains in the background and the fresh, clean, wholesome kids walking back and forth along the beautifully manicured grounds it is gratifying to know that at least one university in this part of the country is teaching its students that it only costs a little more to go first-class</i>. [Regus McCollie,<i>Tucson Citizen Sports</i>, December 1977]<br><br>The other day your newspaper editor received this letter regarding Brigham Young University; I should also like to read it.<br><br><i>Your behavior at the UTEP basketball game at the Marriott Center prompted this letter. First my credentials: I graduated from BYU (I know all the words to the "Cougar Fight Song"), and all of my children have attended BYU. I have been observing the student section sine the days of the Springville gym. You have always supported your teams, win or lose, in a grand manner.</i><br><br><i>Now for the lecture: Our home is in University of Utah territory, and we have always been proud that "our" student body didn't act like the Utes. Last night I was appalled at the booing, shouting, etc., that I observed coming from your side of the arena. I know President Oaks, who sits a few rows in front of us, was embarrassed too. I thought I was watching the wrong student body. Only the colors were different.</i><br><br><i>Please give my words some serious thought before the BYU-Utah game, or our neighbors will never let us live it down. You're the greatest kids on earth--act like it</i>. [L. Tucker, letter to editor,<i>Daily Universe,</i>17 January 1979]<br><br>I am sure there have been just a few exhibitions of bad sportsmanship by loyal BYU fans, as there are at most sporting events, but let us at BYU always maintain dignity even in our exuberance and keep the Tucson sportswriter's words in mind: "You get the feeling that win or lose BYU students have class; and that they are the best-groomed students on any campus in this area."<br><br>There are some who rebel at the standards required at BYU, but it is those standards which keep BYU from becoming just another university of students beset with morals problems and lack of reverence for God and country, and in general displaying many of the symptoms that are the source of much of the world's unrest today.<br><br>I like what a lad wrote in a letter to the editor of the<i>Daily Universe</i>. I hope you will keep his words in mind as you contemplate the reasons for his choosing to attend BYU. He wrote as follows from Minnesota:<br><br><i>As someone not in attendance at BYU, I had a chance to read the text of President Kimball's speech published in the September 13<sup>th</sup></i>Daily Universe<i>.</i><br><br><i>I am a person taking instruction in the Mormon faith. I hope to attend BYU in the future. I chose BYU as opposed to Harvard, Yale, and others because I believe it is special. The school and its people are special because standards are adhered to, not arbitrary standards set up by whim or caprice, but standards set down by a "living prophet of God." Those four words jump out from the printed page.</i><br><br><i>When I am a student there I will covenant to keep these standards, not under force but with free will and happiness. Students at BYU are considered "different" because of these standards. That difference is not one of disrespect, but one reflecting that they are indeed a "chosen" people, something for which they can be eternally proud, and something no one else can claim. I look forward to being able to make that claim.</i><br><br><i>These are some reflections of a person looking in</i>. [T. Ray Lippert, letter to the editor,<i>Daily Universe</i>, 4 October 1978]<br><br>He recognizes that Brigham Young University is outstanding and different. How fortunate you are to be able to attend this University with an outstanding president and faculty; where the gospel is taught; where the President of the Church, a prophet of God, is chairman of the Board of Trustees; and which rates so highly in all academic fields!<br><br>It is not my intent, I am sure you understand, to make you feel puffed up or boastful by citing these examples, but to help you realize who you are so that you may act accordingly. Do not ever let it be said that you are the one who is responsible for bringing disgrace or discredit to the University, or the one who causes disillusionment of the good reports about Brigham Young University because of<i>your</i>bad example.<br><br>As I think of the potential of twenty-five thousand or more of you leaving this University, as I said before, and spreading yourselves throughout the world, I cannot help but be aware of the leavening influence you can be in so many different ways; and I am assuming that you are all going to be an influence for<i>good</i>wherever you go.<br><br>In your alumni publication<i>Today</i>, there is usually a list of BYU alumni and what they are doing in their vocational pursuits. It is most impressive that there are so many who are leaders in their respective fields, and it is a credit to the University for having taught so well. Let me list just a few from the December issue:<br><br><i>Dean Dennett,</i>[class of]<i>'53, was elected to the office of Superintendent of the Shasta County, California, schools. . . .</i><br><br><i>Kenneth G. Larsen,</i>[class of]<i>'53, was recently promoted to Colonel in the U.S. army, while serving as Chief of the Army National Guard Recruiting and Retention Support Center at Fort Sheridan, Illinois . . .</i><br><br><i>Donald R.

Atwater,</i>[class of]<i>'75, was recently promoted to Captain in the U.S. Air Force. . . . He is presently serving as an intelligence officer at Headquarters Strategic Air Command . . . and working on developing the U.S. nuclear war plans.</i>["Alumni Today,"<i>Brigham Young University Today</i>32, no. 8 (December 1978): 24-28]<br><br>These are just a few of those who have gone forth from this campus to serve in a variety of occupations throughout the world. You can and should decide today that you will serve with distinction and continue to bring honor to your alma mater and to the Church.<br><br>Listed with the accomplishments of many of these alumni were their family status and their Church activity. I have always maintained that to be truly successful and happy one must seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and the other things will come (see Matthew 6:33). Never be ashamed of the gospel of Jesus Christ. Do not hesitate to let people know what your standards are and be courageous enough to take a stand when necessary.<br><br>If I have not said enough already to convince you that living the standards of the Church will help you, let me read from two letters received from Washington by President Spencer W. Kimball a couple of months ago. One was from a senator's administrative assistant. This is what he said:<br><br><i>I have been intending to write you for some time now, following a conversation I had about the problem of acquiring competent staff for Capitol Hill offices.</i><br><br><i>I told a senator--and I was quite serious about it--that in twelve years of running my senator's office, I had developed a great admiration for members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. We try very hard to hire as many natives of our own state as possible for office jobs, of course. But over the years, I have learned that virtually without exception, our most dedicated, hard-working employees have been members of your religion. It has happened so often that I know it isn't mere coincidence.</i><br><br><i>When I mentioned this fact at a meeting, other people from other Capitol offices indicated they had made the same discovery. So, I now have a rule-of-thumb which goes: All other things being equal, we will offer the job to the candidate who is a Mormon. Not knowing just who to thank for all of the good fortune we have had with members of your church over the years, I decided to convey the information to you</i>[President Kimball]<i>. I just hope you will continue to encourage young people with whom you are associated to consider careers on Capitol Hill, because we can sure use more of them out here.</i><br><br>Then his senator, to whom he had shown the letter, wanted to add a few thoughts of his own, and he said:<br><br><i>What he says is true. We have utilized members of the LDS Church in virtually every capacity in the office, and I can't recall a time when the results weren't exceptionally good. Members of your church seem better prepared to accept the responsibilities of adult life, and their training usually puts them miles ahead of other job-seekers out here. But in the final analysis, I think the one quality which sets them apart is their dedication. For example, they never have to be told to work long hours--they usually recognize the need and do so. I, in turn, am very pleased that the reputation of our office is such that many young Mormons check in here as soon as they arrive in town. I think we have become sort of a home-away-from-home for them. That is flattering indeed, and I hope our long association with members of you religion continues in the years ahead.</i><br><br>I can believe that offices sets an example for honesty and integrity that is all too lacking in some government offices today.<br><br>You young men and women not only have the opportunity but you have the great responsibility, as members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and as students of this great University, to go out and turn the world around. (I was going to say, "literally set the world on fire," but I suppose there is too much arson going on for me to say that.) I repeat: We must never be ashamed of the gospel of Christ, and we must never be ashamed of our principles and standards. We must be proud of our heritage and the fact that we belong to the Church of Jesus Christ, which was restored in these latter days through the Prophet Joseph Smith. Nearly 150 years ago when he organized the Church under divine direction his name was ridiculed, and he was persecuted and finally killed as a martyr for the cause he espoused. Today, as recorded in a publication called<i>Forecast: 1979</i>, which quotes from a book ranking the most influential persons in history, Joseph Smith is recorded as probably the most influential religious leader in American history.<br><br>Although it was assumed that his death would mark the end of the Mormon religion, the Church continued to flourish and, overcoming much adversity and great trials and tribulations, is still making tremendous growth and progress because it is the Church of Jesus Christ; and, according to the scriptures, the word of the Lord shall go forth by the mouths of his disciples and none shall stay them (see D&amp;amp;C 1:4–5).<br><br>We must all exert every effort to remain "true to the faith which our parents have cherished," and for which "martyrs have perished" (see<i>Hymns</i>, no. 157). You are the ones who now must prepare yourselves to carry on and be a light unto the world. I am so proud that we have people like you preparing to go out and take a stand. It is only through the gospel that the world can be saved, and it is only through those who know and understand and have the authority to teach the message that it can be taken to the world. This is your responsibility.<br><br>Let us consider some of the specific areas where it is vital for us to take a stand for righteousness' sake. We must first be aware of the forces at work and the attacks they are making against the moral fiber of our civilization. First of all we must be aware of the antichristian element among us. There are those who want to take Christ out of Christmas, who would silence the singing of "Silent Night" and other religious hymns, who would keep from public display the nativity scene or prevent the presentation of religious pageants relating to the Savior. Determine now that you will speak out against these forces which are undermining the very principles upon which this nation was founded as a Christian nation, principles recognizing God as the Creator of the World and Christ as its Savior and establishing a constitution based on Christian principles.<br><br>While we are talking about our early settlers, I might mention an article I read at Thanksgiving time which referred to the observance of the first Thanksgiving when the Pilgrims were not merely praising God for seeing them through that first year and their first harvest, but were celebrating their success in a society where everyone worked and contributed for the benefit of all. The article went on to compare that concept with the situation today where we have so many able-bodied men and women accepting government welfare with no attempt to work for their sustenance even when they are able. The author concluded that the Pilgrims would no doubt advocate workfare as opposed to welfare. From the very early days of the Church, its members have been encouraged to be honest, hard-working, self-reliant, thrifty, and eager to assist the less fortunate. This should be your attitude as you go out into the world.<br><br>There are so many moral issues at stake in today's society. I am sure you have already determined to keep yourself clean and pure and to avoid the temptations which will keep you from your goal of returning to live with your Father in Heaven where you will enjoy immortality and eternal life. You must not only keep yourselves morally clean, but you must use your influence to persuade others to so live that they may enjoy the blessings that come from obedience to God's commandments. Only as you do this can you be sure that you and your families can live in communities where you will not be subjected to the evils that come from immorality and obscenity.<br><br>I think I need not elaborate on what happens to individuals, to families, to communities, and to nations when the laws of God are violated. There is no happiness in sin, and the penalty is paid even by generations yet unborn. In fact, the greatest burden that one has to bear is the burden of sin. To be free of this burden and accomplish the goals we want to reach, we must be prepared to discipline ourselves and not rationalize.<br><br>Another area for attack is pornography. I need not tell you the influence for evil that obscenity and pornography exert on an individual and on a community. In a California newspaper a story recently appeared with this headline: "Porno stays only as long as we allow it." This statement was made by a policeman at a businessmen's luncheon, and a list was given of those communities that had organized and were successful in closing up adult bookstores and pornographic newspaper stands, and another list of those who had done nothing and were still plagued with problems because of them.<br><br>Your own president, Dallin Oaks, has made this statement regarding pornography:<br><br><i>Pornographic or erotic stories and pictures are worse than filthy or polluted food. The body has defenses to rid itself of unwholesome food. With a few fatal exceptions, bad food will only make you sick but do no permanent harm. In contrast, a person who feasts upon filthy stories or pornographic or erotic pictures and literature records them in this marvelous retrieval system we call a brain. The brain won't vomit back filth. Once recorded it will always remain subject to recall, flashing its perverted images across your mind and drawing you away from the wholesome things in life.</i>[Dallin H. Oaks, "Challenges for the Year Ahead," speech given at Brigham Young University, 6 September 1973]<br><br>I hope that none of you will ever hesitate to lead out in efforts to rid our society of these evils to which I have referred. Do not wait for others to take the initiative. You may feel that nothing can be accomplished by one or two persons, but that is where it all begins. I am reminded of a little poem, which reads:<br><br><i>"Your task, to build a better world," God said.</i><br><i>I answered, "How?"</i><br><i>The world is such a large, vast place,</i><br><i>So complicated now.</i><br><br><i>And I so small and useless am</i><br><i>There's nothing I can do."</i><br><i>But God, in all his wisdom, said,</i><br><i>"Just build a better you."</i><br>[Anonymous]<br><br>It all starts with one; and, as I have tried to emphasize, because of who you are it is your responsibility to help make this a better world. You have been chosen to come forth in this particular time and place, and there has never been a greater need for strong and righteous leadership than now. We must not allow Satan, through his cunning and deceitful methods, to be victorious in his attempts to persuade so many to follow him. He claims to be the god of this world; and as we view conditions today we are persuaded that we are moving rapidly in that direction.<br><br>We have been warned and forewarned regarding the evils of such immoral practices as homosexuality, lesbianism, premarital sex, and all other forms of impure, unnatural, and unholy practices. Nobody has been warned as we have. All these things are in direct violation of the laws of God and will lead to our downfall. I think you understand what I am saying; but for those of you who rationalize or feel that the definitions are not quite clear, let me pass on to you what President Joseph Fielding Smith said: "If there is any doubt in your mind, do not do it."<br><br>We must take a stand for freedom and love of country. Let us do everything in our power to preserve liberty, which is a God-given gift; but let us strive for peaceful ways to solve our problems. With all the strife and conflict and turmoil going on in the world today, there is nothing which could not be resolved through simply applying the Golden Rule and keeping the commandments of God. This is the message of the gospel that you will carry to the world, either through active service as missionaries or through example in your daily lives.<br><br>Now, you cannot expect to leave here and go out and change the world unless you begin while here to prepare yourselves. You cannot cheat a little here and there, or be dishonest in your dealings, or practice a little immorality and then expect to go out into the world and set that good example about which I have been talking. It shocks me to pick up a copy of your<i>Daily Universe</i>and read such headlines as these I recently saw: "Artifacts, Coins Stolen from Y," or "Phone Abuse Campus Problem." None of you, I am sure, would be guilty of these things--it must have been some strangers who were passing through town. Wherever we can correct such abuses, let us not be afraid to get involved. Let us keep this campus the best.<br><br>You have probably heard my story about an introduction made of me by the governor of Texas when I went there from Canada to speak to a group of oilmen. He knew that I had been a bishop, and in his introduction he referred to that and then said: "Any man who is worthy to be a bishop in the Mormon Church needs no other introduction as far as I am concerned." He was not trying to compliment me, but was paying a tribute to the Church because of a bishop or bishops he had known. Suppose just one of them had let him down; it would have made all the difference in his attitude toward the Church and its members. So often the Church is judged by someone through the acts of the only member he has known. How will you individually affect its reputation? Let us answer the question:<br><br><i>What kind of church would this</i><br><i>church be</i><br><i>If everyone in it were just</i><br><i>like me?</i><br><br>What a wonderful thing it would be if everyone could say, "A graduate of Brigham Young University needs no other introduction as far as I am concerned," or "A missionary for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints needs no other introduction as far as I am concerned"! That could be our reputation--you know it could. It is all up to you.<br><br>I heard of an employer who asked a young man, "If I hire you, can I depend on you?"<br><br>The response was: "Yes, sir. You can depend on me whether you hire me or not."<br><br>Speaking of hiring, I refer to a recent newspaper column with a big headline: "Reasons to Hire Non-smokers." Lest any of you do indulge or have been tempted, let me cite the reasons given: Less absenteeism, fewer illnesses, fewer chronic diseases leading to early disability, fewer work accidents, more productivity, better impression with the general public, less destructiveness of company property, less offense to fellow workers, less susceptibility to many occupational health hazards.<br><br>The Word of Wisdom was not given to us capriciously. There is more and more evidence every day about the ill effects of tobacco on those who smoke, nonsmokers in the presence of smokers, and even unborn children. It is not smart to smoke; it is folly. Read the Word of Wisdom carefully and live accordingly, so that the promise given can be fulfilled. This is it:<br><br><i>And all saints who remember to keep and do these sayings, walking in obedience to the commandments, shall receive health in their navel and marrow to their bones;</i><br><br><i>And shall find wisdom and great treasures of knowledge, even hidden treasure;</i><br><br><i>And shall run and not be weary, and shall walk and not faint.</i><br><br><i>And I, the Lord, give unto them a promise, that the destroying angel shall pass by them, as the children of Israel, and not slay them.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 89:18­ndash;21; emphasis added]<br><br>I now call your attention to the phrase "walking in obedience to the commandments," which we must do in addition to keeping the Word of Wisdom in order to receive the promise. Now is the time to determine to do this, and it will soon become automatic; your decisions will have been made, and when moments of temptation come you already will have chosen to do right.<br><br>You will be honest tithe-payers, you will attend your meetings, you will accept and discharge with diligence the calls that come to you, you will have family and individual prayer regularly, you will study the scriptures and keep the commandments found therein, and as you do so the Lord will pour out so many blessings that you will not be able to contain them. What more could you ask?<br><br>We have talked at some length, and ordinarily I am a great believer in short speeches-dev. I hope that you do not feel as one man did at a football banquet for Yale University where the coach, who was sometimes long-winded, was the speaker. He had decided to key his speech around the school's name and took 15 minutes on "Y" for youth, more time for "A" on ability, then "L" for loyalty. Just as he started "E" for excellence someone was heard to say, "Thank goodness he isn't the coach for Massachusetts Institute of Technology."<br><br>Seriously, I like to come here because I love the young people of the Church, and I love Brigham Young University. I want the very best for all of you; and I know that, as you complete your work here and leave for your various fields of endeavor in various parts of the world, each of you has some particular mission to perform. We are counting on you--the Lord is counting on you. Do not let him down. Remember that you are his child; call on him and he will answer.<br><br>Some of you will someday be holding positions of leadership in the Church. One of you may one day stand at this pulpit, as I am honored to do today. May your testimony be as mine, that I know beyond a shadow of a doubt that God lives, and that Jesus Christ is his Son, the Savior of the world. He gave his life for us that we might be resurrected to immortality and eternal life. I testify that Spencer W. Kimball is a prophet of God and his mouthpiece on the earth today, as was Joseph Smith through whom the gospel was restored. This is the Church of Jesus Christ; and as you so live and show your love for him, he will bless you and keep you, which is my prayer for you in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>N. Eldon Tanner was a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when this devotional address was given at Brigham Young University on 30 January 1979.</i></i><br><br><i>© Intellectual Reserve, Inc.

<h1>uot;All Are Alike Unto God&quot; - Howard W. Hunter - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
This multistake fireside that brings you together each month is the largest in the Church, and it is an honor to be invited to address you. I have a deep awareness of the responsibility associated with this honor and therefore seek the guidance of the Spirit and pray that I might have utterance to portray to you some of the thoughts that are on my mind.<br><br>Brigham Young University is distinctive. It is, as it were, a gathering place for children of our Father from many nationalities and cultures around the world. The campus and those who come here are testaments to the truth that the gospel of Jesus Christ transcends nationality and color, crosses cultural lines, and blends distinctiveness into a common brotherhood. This is the way the Church feels about each of you--and it is about this common brotherhood that I wish to speak.<br><br>I take as a theme a passage from the Book of Mormon referring to the Lord's relationship to the children of men throughout the earth in which it is stated:<br><br><i>... And he inviteth them all to come unto him and partake of his goodness; and he denieth none that come unto him, black and white, bond and free, male and female; and he remembereth the heathen; and all are alike unto God, both Jew and Gentile.</i>[2 Nephi 26:33]<br><br>From this statement it is clear that<i>all</i>men are invited to come unto him and<i>all</i>are alike unto him. Race makes no difference; color makes no difference; nationality makes no difference. The brotherhood of man is literal. We are all of one blood and the literal spirit offspring of our eternal Heavenly Father. Before we came to earth, we belonged to his eternal family. We associated and knew each other there. Our common paternity makes us not only literal sons and daughters of eternal parentage, but literal brothers and sisters as well. This is a fundamental teaching of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.<br><br>I would like to read to you several passages from the scriptures that refer to our common paternity and how our nationalities were determined. First, from Paul's address on Mars' Hill to the intellectuals in the marketplace at Athens. Because of their worship of an unknown god, Paul was directing his remarks to an explanation of the true God. He said:<br><br><i>And</i>[God]<i>hath made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on all the face of the earth, and hath determined the times before appointed, and the bounds of their habitation</i>. [Acts 17:26]<br><br>The words "hath made of one blood all nations of men" refer to Adam, the mortal father of the nations of men. The whole human race is the offspring of one man. Paul said that by divine plan the offspring has been scattered over the earth at the "times before appointed"--that is, the period fixed by God for the several families to go into the countries where he decreed they should dwell. Not only did God determine the times when they should go, but also the "bounds of their habitation," or, in other words, the countries where they should dwell so that their posterity might carry out the Lord's divine purposes.<br><br>The second passage of scripture is from the Book of Deuteronomy. The writer uses these words: "When the most High divided to the nations their inheritance, when he separated the sons of Adam, he set the bounds of the people according to the number of the children of Israel" (Deuteronomy 32:8). This would indicate that the Lord separated the offspring of Adam into nations and at the same time provided an inheritance for the children of Jacob.<br><br>The other passage is this statement made by Peter to Cornelius and his friends:<br><br><i>Of a truth I perceive that God is no respecter of persons:</i><br><br><i>But in every nation he that feareth him, and worketh righteousness, is accepted with him.</i>[Acts 10:34–35]<br><br>Peter had been of the opinion that only Jews were in the favor of the Lord and that Gentiles were not as acceptable. Before he had even met Cornelius, though, a vision was shown him, and he saw plainly that God was not partial. No nation or people or individual could expect to be favored above another.<br><br>From those passages of scripture we learn these basic principles: First, all men on earth are of one blood--we stem from common ancestors, Adam and Eve; second, God, our Father, in his omniscient wisdom, determined premortally the nation in which we were to live; third, nationalities are apparently circumscribed in relation to the House of Israel; fourth, our Father does not favor one people over another, but accepts all those of every nation who fear him and work righteousness.<br><br>The Church, being the kingdom of God on earth, has a mission to all nations.<br><br><i>Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the son, and of the Holy Ghost:</i><br><br><i>Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you</i>. [Matthew 28:19–20]<br><br>These words from the lips of the Master know no national boundaries; they are not limited to any race or culture. One nation is not favored above another. The admonition is clear--"teach<i>all</i>nations."<br><br>A present prophet has renewed this great challenge to the leaders of the Church. In addressing the Regional Representatives, he said:<br><br><i>The scriptures are replete with commands and promises and calls and rewards for teaching the gospel. I use the word command deliberately, for it seems to be an insistent directive from which we, singly and collectively, cannot escape.</i><br><br><i>I ask you, what did he mean when the Lord took his Twelve Apostles to the top of the Mount of Olives and said: "And ye shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem, and in all Judaea, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth."</i>(Acts 1:8.)<i>These were his last words on earth before he went to his heavenly home.</i><br><br><i>What is the significance of the phrase "uttermost part of the earth"? He had already covered the area known to the apostles. Was it the people in Judea? Or those in Samaria? Or the few millions in the Near East? Where were the "uttermost parts of the earth"? Did he mean the millions in what is now America? Did he include the hundreds of thousands, or even millions, in Greece, Italy, and around the Mediterranean, the inhabitants of central Europe? What did he mean? Or did he mean all the living people of all the world and those spirits assigned to this world to come in centuries ahead? Have we underestimated his language or its meaning? How can we be satisfied with 100,00 converts out of four billion people in the world who need the gospel?</i><br><br>[President Kimball continues:]<i>After his crucifixion the eleven apostles assembled on a mountain in Galilee, and the Savior came to them and said: "All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth.</i><br><br><i>"Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost:"</i>[He said "all nations."]<br><br><i>"Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you always, even unto the end of the world. Amen."</i>(Matthew 28:18–20.)<br><br><i>Again as Mark records the events after the resurrection, he upbraided those who had some doubts about his resurrection, then commanded them: "Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature."</i>(Mark 16:15.)<br><br><i>And Luke records the event--"That repentance and remission of sins should be preached ... among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem."</i>(Luke 24:47.)<i>Again, his last command. Surely there is significance in these words! There was a universal need and there must be universal coverage.</i><br><br><i>As I remember the world as Moses saw it--it was a big world. "And Moses beheld the world and the ends thereof, and all the children of men which are, and which were created."</i>(Moses 1:8.)<br><br><i>I am constrained to believe that at that time the Lord knew the bounds of the habitations of man and the areas that would be settled and already knew his people who would possess this world.</i>["When the World Will Be Converted," address to Regional Representatives,<i>Ensign,</i>October 1974, p.2.]<br><br>Several significant developments have taken place recently that will materially assist in accomplishing the commission to teach all nations. There has been revealed the timely need for building up the First Quorum of the Seventy.<br><br>One of the revelations formulating the constitution for the affairs of the kingdom makes this provision:<br><br><i>The Twelve are a Traveling Presiding High Council, to officiate in the name of the Lord, under the direction of the Presidency of the Church, agreeable to the institution of heaven; to build up the church, and regulate all the affairs of the same in all nations.</i><br><br>[The revelations then continues to define the duties of the Seventy:]<i>The Seventy are to act in the name of the Lord, under the direction of the Twelve or the traveling high council, in building up the church and regulating all the affairs of the same in all nations....</i><br><br><i>It is the duty of the traveling high council to call upon the Seventy, when they need assistance</i>. [D&amp;amp;C 107:33–34, 38.]<br><br>With the rapid growth of the Church and the heavy demands on the Twelve to provide leadership and administration and teach all nations, it becomes clear why the Lord has directed the building up of the First Quorum of the Seventy. The recent decision to do so by the First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve reminds us of an interesting historical parallel of an episode recorded by Luke in the Acts of the Apostles. The foreign or Hellenistic Jews in Jerusalem were complaining that their widows were being neglected and not taken care of like the widows of the native Jews. When the apostles heard of this murmuring, a significant thing happened:<br><br><i>Then the twelve called the multitude of the disciples unto them, and said, It is not reason that we should leave the word of God, and serve tables.</i><br><br><i>Wherefore brethren, look ye out among you seven men of honest report, full of the Holy Ghost and wisdom, whom we may appoint over this business.</i><br><br><i>But we will give ourselves continually to prayer, and to the ministry of the word</i>. [Acts 6:2–4]<br><br>In other words, the Twelve told the meeting that it was not reasonable for them to leave their important office of teaching the gospel to provide for the daily welfare of the widows and serve their tables. There were other good men who could look after these duties so the Twelve could continue to devote themselves to the charge of teaching the gospel to all persons. The result of the decision to call others to assist with the details was this: "And the word of God increased; and the number of the disciples multiplied in Jerusalem greatly; and a great company of the priests were obedient to the faith" (Acts 6:7).<br><br>In the brief statement of that episode, we learn these facts: First, that the Twelve determined they were not to "serve tables" or, in other words, occupy their time in the details of administration; second, they appointed seven men, "full of the Holy Ghost and wisdom," to look after the day-to-day needs; third, the Twelve then devoted their energies to the "ministry of the word"; fourth, the word of God increased, and the gospel was carried to greater numbers.<br><br>In December 1978, the First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve made a similar determination that it was no longer advisable for the Twelve to occupy their time in the details of administration of the many Church departments. They delegated seven men, designated as the presidents of the First Quorum of the Seventy, to give supervision to these details so that the Twelve could devote their full energies to the overall direction of the work, and, as directed by the Doctrine and Covenants, "To build up the church, and regulate all the affairs of the same in all nations."<br><br>I fully believe that in the near future we will see some of the greatest advancements in spreading the gospel to all nations that have ever taken place in this dispensation or any previous dispensation. I am sure that we will be able to look back in retrospect--as a result of the decision recently made--and record as Luke did, "And the word of God increased."<br><br>Another significant development of recent date is the revelation on extending priesthood blessings to all worthy male members, regardless of race or color, which will assist also in accomplishing the commission to teach all nations.<br><br>Gradually nations are opening their doors, and the areas of the earth to which the gospel is being carried are increasing. With approximately 28,000 missionaries, more than at any time in the past, teaching is being increased. Missionaries are now extending the work to the west as far as Thailand, which leaves only Burma and Pakistan, to India, on the backside of the world. To the east there are missionaries as far as Iran, with only a short gap to India. They almost circle the globe.<br><br>From these revelations and developments, it should be manifestly evident to members of the Church that our Father loves all of his children. He desires all of them to embrace the gospel and come unto him. Only those are favored who obey him and keep his commandments.<br><br>As members of the Lord's church, we need to lift our vision beyond personal prejudices. We need to discover the supreme truth that indeed our Father is no respecter of persons. Sometimes we unduly offend brothers and sisters of other nations by assigning exclusiveness to one nationality of people over another.<br><br>Let me cite, as an example of exclusiveness, the present problem in the Middle East--the conflict between the Arabs and the Jews. We do not need to apologize nor mitigate any of the prophecies concerning the Holy Land. We believe them and declare them to be true. But this does not give us justification to dogmatically pronounce that others of our Father's children are not children of promise.<br><br>We have members of the Church in the Muslim world. These are wonderful Saints, good members of the Church. They live in Iran, Egypt, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, and other countries. Sometimes they are offended by members of the Church who give the impression that we favor only the aims of the Jews. The Church has an interest in all of Abraham's descendants, and we should remember that the history of the Arabs goes back to Abraham through his son Ishmael.<br><br>Imagine a father with many sons, each having different temperaments, aptitudes, and spiritual traits. Does he love one son less than another? Perhaps the son who is least spiritually inclined has the father's attention, prayers, and pleadings more than the others. Does that mean that he loves the others less? Do you imagine our Heavenly Father loving one nationality of his offspring more exclusively than others? As members of the Church, we need to be reminded of Nephi's challenging question: "Know ye not that there are more nations than one?" (2 Nephi 29:7).<br><br>At the present time we are engaged in a project of beautifying the Mount of Olives in Jerusalem by a garden, in memory of Orson Hyde, an early apostle of the Church, and the dedicatory prayer he offered on that site. It is not because we favor one people over another. Jerusalem is sacred to the Jews, but it is also sacred to the Arabs.<br><br>A cabinet minister of Egypt once told me that if a bridge is ever built between Christianity and Islam it must be built by the Mormon Church. In making inquiry as to the reason for his statement I was impressed by his recitation of the similarities and the common bonds of brotherhood.<br><br>Both the Jews and the Arabs are children of our Father. They are both children of promise, and as a church we do not take sides. We have love for and an interest in each. The purpose of the gospel of Jesus Christ is to bring about love, unity, and brotherhood of the highest order. Like Nephi of old, may we be able to say, "I have charity for the Jew. ... I also have charity for the Gentiles." (2 Nephi 33:8, 9.)<br><br>To our friends of Judah, we say: We are your brethren of the house of Joseph--we feel close relationship to you. We are messengers of the true covenant and bear a message that God has spoken in this day and time.<br><br>To our kinsmen of Abraham, we say: We are your brethren--we look upon no nation or nationality as second-class citizens. We invite all men to investigate our message and to receive our fellowship.<br><br>To our brothers and sisters of all nationalities: We bear solemn witness and testify that God has spoken in our day and time, that heavenly messengers have been sent, that God has revealed his mind and will to a prophet, Joseph Smith. And, as Andrew beckoned his brother, Simon Peter, to come and hear the Messiah, we say to one and all: "Come and see" (see John 1:35–42).<br><br>As our Father loves all his children, we must love all people--of every race, culture, and nationality--and teach them the principles of the gospel that they might embrace it and come to a knowledge of the divinity of the Savior. Only they are favored who keep his commandments.<br><br>I know that God is our eternal Heavenly Father, and that his son, Jesus Christ, is the Savior of the world. We will receive blessings and find exaltation by following him, keeping his commandments, having love for and teaching all nations. In the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>© Intellectual Reserve, Inc. All rights reserved.</i>
<h1>Beauty - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
President Oaks, faculty, students, and friends of BYU, I come before you with heartfelt gratitude and appreciation for this precious opportunity and privilege of speaking to you today. I come in humility, subdued in spirit and desiring only your prayers and the guidance of the Holy Ghost so that what I will say will be the mind and will of the Lord.<br><br>It is great to be back on the campus of the greatest university in all the world. I think of BYU as a center of refined culture, spiritual growth, leadership development, learning, and progress. Unlike some universities, it is not a center for atheism, immorality, confusion, hate, crime, or political and moral rebellions. BYU is also a "happy hunting ground" for many of its students; it is here that I met my eternal companion. My wife and I have some choice and fond memories of this place. We are grateful for the beautiful influences of this great and marvelous University.<br><br>There is a poetic phrase in Navajo folklore that goes something like this: "May I walk in beauty--beauty behind me, beauty in front of me, beauty above and beneath me, and beauty all around me." To a Navajo, to "walk in beauty" simply means to be happy and to have peace of mind and peace with oneself; to be happy and at peace with others; to be happy and at peace with the environment and the world; and to be happy and at peace with the Great Spirit.<br><br>It is in this kind of spirit, my brothers and sisters, that I stand before you today. I sincerely feel that I am happy and at peace with myself; happy and at peace with my family; my neighbors, and you; at peace and happy with the world; and at peace and happy with the Lord Jesus Christ. I am especially at peace and happy with my Comanche wife; there is no tribal dispute between her and me. We are probably the only two tribes in the whole USA that are at peace with each other. I simply feel great, my brothers and sisters. To "walk in beauty" means just that--to feel great and at peace in one's mind about everyone and everything.<br><br>The word "great" is a very interesting word. It has the same connotation and meaning as the Navajo phrase, "to walk in beauty." Sometimes we use this word to apply to persons or things. We can speak about BYU as a great institution, you students as a great student body, the faculty as great scholars and teachers, the athletic teams as great athletes or persons, and our nation as a great country. However, this word has one of its finest applications in describing you and me. It designates a human dimension of the highest quality, excellence, or ability.<br><br>Greatness is also one of our goals in achieving eternal life. My feeling or philosophy has always been this: If we want to be a great soul in heaven, then we ought to live and practice being a great soul here on earth. In other words, if we desire to become Christlike, we ought to practice and live a Christlike life here and now. To put it in yet another perspective, if we desire exaltation, we ought to "walk in beauty" in all of our days on earth and into the eternities.<br><br>Whether our concern is for here or for hereafter, we should be aware of those beautiful godlike virtues or personality traits in each of us that are great in power and in magnitude. These godlike attributes provide divine influences that urge each of us to seek praiseworthy goals. They urge us to reach upward and onward toward perfection in every field of activity. When these character qualities are not disciplined or when they are distorted, ideals are forsaken and the resulting confusion dampens our faith and progress.<br><br>Our Heavenly Father represents the greatest good in all the universe. He is all-wise and all-knowing; He possesses all knowledge and is all-powerful and perfect. If you and I will follow Him, His influence, His instructions, and His commandments, we can actually become like Him. He is the giver of all things that are good, positive, and beautiful. We will only "walk in beauty" when we keep His greatness, His virtues, and His qualities in our minds. If we can keep in our minds the thought that we possess His personality traits, mental abilities, and character qualities, our lives will be full of beauty before us, beauty behind us, beauty beneath and above us. Our lives will be full of successful, spiritual, and beautiful experiences.<br><br>If properly trained and disciplined, our godlike human mind can perform some of the most powerful and beautiful things. It can make some of you great teachers, great salesmen, great scientists, great musicians, or simply great persons. Jesus Christ said, "All things are possible to him that believeth" (Mark 9:23). There is beauty in our minds if they are full of positive, pleasant, and beautiful thoughts. Faith, courage, strength, industry, and happiness of the greatest possible value can be built only in a mental environment of positive and praiseworthy thoughts. Success or failure starts in the mind. In other words, if you and I did not have heads, we would be perfect.<br><br>Whatever kinds of thoughts we entertain in our minds will dictate whether we will succeed or fail in life. Whatever success or accomplishments we obtain in life will be predicated on a disciplined mind thriving on positive and virtuous thoughts. A disciplined mind in a bed of pure thoughts will gradually banish doubts and fears from the mind. Doubts and fear are the enemies of faith, for faith lives and grows in the mind. Faith is nurtured, cultivated, and developed in the mind in the presence of clean and pure thoughts. We live by faith--our faith in ourselves, our faith in others, our faith in our country, our faith in our work, and our faith in God. We will achieve more and we will receive greater personal power and strength only when we have faith in God and in our own worthwhileness. Our Heavenly Father did not place us here one earth to fail, but to succeed. You and I possess enough of His character qualities and enough intelligence to overcome and conquer all of the problems, doubts, fears, sins, and discouragements of life. Every success has a cause, and that cause is a disciplined, positive mind wherein faith is in full bloom. The apostle Paul said:<br><br><i>Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report; if there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think on these things.</i>[Philippians 4:8]<br><br>When we do these things mentioned by Paul, there is peace and serenity in our minds; our faith grows; and we begin to develop those godlike qualities of honor, integrity, love, patience, understanding, fairness, and truthfulness to their utmost. We begin to "walk in beauty" with an inner glow of peace and happiness, having rid our minds of hate, envy, jealousy, prejudice, doubts, fears, inferiority complexes, and negative attitudes.<br><br>We should furnish our minds with ideas of faith, positive thinking, industry, courage, and righteousness. With these helpful, stimulating, and motivating ideas, our faith and strength are greatly increased, we begin to hunger and thirst for righteousness, we develop a high self-esteem, and we increase our love for God and for our fellowmen. Our minds become more receptive to spiritual things and to the promptings of the Holy Ghost. We form a philosophy of life and a depth of character that can guarantee almost any success by keeping us on the straight and narrow path toward the celestial kingdom.<br><br>One of the biggest problems, my brothers and sisters, that can come into our life is to develop a low self-esteem, or a low opinion of ourselves. We fall into this predicament when we either allow our minds to go undisciplined or develop negative, rebellious minds. Unless our minds are well managed, they will run wild like morning-glory vines. King Solomon once said, "For as [a man] thinketh in his heart, so is he" (Proverbs 23:7). He could very well have said, "As a man thinketh in his<i>mind</i>, so is he." If our minds are not properly trained or are filled with critical, rebellious, unclean, or other negative thoughts, then we build up our hate and our sins, nurture our discouragements, and enlarge our self-doubts. An undisciplined, negative mind will become mixed up and confused. It will begin to fight against others and against the Church, tear down the government, and rebel against God.<br><br>It is when we are in this state of mind that we are usually the hardest on ourselves. We know more about our faults and weaknesses than anyone else; and when we are in this condition we are not strong enough to handle properly our doubts, our fears, our sins and bad habits. We will then begin to develop inferiority complexes and destructive feelings of guilt. Damaging self-criticism and self-condemnation are born in this kind of environment. Sometimes we limit ourselves by comparing ourselves to others and therefore never trying because we feel inferior to others.<br><br>A ragged, ten-year-old Navajo boy--fresh off the reservation, unexposed to the world, living in a Mormon foster home in the Church's Indian Placement Program--would never have succeeded had he compared himself to his Anglo friends, who were far more educated, advanced, and prepared than he was. He did not start school until he was eight years of age, and then was quickly advanced three or four grades because he was behind in his grade and was over age. He had a poor command of the English language. His parents were illiterate. He was from a large family. He was raised on desert animals and mutton stew. He seldom had a decent bath for lack of water. He was raised on a dirt floor in a small one-room Hogan without modern conveniences and luxuries. He succeeded educationally, socially, and spiritually because he was his own competitor and because he set out to develop a high opinion of himself and to develop a more positive mind.<br><br>Unrighteous self-criticism and criticism of others are born in the mind, and they can be very destructive. Unjust self-criticism and fault-finding with others are just two of the things that are perpetuated by Satan. Self-appraisal, when handled properly and in the right spirit, can be helpful.<br><br>A person with a low self-esteem will usually blame others for all his troubles and problems and failures. He will begin to say that "they" are to blame. He will gradually lose self-confidence and initiative. He usually does not think well of himself and reacts negatively toward others. Generally, he is mad at the world, the schools, the government, the Church, his teachers, and his priesthood leaders. His rebellious mind will lead to rebellious actions.<br><br>If we should ever find ourselves in such circumstances, the cure is not to remodel or change the world but to change our self-world first. It is futile and useless to curse and blame the establishment, the schools, the governments, the Church, or the administration. The cure is to look at ourselves and to change our attitudes and rebellious minds. The change has to come from within first; and then, as we change inside, the world and people will begin to be a little more beautiful. This is especially true for minority groups when they are exposed to the majority, and sometimes for members of the majority when they are in the minority.<br><br>It is impossible for you and me to "walk in beauty" while our minds are filled with old grudges and bitterness that are pouring poison into our systems. A little hate, a touch of prejudice, a touch of jealousy lodged in our minds can be compared to cancer. They can spread rapidly and run wild, seriously injuring our self-confidence and critically damaging the self-esteem of others.<br><br>While it is important to put the right kinds of thoughts into our minds, it is equally important to know how to get negative thoughts out of our minds. Positive, virtuous thoughts should be put into the minds while impure thoughts are gradually eliminated.<br><br>Doubts and fears thrive and mushroom from a seed of negative and impure thoughts. Faith is retarded in an atmosphere of weak and evil thoughts. When our minds are full of bitterness, we live in a world of sin. When our minds are full of evil, we live in a world of hate. When our minds are full of doubt, we live in a world of fears. Sin is born in the mind. Immorality is born in the mind. Crime is nurtured in the mind. Cheating and dishonesty are cultivated and developed in the mind. Fault-finding is born and nurtured in the mind. Hate and prejudice are born in the mind.<br><br>Some of us sometimes carry a burden of accumulated guilt or sin, causing us to feel unworthy and to withdraw from families, friends, and Church activity. Evil and weak thoughts that have not banished from our minds can cause us to give up on ourselves, and we gradually lose our self-respect and self-confidence.<br><br>One of the main purposes of the mission of the Lord Jesus Christ was to help you and me establish a more successful, positive, and happy way of life with a well-trained mind and a disciplined character so that we will succeed in reaching the celestial kingdom. He said at one time,<br><br><i>Come unto me, all ye that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.</i><br><br><i>Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls.</i><br><br><i>For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light</i>. [Matthew 11:28–30]<br><br>What the Lord meant was, "adopt my way of life--live, think, and act as I do." He invited us to think as He did and to live as He did. He wants us to manage our minds properly and train and discipline our character properly--in other words, to empty our mind of all bitter thoughts, jealous thoughts, evil thoughts, and other negative and weak thoughts. Jesus Christ never entertained any doubts, fears, hate, evil, or other negative thoughts in His mind. He invites you and me to do the same thing.<br><br>Only when we get the weak and evil thoughts out of our minds can we begin to "walk in beauty" and achieve our goal of eternal life with our Heavenly Father. We need to empty the impure thoughts out of our minds, and to get down on our knees and repent of them if we need to do so. Scriptures make it very clear that no unclean thing can enter God's presence. The celestial kingdom could not be the celestial kingdom it were filled with hate, doubt, fears, negative thinking, immorality, and selfishness.<br><br>To develop a well-trained mind full of positive, virtuous thoughts is light. The scriptures say, "that which is of God is light; and he that receiveth light, and continueth in God, receiveth more light; and that light groweth brighter and brighter until the perfect day" (D&amp;amp;C 50:24). The more you entertain good, righteous thoughts, the more light you receive. The more light you receive, the closer you get to perfection; and the closer you get to perfection, the closer you are to becoming a possessor of all things that the Lord has. He said, "Wherefore, he is possessor of all things; for all things are subject unto him, both in heaven and on the earth, the life and the light, the Spirit and the power, sent forth by the will of the Father through Jesus Christ, his Son" (D&amp;amp;C 50:27).<br><br>But the Lord also said that "no man is possessor of all things except he be purified and cleansed from all sin" (D&amp;amp;C 50:28). "Cleansed from all sin" included emptying our minds of all weak, negative, and evil thoughts. These impure thoughts represent darkness, and the Lord told us to "chase darkness from among you" (D&amp;amp;C 50:25). Selfish and evil thoughts debase the soul. Jesus Christ condemned the fostering of such thoughts, motives, and feelings.<br><br>We can control our future by being able to control what we put into our minds. William James, a famous author and psychologist, had this quote to offer:<br><br><i>Sow a thought, and you reap an act;</i><br><i>Sow an act, and you reap a habit;</i><br><i>Sow a habit, and you reap a character;</i><br><i>Sow a character, and you reap a destiny.</i><br>[John Bartlett,<i>Familiar Quotations,</i>14th ed. (Boston: Little, Brown and Co., 1968), p. 1100.]<br><br>Important it is, my brothers and sisters, that we think wholesome, kindly thoughts. Thoughts are the seeds of acts. Righteous thoughts, if consistently kept in the forefront of the mind, will inevitably lead to righteous acts. Even the thoughts in our minds at this very moment are contributing significantly in shaping our character and soul.<br><br>May I admonish and counsel each of us, my brothers and sisters, to consider seriously Mormon's last affectionate wish for his son Moroni: "My son, be faithful in Christ; . . . and may his sufferings and death, and the showing his body unto our fathers, and his mercy and long-suffering, and the hope of his glory and of eternal life, rest in your mind forever" (Moroni 9:25).<br><br>My brothers and sisters, may our Heavenly Father's divine care and inspiration always attend you. May you think in beauty, may you talk in beauty, may you live in beauty--beauty before you, beauty behind you, beauty above and beneath you, beauty all around you in all of your days here on earth and into the eternities--I humbly pray in the name of our Lord and Savior, even Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>George P.

<h1> Mirror, on the Wall”: A Look at the “Me Decade” - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Thank you, President Oaks, and all of you. My thanks to Dean Clark for that beautiful prayer; I pray that it will be efficacious in my behalf. According to Brother Robert Webb and a recently published Richter scale of Provo popularity, my talks on this campus rate somewhere just between the Haun's Mill massacre and a terminal case of acne. My goal this morning is to keep trying--keep moving forward, perhaps to take my rightful place with the rich flora and fauna of colorful Ethiopia.<br><br>May I say, at the outset, that much of my message is intended to be seen against the backdrop of President's Day, February's reprieve of the winter doldrums and the annual commemoration of the births of, among others--including my wife--the two greatest presidents this republic has ever known. I am asking this morning that we look at your college decade (the seventies) and mine (the sixties) in the reflected light of a Washington and a Lincoln. As I speak, consider, if you will, their times and their trials and their gifts to us, and it will put your own world into clearer perspective.<br><br>Everyone I know is mad at the 1970s. One commentator recently said if he had the chance he would promptly bid goodbye to the seventies--"a year too early," he thought, "but not a moment too soon." I presume that, with one year remaining in this decade's contract, 1979 would be traded to the 1980s for a fixed sum plus six months of another year to be named in a later round of the draft.<br><br>Of course, culture and history do not actually happen in decades; but we find it convenient to talk about them that way. Your parents like to speak of the twenties--you know, the Charleston--and some of you like to talk of the fifties--you know, the Fonz. And thus the seventies; full, some say, of forgettable faces, books no one could read, movies no one wanted to sit through. It has been suggested that the nicest thing which might be said of these last ten years is that they were sort of "factory seconds--the temporal equivalent of the Edsel." A country that once thought it could rule the world now despairs of governing New York City.<br><br>Has there indeed been some "souring of the national soul"? Professor Kenneth Kolson laments--and I quote--<br><br><i>In this decade an epidemic of cynicism [has] spread through the country, ... contaminating [our national institutions] and the reservoir of good will ... built up among Americans over the centuries; [now] Main Street [U.S.A. has been rendered] the moral equivalent of Pompeii.</i><br><br><i>Americans no longer revere the presidency; they believe that every interest is represented in Congress but the public interest; they even have little faith in the Justices of the Supreme Court. In 1964, 78% of a national sample ... said that the government in Washington can be trusted to do what is right 'always' or 'most of the time.' By 1974 [the year of Watergate] this figure had shriveled to 36% ... Similarly, the percentage of those answering that the government 'is run for the benefit of all the people' (as opposed to being controlled by a few big selfish interests) declined from 64% to 25% in the same ten-year period. ...furthermore the erosion of public trust and confidence is not confined to the realm of government. The family, schools, business, the professions ... all seem to be experiencing serious credibility crises</i>. [<i>Tom Sawyer has grown up and there in the mirror stands Charles Manson</i>.] [Kenneth Kolson, "The Great Sobriety: An Epitaph for the'70s" The Rockford Papers, vol. 3, no. 5 (1978), pp. 1–10.]<br><br>Well, come now--tell me what can be wrong with a decade that has brought you<i>Jaws</i>,<i>Roots</i>, clones, Shake'n Bake, "Mork'n Mindy," King Kong (you remember him? The big fella with the raccoon coat?), swine flu, R2D2, and frozen yogurt. That kind of decade can't be<i>all</i>bad! (See<i>New West</i>, Jan. 1979.)<br><br>Part of the dilemma over the seventies stems from the sixties (my college decade), as every dilemma in life always stems from some other. It was reported recently that a group of governmental advisers meeting in the White House to discuss inflation, Iran, Taiwan, the Middle East, public transportation, and national health--in that order--expressed some longing for "the benign 1960s."<i>Benign 1960s</i>! I was there, folks, and it was not benign. If the 1970s fear "a souring of the national soul," the 1960s saw a brutal ransacking of it, in which presidents were assassinated, cities were gutted by flame, college campuses became battlegrounds, and American boys fought in a war more confusing than any since father faced son across the Mason-Dixon line. Protestations of love and freedom by the flower children of my college generation relapsed all too quickly into bloody rage and the enslavement of drugs and degeneracy.<br><br>As Professor Kolson has noted, the sixties asserted that every child is entitled to a free hot lunch; the seventies concede the worthiness of the goal but rediscover that there is no such thing as a free lunch, hot or cold. The sixties urged women to put down their brooms and take up their banners; the seventies are once again asking if before counting the profit we have counted the cost. The sixties adjusted educational standards to ensure that no student would ever fail to meet them; the seventies stand stunned at the spectacle of high school graduates who cannot read with any facility nor write a coherent sentence.<br><br>The sixties saw California legislators award a ten-thousand-dollar grant for a choral group to serenade whales, and it funded community college courses in voodoo; the seventies saw California pass Proposition 13. The sixties nourished the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, those warm friends of BYU with the kamikaze instinct who want to fly down the tube of the Y smokestack in what one writer called "the Swedenization of America"; the seventies, pondering the condition of HEW in this year of its silver jubilee, wonder how it has come to pass that this department, which employed 35,000 people in 1954, now pays the salaries of 1,444,000 people and spends 500 million dollars every 24 hours. As Everett Dirksen used to say: "A billion here, a billion there--before you know it, it adds up to real money." We do have some challenges in the seventies.<br><br>But for all of this, I do not think that we are seeing "a moral Pompeii" or even a Sahara of the spirit in our day. Public opinion surveys seem to show consistently that Americans, rather than being alienated from their national institutions, are simply disgusted with their standards of performance and are going to demand more of them. I think the national soul has not soured, but that people are generally unwilling to buy any more lemons. The ultimate result should be an improvement in public trust and confidence, not an erosion of it.<br><br>I wish to make a distinction here between cynicism and concern. I have concerns about our day--a major one of which I wish to discuss with you in some detail. But I am not cynical and I ask you not to be. I do not believe that all human conduct is self-serving or that all noble-sounding explanations are contrived and only mask the depravity of human motives. Cynicism is an intellectual cop-out, a crutch for a withered soul, a thin excuse for inaction and retreating commitment. Do not become cynical about government or education or civic affairs or religion or the human race or the time in which you live. Do on the other hand, be appropriately concerned and actively involved. We will always need responsible, reputable, reasonable social critics who will help in mapping the terrain and marking the pitfalls. But we do not need what Elder Gordon B. Hinckley once described on this campus as "pickle suckers," those studied in the "sour vinegar of invective and anger." May I quote from Elder Hinckley's remarks at a BYU devotional.<br><br><i>The tragedy</i>[of the pickle sucker]<i>is that this spirit is epidemic. ... To hear tell these days, there is nowhere a man of integrity among those holding public office. In many instances this spirit has become the very atmosphere of university campuses. The snide remark, the sarcastic gibe, the cutting down of associates--these, too often, are of the essence of our conversation. In our homes wives weep and children finally give up under the barrage of criticism leveled by husbands and fathers. Criticism is the forerunner of divorce, the cultivator of rebellion, sometimes a catalyst that leads to failure. Even in the Church it sows the seeds of inactivity and finally apostasy.</i><br><br><i>I come ... with a plea that we stop seeking out the storms and enjoy more fully the sunlight. I am suggesting that we "accentuate the positive." I am asking that we look a little deeper for the good, that we still our voices of insult and sarcasm, that we more generously compliment virtue and effort. I am not asking that all criticism be silenced . ... I am not suggesting that our conversation be all honey and blossoms....</i><br><br><i>What I am ... asking is that we turn from the negativism that so permeates our society and look for the remarkable good in the land and times in which we live, that we speak of one another's virtues more than we speak of one another's faults, that optimism replace pessimism, that our faith exceed our fears</i>. [Gordon B. Hinckley, "Let Not Your Heart Be Troubled,"<i>Speeches of the Year, 1974</i>(Provo: Brigham Young University Press, 1975), p. 266]<br><br>I offer that again this morning as good counsel in a month when we honor the memory of a George Washington or an Abraham Lincoln.<br><br>As Elder Hinckley suggests, we must have our concerns. Life demands something more than a ubiquitous smile button saying, "Have a nice day." If we need a button at all I suppose it should say something more like "Make it a nice day." Part of my message this morning is that as we exert virtuous effort in this world we can rejoice in many good things that are central to our faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, our family and friends and neighbors, our Church activity, and our life together in a choice land and in an age unequaled in the history of this world in its privileges and possibilities. We are not without our solutions. Especially is it true that a faithful Latter-day Saint is not without his or her solutions.<br><br>I believe that for the most part our Founding Fathers (whose monumental revolution we again commemorated in the seventies, by the way) were endowed with such faith. Surely they had problems. Taxation<i>with</i>representation was not a heck of a lot more fun than taxation<i>without</i>it. They had great concerns, but avoided cynicism and rolled up their sleeves. Surely the presidential greatness of Washington and Lincoln must have been in no small measure due to the fact that they were good, thoughtful, dignified, responsible, spiritually sensitive men<i>before</i>they were presidents. For all their courage and commitment, neither could be called a lunatic or a zealot; and for all their burdens, they could not be called "pickle suckers" either.<br><br>Perhaps we could do not better in this month when we honor their birth than to use their example, as we examine the challenge of the 1970s or the eighties or the nineties, and to remember something of their service and their sacrifice. As I look at your decade--and at those that lie ahead--I am very hopeful and very encouraged because of what I believe. I believe in help from both sides of the veil and in the worth and the possibility of a human soul. I take great strength from that oft-repeated reminder in the Doctrine and Covenants:<br><br><i>Fear not, little flock....</i><br><br><i>... Ye are little children, and ye have not as yet understood [what] great blessings the Father hath in his own hands and prepared for you;</i><br><br><i>... Be of good cheer, for I will lead you along.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 6:34, 78:17–18]<br><br>With that much introduction and assurance, I do wish to share one concern I have. It is not restricted to--or unique in--the 1970s. Indeed, it is quite literally as old as Cain and Abel, having something to do with why we came to this planet from an earlier, heavenly existence. It is not really a challenge for governments or schools or cities or businesses--at least not initially. It is, rather, a challenge for individual people--even people right here at BYU, or any other place we might find ourselves. Some problems seem far away and beyond our reach--problems in places like Washington or Teheran or Peking. But this is, if you will, a Provo problem and you can do something about it--in your apartments and wards and classes, at work or in your leisure. If you do not, then it certainly becomes a problem for governments and schools and businesses and families. But the real solution is in the privacy of the human soul--yours and mine.<br><br>This concern I have is dramatized by a new magazine that appeared on newsstands for the first time last month. It is called<i>Self.</i>I know nothing about the merits or liabilities of this magazine; I am merely intrigued by the title:<i>Self</i>. After<i>Life</i>and<i>Look,</i>to<i>People</i>and<i>Us</i>, we have now come to<i>Self</i>. My concern about the seventies, and indeed about every decade ahead of you, is somehow suggested by that title--by the threat of moral vision which seems to steadily decrease until it may finally come down to "self" only--one life wide, one life deep, and the devil take the hindmost. The threat I fear, in a month when we remember two who did not suffer from it, is the threat of self-centeredness gone amuck, or psychic insistence upon everyone doing his own thing, of everyone getting in touch with himself at the expense of getting in touch with anyone else. It is the threat of a culture which has in some ways carried accentuated individualism to the extreme and now has the pursuit of happiness standing<i>paralyzed</i>in front of a mirror, pleading, "Mirror, mirror on the wall, who's the fairest of them all?" We live in a time in which there has been almost transcendent self-attention, in which the conquest of nature and search for new frontiers, social and otherwise, has given way to neonarcissism. The greatest of all tasks in the 1970s appears to be "self-realization."<br><br>In a world where it is all hanging out, where we have immersed ourselves in ourselves, where intimacy has gone public and four-letter words batter our ears, we run the risk, in our quest for instant gratification and purely personal views of our world, of profoundly violating the two great commandments on which all others depend. We may come to find neither love of God nor love of neighbor but only love of ourselves. Should that ever be so, then, as Pogo Possum would say: "We have met the enemy and he is us."<br><br>I say "we": that is an editorial "we." I am not speaking of you and me personally so much as I am speaking of our times, our climate, our current condition. Unfortunately, such preoccupation with self does face us in many locations on this globe.<br><br>You will know from the<i>Daily Universe</i>and a poster or two around campus and President Oak's introductory remarks that I have titled this forum address " 'Mirror, Mirror on the Wall': A Look at the 'Me Decade.'" That phrase "the Me Decade" was coined for the 1970s by Tom Wolfe, whose strongest recommendation is that he holds a PhD in American Studies from Yale. While I do not agree with Wolfe's entire thesis, I would nevertheless like to appropriate his title and much of his stimulating suggestions for our purposes this morning--for LDS purposes if you will--and apply them to our life here at BYU. I repeat that this tendency about which I am concerned is no more linked to the seventies than it was to the thirties or will be to the nineties, though it may be a little more visible at some times than at others. It is first and foremost a matter of spirit and only incidentally a matter of society. The principles involved are as old as the gospel is old, and the future is as bright as every new and everlasting covenant is always bright. Let me briefly suggest how we got where we are, quoting generously from Mr. Wolfe. (See Tom Wolfe, "The Me Decade and the Great Awakening,"<i>Mauve Gloves and Madmen</i>, [New York: 1976], pp. 126–67.)<br><br>It has been in our time, yours and mine--inflation notwithstanding--that we have seen some significant realization of at least four centuries of utopian dreams. In this country and largely in the last quarter of this century--your lifetime--we have realized for many (surely not all) in this country (though not everywhere in this country) the potential dreamed of by those who foresaw the three great necessities of industrialized man: (1) surplus or discretionary income, (2) surplus or discretionary time, and (3) political freedom. From the end of World War II to the 1960s this "common man" had just about arrived. It was obviously time to get on with the business of "realizing his potential."<br><br>Observing, studying, doting on, remaking, remodeling, elevating, and polishing oneself had always been, heretofore, an aristocratic luxury, confined throughout most of history to royalty since they had the time and the money and usually the vanity to do it. By the mid-1960s, however, this luxury had become available to literally millions. The equivalent of Louis XIV's finishing school at Versailles was now the Esalen Institute, perched on a cliff overlooking the Pacific in Big Sur, California. Esalen's specialty, as one participant put it, was "an oil change and a lube job for your personality." Businessmen, housewives, students, drifters--anyone who could afford it, and by now many could--paid $220 a week to come to Esalen to learn about themselves, loosen up a little, and maybe wear a jumpsuit. The primal screams of hysterical encounter sessions roared through the pines, startling enough to stunt a sequoia.<br><br>What on earth was the appeal? The appeal, on earth, was simple enough. It was, as Mr. Wolfe suggests, the chance for each to say, "Now let's talk about<i>me.</i>" Whether or not your personality was renovated was beside the point; you had finally focused your entire energy and attention (and with any luck everybody's else's) on the most fascinating subject on the earth: ME--and with a live audience. Just imagine "my life" becoming a real drama with universal significance, analyzed just like King Lear's or Rasputin's.<br><br>By this time the much-publicized hippie communes of the 1960s, no longer big items in the press, were becoming more and more slanted toward pop theology, and many of the Me movements swung in behind them. Their neo-Gnostic religious style saw its ultimate and most tragic expression just weeks ago in Jonestown. Synanon, Arica, EST, scientology had now all become religions, or so they said.<br><br>In almost any city now a strange menagerie (as George Steiner calls them) can be seen tangoing along some sidewalk, offering "dime-store mantras and fairground meditation" leading to instant Nirvana, or for the recalcitrant perhaps a rattlesnake in the mailbox. Such groups as the Hare Krishna, the Sufi, and the Mahraji Ji communes--not to mention the Unification Church of Sun Myung Moon--soon discovered that they could enroll thousands of new members and still make a small fortune in real estate.<br><br>In the meantime traditional Christian churches often strained to keep up with the action. Modernization for them (you know--"let's look at ourselves") meant a new liturgy or new apparel or perhaps a new coffeehouse where one might--as ever--"get in touch with himself." This was obviously not a time to worry about getting in touch with God. Some even thought it might help if the preacher put on a turtleneck sweater and sang "Michael Row the Boat Ashore" at Sunday evening vespers. In that transition from the sixties to the seventies one church saw its magnificent cathedral of St. John the Divine in New York City become the scene of a pot-smoking, anti-war ceremony in which Norman Mailer's dirty words were read before the High Altar. At nearly the same time its Grace Cathedral in San Francisco saw Allen Ginsberg, wearing animal robes and a deer's head, cast images of buffalo herds and other endangered species on the walls and ceiling of the building--accompanied, of course, by rock music. But as one contemporary Christian said, indicating so much that offended him, "There are no heresies in a dead religion." (Paul Seabury, "Trendier Than Thou,"<i>Harper's</i>, October 1978, pp.39–52).<br><br>So cathedrals and churches were active again, but in a new way: do-it-yourself religion had taken over, religion in which a whale or porpoise or snail darter or lousewort, along with any bird or blade of grass in a national park, was entitled to greater legal protection than a five-month-old fetus. After all--"mirror, mirror on the wall"--it is my body, is it not? In the 1970s some of the actors on our worldwide stage had come to that prayer offered thirty years ago in one of W. H. Auden's plays:<br><br><i>O God, put away justice and truth for we cannot understand them and do not want them. ... Leave Thy heavens and come down to our earth. Become our uncle. Look after Baby, amuse Grandfather, escort Madam to the Opera, help Willy with his homework, introduce Muriel to a handsome naval officer. Be interesting and weak like us, and [then] we will love you as we love ourselves</i>. [W. H. Auden,<i>For the Time Being</i>, 1944]<br><br>Of course, what so affects the self inevitably affects society. As a result we have also had great political and social challenges. A recent column in the<i>New York Times</i>lamented these narrow commercial and social concerns that are dividing people and diverting them from the larger question of our common good. Such conflict between general and personal interests has always been at the roof of political action; but it seems more of a threat now, in a free world when the need for cooperation in complex societies is greater than ever before. Some examples:<br><br>In his New Year's message to the Canadian people, Prime Minister Trudeau was almost pleading with his fellow countrymen to disarm their violent tempers and to think and act, not as French Canadians or as English Canadians, but just as Canadians. Scarcely days later Rene Levesque was in Washington proclaiming the virtues of violent separation and getting a good hand from the National Press Club.<br><br>At the same time President Carter, concluding that inflation was the main threat to the commonwealth, brought in what he called a "lean and austere" budget (of more than half a trillion dollars!) and ever since has been under attack from minorities and labor for abandoning the poor and from big business and special interests for paying too much attention to the poor. The success of purely voluntary wage and price controls surely remains to be seen.<br><br>The mayor of New York City, in his state of the city message, asked for an end to factionalism and the harmful rhetoric of confrontation. The response was a recall petition to throw him out of office.<br><br>Even in Britain--the land of my mission, the scene of my spiritual birth, the home of team play and democratic responsibility--there is such a maze of strikes and disputes now on that no computer can, as the British would say, keep "a proper tally." That only reflects the terror and chaos of other locations, particularly Italy, the Middle East, and now especially Iran.<br><br>May I quote from the<i>Times</i>article?<br><br><i>What is it that has brought on this</i>[self-centered]<i>contempt for authority? It is partly the misuse of authority in the past--imperial presidencies leading to imperial congresses and parliaments, greatly influenced by powerful business, labor, and racial factions.</i><br><br><i>Beyond this, however, it is also a general feeling among the general public of being overwhelmed by the complexity of modern problems.</i><br><br><i>In short, [there is now] a tendency to work within factions for limited and often selfish ends. One hears the same refrain over the wide range of free countries--that everybody is out for himself, so why not do the same</i>? [James Reston]<br><br>Part of this chaos is due to what our colleague Bruce Hafen calls "the almost endless talk about personal liberty and self-fulfillment; it is in the air. There are right movements [everywhere]." (Bruce C. Hafen, "Individual Liberty, Commitment, and Marriage,"<i>Ensign</i>, December 1978, p. 14.)<br><br>It is hard, in the apple-pie tradition, to be against rights; but consider this comment from Alexander Solzhenitsyn:<br><br><i>Destructive and irresponsible freedom has been granted boundless space [in the free world]. [Remember--this is from one who knows a great deal about loss and lack of freedom.] [Western] society appears to have little defense against ... human decadence, such as ... the misuse of liberty for moral violence against young people [where] motion pictures [and television and magazines are] full of pornography, crime, and horror. This is considered to be part of freedom, and theoretically counterbalanced by the young people's right not to look or accept. [But they do look and are accepting, and] life organized [so] legalistically has thus shown its inability to defend itself against the corrosion of evil ... It is time, in the West, to defend not so much human rights as human obligations....</i><br><br><i>In early democracies, as in American democracy at the time of its birth, [those] human rights were granted because man [was] God's creature. That is, freedom was given to the individual conditionally, on the assumption of his constant religious responsibility. Such was the heritage of the preceding</i>[two]<i>thousand years. Two hundred years ago--even fifty years ago--it would have seemed quite impossible, in America, that an individual could be granted boundless freedom simply for the satisfaction of his [basest] instincts or whims. Subsequently, however, all such limitations were discarded ...; a total liberation occurred from the moral heritage of Christian centuries, with their great reserves of mercy and sacrifice. Meanwhile, state systems were becoming increasingly materialistic. The West ended up by ... enforcing human rights, sometimes even excessively, [while] man's sense of responsibility to God and society grew dimmer and dimmer. In the past few decades, the legalistic, selfish aspect of Western thinking has reached its apogee, and the world is now in a harsh spiritual crisis and a political impasse. All the glorified technological achievements of Progress, include the conquest of outer space, do not redeem the twentieth century's moral poverty, which no one could imagine even as late as in the nineteenth century.</i><br><br><i>[Man's task now is of] a spiritual nature . ... No one on earth has any way left but--upward.</i>[Alexander Solzhenitsyn, "A World Split Apart,"<i>National Review,</i>7 July 1978, pp. 836–55]<br><br>One of the first gifts we receive in this world to help us "upward" is a family. It is obvious that marriage and family are designed to be two of the most basic opportunities in this world where these barriers of selfishness and self-centeredness and moral poverty may be overcome. In that discussion about "rights" to which I referred, President Hafen wrote:<br><br><i>Not understanding the depth of the commitment made [in a] marriage and perhaps influenced by a seductive talk about the 'rights to self-fulfillment,' many in today's world who experience marital differences [simply] leave the scene of the conflict by either literally or figuratively divorcing themselves from the persons they view as the source of their frustrations.</i><br><br><i>Many of these in time will marry another person, only to find another set of conflicts and frustrations. Once again, they may leave the scene of conflict, somehow believing that they are entitled to live without the inconvenience of dealing with points of view different from their own. ... Thus, they may never experience what it is to understand a situation from the perspective of another person or to subordinate their own needs to those of others. As a result, they deprive themselves of the experiences necessary to permit the discovery of the meaning of love</i>. [Hafen, "Individual Liberty," pp. 16, 17]<br><br>In the same vein, Lois and Paul Glasser--after reciting a litany of statistics on divorce, one-parent families, illegitimacy, adultery, and parental violence--say wistfully:<br><br><i>Is it possible that more and more young people, and some older ones also, enter a new marital relationship expecting instant gratification ... for which no effort on their part is required? Can we hypothesize that society's emphasis on individualism is so great that marriage is not seen as a partnership but another place to compete for gratification of personal needs? Can it be suggested that family life is no longer seen as a cooperative venture among parents and children who have social responsibilities toward the group as a whole, but as a place where each grabs what he or she can get now without endangering future rewards?</i>[Lois and Paul Glasser, "Hedonism and the Family,"<i>Journal of Marriage and Family Counseling,</i>October 1977, pp. 13–14]<br><br>I think that what is destroying the family, where it is being destroyed, is what destroys any society: it is "mirror, mirror on the wall." We wish to follow our own star and not be hampered by the glare of any other. Move the old folks to Florida and put the kids in a day-care center. That works, says Dr. Urie Bronfenbrenner, if you're young and rich. But if you happen to be a child, or sick, or lonely, or old--and all of us are at some time--then you need someone else. In fact, you will find that you need someone else even if you are young and rich. If that someone is off doing his own thing, then you are probably in trouble.<br><br>In my decade of the sixties a vast best seller was Harris's book,<i>I'm OK, You're Ok</i>. (You know--"mirror, mirror on the wall.") But in yours--the seventies--Ringer has done him one better--in fact done him two better--by publishing<i>Looking Out for #1</i>and<i>Winning through Intimidation</i>. Against such outrageous monuments to self-interest may I set one transcendent figure with its penetrating lesson for all mankind: He who, in Isaiah's language (listen carefully), "hath borne<i>our</i>griefs, and carried<i>our</i>sorrows, ... was wounded for<i>our</i>transgressions [and] bruised for<i>our</i>iniquities" (Isaiah 53:24–25). Of the innumerable accounts from his own life and teachings--and let your mind consider how often Christ taught the love of God and neighbor, those elements on which all the law and the prophets, and indeed the gospel of Jesus Christ, hang--let me recount in many of His own words what one writer has called the "Doctrine of the Cross" (see A. B. Bruce,<i>The Training of the Twelve</i>, [1894; reprint ed., Grand Rapids, Mich.: Kregel Publications, 1974], pp. 281–91). It is the scriptural answer to "looking out for number one."<br><br>Jesus had for the third time explicitly announced his approaching crucifixion, indicating that his death would take place in connection with the very visit to Jerusalem which he and his disciples were now making. Luke notes, however, that the disciples<br><br>"understood none of these things: and this saying was hid from them, neither knew they the things which were spoken" (Luke 18:34). They were obviously thinking of other matters. Their minds were possessed by some dreams and expectations of that time when "the kingdom of God should immediately appear" (Luke 19:11).<br><br>In the light of Jesus' discourses on the coming of the Son of Man, undoubtedly all the disciples were looking forward to their thrones, but James and John were for a moment seeking the most distinguished ones. Their mother, kneeling before the Savior, said urgently, "Grant that these my two sons may sit, the one on thy right hand, and the other on the left, in thy kingdom." We cannot fault this mother in wishing such a noble station for her sons, except that she is asking the Lord himself to aid in matters of ambition and vanity, however worthy. What was asked could not be granted without Jesus being untrue to his own character and his habitual teachings on selfishness and humility.<br><br>Furthermore, hers seems to be a narrow view of the kingdom of God. It is a particularly unwholesome court, even in a secular world, where places of highest distinction can be obtained by solicitation and favor--by assertion and Ringer's intimidation, if you will--rather than by invitation and merit.<br><br>This request apparently caused some bitterness, for it is recorded that "when the ten heard it, they were moved with indignation against the two brethren." We are, at first, a bit mystified by this scene. If James and John innocently thought that such a request would cause difficulty, they seem to be less wise than we might have assumed. If, on the other hand, they made the request without caring for the disaffection that might ensue, they would appear to be selfish as well as vain.<br><br>In fact, they were neither. The gentleness of Jesus' reply suggests that these faithful disciples were not calculating or cruel. They were, along with the other ten, simply children in terms of gospel growth and education. Christ uttered not a word of direct rebuke, but dealt with them as a father might deal with a child who had made a request without thinking of the consequences. He implies no malice--only ignorance. "Ye know not," he said to them quietly, "what ye ask. Are ye able to drink of the cup that I [am about to drink] ...?<br><br>There is more than compassion or correction in this question: there is instruction, concerning the true way of progress in the kingdom of God. Jesus taught His disciples that advancement in His kingdom went not by favor or political solicitation, but rather<i>via dolorosa</i>, by the way of the cross. The "palm-bearers in the celestial realms of glory" will be they who have passed through tribulation, and the princes of the kingdom will be those who have drunk most deeply of His cup of service and sacrifice. For those who refused to drink thereof--the selfish, the self-indulgent, the purely ambitious or vain--there will be lesser places in the kingdom, places without honor on His right hand or His left.<br><br>The startling question put to those two apostles by Jesus did not take them by surprise. Promptly and firmly they replied, "We are able."<br><br>His response then: "Ye shall drink indeed of my cup, and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with." (See Matthew 20:20–24.)<br><br>This was a strange favor, it seems to me, for the Lord to grant. He was not mockingly offering them the cup of His suffering rather than a throne in His kingdom, but he was obviously very serious. However perhaps even then James and John knew that the cup and the throne were inextricably linked and could not be given separately.<br><br>The elect of God usually do not look like the prosperous publisher of a magazine called<i>Self</i>or a book titled<i>Winning through Intimidation</i>. More often they will be toilers, pioneers in a sometimes unwelcome world, turning a wilderness of complex problems into a fruitful field with faith. They are the world's salt, its leaven, and its light, but they may get little thanks for that service. This does not, however, really matter to them because it is scripturally certain that those who ask only the favor--the self-fulfillment, if you will--of being companions with Christ in tribulation and service will be rewarded with the highest stations in the eternal kingdom. Perhaps there is no better argument in support of the doctrine of exaltation than W. W. Phelp's line from the hymn you all know: "Sacrifice brings forth the blessings of heaven" (<i>Hymns</i>, no. 147). If crosses would let us alone, I suppose we would let them alone. We usually do not seek out the bitter cup and the bloody baptism, but sometimes they seek us. God does draft men into the warfare of this world; and if any come to genuine faith and conviction as a result of it, as many an impressed soldier has done, it will be a faith and conviction which at least in the first flames of battle, he did not particularly covet.<br><br>The single greatest feature in the lesson which Jesus gave His disciples here is the contrast between His kingdom and the other kingdoms of this earth. Both the way of acquiring position and the means of exerting authority were dramatically different. His message to them was that earthly kingdoms were then being ruled by a class of people who possessed hereditary rank, or by those who sought favors from them. The governing class were those whose birthright was to rule, and whose boast it was never to have been in a servile position. In His kingdom, on the other hand, a man could only become great--a ruler, if you will--by first being the servant to those over whom he is to bear rule. In the divine commonwealth, only they rule who account it a privilege to serve.<br><br>Having explained by contrast the great principles of the spiritual kingdom over those of mortal men, Jesus next enforced the doctrine by a reference to His one example. "Whosoever will be chief among you," He said to the Twelve, "let him be your servant:" and then He added: "Even as the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many." (Matthew 20:27–28.)<br><br>These words were spoken by Jesus as one who claimed to be a king, and who was indeed ordained in the very councils of heaven to be the first in a great and mighty kingdom. So the Lord is setting himself forth here not merely as an example of humility, but as one who must illustrate for us all that the way to power in the spiritual world is through service, not intimidation; it is loss of self, not obsession with self, that brings those otherwise mystical icons--meaning and fulfillment and happiness. The truth of the matter is that He would one day be ministered to by legions--yes, worlds--of willing, devoted people, acknowledging Him as their Lord and King. Every knee would someday bow and every tongue confess. The point on which He wishes to fix the attention of his disciples here, however, is the peculiar way in which He must work to obtain that crown. In effect he says:<br><br>"I am a King, and I expect one day to claim my kingdom; James and John are not mistaken in that respect. But I will obtain my kingdom differently from the way secular princes get theirs. They get their thrones by succession or intimidation or selfishness; I will get mine by personal merit alone. They secure their kingdom by right of birth or bombast; I hope to secure mine by the right of service. They inherit their subjects, but I will need to buy mine, with the payment of my body and my blood."<br><br><i>... Whosoever will be chief among you, let him be your servant:</i><br><br><i>Even as the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.</i><br><br>With that one thought I close. Please,<i>please</i>, do not misunderstand my message this morning. Surely you know that I am not speaking against self-improvement. I am certainly not speaking against self-worth. Those are precisely the things of which I am speaking. I simply believe that real improvement and worth and fulfillment are demonstrated to us in the life of the Master and not at the Esalen Institute.<br><br>Above all, I have not wanted to sound like a pickle-sucker. It was H. L. Mencken who defined a Puritan as one who had the uneasy, insatiable, gnawing fear that someone somewhere was having a good time. I hope you know me better than that. I love you very much and I wish for you the profoundest kind of joy and fulfillment in this world.<br><br>It is just that I believe the source--the source--of meaning and fulfillment and joy in our lives is not egocentric--it does not originate in us, but lies elsewhere. We then tap that source and cause it to flow to us when we reach out and reach up. To quote President Kimball and to conclude:<br><br><i>I have learned that ... when we are engaged in the service of our fellowmen, not only do our deeds assist them, but we put our own problems in a fresher perspective . ... In the midst of the miracle of serving, there is the promise of Jesus, that by losing ourselves we find ourselves.</i><br><br><i>Not only do we "find" ourselves in terms of acknowledging guidance in our lives, but the more we serve our fellowmen in appropriate ways, the more substance there is to our souls . ... Indeed, it is easier to "find" ourselves because there is so much more of us to find</i>. [Spencer W. Kimball,<i>Ensign,</i>December 1974, p. 2]<br><br>George Washington and Abraham Lincoln and Pat and Jeff Holland--and all the prophets of God--ask for you a rich life, sacred liberty, and the successful pursuit of happiness--this year, this decade, and all your life. And as you seek those inalienable rights, may we ask you also to pay heed to your enduring sense of obligation. In the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Jeffrey R.

<h1> Never Faileth” - Vaughn J. Featherstone - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I approach this assignment with great excitement. I love BYU, the Lord's university.<br><br>Columnist George Will cited these as the three least credible sentences in the English language: first, "Your check is in the mail"; second, "Of course I will respect you as much in the morning"; and third, "I'm from the government; I'm here to help."<br><br>As a nation, we are often like the old fellow who was sleeping on the couch and whose grandson came in, rubbed some Limburger cheese on his moustache, and then left. In a few minutes the old boy awakened with a snort. The living room smelled terrible. He went outside and found that the whole world smelled even worse. We live in that kind of a situation today, when constructive, destructive, and all kinds of criticism reach their highest levels.<br><br>How blessed we are to belong to the Church of Jesus Christ, which has been restored in these last days! Life is so beautiful, fulfilling, and filled with rich pleasures and treasures. This morning I would like to share with you a principle that, if followed in its pure form, will bring us the greatest depth of joy and fulfillment in this life and guide us safely to a state of exaltation with our families in the celestial kingdom. My text is taken from the thirteenth chapter of 1 Corinthians, verses one through eight, where the apostle Paul wrote:<br><br><i>Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not charity, I am become as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal.</i><br><br><i>And though I have the gift of prophecy, and understand all mysteries, and all knowledge; and though I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing.</i><br><br><i>And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and though I give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing.</i><br><br><i>Charity suffereth long, and is kind; charity envieth not; charity vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up,</i><br><br><i>Doth not behave itself unseemly, seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked, thinketh no evil:</i><br><br><i>Rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in the truth;</i><br><br><i>Beareth all things, believeth all thing, hopeth all things, endureth all things.</i><br><br><i>Charity never faileth: but whether there will be prophecies, they shall fall; whether there be tongues, they shall cease, whether there be knowledge, it shall vanish away.</i><br><br><i>For we know in part, and we prophesy in part.</i><br><br>But again let me say, "Charity never faileth."<br><br>Reiterating what Paul said--"Though I speak with the tongue of men and of angels ..." --does this imply that speaking as men and angels is a part of charity? I think it does. If so, that statement and all the other statements in these verses have some interesting implications that should be very significant to all of us. Is it possible to have charity in its full measure and not be a member of Christ's true Church? The answer seems self-evident when we recall that the prophet Nephi said:<br><br><i>Do ye not remember that I said unto you that after ye had received that Holy Ghost ye could speak with the tongue of angels? And now, how could ye speak with the tongue of angels save it were by the Holy Ghost?</i><br><br><i>Angels speak by the power of the Holy Ghost; wherefore, they speak the words of Christ. Wherefore, I said unto you, feast upon the words of Christ</i>;<i>for behold, the words of Christ will tell you all things that ye should do.</i>[2 Nephi 32:2–3]<br><br>Then, a few verses later, Nephi wrote the following:<br><br><i>But I, Nephi, have written what I have written [and as I read this I would like you to consider again the subject of charity], and I esteem it as of great worth, and especially unto my people. For I pray continually for them by day, and mine eyes water my pillow by night, because of them; and I cry unto my God in faith, and I know that he will hear my cry.</i><br><br><i>And I know that the Lord God will consecrate my prayers for the gain of my people. And the words which I have written in weakness will be made strong unto them; for it persuadeth them to do good; it maketh known unto them of their fathers; and it speaketh of Jesus, and persuadeth them to believe in him, and to endure to the end, which is life eternal....</i><br><br><i>And now, my beloved brethren, all those who are of the house of Israel, and all ye ends of the earth, I speak unto you as the voice of one crying from the dust: Farewell until that great day shall come.</i><br><br><i>And you that will not partake of the goodness of God, and respect the words of the Jews, and also my word, and the words which shall proceed forth out of the mouth of the Lamb of God, behold, I bid you an everlasting farewell, for these words shall condemn you at the last day.</i><br><br><i>For what I seal on earth, shall be brought against you at the judgment bar; for thus hath the Lord commanded me, and I must obey.</i>[2 Nephi 33:3–4, 13–15]<br><br>How beautiful are the words of Nephi! Can a man speak as men and angels and not have the Holy Ghost?<br><br>Paul continues: "Though I have the gift of prophecy." To some it is given to prophesy in beautiful words; yet this gift alone does not give one a fullness of charity. There are great deeds done in many small acts of life--obscure deeds performed where none but God can see. Many who speak and prophesy with such great power are found wanting because they do not provide love, service, and tender acts of kindness in their own homes to the members of their families, and to others that they do not know so well. I suppose many have not yet discovered what writer Lloyd Douglas has referred to as the "magnificent obsession."<br><br>"Though I understand all mysteries and have all knowledge...." Many very special priesthood leaders study the scriptures constantly, referencing and cross-referencing and cramming their minds with beautiful truths of the gospel. They can quote scripture, expound doctrine, and clarify the mysteries with great understanding. This is all good; however, the application of these truths is far greater than the knowledge. If we can quote and understand the thirteenth chapter of 1 Corinthians but cannot reach out to the widow in her need and fill her leaky, rusty old bucket, we fail. If we cannot, as Jacob Hamblin states,<br><br><i>dip fingers without revulsion in the Indian sheep-gut stew, if grasshopper meal cannot be accepted as a food offering, if he cannot forget his own bed comforts as he shares the smoky wickiup or hogan, his acts and feelings become an affront to the people with whom he labors, and they view him with suspicion. Too many times, our brethren fill a mission call in the attitude of onerous duty rather than with a sincere and prayerful endeavor to honestly love and understand the dark and unwashed humanity he has pledged himself to serve.</i>[Paul Bailey,<i>Jacob Hamblin: Buckskin Apostle</i>(Los Angeles: Westernlore Press, 1948), p. 248]<br><br>The teacher or leader must not only be first in knowledge, in prophecy, and in understanding the mysteries, but he must also be first in performance. I believe that it is not only an offense to the people but also an offense to God when priesthood leaders, teachers, and members of the Church never really get down and serve the people, do not do their duty, do not magnify their callings, and do not fill their stewardships. We ought to bend our backs in our callings in such a way that our words and teachings are always racing to keep up with our acts. In this way we will never become what the Savior referred to as "whited sepulchers" (see Matthew 23:27).<br><br>"Though I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing." What is the point Paul is trying to make? I believe that he is affirming once again that, in addition to our faith, our works must qualify us. Let me give you a couple of examples relevant here at BYU.<br><br>Spring is coming. How often we see returned missionaries take off their garments and change into shorts to wash and wax their cars. Then they spend the rest of the day going on errands and playing in their shorts, cutoffs, or briefs. This is not charity; it is harmful to the character of the individual, it is detrimental to all who may observe, and it leads to transgression. Please, fellow returned missionaries, do not trample the sacred covenants under the feet of apathy or ignorance.<br><br>We claim to have faith, but it is not charity that leads a young lady to accept a diamond ring from a young man just to add one more to her list of engagements. A girl's announcement that she has been engaged two, three, or four times says nothing complimentary about her. Rather, it infers, I believe, that she is immature; that she does not know how to make a decision; that she did not give sufficient thought, prayer, and fasting to the matter; or simply that she feels it gives her a false feeling of importance. In the sacred marriage covenant, both the man and the woman ought to have made an absolute, unalterable decision to marry; and engagement should wait until they both feel this way. Would you consider that, please? Too many times, once an engagement takes place either the young man takes license or the young woman gives license to do things that have previously been denied or taboo in their courtship. The standard of conduct is always the same in the Church before engagement or after engagement.<br><br>I recently interviewed a young woman who had been totally pure before her engagement, but after the engagement had let herself go and committed fornication with her fiancé. A few months later things did not work out and the engagement was off. Even though a person may have great faith, who could say that their committing such acts represents charity?<br><br>I believe that we have here at BYU one of the great basketball teams in the nation. Things are going to happen; we may well be on the public television. I think it would be an offense to God if this great student body and the people who are the fans of this great basketball team and this institution did not conform to the statement made by Dallin Oaks: "We ought to be the best fans." I am not certain that God would want us on national or worldwide television if the fans did not represent the fine conduct of the players. I do not know how a player must feel who comes to any floor across the nation where--and I have seem this on television--a section of students stands up and all of them start pointing their fingers and shouting, "You, you, you!" when the poor fellow has only fouled and it is not all that serious. I suppose he feels like crawling off the floor, and I suppose that is what the intimidators want him to do. I hope this never happens at BYU.<br><br>I believe that there ought to be no greater fans--no more loyal or positive fans--than here at BYU; but the negative aspects ought not to be part of our conduct. I do not believe that it displays charity. I made a decision many years ago that I would try as desperately as ever I knew how never to do anything that might embarrass the Church. You see, our conduct reflects upon the Church as an institution, not upon us as individuals; no one will pin down, "Who was it?" or "Which group?" but will simply say, "the Church" or "the Mormons."<br><br>"Though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor ...". Apparently, this in and of itself is not charity, although it is a major part. I have known of people who have given great sums of money to charitable organizations to provide for the poor; and yet, as the following verse illustrates, some of these people may miss the mark. As this young boy says:<br><br><i>We have the nicest garbage man;</i><br><i>He empties out our garbage can.</i><br><i>He's just as nice as he can be;</i><br><i>He always comes and talks with me.</i><br><i>My mother doesn't like his smell;</i><br><i>But, then, she doesn't know him well.</i><br><br>I believe that maybe the boy understood a lot more about charity than his mother did; he could have taught her some things.<br><br>In his book<i>Les Miserables</i>, Victor Hugo states, "The door of the physician should never be closed, the door of the priest should always be opened." Robert Ingersoll, the atheist, spoke a portion of truth when he said, "The hands that help are holier than the lips that pray." We should not separate the lips that pray from the hands that help. I think Paul is trying to teach us that those who bestow their goods and give their bodies to be burned should also exercise the other dimensions of charity. Victor Hugo also suggested that "the shepherd should not recoil from the diseased sheep." How often this happens in the Church! Many who give liberally of their means hold tight-fisted their time and their talents.<br><br>"Charity envieth not ...". It has come to our attention that many homosexuals who hide their perversion in public cry out when among their "gay" groups, "God made us this way. We are still children of God. He understands; He knows our hearts. We faithfully hold family home evenings, we pray, we attend Church. Why don't the Brethren understand? Why will they not listen? We were just made different. It is not our fault. God will surely judge us differently from our brethren." And so they envy the "normal" member of the Church who lives an upright and circumspect life, saying, "If only the Brethren understood."<br><br>To condone homosexuality is not an act of charity. Perversion is perversion. All the reasoning of the greatest minds in the world cannot change the seriousness of the transgression. Worlds without end, the homosexual cannot be exalted. That is it--as plainly, simply, and clearly as one can state. It matters not whether it be the adultery, the homosexual, the fornicator, or the felon--no man ever has or ever will, worlds without end, be saved in his sins. There can be no compromise; the truth is absolute. Other churches who have adjusted their standards and compromised their principles can do so because they are not the true church of Jesus Christ. The Savior's standard of morality will everlastingly be the same. It is not charity to give hope where no hope exists. Man cannot be saved in his sins.<br><br>"Charity thinketh no evil ...". Every homosexual who has been affiliated with or knows about the Church knows that what I am saying is true, and yet it is a hard doctrine to accept. When the Savior taught hard doctrine, oftentimes the people abandoned him; on one such occasion, he asked the disciples,<br><br><i>Will ye also go away?</i><br><br><i>Then Simon Peter answered him, Lord, to whom shall we go? Thou hast the words of eternal life.</i><br><br><i>And we believe and are sure that thou art that Christ, the Son of the living God.</i>[John 6:67–69]<br><br>I believe with all of my heart and soul that the Church reaches out to the diseased sheep. We will reach out and do all we can, with our arms extended to the very limit. President J. Reuben Clark said, "I believe when the Lord metes out punishment, he will mete out the least possible punishment that it is possible to mete out and satisfy the demands of justice; and when he metes out rewards for the good things we have done, for keeping the commandments, he will mete out the greatest possible number of blessings for that which we have done that is right" (J. Reuben Clark, Jr., "<a href="https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/j-reuben-clark_ye-sow/"><span style="color: #33cccc;">As We Sow, So Shall We Reap</span></a>" [recorded talk delivered at Brigham Young University, May 3, 1955]).<br><br>I sense charity when President Kimball speaks. Listen carefully to this beautiful quote from his speech given to the seminary and institute students in Long Beach, California, on April 9, 1978:<br><br><i>Sex involvement outside of marriage locks the door to temples and thus bars the way to eternal life. We extend to every listener a cordial invitation to come to the watered garden, to the shade of trees, to unchangeable truth. Come with us to sureness, security, consistency. Here the cooling waters flow; the spring does not dry ....</i><br><br><i>Come, listen to a prophet's voice and hear the word of God.</i><br><br>Charity vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up, doth not behave itself unseemly, seeketh not her own." I am impressed that Paul refers to charity in the feminine gender. Why? He does so, I suppose, because a mother's love comes nearer charity than anything else does. An unknown mother wrote a poem entitled "Mothers Are People":<br><br><i>Mothers are people who cook things,</i><br><i>Like breakfast or lunch or a snack;</i><br><i>Dexterous people who hook things</i><br><i>Which button or zip up the back.</i><br><br><i>Mothers are people who blow things,</i><br><i>Balloons and kisses and noses;</i><br><i>Green-thumbish people who grow things,</i><br><i>Like ivy and puppies and roses.</i><br><br><i>Mothers are people who send things,</i><br><i>Like letters and strawberry tarts;</i><br><i>Magical people who mend things,</i><br><i>Like blue jeans and elbows and hearts.</i><br><br><i>Mothers are people who find things,</i><br><i>Like mittens and homework and germs;</i><br><i>Fussbudget people who mind things,</i><br><i>Like cusswords and snowballs and worms.</i><br><br><i>Mothers are people who sweep things,</i><br><i>Like porches and cobwebs and rugs;</i><br><i>Softhearted people who keep things,</i><br><i>Like artwork, report cards, and hugs.</i><br><br><i>Mothers are people who nurse things,</i><br><i>A boy or a girl or a spouse;</i><br><i>And, all in all, there are worse things</i><br><i>Than mothers to have in your house.</i><br><br>I think perhaps the author understood all the things a mother does.<br><br>I have a great friend named Jay Mitton, who is the secretary of the First Quorum of the Seventy of the Church. I also knew his mother as the Relief Society president of the Boise Ninth Ward. I was the finance chairman for the ward, and I remember going around to visit every single family to see if they needed assistance or if they could contribute financially to the Church. I went to the house of an old man who must have been in his eighties, and as he welcomed me in he said, "My wife isn't here, and as you know I am not a member of the Church."<br><br>"Is your wife in town?" I asked.<br><br>"Well, she's in the hospital, and she's been there for four weeks."<br><br>I looked around his house and saw that it was immaculate and spotless--the dishes were all done instead of being piled up in the sink for four weeks. I remarked, "I'm certainly impressed with the way you keep house."<br><br>He said, "You know, I'm not a member of your church, but you have one of the greatest women I have ever met in my life. Her name is Claudia Mitton. Do you know, she comes over here every other day or so, and she'll do the dishes, and then she'll get down on her hands and knees and scrub my floor. No one knows she comes. She just slips in and quietly leaves." It is acts such as these that constitute true charity.<br><br>Let me share with you a few other things that may enlarge our understanding of charity. I read, in a great book that I have, the story of two ambassadors, Spinola and Richardet, who were sent by the King of Spain to The Hague to try to effect a treaty. As they performed their duties and inspected all that they could, they saw a little boat floating down the river. The boat stopped, and the eight or ten men on the boat disembarked, sat down in the grass, and proceeded to make a simple lunch of brown bread, cheese, and drink. Seeing a peasant walking by, Spinola and Richardet called to him and asked, "Who are these men?"<br><br>The peasant looked at the men for a moment and said, "Oh, these are our worshipful masters; they are the deputies of the states."<br><br>Spinola then turned to Richardet and said, "We had better let these men alone; these are not men to be conquered."<br><br>If we went to President Kimball's home tonight, do you know what we would see him eating? Probably a bowl of milk with broken bread in it. Men of such simple strength are not to be conquered. I tell you that the Church is standing up and putting on its beautiful garments because of men like President Kimball.<br><br>I attended a training director's seminar in Anaheim some time back, where Mike Vance, director of training for Disneyland Corporation, told of an interesting incident. The Disneyland people had invited a number of those veterans who had been injured or lost limbs during the war in Vietnam to spend the day at Disneyland. The Disneyland Corporation sent its airplane--I think it is called<i>Mickey Mouse 1</i>--up to an airbase near San Francisco to pick up all these men to fly them down, and then took them out to Disneyland, where they spent the whole day. Then, said Mike Vance, "as they were about ready to part--all these military men, standing there with out any arms, but just hooks hanging down--there was a sudden feeling of uneasiness, and no one knew what to say. Than, all at once, Sasha, one of the guides, went over to them and said, 'Men, before you leave, do you mind if I just shake your hooks?' And she shook hooks with each one of them." As you know, metal conducts warmth and heat; and I am sure that as she grabbed hold of their hooks and shook them her warmth extended right into their hearts.<br><br>The men were flown back to their base, and several weeks later the Disneyland people received a letter from their commanding officer saying what a great experience it had been for all of them to go down to Disneyland and spend the entire day there. It continued, "My men were terribly impressed with everything that was done, but do you know what they remember most? A young woman by the name of Sasha, who shook all of our hooks." That, you see, is charity.<br><br>Sir Walter Scott, the gentleman's gentleman was admired by all who met him. When little children came into a room where Sir Walter Scott was, they were instantly attracted to him and sat on the floor around him as he carried on a conversation. They felt his warmth. When a woman came into the room, whether homely or beautiful, she was attracted to him. Men of great renown or of little renown could approach Sir Walter Scott and feel totally at ease. One of his friends once remarked to him, "You must have had a terribly impressive mother who taught you all of these things."<br><br>Sir Walter replied, in effect, "No; I did have a wonderful mother, but actually that is not where I learned the lesson. When I was a boy of about eight or nine, I was out in the street playing. Seeing a dog down the street, I picked up a big rock and, not knowing whether I would hit it or not, I threw it at the dog to scare it. It did hit the dog and broke its leg. The dog fell down on its front legs, crawled up to me, and licked my boots." That is where Sir Walter Scott learned charity. That is where he learned the kind of humility the Savior exemplified when he washed the feet of his disciples one by one.<br><br>Who could forget the story of Abram and Zimri, brothers who worked side by side in the field? Abram had a wife and seven sons, and Zimri had none. When harvest time came, they divided the harvest equally; but that night, as Abram sat in his house, he thought, "I have a wife and seven sons, and Zimri has none. It isn't fair that we divide the harvest equally." So he slipped out into the night, removed a generous third of the sheaves from his harvest, and placed them on Zimri's pile. Then he went back to his home and sat by the fire with seven sons.<br><br>As Zimri sat alone by his fire in his home, he thought, "It isn't fair that we share alike. My brother Abram has seven sons and a wife, and I have none." And so he slipped out into the night, carefully removed a generous third of the sheaves from his harvest, and he placed them on Abram's pile. Then he returned to his home.<br><br>The next morning, when they went out to the fields, both brothers noticed that the harvests were exactly as they had been the day before, and neither one of them could understand. So that night again, after it got dark, Abram crept out into the night and repeated his work of the night before. This time he went to a nearby ditch, crouched down in it, and waited. In a few moments, he saw his brother Zimri come out of his home and begin to remove a generous third of the sheaves from his harvest. Jumping up from his hiding place, Abram ran to his brother and fell on his neck and kissed him, his joy so full he could not speak.<br><br>How often we misunderstand charity? We cannot possibly get into the Lord's debt. The Lord has said, "Whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap." In the book<i>The Agony and the Ecstasy,</i>Irving Stone describes Michelangelo's first piece of sculptured marble, a bust. It was nearly completed when his professor walked over to look at it. He picked it up, examined it, then put it back on the workbench and without a word turned and walked away. As he did, he carelessly brushed against the bust with his arm. It fell to the floor, breaking into a thousand pieces, Michelangelo stood with his mouth open, aghast at what had happened. Then the professor looked back over his shoulder and said, "It wasn't worthy of you."<br><br>Had that little act not taken place, we may never have heard of Michelangelo. It is those who are terribly tough on us and who make us stretch beyond the limit of what we think we can stand that raise us.<br><br>Coming back to the modern day, I recently heard of a woman who wrote to one of the national columnists--whose name you would know if I shared it with you--and said, "I am a nurse working at a hospital in the child abuse section. Every time they bring children in, it just about breaks my heart; I can't stand to see these little children beaten, mutilated, bruised, and hurt. I guess the straw that broke the camel's back came the other day when they brought in a little five-year-old girl. As I held her in my arms, her mother said, 'I didn't think I was hitting her that hard.'"<br><br>The nurse said, "The little girl passed away in my arms. Just before she passed away, she opened her eyes and said, 'My mommy says I'm a bad girl.'"<br><br>I would have given anything to have been the national columnist responding to that letter. It would have said something like this: "No, sweetheart, you are not a bad girl; your mommy is a bad mommy."<br><br>It really is time that men of charity, women of charity, and a church of charity stood up and reached their full stature. Things exist in our society that are too abominable to be allowed to remain--drugs, abortion, child abuse, and perversions of every kind. And yet, as we put on our beautiful garments and become a charitable people, I tell you that Jacob has come of age, and that we will make a profound impact on this world. But we must do it unitedly. We cannot have just a few members of the Church; we need to move four million people in that direction, and then things will really begin to happen.<br><br>In a speech on business and morality David Linowes quoted the following:<br><br><i>To whom can I speak today?</i><br><i>The gentle man has perished</i><br><i>The violent man has access to everybody</i><br><i>To whom can I speak today?</i><br><i>The iniquity that smites the land</i><br><i>It has no end.</i><br><br><i>To whom can I speak today?</i><br><i>There are no righteous men</i><br><i>The earth is surrendered to criminals.</i><br>[David W. Linowes, "International Business Morality Integrity and Ethics," in<i>Vital Speeches of the Day</i>43 no. 15 (May 15, 1977): 477]<br><br>This quote, delivered in a modern-day speech, was written by a man over four thousand years ago in Egypt as he prepared to commit suicide. It sounds so like today.<br><br>Is it not time that we took a stand? It is vital that we let the world know that there is such a thing as unacceptable conduct; that we as a church put on our beautiful garments and become a standard for all nations; that we have charity, which is the pure love of Christ, reflected in every word, act, and deed, so that through our lives the whole world might see a true pattern and model for a modern-day man of Christ. May we do this I pray humbly in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Vaughn J.

<h1>teps: Wisdom, Stature, and Favor - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
My beloved associates--members and friends of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints:<br><br>Sister Benson and I are honored to be in your midst tonight. I pray that the spirit of the Lord will be with us and that I might be an instrument in the Lord's hands to bless and edify you.<br><br>For nearly six thousand years, God has held you in reserve to make your appearance in the final days before the Second Coming of the Lord. Every previous gospel dispensation has drifted into apostasy, but ours will not. True, there will be some individuals who will fall away; but the kingdom of God will remain intact to welcome the return of its head--even Jesus Christ. While our generation will be comparable in wickedness to the days of Noah, when the Lord cleansed the earth by flood, there is a major difference this time. It is that God has saved for the final inning some of his strongest children, who will help bear off the Kingdom triumphantly. And that is where you come in, for you are the generation that must be prepared to meet your God.<br><br>All through the ages the prophets have looked down through the corridors of time to our day. Billions of the deceased and those yet to be born have their eyes on us. Make no mistake about it--you are a marked generation. There has never been more expected of the faithful in such a short period of time as there is of us. Never before on the face of this earth have the forces of evil and the forces of good been as well organized. Now is the great day of the devil's power, with the greatest mass murderers of all time living among us. But now is also the great day of the Lord's power, with the greatest number ever of priesthood holders on the earth. And the showdown is fast approaching.<br><br>Each day the forces of evil and the forces of good pick up new recruits. Each day we personally make many decisions that show where our support will go. The final outcome is certain--the forces of righteousness will finally win. What remains to be seen is where each of us personally, now and in the future, will stand in this fight--and how tall we will stand. Will we be true to our last-days, foreordained mission?<br><br>Great battles can make great heroes, but heroes will make great battle. You will never have a better opportunity to be a greater hero in a more crucial battle than in the battle you will face today and in the immediate future. Be warned that some of the greatest battles you will face will be fought within the silent chambers of your own soul. David's battles in the field against the foe were not as critical as David's battles in the palace against a lustful eye. We will each find our own battlefield. The tactics that the enemy will use against us will vary from time to time; he will feel after our weak spots. We must be alert to the devil's devious designs, to the subtle sins and clever compromises as well as the obvious offenses.<br><br>Fortunately for us, we have the privilege of fighting under the Lord's banner. While the devil hates us and seeks to make all men miserable like unto himself (see 2 Nephi 2:27), the Lord instead loves us and seeks for us the fullness of joy which He possesses.<br><br>Christ lived on the earth and was subject to all manner of temptation, but He won every battle. He is the most successful warrior that ever walked the earth, and He wants to help us win every battle, be it personal or public. When we fall short, His atonement will cover for us on certain conditions.<br><br>Jesus knows that His kingdom will triumph, and He wants you to triumph with it, too. He knows in advance every strategy the enemy will use against you and the Kingdom. He knows your weaknesses and He knows your strengths. By revelation, personal to you, you may discover some of these strengths and weaknesses through a careful and prayerful study of your patriarchal blessing. Through proper prayer you can ask him to reveal to you your weaknesses so that you can amend your life. In the Book of Mormon in Ether, chapter 12, verse 27, the Lord says the following:<br><br><i>If men come unto me I will show unto them their weakness. . . . If they humble themselves before me, and have faith in me, then will I make weak things become strong unto them.</i><br><br>God can reveal to you your talents and your strengths so that you will know upon what you can build. Be assured that in all your righteous endeavors you can say, as Paul said in Philippians, chapter 4, verse 13, "I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me." And also be assured, as Paul said in 1 Corinthians, chapter 10, verse 13, that no temptation will befall you but what is common to man and that God will, with each temptation, provide a way to escape.<br><br>We follow a perfect leader--not just one who tells us to do what he thinks we should do, but the only one who can say that we should be as He is in everything. In the Book of Mormon, in 3 Nephi, chapter 27, verse 27, the Lord asked the question, "What manner of men ought ye to be?" And then He answered by saying, "Verily I say unto you, even as I am."<br><br>What manner of man was Jesus when He was your age--when He was growing into manhood, when He was personally preparing Himself during those thirty years for His three-year public ministry? Turning to the book of Luke in the New Testament, chapter 2, verse 52, we read these words: "And Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favor with God and man."<br><br>Here, then, are the four great areas where Jesus grew in personal preparation. Your first thirty years cover the time in your life when most of you will be serving missions, getting your education, dating, getting married, establishing homes, and finding and beginning a career. If we, then, are to follow in His footsteps, we should increase in those same four areas in which He increased. In the Doctrine and Covenants, section 93, verse 13, it states that Jesus "received not of the fullness at first, but continued from grace to grace [not from sin to grace, but from grace to grace] until he received a fullness." We too should move "from grace to grace" "in wisdom and stature and in favor with God and man." Let us consider these four areas.<br><h2><b>"Jesus Increased in Wisdom"</b></h2><br>Wisdom could be considered the proper application of true knowledge. Not all knowledge has the same worth, nor are all truths equally valuable. The truths upon which our eternal salvation rests are the most crucial truths that we must learn. No man is truly educated unless he knows where he came from, why he is here, and where he can expect to go in the next life; unless he can adequately answer the question which Jesus posed: "What think ye of Christ?" The world cannot teach us these things as the Kingdom can. Therefore, the most essential knowledge for you to obtain is the saving knowledge within the gospel and the knowledge of its author--even Jesus Christ. In fact, that eternal life for which we should all be striving--which is the greatest gift that God can give and which is God's type of life, the life of the great Eternal One--that eternal life comes from knowing our Father in heaven and His Son, our Elder Brother, Jesus Christ. As the scripture in John, chapter 17, verse 3, reads, "This is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent." We cannot know about God and Jesus without studying about them and then doing their will. This in turn will lead to additional revealed knowledge which, if obeyed, will eventually lead us to further truths. If we keep following this pattern, we will receive further light and joy that will eventually lead us into God's presence where we, with Him, will have a fullness.<br><br>In the Doctrine and Covenants, section 88, verse 118, we are admonished to "seek . . . out of the best books words of wisdom." Surely these books must first include the scriptures. Next, and alongside them, must be the words of the Presidents of the Church. In the Doctrine and Covenants, section 21, verse 5, the Lord said of the President of the Church, "His word ye shall receive, as if from mine own mouth." These books make up what has been referred to as "the Lord's library"--namely the standard works and the various volumes that contain the words of the different Presidents of the Church. Of the latter volumes, that which would be of greatest importance to you would be the words of the current President of the Church, for his words are directed to our day and our needs.<br><br>The Lord has also given a special mantle to the apostles, and the significance of their words is pointed out in section 1, verse 14--the Lord's preface to the Doctrine and Covenants-- where he says that those who will not "give heed to the words of the prophets and apostles shall be cut off from among the people." The writing of other General Authorities should be given consideration also.<br><br>While the gospel includes the more crucial saving truths contained within theology, it also includes truth in other branches of learning. The Lord encouraged the early missionaries in the 88<sup>th</sup>section of the Doctrine and Covenants, verse 79, to be instructed more perfectly in<br><br><i>things both in heaven and in the earth, and under the earth; things which have been, things which are, things which must shortly come to pass; things which are at home, things which are abroad; the wars and the perplexities of the nations, and the judgments which are on the land; and a knowledge also of countries and of kingdoms.</i><br><br>Today, with the abundance of books available, it is the mark of a truly educated man to know what not to read. "Of making many books there is no end" (Ecclesiastes 12:12). Feed only on the best. As John Wesley's mother counseled him: "Avoid whatever weakens your reason, impairs the tenderness of your conscience, obscures your sense of God, takes off your relish for spiritual things, . . . increases the authority of the body over the mind."<br><br>The fact that a book is old does not necessarily make it of value. The fact that an author wrote one good work does not necessarily mean that all his books are worthy of your time. Do not make your mind a dumping ground for other people's garbage. It is harder to purge the mind of rotten reading than to purge the body of rotten food, and it is more damaging to the soul.<br><br>Most novels and pulp magazines are filled with a lot of rubbish, and most TV and a lot of radio programs are a waste of time, if not corruptors of morals or distorters of truth. The less newspapers have to say of value and of truth, the more pages they seem to take to say it. Usually a few minutes is more than sufficient to read a paper. One must select wisely a source of news; otherwise it would be better to be uninformed than misinformed. The subscribers of some mass magazines and newspapers are ever reading but seldom able to come to a knowledge of the truth in the areas of most vital concern.<br><br>As we approach the showdown, it will be increasingly valuable to have vocational skills--to be able to use our hands. The most essential temporal skills and knowledge are to be able to provide food, clothing, and shelter. Increasingly the Lord, through His servants, is trying to get us closer to the soil by raising our own produce.<br><br>Let us summarize. The most vital knowledge you can learn is the saving truths of the gospel--the truths that will make the difference in your eternal welfare. The most vital words that you can read are those of the Presidents of the Church--particularly the living prophet--and those of the apostles and prophets. God encourages learning in many areas, and vocational skills will have increasing importance. There is much reading material that is available that is either time-wasting or corrupting. The best yardstick to use in discerning the worth of true knowledge and learning is to go first and foremost to the words of the Lord's prophets.<br><h2><b>"Jesus Increased in . . . Stature"</b></h2><br>There is no question that the health of the body affects the spirit, or the Lord would never have revealed the Word of Wisdom. God has never given any temporal commandments--that which affects our stature affects our soul. There are at least four basic areas which make the difference in your health--in your growing in stature.<br><br>First: righteousness. Sin debilitates; it affects not only the soul but the body. The scriptures are replete with examples of the physical power that can attend the righteous. On the other hand, unrepented sin can diffuse energy and lead to both mental and physical sickness. Disease, fevers, and unexpected deaths are some of the things that have been directly related to disobedience. Jesus healed a man of a physical malady and then told him in John, chapter 5, verse 14, to "sin no more, lest a worse thing come unto thee." Galahad said that his strength was as the strength of ten because his heart was pure.<br><br>Second: food. To a great extent we are physically what we eat. Most of us are acquainted with some of the prohibitions, such as no tea, coffee, tobacco, or alcohol. What need additional emphasis are the positive aspects--the need for vegetables, fruits, and grains, particularly wheat. In most cases, the closer these can be, when eaten, to their natural state-- without overrefinement and processing--the healthier we will be. To a significant degree, we are an overfed and undernourished nation digging an early grave with our teeth, and lacking the energy that could be ours because we overindulge in junk foods. I am grateful to know that on this campus you can get apples from vending machines, that you have in your student center a fine salad bar, and that you produce an excellent loaf of natural whole-grain bread. Keep it up and keep progressing in that direction. We need a generation of young people who, as Daniel, eat in a more healthy manner than to fare on the "king's meat"--and whose countenances show it (see Daniel 1).<br><br>Third: exercise. The body needs the toning up that comes from exercise. Walking in the fresh air can be exhilarating and refreshing. Properly directed running can have some beneficial effects. Simple situps or sporting activity can be helpful.<br><br>Fourth: sleep. Adequate early rest is best. In the Doctrine and Covenants, section 88, verse 124, the Lord commands: "Cease to sleep longer than is needful; retire to thy bed early, that ye may not be weary; arise early, that your bodies and your minds may be invigorated." There are too many enticements to late evening activities. Not only can this weary the body, but a wearied body may be more susceptible to improper activities in the darkness and lateness of the night. Early to bed and early to rise is still good counsel, and a brief nap during the day can be recuperative.<br><h2><b>"Jesus Increased . . . in Favor with God"</b></h2><br>What are some of the things that would increase our favor with God? There are many, of course. The book of Abraham in the Pearl of Great Price, chapter 3, verse 25, states that one of the purposes of life is to be proved to see if we "will do all things whatsoever the Lord [our] God shall command [us]." In short, we are to learn the will of the Lord and do it. We are to follow the model of Jesus Christ and be like Him. The essential question of life should be the same one that Paul asked in the book of Acts, chapter 9, verse 6, when he said, "Lord, what wilt thou have me do?" God's will for you can be determined from three sources: (1) the scriptures--particularly the Book of Mormon, of which the Prophet Joseph said, "a man would get nearer to god by abiding by its precepts, than by any other book" (Joseph Smith,<i>History of the Church</i>4:461)--(2) inspired words from the Lord's anointed--particularly the presidents of the Church and especially the living one, along with the words of the apostles and prophets (local Church leaders are also entitled to give inspired direction for those over whom they preside)--and (3) the spirit of the Lord.<br><br>The world has the light of Christ to help guide it, but we are entitled to that great gift, the gift of the Holy Ghost. For the Holy Ghost to be fully operative we have to keep our channels clear of sin. The clearer our channels, the easier it is to receive God's message to us; and the more of His messages we receive and put into action, the greater will be our joy. If our channels are not clear of sin, then we may think we have gotten inspiration on a matter when it is really "sin-spiration"--that is, promptings from the devil.<br><br>To the end of clearing our channels and keeping them clear, I would admonish all of you to read President Kimball's book<i>The Miracle of Forgiveness</i>; and the sooner you can read it the greater blessing it will be for you. Other practices that would increase our favor with God would include daily scripture study, along with personal prayers morning, midday, and night. We also need to render service to our Father's children through the family, the Church, and the country.<br><br>God has a timetable--a sequence or season for good things. A mission, when its time has arrived, takes priority over marriage and education. And when one is mature enough and has found the right company, then marriage should not be delayed for education. While all three--mission, marriage, and education--are essential, there is a proper order to follow.<br><br>We need more men and women of Christ who will always remember Him, who will keep His commandments which He has given them. The greatest yardstick of success is to see how much your daily walk can be like Christ's--how closely you can walk each moment in His steps.<br><h2><b>"Jesus Increased . . . in Favor with . . . Man"</b></h2><br>The greatest roles you can take to bless your fellowmen are to be strong missionaries and to be strong patriarchs and matriarchs--to raise a righteous posterity who will be part of the solutions to the world's problems and not part of the problems. You have probably heard that the greatest Church work you can perform will be within the walls of your own home. It is also true that no nation is stronger than its homes. For a man, there is no calling as high as that of a righteous patriarch, married in the house of the Lord, presiding over his children. Even the very Elohim has us address Him as "our Father who art in heaven." For a woman there is no calling as high as that of a righteous mother, married in the House of the Lord, rearing a posterity.<br><br>Someone has said that happy is the man who has found his worship, his wife, and his work, and loves all three. Do you realize that during your comparatively young years, you will probably be making three of the most momentous decisions of your life? You will be deciding on the role of the Church or worship in your life, selecting a wife or husband, and--particularly for you men--choosing your life's work.<br><br>All of you can know, if you do not know already, that The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is the only true church. All you need to do to gain this knowledge is to carefully read the Book of Mormon and then do what is stated in Moroni, chapter 10, verse 4:<br><br><i>And when ye shall receive these things, I would exhort you that ye would ask God, the Eternal Father, in the name of Christ, if these things are not true; and if ye shall ask with a sincere heart, with real intent, having faith in Christ, he will manifest the truth of it unto you, by the power of the Holy Ghost.</i><br><br>If the Book of Mormon is true--which I testify that it is--then Joseph Smith was a prophet. If Joseph Smith was a prophet, then the church he established, as an instrument in God's hands, is true--even The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. If the Church is true, then there stands at the head of the Church today a prophet of God.<br><br>In addition to finding your worship, you will need to find your wife or husband. This will require careful and prayerful consideration. It would be well to mingle with many good people to have a better understanding of others. It you desire a fine companion, then you should be on a high and wholesome level. One of the best yardsticks for knowing whether a certain person may be best for you is to ask yourself what kind of an influence this person has on you. In their presence do you wish you were better than you are--do you think some of your noblest thoughts--are you encouraged to goodly deeds? If this is so, then that person could be worthy of greater consideration. But if being in their company makes you tend in the opposite direction, you had best leave them.<br><br>Young women, you are not required to lower your standards to get a husband. Keep yourselves attractive, maintain high standards, place yourselves in a position to meet worthy men, and be engaged in constructive work. Then, if you are married later than sooner--if you even have to wait until the next life to get a choice man--God will make up the difference to you. Time is numbered only to man. God has your eternal perspective in mind.<br><br>And now, so far as your work is concerned: It is divinely ordained what a woman should do, but a man must seek out his work. The divine work of women involves companionship, homemaking, and motherhood. It is well if skills in these three areas can first be learned in the parents' home and then be supplemented at school if the need or desire presents itself. The first priority for a woman is to prepare herself for her divine and eternal mission, whether she is married soon or late. It is folly to neglect that preparation for education in unrelated fields just to prepare temporarily to earn money. Women, when you are married it is the husband's role to provide, not yours. Do not sacrifice your preparation for an eternally ordained mission for the temporary expediency of money-making skills that you may or may not use. I do not think it needs to be an "either/or" choice; but if it does, then choose the divine mission preparation. Some women are well prepared for their mission and want to acquire additional skills in other areas; and that is fine, if they so desire. It is simply a case of putting first things first. To paraphrase the Lord, when He was speaking of those who obeyed the lesser law and neglected the weightier matters: these ye might do, but do not leave the other undone (see Matthew 23:23). Some women acquire money-making skills in areas closely related to their divine missions, and the advantages of that approach are plain.<br><br>Brethren, it is your role to be the leader in the home. While the wife may be considered the heart of the home, you are the head. You are the provider, and it takes the edge off your manliness when you have the mother of your children also be a provider. What will you choose for a career? What will your work be? It has been said that no one is born into this world whose work is not born with him or her. We bring from our preexistent state various talents and abilities. We strive to find the right wife, and it is our responsibility to strive to find where we can make a contribution to our fellowman--an area where we have some interest and abilities and where we can, at the same time, provide for our own.<br><br>I am glad Beethoven found his way into music, Rembrandt into art, Michelangelo into sculpturing, and President David O. McKay into teaching. To find your proper niche and do well at it can bless you, yours, and your fellowmen. If you need help finding your career, it is available: (1) Ponder and pray about it; (2) study closely your patriarchal blessing; (3) consider what you do well; (4) take some vocational and interest tests; and (5) get acquainted with various professions to see what is available.<br><br>I understand that you have a fine career counseling center here at BYU with a diversified program that offers help through classes, testing, seminars, a library, and so on. I hope that if you feel the need you will take advantage of these opportunities. How true it is--happy is the man who has found his worship, his wife, and his work, and loves them all.<br><br>The world is gradually beating a path to our door to see how we do things. Stick by your righteous guns and you will bless your fellowman. Be right, and then be easy to live with, if possible--but in that order.<br><br>My beloved brothers and sisters, "Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favor with God and man," and so can you. You are a royal generation. The heavenly grandstands are cheering you on. We are fast coming to the close of this game. The opposition is real and is scoring. But we have scored, we are scoring, and we will score in the future. The Lord is our coach and manager. His team will win, and we can be a valiant part of it if we so desire. Rise up, O youth of Zion! You hardly realize the great divine potential that lies within you. May you all follow your leader, Jesus Christ, and increase mentally, physically, spiritually, and socially, I pray for all of you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Ezra Taft Benson was a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when this fireside address was given at Brigham Young University on 4 March 1979.</i></i><br><br><i>©Intellectual Reserve, Inc.

<h1>ony of Christ - James E. Faust - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I have come this morning to speak to you of holy things and of sacred happenings. Perhaps it may not be given to us to fully understand these occurrences, except through the intelligence of the Holy Spirit. I pray for that special spirit both for you and for myself, so that we may come to a perfect understanding concerning these sacred matters. I pray that we may worship together in spirit and truth. I will speak to you today concerning a testimony of Christ.<br><br>I can speak to you with some insight and feeling on this subject for two reasons. Firstly, I am the most newly called of the special witnesses. No one else in the world has more recently experienced the sacred happenings of coming to this sacred calling than I. Secondly, Sister Faust and I have recently walked in some of the pathways of the Savior. What I have to say to you, however, is more than feelings, but is rather fact and knowledge to me, the truth of which may be known to you by sacred whisperings.<br><br>The things of the spirit are most to be treasured because from these spiritual reassurances come the sacred inner peace and strength, as was the testimony of John the Baptist: "A man can receive nothing, except it be given him from heaven" (John 3:27). Each has to receive his own witness concerning Jesus as the Christ. I wish this morning to set my seal upon this knowledge. Let me begin with Peter. No one was in a better position to know than was Peter. Peter's story is credible--he was there. Said Peter, "For we have not followed cunningly devised fables, when we made known unto you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but were eyewitnesses of his majesty" (2 Peter 1:16).<br><br>Anyone who claims discipleship cannot help but have a special appreciation for the calling of the first apostles and for their authority.<br><br><i>And Jesus, walking by the sea of Galilee, saw two brethren, Simon called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea: for they were fishers.</i><br><br><i>And he saith unto them, Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men.</i><br><br><i>And they straightway left their nets, and followed him.</i><br><br><i>And going on from thence, he saw other two brethren, James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, in a ship with Zebedee with their father, mending their nets; and he called them.</i><br><br><i>And they immediately left the ship and their father, and followed him.</i>[Matthew 4:18–22]<br><br>These came early to a testimony of his divinity.<br><br><i>Again the next day after John stood, and two of his disciples;</i><br><br><i>And looking upon Jesus as he walked, he saith, Behold the Lamb of God! ...</i><br><br><i>One of the two which heard John speak, and followed him, was Andrew, Simon Peter's brother.</i><br><br><i>He first findeth his own brother Simon, and saith unto him, We have found the Messias, which is, being interpreted, the Christ.</i><br><br><i>And he brought him to Jesus. And when Jesus beheld him, he said, Thou art Simon the son of Jona; thou shalt be called Cephas, which is by interpretation, A stone.</i><br><br><i>The day following Jesus would go forth into Galilee, and findeth Philip, and saith unto him, Follow me....</i><br><br><i>Philip findeth Nathanael, and saith unto him, We have found him, of whom Moses in the law, and the prophets, did write, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.</i><br><br><i>And Nathanael said unto him, Can there any good thing come out of Nazareth? Philip saith unto him, Come and see.</i><br><br><i>Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him, and saith of him, Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile!...</i><br><br><i>Nathanael answered and saith unto him, Rabbi, thou art the Son of God; thou art the King of Israel.</i><br><br><i>Jesus answered and said unto him, Because I said unto thee, I saw thee under the fig tree, believest thou? Thou shalt see greater things than these.</i><br><br><i>And he saith unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Hereafter ye shall see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man.</i>[John 1:35–36, 40–43, 45–47, 49–51]<br><br>The first recorded assignment to the Twelve recalls:<br><br><i>And when he had called unto him his twelve disciples, he gave them power against unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to heal all manner of sickness and all manner of disease....</i><br><br><i>And as ye go, preach, saying, The kingdom of heaven is at hand.</i><br><br><i>Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers, raise the dead, cast out devils: freely ye have received, freely give.</i><br><br><i>Provide neither gold, nor silver, nor brass in your purses.</i><br><br><i>Nor scrip for your journey, neither two coats, neither shoes, nor yet staves: for the workman is worthy of his meat.</i><br><br><i>And into whatsoever city or town ye shall enter, inquire who in it is worthy; and there abide till ye go thence.</i><br><br><i>And when ye come into an house, salute it.</i><br><br><i>And if the house be worthy, let your peace come upon it: but if it be not worthy, let your peace return to you.</i>[Matthew 10:1, 7–13]<br><br>Peter frequently testified of the divinity of the Savior.<br><br><i>From that time many of his disciples went back, and walked no more with him.</i><br><br><i>Then said Jesus unto the twelve, Will ye also go away?</i><br><br><i>Then Simon Peter answered him, Lord, to whom shall we go? thou hast the words of eternal life.</i><br><br><i>And we believe and are sure that thou art that Christ, the Son of the living God.</i>[John 6:66–69]<br><br>Much training was necessary for the ancient disciples, as well as for the modern.<br><br><i>And being in the house he asked them, What was it that ye disputed among yourselves by the way?</i><br><br><i>But they held their peace: for by the way they had disputed among themselves, who should be the greatest.</i><br><br><i>And he sat down, and called the twelve, and saith unto them, If any man desire to be first, the same shall be last of all, and servant of all.</i><br><br><i>And he took a child, and set him in the midst of them: and when he had taken him in his arms, he said unto them:</i>[Mark 9:33–36]<br><br><i>Verily I say unto you, Except ye be converted, and become as little children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven.</i><br><br><i>Whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child, the same is greatest in the kingdom of heaven.</i><br><br><i>And whoso shall receive one such little child in my name receiveth me.</i>[Matthew 18:3–5]<br><br>Others were given a testimony concerning his divinity in little Bethany. Many marvelous things happened, not the least of which was the raising of Lazarus from the dead.<br><br><i>Then said Martha unto Jesus, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died.</i><br><br><i>But I know, that even now, whatsoever thou wilt ask of God, God will give it thee.</i><br><br><i>Jesus saith unto her, Thy brother shall rise again.</i><br><br><i>Martha saith unto him, I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day.</i><br><br><i>Jesus said unto her, I am the resurrection, and the life: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live:</i><br><br><i>And whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die. Believest thou this?</i><br><br><i>She saith unto him, Yea, Lord: I believe that thou art the Christ, the Son of God, which should come into the world ....</i><br><br><i>And when he thus had spoken, he cried with a loud voice, Lazarus, come forth.</i><br><br><i>And he that was dead came forth, bound hand and foot with graveclothes: and his face was bound about with a napkin. Jesus saith unto them, Loose him, and let him go.</i><br><br><i>Then many of the Jews which came to Mary, and had seen the things which Jesus did, believed on him.</i>[John 11:21–27, 43–45]<br><br>Peter's personal testimony was strengthened by his experience of walking on the water to go to Jesus.<br><br><i>But when he saw the wind boisterous, he was afraid; and beginning to sink, he cried, saying,Lord, save me.</i><br><br><i>And immediately Jesus stretched forth his hand, and caught him, and said unto him, O thou of little faith, wherefore didst thou doubt?</i><br><br><i>And when they were come into the ship, the wind ceased.</i><br><br><i>Then they that were in the ship came and worshipped him, saying, Of a truth thou art the Son of God.</i>[Matthew 14:30–33]<br><br>There were many who believed, but for social reasons lacked the faith to follow:<br><br><i>Nevertheless among the chief rulers also many believed on him; but because of the Pharisees they did not confess him, lest they should be put out of the synagogue:</i><br><br><i>For they loved the praise of men more than the praise of God.</i>[John 12:42–43]<br><br>Now we approach the Easter season, and there is no greater testimony of Jesus Christ than that found in the story of the Crucifixion and the Resurrection. The end began in Bethany, which is on the far side of the Mount of Olives from Jerusalem. The Savior passed around the brow of the mount through little Bethphage. Of Wednesday we have no record. Thursday was the preparation for the Passover.<br><br><i>And when the hour was come, he sat down, and the twelve apostles with him....</i><br><br><i>And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and said: Take this, and divide it among yourselves:</i><br><br><i>For I say unto you, I will not drink of the fruit of the vine, until the kingdom of God shall come.</i>[Luke 22:14, 17–18]<br><br>Following this, Jesus performed the great symbolic act of washing the disciples' feet. After having poured water into a basin, he<br><br><i>began to wash the disciples' feet, and to wipe them with the towel wherewith he was girded....</i><br><br><i>Peter saith unto him, Thou shalt never wash my feet. Jesus answered him, If I wash thee not, thou hast no part with me.</i><br><br><i>Simon Peter saith unto him, Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands and my head.</i>[John 13:5, 8–9]<br><br>Jesus, at the Last Supper, announced the betrayal.<br><br><i>Now there was leaning on Jesus' bosom one of his disciples, whom Jesus loved.</i><br><br><i>Simon Peter therefore beckoned to him, that he should ask who it should be of whom he spake.</i><br><br><i>He then lying on Jesus' breast saith unto him, Lord, who is it?</i><br><br><i>Jesus answered, He it is, to whom I shall give a sop, when I have dipped it. And when he had dipped the sop, he gave it to Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon.</i><br><br><i>And after the sop Satan entered into him. Then said Jesus unto him, That thou doest, do quickly.</i><br><br><i>Now no man at the table knew for what intent he spake this unto him.</i>[John 13:23–28]<br><br>Then followed the sacrament:<br><br><i>And as they did eat, Jesus took bread, and blessed, and brake it, and gave to them, and said, Take, eat: this is my body.</i><br><br><i>And he took the cup, and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them: and they all drank of it.</i><br><br><i>And he said unto them, This is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many.</i>[Mark 14:22–24]<br><br>The training of the apostles was continuing.<br><br><i>And the Lord said, Simon, Simon, behold, Satan hath desired to have you, that he may sift you as wheat:</i><br><br><i>But I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not, and when thou art converted, strengthen thy brethren.</i>[Luke 22:31–32]<br><br>Peter and the other disciples professed complete loyalty:<br><br><i>Simon Peter said unto him, Lord, whither goest thou? Jesus answered him, Whither I go, thou canst not follow me now; but thou shalt follow me afterwards.</i><br><br><i>Peter said unto him, Lord, why cannot I follow thee now? I will lay down my life for thy sake.</i><br><br><i>Jesus answered him, Wilt thou lay down thy life for my sake? Verily, verily, I say unto thee, The cock shall not crow, till thou hast denied me thrice.</i>[John 13:36–38]<br><br>Then followed the great discourse found in John 14:<br><br><i>Let not your heart be troubled: ye believe in God, believe also in me.</i><br><br><i>In my father's house are many mansions: if it were not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you....</i><br><br><i>Thomas saith unto him, Lord, we know not whither thou goest; and how can we know the way?</i><br><br><i>Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me....</i><br><br><i>If ye love me, keep my commandments.</i><br><br><i>And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you forever....</i><br><br><i>But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I said unto you.</i>[That seems to be a great promise for the students of Brigham Young University.]<br><br><i>Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid.</i>[John 14:1–2, 5–6, 15–16, 26–27]<br><br>After they had sung a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives, walking down though the Cedron Valley. The disciples were commanded again to love one another: "This is my commandment, That ye love one another as I have loved you.<br><br>"Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends" (John 15:12–13). They were reminded that the world would hate them: "If the world hate you, ye know that it hated me before it hated you" (John 15:18).<br><br>Then began the great intercessory prayer:<br><br><i>And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent....</i><br><br>[With a prayer for unity and sanctification,]<i>That they all may be one; as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in us: that the world may believe that thou hast sent me....</i><br><br><i>I in them, and thou in me, that they may be made perfect in one; and that the world may know that thou hast sent me, and hast loved them, as thou hast loved me.</i>[John 17:3, 21,23]<br><br>Arriving at the first slope on the Mount of Olives, he took Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and began to be sorrowful.<br><br><i>Then saith he unto them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful, even unto death: tarry ye here, and watch with me.</i><br><br><i>And he went a little farther, and fell on his face, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless not as I will, but as thou wilt.</i><br><br><i>And he cometh unto</i>[Peter, James, and John]<i>and findeth them asleep, and saith unto Peter, What could ye not watch with me one hour?</i><br><br><i>Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation: the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.</i><br><br><i>He went away again the second time, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if this cup may not pass from me, except I drink it, thy will be done.</i>[Matthew 26:38–42]<br><br>"And being in an agony he prayed more earnestly: and his sweat was as it were great drops of blood falling down to the ground" (Luke 22:44). This is further described in the Doctrine and Covenants: "Which suffering caused myself, even God, the greatest of all, to tremble because of pain, and to bleed at every pore, and to suffer both body and spirit--and would that I might not drink the bitter cup, and shrink" (D&amp;amp;C 19:18). This suffering was described as "sore" and "exquisite" (see D&amp;amp;C 19:15).<br><br><i>And he came and found them asleep again: for their eyes were heavy.</i><br><br><i>And he left them, and went away again, and prayed the third time, saying the same words.</i><br><br><i>Then cometh he to his disciples, and saith unto them, Sleep on now, and take your rest: behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.</i><br><br><i>Rise, let us be going: behold, he is at hand that doth betray me.</i>[Matthew 26:43–46]<br><br>Judas knew where to find the Savior. He had been there often with the disciples. The Savior could see the band of men and officers coming down through the gate with lanterns and torches and weapons. He could hear the armor clanking, and could perhaps follow every footstep as they came down the hill, crossed over the little brook at the bottom of the Cedron Valley, and entered the Garden.<br><br><i>Jesus therefore, knowing all things that should come upon him, went forth, and said unto them, Whom seek ye?</i><br><br><i>They answered him, Jesus of Nazareth. Jesus saith unto them, I am he. And Judas, also, which betrayed him, stood with them.</i><br><br><i>As soon then as he had said unto them, I am he, they went backward, and fell to the ground.</i>[Without question, they were overpowered by the occasion.]<br><br><i>Then asked he them again, Whom seek ye? And they said, Jesus of Nazareth. Jesus answered, I have told you that I am he: if therefore ye seek me, let those go their way.</i>[John 18:4, 8]<br><br>Impulsive Simon Peter had a sword, which he could not resist using, and he cut off the right ear of the high priest's servant, Malchus.<br><br><i>Then said Jesus unto him, Put up again thy sword into his place: for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword.</i><br><br><i>Thinkest thou that I cannot now pray to my Father, and he shall presently give me more than twelve legions of angels?</i><br><br><i>But how then shall the scriptures be fulfilled, that thus it must be?</i><br><br><i>In that same hour said Jesus to the multitudes, Are ye come out as against a thief with swords and staves for to take me? I sat daily with you teaching in the temple, and ye laid no hold on me.</i>[Matthew 26:52–55]<br><br><i>Then the band and the captain and officers of the Jews took Jesus, and bound him.</i>[John 18:12]<br><br><i>And they all forsook him, and fled.</i><br><br><i>And there followed him a certain young man, having a linen cloth cast about his naked body; and the young men laid hold on him:</i><br><br><i>And he left the linen cloth, and fled from them naked.</i>[Mark 14:50–52]<br><br>Jesus was first questioned by Annas. "Jesus answered him, I spake openly to the world; I ever taught in the synagogue, and in the temple, whither the Jews always resort, and in secret have I said nothing" (John 18:20). The pre-trial examination took place before Caiaphas and the council at the house of Caiaphas, which is on the hill across from the Garden of Gethsemane, and at that time inside the city wall. At that hearing it is recorded, "For many bare false witness against him, but their witness agreed not together"--and that is not uncommon in tribunals (Mark 14:56).<br><br><i>But Jesus held his peace. And the high priest answered and said unto him, I adjure thee by the living God, that thou tell us whether thou be the Christ, the Son of God.</i>[Matthew 26:63]<br><br><i>And Jesus said, I am: and ye shall see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven.</i><br><br><i>Then the high priest rent his clothes, and saith, What need we any further witnesses?</i><br><br><i>Ye have heard the blasphemy: what think ye? And they all condemned him to be guilty of death.</i><br><br><i>And some began to spit on him, and to cover his face, and to buffet him, and to say unto him, Prophesy: and the servants did strike him with the palms of their hands.</i>[Mark 14:62–65]<br><br><i>And when they had blindfolded him, they struck him on the face, and asked him, saying, Prophesy, who is it that smote thee?</i>[Luke 22:64]<br><br>Peter was also at the palace of Caiaphas, the high priest; and one of the maids of Caiaphas noticed him.<br><br><i>And when she saw Peter warming himself, she looked upon him, and said, And thou also wast with Jesus of Nazareth.</i><br><br><i>But he denied, saying, I know not, neither understand I what thou sayest. And he went out into the porch; and the cock crew.</i><br><br><i>And a maid saw him again, and began to say to them that stood by, This is one of them.</i><br><br><i>And he denied it again. And a little after, they that stood by said again to Peter, Surely thou art one of them: for thou art a Galilean, and thy speech agreeth thereto.</i><br><br><i>But he began to curse and to swear, saying. I know not this man of whom ye speak.</i><br><br><i>And the second time the cock crew. And Peter called to mind the word that Jesus said unto him, Before the cock crew twice, thou shalt deny me thrice. And when he thought thereon, he wept.</i>[Mark 14:67–72]<br><br>The formal trial and condemnation is briefly recorded; the charge again was blasphemy.<br><br><i>Art thou the Christ? tell us. And he said unto them, If I tell you, ye will not believe:</i><br><br><i>And if I also ask you, ye will not answer me, nor let me go.</i><br><br><i>Hereafter shall the son of man sit on the right hand of the power of God.</i><br><br><i>Then said they all, Art thou then the Son of God? And he said unto them, Ye say that I am.</i><br><br><i>And they said, What need we any further witness? for we ourselves have heard of his own mouth.</i>[Luke 22:67–71]<br><br>Judas, it is recorded,<br><br><i>Repented himself, and brought again the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders,</i><br><br><i>Saying, I have sinned in that I have betrayed the innocent blood. And they said, What is that to us? see thou to that.</i><br><br><i>And he cast down the pieces of silver in the temple, and departed, and went and hanged himself.</i>[Matthew 27:3–5]<br><br>At the first appearance before Pilate was a different charge, that of sedition.<br><br><i>And Pilate asked him, Art thou the King of the Jews? And he answering said unto him, Thou sayest it.</i>[Mark 15:2]<br><br><i>Then said Pilate to the chief priests and to the people, I find no fault in this man....</i><br><br>[Jesus was then taken before Herod,]<i>And when Herod saw Jesus, he was exceeding glad: for he was desirous to see him of a long season, because he had heard many things of him; and he hoped to have seen some miracle done by him.</i><br><br><i>Then he questioned with him in many words; but he answered him nothing.</i><br><br><i>And the chiefs priests and scribes stood and vehemently accused him.</i><br><br><i>And Herod with his men of war set him at nought, and mocked him, and arrayed him in a gorgeous robe, and sent him again to Pilate.</i><br><br><i>And the same day Pilate and Herod were made friends together: for before they were at enmity between themselves.</i>[Luke 23:4, 8–12]<br><br>At the second appearance before Pilate, Pilate again found him innocent.<br><br><i>I, having examined him before you, have found no fault in this man touching those things whereof ye accuse him:</i><br><br><i>No, nor yet Herod: for I sent you to him; and, lo, nothing worthy of death is done unto him.</i><br><br><i>I will therefore chastise him, and release him.</i>[Luke 23:14–16]<br><br>(The release of one prisoner was necessary before the Passover.) Jesus was then scourged--probably with forty lashed less one--and mocked.<br><br><i>And they stripped him, and put on him a scarlet robe.</i><br><br><i>And when they had platted a crown of thorns, they put it upon his head, and a reed in his right hand: and they bowed the knee before him, and mocked him, saying, Hail, King of the Jews!</i><br><br><i>And they spit upon him, and took the reed, and smote him on the head.</i>[Matthew 27:28–30]<br><br>Pilate pled for Jesus;<br><br><i>And from thenceforth Pilate sought to release him: but the Jews cried out, saying, If thou let this man go, thou art not Caesar's friend: whosoever maketh himself a king speaketh against Caesar.</i>[John 19:12]<br><br><i>When Pilate saw that he could prevail nothing, but that rather a tumult was made, he took water, and washed his hands before the multitude, saying, I am innocent of the blood of this just person: see ye to it.</i><br><br><i>Then answered all the people, and said, His blood be on us, and on our children.</i><br><br><i>Then released he Barabbas unto them: and when he had scourged Jesus, he delivered him to be crucified.</i>[Matthew 27:24–26]<br><br>Simon--A Cyrenian, a country man, the father of Alexander and Rufus--was compelled to carry the cross. By this time the purple had been taken from him and his own clothes put back on, and he was led to Golgotha--"the place of the skull"--to be crucified. Two thieves were crucified with him, one on the right hand and one on the left, and over his head the accusation was written, "This is Jesus the King of the Jews" (Matthew 27:37).<br><br><i>Then said Jesus, Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do.</i>[Luke 23:34]<br><br><i>And they crucified him, and parted his garments, casting lots: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, They parted my garments among them, and upon my vesture did they cast lots.</i><br><br><i>And sitting down they watched him there.</i>[Matthew 27:35–36]<br><br>One of the thieves began to rail upon the Savior, saying,<br><br><i>If thou be Christ, save thyself and us.</i><br><br><i>But the other answering rebuked him, saying, Dost not thou fear God, seeing thou art in the same condemnation?</i><br><br><i>And we indeed justly; for we receive the due reward of our deeds: but this man hath done nothing amiss.</i><br><br><i>And he said unto Jesus, Lord, remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom.</i><br><br><i>And Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, Today shalt thou be with me paradise.</i>[Matthew 27:35–36]<br><br>Jesus then spoke to his mother, and his mother's sister Mary, the wife of Cleophas, and Mary Magdalene--the three Marys. John was there, and he was asked to care for the mother of Jesus. "And from that hour that disciple took her unto his own home" (John 19:27).<br><br>There was darkness from the sixth to the ninth hour. Jesus cried in Aramaic,<br><br><i>Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani? that is to say, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?</i>[Matthew 27:46]<br><br><i>And when Jesus had cried with a loud voice, he said, Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit: and having said thus, he gave up the ghost.</i>[Luke 23:46]<br><br>[And the soldiers who were watching Jesus received something of a testimony:]<i>Now when the centurion, and they that were with him, watching Jesus, saw the earthquake, and those things that were done, they feared greatly, saying, Truly this was the Son of God.</i>[Matthew 27:54]<br><br>John records the piercing of the side of Jesus--how the soldiers, having found that he was already dead, did not break his legs after the custom of inducing death before the Sabbath day. Joseph of Arimathea, also a disciple of Jesus went to Pilate and begged for the body of Jesus (see Matthew 27:57–58). Pilate assented. Nicodemus also came, and they brought about a hundred pounds of myrrh and aloes.<br><br><i>Then took they the body of Jesus, and wound it in linen clothes with the spices, as the manner of the Jews is to bury.</i><br><br><i>Now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden; and in the garden a new sepulchre, wherein was never man yet laid.</i><br><br><i>There laid they Jesus therefore because of the Jews' preparation day; for the sepulchre was nigh at hand.</i>[John 19:40–42]<br><br>Guards were placed at the tomb.<br><br><i>And, behold, there was a great earthquake: for the angel of the Lord descended from heaven, and came and rolled back the stone from the door, and sat upon it.</i><br><br><i>His countenance was like lightening, and his raiment white as snow:</i><br><br><i>And for fear of him the keepers did shake, and became as dead men.</i>[Matthew 28:2–4]<br><br>It was now Sunday; the Sabbath had ended. While it was still dark came Mary Magdalene to the sepulchre, and found the stone rolled away. "Then she runneth, and cometh to Simon Peter; and to the other disciple, whom Jesus loved, and saith unto them, They have taken away the Lord out of the sepulchre, and we know not where they have laid him" (John 20:2). The women came unto the sepulchre and found the body of the Lord Jesus gone.<br><br><i>And it came to pass, as they were much perplexed thereabout, behold, two men stood by them in shining garments:</i><br><br><i>And as they were afraid, and bowed down their faces to the earth, they said unto them, Why seek ye the living among the dead?</i><br><br><i>He is not here, but is risen: remember how he spake unto you when he was yet in Galilee.</i>[Luke 24:4–6]<br><br>The women then hurried and told all these things unto the eleven. They included Mary Magdalene, Joanna, Mary the mother of James, and the other women that were with them (see Luke 24:10). Peter and John came and witnessed the empty tomb and found the linen clothes, and the napkin that was about his head was in a separate place by itself (see John 20:3–7).<br><br>Jesus then appeared to Mary Magdalene.<br><br><i>Jesus saith unto her, Woman, why weepest thou? whom seekest thou? she, supposing him to be the gardener, saith unto him, Sir, if thou have borne him hence, tell me where thou hast laid him, and I will take him away.</i><br><br><i>Jesus saith unto her, Mary. She turned herself, and saith unto him, Rabboni; which is to say, Master.</i><br><br><i>Jesus saith unto her, Touch me not; for I am not yet ascended to my Father: but go to my brethren, and say unto them, I ascend unto my Father, and your Father; and to my God, and your God.</i>[John 20:15–17]<br><br>The chief priests were concerned when those who had been sent to watch reported what had happened. The guards were bribed by the chief priests: "Say ye, His disciples came by night, and stole him away while he slept" (Matthew 28:13). Jesus appeared to the two followers at Emmaus, to Simon Peter, to ten apostles and those with them, and again to all of the apostles-- including Thomas, who had said,<br><br><i>Except I shall see in his hands the print of the nails, and put my finger into the print of the nails, and thrust my hand into his side, I will not believe....</i><br><br><i>Then saith he to Thomas, Reach hither thy finger, and behold my hands: and reach hither thy hand, and thrust it into my side: and be not faithless, but believing.</i><br><br><i>And Thomas answered and said unto him, My Lord and my God.</i><br><br><i>Jesus saith unto him, Thomas, because thou hast seen me, thou hast believed: blessed are they that have not seen, and yet have believed.</i>[John 20:25, 27–29]<br><br>Before the Ascension, Jesus appeared to the eleven in Galilee:<br><br><i>Then the eleven disciples went away into Galilee, into a mountain where Jesus had appointed them.</i><br><br><i>And when they saw him, they worshipped him: but some doubted.</i><br><br><i>And Jesus came and spake unto them, saying, All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth.</i><br><br><i>Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost:</i><br><br><i>Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you.</i>[Matthew 28:16–20]<br><br><i>And, behold, I send the promise of my Father upon you: but tarry ye in the city of Jerusalem, until ye be endowed with power from on high.</i><br><br><i>And he led them out as far as to Bethany, and he lifted up his hands, and blessed them.</i><br><br><i>And it came to pass, while he blessed them, he was parted from them, and carried up into heaven.</i><br><br><i>And they worshipped him, and returned to Jerusalem with great joy:</i><br><br><i>And were continually in the temple, praising and blessing God.</i>[Luke 24:49–53]<br><br>I now wish to set my seal and testimony upon these events, and upon the divine calling of Jesus as our Lord, Savior, and Redeemer, in my capacity as the newest special witness. In my journal for September 28, 1978, it is noted, "Today I was called as a member of the Council of the Twelve Apostles of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. I have prayed to make myself somehow worthy in a small measure and to be qualified, and I hope that I come to this new calling with a pure heart and purged of all personal ambition."<br><br>I will not chronicle further the details concerning this calling because they are so personal and so sacred that the smallest part which one feels cannot be said. I am certain that it is an experience like none other. It is a feeling of terrible aloneness, a feeling of wounds in the heart, a feeling of sweet agony. There are the buffetings of Satan, and the encircling warm comfort of the Spirit of the Master. There are the feelings of crushing burden, self-doubt, and unworthiness--the fleeting feeling of being alone, and then of being reinforced a hundredfold. This special sacred feeling is a sustaining influence, and often a very close companion. I have prayed to be sustained in a work that I have come to appreciate more than life itself.<br><br>I testify that He lives, that He loves us, that this is His holy work. I testify that His are the words of eternal life. I testify that through this Church His work and His glory--to bring about the immortality and eternal life of the faithful and the obedient--is being accomplished.<br><br>I humbly ask the blessings of Almighty God to be upon us all, and especially upon you choice, wonderful young students and missionaries. I pray that you may be blessed in your hearts and in your minds to come to a knowledge of who you are and what your individual work in this life is to be. I pray that in this great University your spiritual batteries may be filled to overflowing, to sustain you all of the days of your life. I pray that you may be courageous and strong in your resolve to be obedient to what you have been taught and to what you know in your hearts to be right; and I invoke these blessings upon you and leave this testimony in the sacred name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>James E.

<br>
This is a tremendous audience--they tell me that between thirteen thousand and fourteen thousand people are here.<br><br>I hope that you will join me in a prayer that while I speak to you I will have the influence of the Spirit with me--and that you will, too, so that the time will not be wasted. We particularly need it because I have chosen to speak to you about the guidance of the Holy Spirit.<br><br>As a prelude to what I shall say, I quote a statement made some time ago by Kurt Waldheim, Secretary-General of the United Nations, in which he said:<br><br><i>I do not wish to conceal . . . my profound concern about the situation which now prevails in the world, a concern which I know to be shared by responsible people everywhere. There is an almost universal sense of apprehension about where the tumultuous developments of our time may take us, a sense of deep anxiety at phenomena which we do not fully understand, let alone control. In all the speculation, much of it depressing, about the shape of the future, there recurs a note of helplessness and fatalism which I find deeply disturbing. This is not a new phenomenon. Dire prophecies have often before been the symptoms of periods of transition and change in human society. What is new is the scope and scale of the problems that give rise to these apprehensions. . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . Today the civilization that is facing such a challenge is not just one small part of mankind--it is mankind as a whole</i>. [Kurt Waldheim, address to United Nations General Assembly, August 30, 1974; emphasis added]<br><br>I assume, without elaborating, that we can all agree that we are living in a day of confusion and bewilderment. As conditions worsen, it becomes more apparent every day that we are on a collision course with disaster. I am persuaded that nothing short of the guidance of the Holy Spirit can bring us through safely. I call attention to our unpleasant situation not because I want you to see and clearly recognize the predicament of the world in which we live.<br><br>Personally I am not disheartened. I am concerned, but I do not live in terror. It has been said that the late President J. Golden Kimball once attended a stake conference session in which the speaker who preceded him occupied nearly all the time with a scorching call to repentance and that when Brother J. Golden followed him, he simply said, "Well, brothers and sisters, I suppose the best thing for all of us to do is to go home and commit suicide."<br><br>Serious as are our times, however, I do not recommend Brother Golden's prescribed course, because I have an unwavering confidence that if we will heed and follow the guidance of His Holy Spirit, the Lord can and will preserve and bring us through safely.<br><br>Our arrival at the brink upon which we now are poised is no surprise to the Lord. He saw disaster coming and provided the way of escape. As long ago as November 1, 1831, He said:<br><br><i>I the Lord, knowing the calamity which should come upon the inhabitants of the earth, called upon my servant Joseph Smith, Jun., and spake unto him from heaven, and gave him commandments;</i><br><br><i>And also gave commandments to others, that they should proclaim these things unto the world.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 1:17–18]<br><br>He had prefaced this statement by explaining the reason for the coming calamity as follows:<br><br><i>They</i>[referring to the inhabitants of the earth]<i>seek not the Lord to establish his righteousness, but every man walketh in his own way, and after the image of his own God, whose image is in the likeness of the world, and whose substance is that of an idol, which waxeth old and shall perish.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 1:16]<br><br>Now the means of escape provided in the commandments, which the Lord had given to Joseph Smith, directing him and "others" to proclaim them unto the world, is "the guidance of the Spirit." In the commandments, the Lord teaches specifically and emphatically that such guidance is a reality and is available to every person, and that if followed it would lead to a solution of all our problems--individual, national, and international. That the enjoyment of it is the birthright of every soul is made plain in the following statements found in the 84th section of the Doctrine and Covenants:<br><br><i>The Spirit</i>[says the Lord]<i>giveth light to every man that cometh into the world; and the Spirit enlighteneth every man through the world, that hearkeneth to the voice of the Spirit.</i><br><br><i>And every one that hearkeneth to the voice of the Spirit cometh unto God, even the Father.</i><br><br><i>And the Father teacheth him of the covenant</i>[that is, the gospel of Jesus Christ]<i>which he has renewed and confirmed upon you, which is confirmed upon you for your sakes, and not for your sakes only, but for the sake of the whole world.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 84:46–48; emphasis added]<br><br>This tremendous truth--that every soul is enlightened by the spirit of Christ and endowed with the ability to respond to its guidance--is perfectly understandable when we remember that mortals are, by inheritance, spirits. They are the natural-born spirit children of God. It is, therefore, natural that there persists in every human soul, form antemortal spirit life, the capacity to instinctively respond to the promptings of the Spirit.<br><br>The truth that "every one that hearkeneth to the voice of the Spirit cometh unto God" is often repeated in the scriptures. In the 93rd section of the Doctrine and Covenants it is stated this way;<br><br><i>Thus saith the Lord: It shall come to pass that every soul who forsaketh his sins and cometh unto me, and calleth on my name, and obeyeth my voice, and keepeth my commandments, shall see my face and know that I am;</i><br><br><i>And that I am the true light that lighteth every man that cometh into the world.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 93:1–2]<br><br>On the other hand, those who reject the guidance of the Spirit and in rebellion yield to the temptations of the evil one become carnal, sensual, and devilish, and move in the opposite direction. Lehi put it this way:<br><br><i>Wherefore, men are free according to the flesh; and all things are given them which are expedient unto man. And they are free to choose liberty and eternal life, through the great mediation of all men, or to choose captivity and death, according to the captivity and power of the devil; for he seeketh that all men might be miserable like unto himself.</i>[2 Nephi 2:27]<br><br>The importance of obtaining and following the guidance of the Spirit cannot be overemphasized, for it is the issue which separates the righteous from the wicked.<br><br><i>Whoso cometh not unto me</i>[says the Lord]<i>is under the bondage of sin. . . .</i><br><br><i>And by this you may know the righteous from the wicked, and that the whole world groaneth under sin and darkness even now.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 84: 51, 53]<br><br>This doctrine is repeated in the scriptures over and over again. For example, in the 93rd section of the Doctrine and Covenants it is written that "every man whose spirit receiveth not the light is under condemnation" (D&amp;amp;C 93:32).<br><br>Jesus told Nicodemus that<br><br><i>God sent . . . his Son into the world . . . that the world through him might be saved.</i><br><br><i>He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.</i><br><br><i>And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil.</i><br><br><i>For every one that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved.</i><br><br><i>But he that doeth truth cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest, that they are wrought in God.</i>[John 3:17–21]<br><br>These teachings clearly establish the fact that the spiritual guidance received by each individual is strictly up to that individual. Each is enlightened by the spirit when he comes into the world, given his free agency, and held responsible for the exercise thereof.<br><br>There seems to be no middle ground. When men reject the guidance of the Holy Spirit, they are left to their own wisdom and to the promptings of evil spirits. As Jesus taught the Nephites, they may "have joy in their works for a season, [but] by and by the end cometh, and they are hewn down and cast into the fire, from whence there is no return" (3 Nephi 27:11). History, the scriptures, and daily experience all confirm this truth. The uninspired wisdom of men will never solve our difficulties.<br><br>The time is short; a world calamity can be avoided only if enough people can be brought to humble themselves and follow the guidance of the Holy Spirit. The revelations of the Lord are explicit as to what will occur if this fails. Among other things, the Lord says that<br><br><i>a desolating scourge shall go forth among the inhabitants of the earth, and shall continue to be poured out from time to time, if they repent not, until the earth is empty, and the inhabitants thereof are consumed away and utterly destroyed by the brightness of my coming.</i><br><br><i>Behold, I tell you these things, even as I also told the people of the destruction of Jerusalem; and my word shall be verified at this time as it hath hitherto been verified.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 5:19–20]<br><br>Whether the world will take the way of escape is not, however, the determining factor for us. we must do all we can to offer the revealed means of escape to them and with all our power entreat them to embrace it. But for our own selves we must take the stand Joshua took when he said to Israel: "Choose you this day whom ye will serve; . . . but as for me and my house, we will serve the Lord" (Joshua 24:15).<br><br>The Holy Spirit brings peace to all who follow it. As surely as it brings lasting peace to a whole people, as it did to the people of Enoch and the Nephites during their "golden era," so it brings peace to one righteous man though he stand alone in a world of wickedness.<br><br>Paul, awaiting martyrdom in a prison cell, could write to his beloved Timothy:<br><br><i>I am now ready to be offered, and the time of my departure is at hand.</i><br><br><i>I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith:</i><br><br><i>Henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give me at that day: and not to me only, but unto all them also that love his appearing</i>. [2 Timothy 4:6–8]<br><br>Mormon, leading a rebellious, hardened, calloused people with whom the Spirit of the Lord had cased to strive, wrote this to his son Moroni:<br><br><i>And now, my beloved son, notwithstanding their hardness</i>[he was talking about the hardness of the spirits of the Lamanites and Nephites],<i>let us labor diligently; for if we should cease to labor, we should be brought under condemnation; for we have a labor to perform whilst in this tabernacle of clay, that we may conquer the enemy of all righteousness and rest our souls in the kingdom of God.</i>[Moroni 9:6]<br><br>The Prophet Joseph on his way to Carthage could say: "Do not be alarmed, brethren, for they [a company of armed militia] cannot do more to you than the enemies of truth did to the ancient Saints--they can only kill the body." A little later he added: "I am going like a lamb to the slaughter, but I am as calm as a summer's morning. I have a conscience void of offense toward God and toward all men." (Joseph Smith, History of the Church 6:554–55.)<br><br>There is no way to discourage or defeat a people or a person who follows the guidance of the Holy Spirit. They who do so discover the meaning of the Savior's words: "Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid." (John 14:27.)<br><br>In the 9th section of the Doctrine and Covenants is recorded a test by which one may be assured that he has the guidance of the Spirit. I recommend that we make the use of it a continuing practice.<br><br>"You must study it our in your mind," said the Lord to Oliver Cowdery, with respect to the translation from the gold plates. "Then you must ask me if it be right [if you have made the right decision], and if it is right I will cause that your bosom shall burn within you; therefore, you shall feel that it is right" (D&amp;amp;C 9:8). Every person can put that formula to the test and learn for himself the rightness or wrongness of his decisions.<br><br>Remember that "the Spirit giveth light to every man that cometh into the world" (D&amp;amp;C 84:46). Every man is born with the light of Christ in his soul, and it is only when he chooses to reject that light which would guide him through the world that he becomes carnal and sensual and devilish. All of the scriptures agree on this point. Not only do I want you to remember that "the Spirit giveth light to every man that cometh into the world," but remember also that "the Spirit enlighteneth every man through the world, that hearkeneth to the voice of the Spirit," and that "every one that hearkeneth to the voice of the Spirit cometh unto God, even the Father" (D&amp;amp;C 84:46–47). Remember also that the Lord has said:<br><br><i>It shall come to pass that every soul who forsaketh his sins and cometh unto me, and calleth on my name, and obeyeth my voice, and keepeth my commandments, shall see my face and know that I am;</i><br><br><i>And that I am the true light that lighteth every man that cometh into the world.</i><br><br>If you want to obtain and keep the guidance of the Spirit, you can do so by following this simple four-point program.<br><br>First:<i>Pray</i>. Pray diligently. Pray with each other. Pray in public in the proper places, but never forget the counsel of the Savior: "When thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut the door, pray to thy Father which is in secret; and thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly" (Matthew 6:6).<br><br>Learn to talk to the Lord; call upon his name in great faith and confidence.<br><br>Second:<i>Study and learn the gospel</i>.<br><br>Third:<i>Live righteously</i>; repent of your sins by confessing them and forsaking them. Then conform to the teachings of the gospel.<br><br>Fourth:<i>Give service in the Church</i>.<br><br>If you will do these things, you will get the guidance of the Holy Spirit and you will go through this world successfully, regardless of what the people of the world say or do.<br><br>In conclusion, I want to quote a few statements from the revelation from which our text, "Guidance of the Holy Spirit," was taken. The first part of this revelation is a persuasive plea by the Lord to His people to come unto Him while there is yet time. Much of the rest of the revelation is a restatement by the Lord of what He said to His disciples concerning the signs of His coming in the day when He shall come in glory in the clouds of heaven. He gave these statements to the apostles in reply to their question as to the signs of His second coming. And in this revelation He restated them to the Prophet Joseph Smith. As one of the signs, "a light shall break forth among them that sit in darkness, and it shall be the fullness of my gospel." Now that light has broken forth; we know that--and that is one sign of the approach of the coming of Christ.<br><br>"But they receive it not;" said the Lord, "for they perceive not the light, and they turn their hearts from me because of the precepts of men." (D&amp;amp;C 45:28–29.)<br><br>Another sign is that there should be "wars and rumors of wars, . . . . the whole earth [should] be in commotion." As a consequence of an<br><br><i>overflowing scourge . . . a desolating sickness shall cover the land.</i><br><br><i>. . . Among the wicked, men shall lift up their voice and curse God and die.</i><br><br><i>. . .

And, behold, I will come; and they shall see me in the clouds of heaven, clothed with power and great glory; with all the holy angels; and he that watches not for me shall be cut off. . . .</i><br><br><i>Then shall the arm of the Lord fall upon the nations. . . .</i><br><br><i>And calamity shall cover the mocker, and the scorner shall be consumed; and they that have watched for iniquity shall be hewn down and cast into the fire. . . .</i><br><br><i>And at that day, when I shall come in my glory, shall the parable be fulfilled which I spake concerning the ten virgins.</i><br><br>[And this is the text:]<i>For they that are wise and have received the truth, and have taken the</i>Holy Spirit for their guide, and have not been deceived--<i>verily I say unto you, they shall not be hewn down and cast into fire, but shall abide the day.</i><br><br><i>And the earth shall be given unto them for an inheritance; and they shall multiply and wax strong, and their children shall grow up without sin unto salvation.</i><br><br><i>For the Lord shall be in their midst, and his glory shall be upon them, and he will be their king and their lawgiver.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 45:26, 31–33, 39, 44, 47, 50, 56–59; emphasis added]<br><br>You see, to be earnest in what we do is not enough: We have to take the Holy Spirit for our guide and not be deceived.<br><br>God bless us, my young brothers and sisters, that we may have the good sense to take the Holy Spirit as our guide and thereby accomplish the purpose and obtain the reward for which this life was given to us. This I humbly pray, and leave my blessings with you, in the name of Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Marion G.

<h1>Not Fear His Coming - Gordon B. Hinckley - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
As I look at this very large congregation, I know how those players from Pennsylvania felt yesterday. I am seized by something of the same paralysis which evidently troubled them. They made a fairly good comeback, but it was too late; and that is what happens to many of us. We finally repent, but it is very difficult to catch up before the gun is fired.<br><br>Everyone who stands at this pulpit on such an occasion as this apparently has the same feeling--a feeling of wonder and an appreciation and a reassurance. It is a tremendously impressive thing to know that there are so many of your kind and that the generations of the Church are growing in strength and faith and knowledge of the things of God.<br><br>Great and serious is the responsibility of speaking to you. I pray that I may be directed by the Holy Spirit.<br><br>At the outset, and by way of introduction to what I may say later--and even at the risk of appearing a little negative--I wish to indulge a personal privilege. Before this large audience I wish to set the record straight on some statements mistakenly attributed to me.<br><br>Two or three weeks ago a man handed me a typewritten page or two and asked, "Did you say the things that you are reported in this paper to have said?" I was in a hurry; I quickly read the statement and responded, "Of course not--I know better than that." I paid no further attention until more inquiries began to come through the mail from Provo, Rexburg, and other places. Then I knew that I had better make an effort to stop this fabrication which, because of its sensationalism, is evidently being copied and given wide circulation.<br><br>It alleges that I recently participated in a missionary conference in South Africa and that, in a question-and-answer period, I was asked concerning the second coming of the Savior. I am reported to have said that he would come on the morning of the Sabbath and that he would come on his birthday. From these alleged premises the originator of this document had consulted a hundred-year calendar and had concluded with some measure of certainty that the Lord would come on April 6, 1986.<br><br>The fact is that I was in South Africa with President Kimball for an area conference last fall. The further fact is that a meeting was held with missionaries in that area at which the mission president, Elder Neal Maxwell, President Kimball, and I spoke. But there was no question-and-answer period, nor was there any discussion of the second coming of the Savior. The talks given were taped, and I have a transcript of them.<br><br>I recall hearing President Heber J. Grant say, many years ago, that falsehood could march around the world while truth was pulling on its boots. I am beginning to understand that. I assume that no one in the Church would think that a member of the Council of the Twelve would make such statements as these attributed to me. Furthermore, should any such idea have come into my mind, it would not have stood unchallenged with the President of the Church seated immediately behind me. The fact is that the whole thing is a fabrication. Why anyone would indulge in this kind of speculation I cannot understand. As Paul advised Timothy, "Foolish and unlearned questions avoid, knowing that they do gender strifes" (2 Timothy 2:23).<br><br>Of course I do not know when the Savior will come. He himself said:<br><br><i>O that day and hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels of heaven, but my Father only.</i><br><br><i>But as the days of Noah were, so shall also the coming of the Son of man be....</i><br><br><i>Watch therefore: for ye know not what hour your Lord doth come.</i><br><br><i>But know this, that if the Goodman of the house had known in what watch the thief would come, he would have watched, and would not have suffered his house to be broken up.</i><br><br><i>Therefore be ye also ready: for in such an hour as ye think not the Son of man cometh.</i>[Matthew 24:36–37, 42–44]<br><br>If anyone were to ask me the day and the hour of the Second Coming, I could only answer that I do not know. But while neither I nor any other man knows when He will come, there are some things that I do know--and that knowledge comes from the scriptures, and the testimony of its truth comes by the power of the Holy Ghost. Although I do not know the time, I look forward to the Lord's coming.<br><br>Recently, having a free evening, I watched on television a series of news programs. Each dealt with conflict and sorrow and oppression in the world. There was war between Vietnam and China and war in Yemen; there was terrible tension in Iran. Those descendants of Abraham, the Israelis and the Arabs, were trading epithets over the peace treaty due to be signed tomorrow. There were charges of corruption in our own land. There was an account of 500,000 children lost in the big cities of America. Many of these are girls, some of them very young, who turn to prostitution and are caught in a trap from which they cannot escape. There were accounts of brutality and terrible perversions.<br><br>Turning off the set, I walked past the piano in the living room and picked up the hymn book. There I read these choice words, written long ago by Parley P. Pratt, which echo my own feelings:<br><br><i>Come, O thou King of kings!</i><br><i>We've waited long for thee,</i><br><i>With healing in thy wings</i><br><i>To set thy people free.</i><br><i>Come, thou desire of nations, come;</i><br><i>Let Israel now be gathered home.</i><br><br><i>Come, make an end to sin</i><br><i>And cleanse the earth by fire,</i><br><i>And righteousness bring in,</i><br><i>That Saints may tune the lyre</i><br><i>With songs of joy, a happier strain,</i><br><i>To welcome in thy peaceful reign.</i><br>["Come, O Thou King of Kings,"<i>Hymns,</i>no.20]<br><br>Among the things I know and of which I am sure is the fact that he will come again. I hope that all of you have seen the beautiful and impressive mural on the east wall of the lobby of the Church Office Building in which isportrayed the resurrected Lord giving final instruction to eleven of his apostles. At that time he charged them concerning their future responsibility to take the gospel to every nation, kindred, tongue, and people.<br><br><i>And when he had spoken these things, while they beheld, he was taken up; and a cloud received him out of their sight.</i><br><br><i>And while they looked steadfastly toward heaven as he went up, behold, two men stood by them in white apparel;</i><br><br><i>Which also said, Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into heaven? this same Jesus, which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as ye have seen him go.</i>[Acts 1:9–11]<br><br>I know likewise that when he shall come the second time he shall come in glory, in contrast with the way he came in the meridian of time. The first time, he who had been the great Jehovah, the Creator of the earth and the God who spoke to the prophets of old, condescended to come as a babe born in a manger in Bethlehem of Judea. He walked the dusty roads of Palestine, "a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief" (Isaiah 53:3). He yielded himself into the hands of wicked men and was crucified on Golgotha's hill.<br><br>Now, in this dispensation, the Lord has declared that<br><br><i>The time is soon at hand that I shall come in a cloud with power and great glory.</i><br><br><i>And it shall be a great day at the time of my coming, for all nations shall tremble.</i><br><br><i>But before that great day shall come, the sun shall be darkened and the moon be turned into blood; and the stars shall refuse their shining, and some shall fall, and the great destructions await the wicked.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 34:7–9]<br><br>There is a phrase in that quotation that intrigues me: "All nations shall tremble." Man in his arrogance and the great nations in their vaunted power think themselves invincible, but their leaders have not read enough of history.<br><br>More than forty years ago I was a missionary in the British Isles. That was the day of the Empire when it could truthfully be said that the sun never set on British soil, and when the Union Jack waved over a fourth of the world. Britain had a poet in those days who wrote "The Recessional," for which he was severely criticized. But the words of Rudyard Kipling proved prophetic. I have been in many of those lands where once the British Tommies maintained the garrisons while the flag of Britain floated over the nations of New Zealand, Australia, Egypt, India, South Africa, to name afew. In those days the peace of the world was Pax Britannica. Now the Empire is gone; its parts are independent nations, and the British lion that roared so loudly is old and sick and weak.<br><br>Listen to Kipling's words:<br><br><i>Far-called, our navies melt away,</i><br><i>On dune and headland sinks the fire;</i><br><i>Lo, all our pomp of yesterday</i><br><i>Is one with Nineveh and Tyre!</i><br><i>Judge of the nations, spare us yet,</i><br><i>Lest we forget, lest we forget.</i><br>["God of Our Fathers, Known of Old,"<i>Hymns,</i>nos. 76, 77]<br><br>It is easy for me to believe that the nations shall tremble when the Son of God comes again to claim his kingdom, for when that day arrives<br><br><i>the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then shall He sit upon the throne of glory:</i><br><br><i>And before him shall be gathered all nations: and he shall separate them one from another, as a shepherd divideth his sheep from the goats</i>. [Matthew 25:31–32]<br><br>There will be a judgment not only of the nations but also of the people. "Behold," said the Lord,<br><br><i>now it is called today until the coming of the Son of man, and verily it is a day of sacrifice, and a day for the tithing of my people; for he that is tithed shall not be burned at his coming.</i><br><br><i>For after today cometh the burning ...</i>[when]<i>all the proud and they that do wickedly shall be as stubble; and I will burn them up, for I am the Lord of Hosts; and I will not spare any that remain in Babylon.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 64:23–24]<br><br>Some years ago one of our brethren spoke of the payment of tithing as "fire insurance"; that statement evoked laughter. Nonetheless, the word of the Lord is clear that those who do not keep the commandments and observe the laws of God shall be burned at the time of his coming. For that shall be a day of judgment and a day of sifting, a day of separating the good from the evil. I would venture a personal opinion that no event has occurred in all the history of the earth as dreadful as will be the day of the Second Coming--no event as fraught with the destructive forces of nature, as consequential for the nations of the earth, as terrible for the wicked, or as wonderful for the righteous.<br><br>It will be a time of great and terrible fears, of cataclysmic upheavals of nature, of weeping and wailing, of repentance too late, and of crying out unto the Lord for mercy. But for those who in that judgment are found acceptable, it will be a day for thanksgiving, for the Lord shall come with his angels, and the apostles who were with him in Jerusalem, and those who have been resurrected. Further, the graves of the righteous will be opened and they shall come forth. Then will begin the great Millennium, a period of a thousand years when Satan shall be bound and the Lord shall reign over his people. Can you imagine the wonder and the beauty of that era when the adversary shall not have influence? Think of his pull upon you now and reflect on the peace of that time when you will be free from such influence. There will be quiet and goodness where now there is contention and evil.<br><br>I know that you are familiar with all of this and with much more of that which is set forth in the scripture, but I have felt to repeat it tonight when we are gathered in this fireside service as a reminder to each of us of the faith and the certainty that we have of these coming events. To know when they will come would take from us much of the self-discipline needed to walk daily in obedience to the principles of the gospel.<br><br>Most of us seldom think of these millennial events, and perhaps it is well thus. Certainly there is no point in speculating concerning the day and the hour. Let us rather live each day so that if the Lord does come while we are yet upon the earth we shall be worthy of that change which will occur as in the twinkling of an eye and under which we shall be changed from mortal to immortal beings. And if we should die before he comes, then--if our lives have conformed to his teachings--we shall arise in that resurrection morning and be partakers of the marvelous experiences designed for those who shall live and work with the Savior in that promised Millennium. We need not fear the day of his coming; the very purpose of the Church is to provide the incentive and the opportunity for us to conduct our lives in such a way that those who are members of the kingdom of God will become members of the kingdom of heaven when he establishes that kingdom on the earth. Very quickly, by way of conclusion, may I suggest just two or three things, which if observed, will assist.<br><br>The prophet Micah declared: "He hath showed thee, O man, what is good; and what doth the Lord require of thee, but to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God?" (Micah 6:8). There is enough for a long sermon in that one injunction. Let me touch on one point only: "To love mercy." As an example, may I read a paragraph from a letter I received only last week from a young woman who is engaged in this kind of activity as president of the Relief Society.<br><br><i>Yesterday</i>[she writes]<i>I spent the better part of the day picking up welfare groceries and delivering them. One of the two cases I called on was tragic. She is a woman who, years ago, was in a fire and her head was badly injured. For years she has undergone constructive surgery and has a number of pins holding her scalp together. She is divorced, and in order to support herself and her four-year-old girl, she works at anything and everything she can find, doing a job here and a job there, until she is through surgery and can return to school to complete her training as a dietician. She has no car and relies solely on her bicycle for transportation in this great and busy city. She has ridden that bike all winter, with her little girl on the back, sometimes going as many as thirty miles in a day in order to get to and from a small job.</i><br><br><i>A week ago she hit a patch of ice while riding, fell, struck her head, and suffered a concussion. She refused to go to the hospital because she had no money to pay, so she remained in her apartment, suffering from pain until her sister found her and got medical help. Her mother was able to assist her just a little. Her home teacher happened to call and discovered her plight. When I, as the Relief Society president, called her, I discovered she had no food in the house, no medication for her diabetes, and not a cent of money. So yesterday I went to deliver the groceries and take her some medication. What an opportunity to serve one of those so desperately in need!</i><br><br>Love mercy; walk in obedience to the commandment of the Lord by imparting of your substance for the work of this kingdom. Now let me share with you a testimony I heard only last Sunday, spoken by a man once poor in his childhood and now prosperous in his old age. He stood before the congregation and said,<br><br><i>When I was a boy, on a summer's day I would lie out in the lucerne patch and chew on twigs and look up at the sky and wonder where the windows of heaven were that my parents had spoken of. I couldn't see them in the clouds, and I thought they must be somewhere in the blue. I wondered how the windows could be opened so I could get a Boy Scout uniform and a pony and a bicycle. I never got these things, but I have come to see how the windows of heaven are opened as I have become the beneficiary of the kindness of good and generous neighbors and friends in this ward in which we live.</i><br><br>Finally, pertaining to this general subject, let me read a few more words of revelation. I read to you young people a few words of commandment, and a few more words of promise. The commandments: "Let virtue garnish thy thoughts unceasingly." The promise: "Then shall thy confidence wax strong in the presence of God." (D&amp;amp;C 121:45.) I have thought of that statement a great deal. It has been my privilege to meet a number of presidents of the United States and leaders, rulers, and governors in other lands, and it is a reassuring feeling to be able to stand in the presence of such men with confidence. As I have thought of that, I have also thought how marvelous it will be if someday I might stand with confidence in the presence of God.<br><br>"The Holy Ghost shall be thy constant companion," the Lord continues in this statement, "and thy scepter an unchanging scepter of righteousness and truth; and thy dominion shall be an everlasting dominion, and without compulsory means it shall flow unto thee forever and ever" (D&amp;amp;C 121:46)--including, I should like to add parenthetically, that time when the Lord comes at the great day of sifting and separation.<br><br>My brothers and sisters, of these things I testify, relying on the revealed word of the Lord; and I humbly pray with sincere desire that each of us may so live our lives here and now that we may have neither fear nor worry concerning that great and dreadful day of his coming. God bless us in our search for truth and peace and strength, I humbly pray in the name of Him who shall surely come at a time we know not, but whose coming shall be as certain as the coming of the sun over this valley in the morning--in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Gordon B.

<h1>el Has Been Restored - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
President Oaks and my dear brethren and sisters, since the beginning of this meeting I have been feeling what an honor it is to participate in the award that was just given to Dr. Harvey Fletcher. Over most of the years of my life, he has been one of the living legends about which we have heard; and today, for the first time, I had the privilege of making his acquaintance. I would like to say that Dr. Fletcher is undoubtedly one of the great scientists of the world, and certainly one of the greatest among the members of the Church.<br><br>President Oaks neglected--maybe it did not get on the record--to mention the fact that I also attended Brigham Young University, so I feel that I belong here just as much as any of the rest of you. Maybe I did not achieve as Dr. Fletcher did in his first science course, but I hope that someway or another I can be a participant with you.<br><br>I talked yesterday with my dentist, who said, "Imagine that Marriott Center where you're going to speak. All we had was the George Albert Smith Fieldhouse when I attended BYU."<br><br>And I asked, "Have you ever heard of College Hall?" I do not suppose many of you have either. Probably Dr. Fletcher can remember well before College Hall.<br><br>It was suggested--I suppose others have thought of it before--that the title for my remarks today, in view of your coming examinations, should be, "If ye are prepared, ye shall not fear" (see D&amp;amp;C 38:30). I have, in fact, thought to speak about something connected with the opening hymn, "Oh, How Lovely Was the Morning." I want to say something about the restoration of the gospel.<br><br>In the Church we have really only one basic subject to talk about. Everything hinges on the fact that the gospel has been restored. I know that all of us understand about the Restoration, but we do not always remember all of its implications. This has to be the greatest news event since the resurrection of Jesus Christ. It is more important by far than world wars or atom bombs. It is more far-reaching than space flight or men on Mars. There is something in it that the whole world must hear.<br><br>As we proclaim and teach and remind both members and those not in the Church of this message, we wonder why people do not pay more attention if it is all that important--perhaps we do not tell it right. One good reason, of course, why people do not pay attention is that most of the people in the world have not heard about it yet. Very few of those not of the Church understand about the Restoration, for various reasons. First of all, they are probably not too interested; second, the Restoration offends their traditions; third, obedience to the gospel would upset their plans and interests. And so, most people act as if they would rather that it had not happened. I spoke of the Restoration one day to a minister of another faith, and answered all his questions in a friendly discussion; and after he had taken a day or two to reflect on what I had told him, he told me with considerable warmth, "I think that what you teach is a very dangerous heresy." Possibly I had done a poor job of explaining, but, you see, he really did not want the gospel to be restored.<br><br>Some of the members of the Church do not pay much attention either. Their reasons may be that the Church requires too much of their time and effort, or that keeping the commandments would spoil their lifestyle. Many people simply do not want to be that deeply involved or to make firm commitments.<br><br>Still, as we all know, it really has happened and it is true. Such earthshaking events come so rarely that people tend to quickly forget the reality of them. A most unusual demonstration of this attitude is found in the book of Third Nephi. The prophecy had been given that the birth of the Savior would be signified by a period of a day, a night, and a day without darkness; and, as the time approached, those who did not believe and who did not want it to happen began to threaten those who were watching for the sign. You can imagine the feelings of the believers as they waited and waited and wondered if perhaps it would not come after all. But it came. Everything predicted in relation to the Savior will come and has to come.<br><br>Then, at the time of the crucifixion of the Savior, nearly every one of those who had heard about it on the American continent had forgotten the first wonderful sign of the day and the night and the day, and they ignored the threat of the other and more terrible sign that had been predicted. Certainly, they thought, it would not really happen; such things do not happen in this world, you know. But it happened. "And it came to pas in the thirty and fourth year, in the first month, on the fourth day of the month, there arose a great storm, such an one as never had been known in all the land" (3 Nephi 8:5). Before the trouble was over, it did not matter anymore about the warning; those who had not listened were gone.<br><br>The implications for us of the restoration of the gospel are as follows: first, we can really know that God lives; second, the gospel will guide us to a richer, happier, more purposeful life on earth; third, we can know that God watches over us; and fourth, we have assurances that we will live again after death and renew our association with those loved ones we have lost. We have received the promise of a life so rich and happy that its wonders have only been hinted at. Let me give you this example from the 76<sup>th</sup>section of the Doctrine and Covenants:<br><br><i>They are they into whose hands the Father has given all things--</i><br><br><i>They are they who are priests and kings, who have received of his fullness, and of his glory;</i><br><br><i>And are priests of the Most High, . . .</i><br><br><i>Wherefore, all things are theirs, whether . . . things present, or things to come. . . .</i><br><br><i>These shall dwell in the presence of God and his Christ forever and ever.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 76:55–57, 59, 62]<br><br>Maybe there are some people who do not want that to happen either.<br><br>We are expected to spread the news. We must see to it that other people understand and believe; our own blessings depend on how well we take the gospel to the world. Everybody must hear about it. As the Lord said in his preface to the Book of Commandments, or the Doctrine and Covenants:<br><br><i>For verily the voice of the Lord is unto all men, and there is none to escape; and there is no eye that shall not see, neither ear that shall not hear, neither heart that shall not be penetrated.</i><br><br><i>And the rebellious shall be pierced with much sorrow; for their iniquities shall be spoken upon the housetops, and their secret acts shall be revealed.</i><br><br><i>And the voice of warning shall be unto all people, by the mouths of my disciples, whom I have chosen in these last days.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 1:2–4]<br><br>All of us here in the Church are the disciples spoken of, and we ought to improve our method for spreading the gospel. Most of us could be better examples and make the news more easily received. We really do not need to learn better ways of teaching, and we must increase our ability to announce the news.<br><br>Here are some examples of what the gospel really means to people on the earth. I would like to speak about some of this without making reference to the written text, but by drawing upon your recollection. You may, for example, remember something of the story of Adam and Eve when they were cast out of the Garden of Eden and, in that sad circumstance, wondered what would become of them. You can imagine that they had enjoyed the fullness of the blessings of a rich and wonderful life in the actual presence of their Father in Heaven; and now, because of transgression, they were cast out and had nowhere to go.<br><br>They were told to go to work and to do what they had to do, and doggedly they went about their task. If you read carefully in the fifth chapter of the book of Moses you will see that they went through a long trial. They began to have children--not the children you hear about, Cain and Abel and Seth, but other children before those. These children grew up, and they began to pair off and have children and multiply in the land. So Adam and Eve were now grandparents, and they were still struggling in an almost hopeless circumstance. "What are we here for now? We've lost it all. Where can we go?"<br><br>One day, as Adam was out offering a sacrifice, which he did because he had been told to, an angel of the Lord appeared to him and asked, "Adam, what are you doing?"<br><br>And Adam replied, "I'm offering a sacrifice unto the Lord."<br><br>"Why are you doing that, Adam?"<br><br>[He said,]<i>I know not, save the Lord commanded me.</i><br><br><i>And the angel spake, saying: This thing is a similitude of the sacrifice of the Only Begotten of the Father. . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . And thou shalt repent and call upon God in the name of the Son forevermore.</i>[Moses 5:6–8]<br><br>And from that moment the Holy Ghost, or the Spirit of God, fell upon Adam, and a revelation was given to him as to the purpose of life and the purpose of the Son of God in bringing him a redemption whereby he really could, along with his wife, return to that blessed circumstance that he had lost. Imagine the joy with which he returned and told his wife, and how she rejoiced as she said, "I see it all now. There was a purpose in it. Thanks even for our transgression because it brought about the things that we now can enjoy as the greatest gifts in life." (See Moses 5:1–11.)<br><br>There are other stories. My wife happens to be related to the family of Jacob Hamblin, and those who have worked with me over the years know that I have a particular feeling for this man's story. His name, I suppose, is known to most members of the Church, and he had a particular ability to express his feelings and the motivating power of faith that touched his life. I would like to rehearse just a little of what the gospel meant to him.<br><br>He said that he first heard of the gospel when he was living on the frontiers of Wisconsin. He heard through a friend or a neighbor that there were preachers in the area who were proclaiming that the gospel had been restored and that it was the privilege of every man to find out for himself through the Spirit if it was true. Jacob did not understand much about what that meant, but the feeling so fired his mind that he could hardly wait to hear this news that the gospel had been restored. He found the missionaries holding a meeting in a house. He had arrived after the meeting had begun, but as he listened to the message, he felt, "This is what I've been searching for, what I need more than anything in life. How can I know if it's true?"<br><br>As if he had asked the question aloud, the elder stood up again and said, "If there's anyone here who would like to know the truth of what we have just told you, we promise you that if you'll be baptized by immersion and receive the laying on of hands for the gift of the Holy Ghost the Lord will reveal it to you."<br><br>And Jacob said, "That's good enough for me. I'll do that, even though it costs the sacrifice of everything I have."<br><br>He went home and told his wife. She said, "Oh, yes, that's just what it will cost you. I won't live with you any more if you join that church."<br><br>His father and his brother said, "Jacob, what's the matter with you? Don't you know that those are the Mormons? It's one thing to get religion, but why did you have to choose the worst one there is?"<br><br>But he still had that independence of spirit and, having made arrangements to be baptized, he proceeded to meet the elders. He later said that on his way to be baptized he began to reflect on what the sacrifice would mean, and it seemed to him almost too much to bear; he was soon on the point of turning back. (That is a good thing for missionaries to remember, that this wavering happens to most people as they are about to join the Church.) but, he said, as he was about to turn back, he felt the presence of someone near him. He realized that it was his dead grandfather, and he heard a voice say, "Go forward, my son. You cannot comprehend the joy that will come into your life as a consequence of what you are about to do today." Thus fortified, he went forward and met the elders and was baptized into the Church.<br><br>As the elders confirmed him a member of the Church, one of them said, "The spirits in prison have greatly rejoiced over what you have done." Jacob did not understand that, but he told them of his experience with his grandfather on the way. They then explained to him the great work of salvation for the dead, and suddenly he knew why he had joined the Church--not just to satisfy his own interest and curiosity, but to become an instrument in the hand of the Lord to bring the same joy and privilege and blessing to the lives of many other people.<br><br>He returned and told his family what he had done. Evidently they said worse things than they had said before, but now, he said, "I just laughed at them and I told my father, 'Never mind; within two years I'll baptize you in the Church, too.'"<br><br>Well, they all followed him, and they went through the turmoils and the trials of the days of Nauvoo. After the death of the Prophet and the exodus, they followed him across Iowa and across the plains. In the process his wife did leave him, and his mother died along the way. The rest of the family settled in Tooele, and then were called to go to what must have seemed the very end of the earth down in southern Utah, at that time a desolate desert inhabited by what Jacob thought were the most lowly people he had ever seen on the face of the earth. While they were living there, his father died in their little hut, and just before his death he called Jacob to him and said something like this: "Jacob, you know that you have been as a Joseph to your family. Like Joseph who was sold into Egypt, you have brought salvation to your family. Thanks for your persistence and faithfulness. Thanks, Jacob, for all these blessings."<br><br>Does that sound a little strange to you? For what blessing could he possibly be thankful, down there in the desert dying under miserable circumstances? "Thanks for all these blessings, Jacob." Well, he knew of what he talked. He thought of the gospel that had been restored, and he said, "There's no use to pray for me that I stay here longer. I know the gospel. It's time for me to go where I'll be happier. Thanks for those great blessings."<br><br>There is a story about Abraham--there are many stories, I guess, about Abraham, but if you read this one in the first chapter of the book of Abraham, you will recognize that he did not always know the gospel and that it came to him with great impact and power. He said, in effect, "I knew that men before me had possessed gifts and powers that I didn't have, and so I found it necessary to change my place of residence. I decided to move from Ur in Chaldea up to Haran [which is now in Turkey], because when I get up there they have promised me a good job--I'll make fifty thousand dollars a year, I'll get a beautiful home, they'll give me a car and a boat and a camper and three months' vacation and all the medical benefits . . "--I guess some of you have not read that part. He actually said it a little bit differently. (See Abraham 1:1–2.)<br><br>Some of you, in a few days or weeks, may move from Provo to Chicago or Denver or Cleveland, and you will have in mind some of those things--and properly so, perhaps--such as the car, the job, the boat, and some of the other nice things of life. What Abraham really said was:<br><br>[Knowing about those blessings that others have had before me,]<i>I sought for the blessings of the fathers, and the right whereunto I should be ordained to administer the same; having been myself a follower of righteousness, desiring also to be one who possessed great knowledge . . . and to be a father of many nations, a prince of peace.</i>[Abraham 1:2]<br><br>You can see that Abraham was not content to play for those little things. He wanted to own the whole kingdom; that is what he was after. But he did not get it all at once. He knew it would take a little time--fifty, sixty, or eighty years--I am not sure just how long it took him. But it says further, in Hebrews:<br><br><i>By faith Abraham, when he was called to go out into a place which he should after receive for an inheritance, obeyed. . . .</i><br><br><i>By faith he sojourned in the land of promise, as in a strange country. . . .</i><br><br><i>For he looked for a city which hath foundations, whose builder and maker is God. . . .</i><br><br><i>[He] died in faith, not having received [yet] the promises, but having seen them afar off, and [was] persuaded of them, and embraced them, and confessed that[he was a stranger and a pilgrim upon] the earth.</i>[Hebrews 11:8–10, 13]<br><br>Now what is it like in the world among people who do not have the gospel? Let me read a recent article.<br><br><i>If any skeptics remain, let them go anywhere in the city and stop and look around. For example, on the back road leading to the University, one can see regally attired equestrians on one side, while on the other motorcycles, dune buggies, and all-terrain vehicles skitter across the hills like jackrabbits. Near the institute, on a bluff overlooking the golf course--vroom!--a single engine plane jounces across a field and takes off with a glider in tow. Even more of a spectacle are the hang gliders soaring off the same cliff as the sailplanes, while far below, as far as the eye can see, surfboarders ride the rollers and strings of joggers take in the stunning scenery, which includes a group of nudists playing soccer. There is no escaping the sports scene. Plunge into the translucent waters off the point and there seem to be as many skin and scuba divers as fish. On weekends when the Pro teams are not at home the stadium is shared by drag-strippers and wheelchair races. The catalogue goes on and on: stock-car races, go-karting, sky diving, ballooning, 21 sports-car clubs, 350 yacht races, 1,500 bowling leagues. Living here is like being on an eternal vacation.</i>["Sports Town,"<i>Sports Illustrated,</i>December 25, 1978, p. 50]<br><br>Contrary to what you may think, I am not opposed to recreation; but you get the feeling out of that article that the perspective of life is gone, and that some people seem to be literally hell-bent for fun. If the article had been talking about Utah it probably would have included the skiing, and the hunting with campers and four-wheel-drive vehicles, and other things for which we do not always have all that much time. Life need not be less exciting when you are a faithful member of the Church, but it is not what you see in the movies and on television.<br><br>Members of the Church are a called people. We were sent here for a purpose; we are committed and dedicated. You who have served as missionaries are slowly finding out that the mission term was not for just two years, as you thought it was. You are enlisted "for the duration." You may not all understand that phrase; but back in the years of the Second World War, when we were being called up and enlisted, they did not tell us when we would get out. They just said, "For the duration--and six months." That is how long you are enlisted in the gospel. We can act like the people of the world if we want to, taking the toys and the cake and the candy, but we will miss out on the really great prize. Remember, "He that findeth his life shall lose it: and he that loseth his life for my sake shall find it" (Matthew 10:39).<br><br>As members of the Church, there are things you cannot do. For one, you cannot take a "Las Vegas"-style vacation. I do not know whether you all knew that. You cannot gamble, bet on the horses, or play with playing cards. You cannot be "loose," immoral, or violent. Even though the world wants you all--all you men, at least--to imitate the "Marlborough Man" and to be "macho," those attitudes simply do not belong to you. They do not demonstrate Christlike qualities.<br><br>You cannot be dishonest. You cannot take immoral liberties in dating or other associations--if you do you should be excommunicated from the Church. You have no excuse. You are bright young people and you know better. You can do as you please, of course, but remember that the Lord's free agency is just like the Army's. We used to hear soldiers argue that the Army could not make anyone do anything he did not want to do, but there was always some wise old head who would quickly point out, "No, they can't make you do it, but they can sure make you wish you had." The Lord operates on a rather similar principle.<br><br>Now, what<i>can</i>you do--in fact, what<i>must</i>you do as a member of the Church? You must love everybody. Yes, take it literally--and you must especially love your wife or husband. Quite a few older people in the Church forget that. You must be true, go to church, give unstinting service, go on a mission, go to the temple, and pay your tithing. Why must you do all these things? Because when you understand all, you will see that it is worth it. You would really rather live that way if you knew all the perspectives.<br><br>In your daily work, you must have an occupation that contributes to the benefit of humanity and over which you can ask the blessings of the Lord from day to day. Anything else would be unworthy.<br><br>You are committed to be a conservationist in its true sense. We have no right to squander the earth's blessings. Learn not to waste food, energy, or gasoline. My father used to tell the story about the man who bought a pig for five dollars in the spring and sold him for five dollars in the fall. When he was asked how he made money that way, he said, "Well, I didn't make much on the transaction, but I had the use of the pig all summer."<br><br>Perhaps not all of you understand that. Such days are a little in the past, but a friend of mine once put it this way: "If I were eating an apple and didn't want to finish it, I wasn't allowed to throw it away; I had to find a chicken or a pig or something to give it to so that I wouldn't waste it." Thrift is an ancient virtue that still needs to be cultivated in our time.<br><br>Many potent examples show how people must still learn to think correctly. I have a friend who, after he was married in the temple, drifted away from the Church. He was an airline pilot. As time went on, one of his companions, who was also a member of the Church, said, "Look, friend, you're not helping me any. I used to live like you, but I've changed. I'm in the bishopric now, and everything I do to try to build up the Church you tear down. I want you to change."<br><br>Because my friend respected this man, he began to change his ways, went back to church, and began to become active. He said, however, that he still had one vice: he liked to gamble. He played cards with the other pilots when he was away from home, and he was good at it. He hated to give it up because he won quite a bit of money; but, he said, "One day as I went to pay my tithing, I thought, 'Let's see--how do I pay tithing on this money I won gambling?'" That solved the problem for him.<br><br>Other such questions are solved by straight thinking. My father often met the test that farmers generally undergo of "whether I should haul my hay on Sunday because it's about to rain." That was quite a test once upon a time. My father answered it by saying, "Let it rain. I don't care if it rains on the hay; I don't have to eat hay."<br><br>What if we do not want to keep the commandments? Brother Elray Christiansen used to tell of a man who came over from Denmark who was skilled at amassing wealth. He gave up a rather substantial fortune to join the Church and come to Utah, but after he settled here he again had the ability to build up his resources. In the process he lost his testimony. As the brethren visited him, they would say, "You're not doing right, you know," but he would never listen.<br><br>One day two brethren were visiting and one of them said, "Now look, Lars, it's not right what you do." He paid no attention. The brother continued, "Look, Lars, you can't take it with you, you know."<br><br>That touched Lars, and he said, "What's that you say?"<br><br>"I told you, you can't take it with you."<br><br>And Lars said, "<i>Vell</i>then, I<i>vill</i>not go."<br><br>Brother Christiansen bore testimony that he has gone.<br><br>Recently we heard of the death of Nelson Rockefeller, who was one of the wealthiest men in the world, and my son asked me how much he had left. The standard answer, of course, is that he left it all, as all will do.<br><br>In closing, there is a story told by President Kimball. I wish I had it here to quote verbatim, but I shall have to do it from memory and pray that I will not mutilate it too much. He said, in substance, "I went to visit a friend. He met me at the airport. 'How do you like my car?' he said as he showed me his luxurious limousine. On the way from the airport to his home, he stopped the car, we got out, and he said, 'See all this? From the mountains on the right hand over to the river on the left--it's all mine.'" The way Brother Kimball said "mine" made you feel the covetousness that man had in his possessions. Then they proceeded to his home, which was truly a palace. President Kimball said, "I spoke at his funeral not long ago. They buried him in a piece of land the length of a tall man and the width of a heavy man, and as I returned from the cemetery I observed the cattle in the field, seemingly unaware that there had been a change of ownership."<br><br>I ask you, do you understand that story? Is there anyone five years old who cannot understand it? It is as plain as day what life is all about. That is why we have the gospel with us; that is why it has been restored. That is why we are called upon to give service and to bring forth fruit as those who know the truth and know the difference between right and wrong.<br><br>I give you my testimony that I know that the gospel is true, that it has been restored, and that this knowledge supersedes in importance every other thing that has been told to us in all the years of our lives. It takes precedence over all the other projects and activities that people anywhere may want to do. I pray that we will be faithful and true to what that implies for all of us, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>William Grant Bangerter was a member of the First Quorum of the Seventy of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when this devotional address was given at Brigham Young University on 10 April 1979.</i></i><br><br><i>©Intellectual Reserve, Inc.

<h1>Your Mission? - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
My dear brothers and sisters, it is a great opportunity and privilege to come back to BYU. As I watched you coming from classes and met some of my former professors, I felt as though I, too, should be coming from class. BYU and our family are very intertwined. Not only did I graduate from here, but my wife did also; and, as has been mentioned, we have two daughters presently attending here. When our oldest daughter graduates next year, she will represent the fifth generation of our family to have graduated from Brigham Young University. My wife and I both graduated from here and met here; my mother graduated from BYU and met my father here; my grandmother graduated from BYU and met my grandfather here; my great-grandfather, George H. Brimhall, was one of the first students of BYU and, in fact, returned some time later to preside over this institution for close to twenty years. (He was married before he came here as a student.) So you can see that our family is pretty well immersed in BYU.<br><br>I ask for your faith and prayers that what is said and, particularly, what is heard this morning will be under the guidance of the Spirit of God. If we can all increase our faith and our determination to live closer to our Father in Heaven, then we will have accomplished the purpose of this devotional. While my remarks may not be as entertaining as you may want, I think they will be important--at least the message is important.<br><br>Let me begin by asking you a very simple question. The question is this: What is your mission? You might think, "Well, I served in Japan," or "I served in Virginia," or wherever, and that is fine; but it is not what I am asking. I mean--what is your mission now? What is your mission in life? What does God expect you to accomplish during your sojourn here upon the earth? And are you doing it?<br><br>I hope that in the next few moments, with the help of the Spirit of the Lord, we can all realize, if we have not realized it before, or, if we have known it, reaffirm in our lives the importance of at least three things: first, that God, our Father in Heaven, does have a specific mission for all of us to fulfill and perform while we are here upon this earth; second, that we can, here and now in this life, discover what that mission is; and third, that with His help we can fulfill that mission and know and have assurance--here and now in this life--that we are doing that which is pleasing to our Father in Heaven. These are all very important concepts; and they are all true.<br><br>If we do not know what our mission it, if we are not sure, if we are uncertain as to whether we are in fact fulfilling it, or if we do not have the positive assurance in our lives that our actions and our performance are pleasing to our Father in Heaven, then it does not really matter what else we are spending our time doing--it is not as important as finding out what we should be doing and having the assurance that we are doing it. Or to put it another way, if we are really interested in doing our Father's will we had better pay the price--whatever price is necessary. we had better pray however fervently, study the scriptures and listen to the Brethren however intently we need to, or in short do whatever is required so that we can have the assurance that we are doing what our Father in Heaven wants us to do--that we are moving in the general area of the mission he has for us to perform. Obviously, that mission will be different for each of us.<br><br>Such a revelation will not come all at once. God will unfold it to us line upon line, according to what is best for us and how capable we are of handling it, and what is best for the progress of his work. But remember that you must start somewhere. I assure you that you should and can know that you are on the right path and that your performance, no matter where you are on that path--student, missionary, newlywed, or whatever--is pleasing to the Lord.<br><br>Listen to what Nephi tells us in 2 Nephi 32:9:<br><br><i>But behold, I say unto you that ye must pray always, and not faint; that ye must not perform any thing unto the Lord save in the first place ye shall pray unto the Father in the name of Christ, that he will consecrate thy performance unto thee, that thy performance may be for the welfare of thy soul.</i><br><br>That is powerful doctrine--powerful because it is true. Everything we do should be done for the Lord; and we ought to make sure that it is what he wants us to do.<br><br>Many of you will say, "Yes, I believe all that, but how do I go about finding what I am supposed to do? How do I know what my mission and calling is? If I were going on a full-time mission, I would send in a group of papers to Salt Lake and someone else would make the decision for me and send me to Germany, or Texas, or Japan, or somewhere. But what about this--this lifelong mission? How do I understand? How do I know? Who tells me?"<br><br>It has been said--not of this, but of another subject--"If you have to ask the question, there is no way of giving you the answer." That is only partially true in this case, for while every person must ultimately receive his own revelation and assurance as to his life's mission, there are great helps available to us. I will review some of these with the hope that they will help all of us in discovering what our mission in this life is. I use the word "discover" advisedly, for it connotes the correct feeling of something that already exists but needs to be found by those who would benefit from its use.<br><br>In our quest to discover our calling in life, the first and most fundamental thing we must do is to follow the Savior--our Savior, the world's Savior. Learn of him, and learn what he did; then do it. The things that he did, even though they occurred two thousand years ago, have universal application. This may seem rather general to you, but it is the basis of all else. You will have to do this by personally studying the scriptures and his life and personally becoming acquainted with him. (And, incidentally, as you do that you will have your questions answered.) But en route to achieving this personal relationship with the Savior, let me give you five specifics to help.<br><br>1. Become and remain worthy to honestly hold a temple recommend. That covers a big area. I am not going to go into detail; you can get the details from your bishop, and I suggest that you do so.<br><br>2. Obtain your patriarchal blessing; or, if you already have it, study it carefully and prayerfully yourself--not necessarily with others.<br><br>3. Read the scriptures daily and prayerfully. We must all do that.<br><br>4. Pray diligently and fervently at least every night and every morning.<br><br>5. Start moving in some direction. Start doing something--take a course, go on a date, choose a major. Start somewhere, in some area about which you at least do not feel negative. If you feel negative about everything, start in the area about which you feel least negative. In other words, do not just sit and wait for a big revelation. Do not wait for a change, or a transfer, or a move, or a different situation. Start where you are, now.<br><br>Let me mention an experience that fits directly into this subject. I had the opportunity, as was mentioned, or serving a full-time mission in Tonga over twenty years ago. I had two great and wonderful mission presidents. The first one, when I arrived, said, "I've got just the place for you. It's a small island several hundred miles from here. It is nearly seven miles around and has about seven hundred people living on it. There are no white people there and no one speaks English. I want you to go there and not come back until you know the discussions and know how to speak Tongan."<br><br>I went, and to put it mildly, there were lots of problems. I did not have a companion, in the traditional sense of the word. (I did have a priest, a better man that I was, who went with me.) Despite the problems--or more correctly, because of the problems--I experienced lots of growth. At one time we came close to literally starving to death because of a hurricane and a wrecked boat. On another occasion we were subject to some serious physical threats and actual abuse. At one time we went a little over four months without mail. (I do not cry very often when missionaries tell me that they had had no mail for a week. Of course, things have improved there and everywhere.) Still, one learns to live with these things. We kept working. Even though there were only seven hundred people in a very limited area, even though I did not know the language, we kept moving--we were doing something.<br><br>I am sure that we did some things wrong--although I must add that whenever there was the possibility of our doing something seriously wrong the Lord let us know in no uncertain terms that it was wrong. And while we still could have done it, we could only have done it in deliberate defiance of his definite impressions to us. Thankfully, we never did. I give you the assurance that if you are striving to do right the Lord will let you know if you are starting to do something wrong--so listen! I am sure that we could have done much more good, but at least we never stopped. We kept going--we did something, and that is important.<br><br>The facts are that when I left that little island after thirteen months I was alive and well. I knew the discussions; I knew the language. Many souls had been baptized into the restored gospel. I had been present--not out of desire, but of necessity, because they thought white men knew everything--when many infants had been born and when several people had died, and I had held some in my arms as they passed away. I had learned quite a lot about life. But most important, I came away knowing at least three things--and we can all come away from our life's experiences knowing these things; in fact, we should and we must.<br><br>1. I knew that God lived; that he had all knowledge and all power; that he was literally the Father of our spirits; and that he loved us as his children, which we are. I knew that he loved us each personally and individually and that he especially watches over his missionaries. I did not merely have faith or confidence in that--I knew it.<br><br>2. I knew that Jesus Christ was his Son, our Savior and Redeemer, a real person, and a true friend; one who gave his life for us and will let us know that he gave his life for us; one who loves us and who we can love in a way that defies human comprehension; one who has helped us more than we may ever know and who now helps us in many great ways that we as yet do not comprehend; one through whom we can look forward to a glorious resurrection of our bodies, a forgiveness of our sins, and an eventual opportunity to stand in the presence of our Father in Heaven cleansed and pure--and this is very important. I plead with you to love him with all your heart; you will be a better person for it and you will be on the path to knowing your mission and calling in life. And that is the third point:<br><br>3. I knew that God had a mission for me and for all men and all women. I did not know exactly what is was in every detail, and that did not matter. I knew where to start. I knew that I had to live more closely in tune with him, and that I could trust him. I knew that our purpose here was to fulfill our mission. I knew that he would, in his own way and according to his timing, let me know what other things he would have me do to fulfill this mission he had in mind for me so that I could receive the joy that comes therefrom. I have not been disappointed, and neither will you be disappointed.<br><br>When the new mission president arrived, he eventually found out where I was and<br><br>Transferred me to another area. (I worked in only two areas my entire mission; and in those days missions were a little longer, so it was nearly three years from the time I left home until I returned.) This second area consisted of sixteen small islands. The new mission president told me that because we were so short of missionaries I would have to go out alone. He told me that I should preach the gospel and build up the Church on those sixteen islands; those were my instructions. (He forgot to tell me that we were supposed to fill out reports, and I thought that they had changed the procedure; so I did not fill out any more reports for the rest of my mission. I suppose that gave me more time to work; I am not sure.) But again I kept moving and trying to do some good.<br><br>There were members on some of those islands, and I often took them with me on preaching trips. Mostly we traveled in small sailboats. I suppose the Lord has his way of testing all of us. It seems that I was born with a weak stomach and most of my boat trips--which were many--found me very ill. We would go to an island, tract all day, and invite everyone out to a meeting that evening. The whole island usually came. (I must admit that there was probably not that much else to do on those tiny islands, and it was a novelty to hear a Palangi, or white man, speak the language.) The average island would have from a few hundred to several hundred inhabitants. I do not think any of them had into the thousands--possibly there were one or two.<br><br>When everyone had arrived, I went through all the lessons, because I knew that I would not be back for several months. I started with lesson one and spent three or four hours teaching all the lessons. When I concluded, I asked the people to pray sincerely that evening about what they had heard. Then I explained that those who felt it was true and had a testimony of it should come down to our boat by 8:00 A.M. the next morning to be baptized and confirmed before we left for the next island. We often baptized people, and they became good members of the Church. We gave them instructions and called couples from some of the other branches to come and help them. Then we left for the next island and tried to come back a few months later.<br><br>Thus, by constantly going around, we gradually built up several good branches that have today evolved into some strong units with some fine leaders from among those people. There was lots of persecution in those days, so when people joined they were quite committed. They had had a spiritual conversion. It was not a social thing to join the Church; converts had to believe it.<br><br>I remember heading home, after completing one of these rounds in a more than usually successful way, in a very happy and grateful mood for the success with which the Lord had blessed us. The sea was rough; but we were not concerned, for we were in the hands of the Lord. As we got close to our home island, the rough weather became more severe, the wind became stronger, and the waves rose higher. Suddenly we found ourselves in the midst of a regular tropical squall which, though of short duration, can be very dangerous.<br><br>I felt, "Well, we will get through this all right. After all we have done and the success the Lord has blessed us with we shouldn't worry about this."<br><br>But the storm increased in intensity and suddenly, with the emergence of two huge waves, the captain shouted those fateful words to the six of us aboard: "Abandon ship!" You may hear a lot of phrases in this life, but there are few as fearsome as these, spoken by a captain in the midst of giant waves and the inconceivable turmoil of elements.<br><br>We did what we had to do and dove in as the gargantuan waves thundered down on our frail little craft, leaving it broken and listless as the six of us, sprawled on the surface of the boiling sea, struggled for our lives. I probably had not read all of the missionary rules, but I knew that missionaries were not supposed to swim; but sometimes one has no choice. We struggled against huge odds to make the nearest shore, a small island that we had just passed. I remember thinking that this really should not be, that we should not be going through this; but we were, and all my thinking or wondering did little good. Only swimming and exerting all the energy and effort I had helped at all.<br><br>After a long time--well over an hour of swimming, as I recall--we finally made it to shore--exhausted, but alive and gratefully so. Just to feel the firm ground under our feet was a great blessing. How much more I appreciated life and solid ground than I had before! Just to be in that boiling sea and to realize how tenuous life is, how quickly this earth life could come to an end, made a great impression on me. Sometimes we literally have to travel over rough waters in order to appreciate some of the fundamental blessings we have--life, for instance. We probably do not begin to understand or appreciate life as we should until we begin to see or sense or recognize death and its closeness to all of us. as we sense these things, we can more clearly comprehend that there is a reason for our being here--in actuality, a mission for us to perform--and that we had better get with it.<br><br>The storm passed rather rapidly, but we were still stranded for several days before we got things together and were able to make our way home over much friendlier seas. The whole experience gave me a new outlook and appreciation for life that I had not had before. As I look back now, I see that there was much more than our strength involved in that horrendous task of getting to shore; but it still took all that we could do. In a similar manner, even though it will take all the effort we can put forth to fulfill our missions here, there will still be much more than our own efforts involved in accomplishing them.<br><br>I remember reading a poster once that said, "A ship in a harbor is safe, but that is not what ships are made for." I think that saying also applies to our lives. We may pass through troubled times, but if we constantly seek nothing but physical security, we are probably not doing what we should. We need to seek the spiritual security of knowing that we are doing the Lord's will. Sometimes that will not give us all the physical security we may desire, but it will give us all we need.<br><br>Again, the important thing is: we made it. You will make it, too. Everyone will make it if they will do what they should. As you see, I am here. Some of you probably wish that I had drowned, but I did not. I am alive, I did return home, I did get married, we have been blessed with a family, we have been able to make a living, and we have received many great opportunities to serve in the Lord's kingdom. No matter what the Lord requires of you, if you keep trying you will be able to fulfill the mission he has in store for you.<br><br>While I would not have chosen that experience, or some other experiences I have had--and I must admit that there were times when I was not as positive as I would like to have been about the outcome--the fact remains that a big part of my subsequent happiness--and your subsequent happiness and joy--has to be traced back to some of those so-called "unwanted" experiences. We do not need to seek them; heaven knows they find us out more often than we may desire. All we need to do is try with all our might to live as we should, keep our eyes on our goal, and leave the rest to the Lord. Then we will realized the truth of the statement that problems are what we see when we take our eyes off the goal. Once we incorporate the available God-given directions in our lives, find our mission, and discover our calling--look out, world, here we come! That is the way we need to feel. That is what must happen for us to be happy and for us to do what the Lord wants us to do. We must have that assurance and the attendant drive in order to accomplish his purposes and build his kingdom and achieve the potential he has in mind for us.<br><br>Let us bring this thought back to reality and apply it to us here today. Most of you are students at BYU. You are concerned about several things. You are concerned about getting married if you are not already married--about meeting and being sure of the right person who will be your eternal companion; you are concerned about gaining a knowledge of some profession and finding a job and having time and means to help build the kingdom. This concern is, in effect, your desire to know your mission and calling in life.<br><br>Maybe you would like to be a teacher, but you know that there are not many teaching jobs available now; what do you do? Do you go into teaching, or do you go into, say, cabinetmaking, which may not require all the college education teaching does but could surely make you a lot of money? These are very valid questions, and they deal directly with what we are talking about: fulfilling your mission and calling in life. As you are obedient to the principles about which we have talked, I promise you that not only are you entitled to revelation, inspiration, and answers to these fundamental questions, but you will receive them. They are important to you and they are important to the Lord. You can receive that inspiration here and now, and you can feel good about the direction in which you are going.<br><br>As previously mentioned, I got a master's degree and taught for a while. I loved it. I would still be doing it except that I did not feel that was my calling--at least not in a professional sense. I went into the contracting and development business and felt a positive assurance that that was what I should be doing. I did not have any great revelation saying, "Be a contractor," or "Do not be a teacher," but I did experiment with a few things, and I turned form those about which I did not feel right and moved in the direction of those about which I did feel right. I soon ended up building homes, apartments, commercial buildings, and so on.<br><br>Such a course is not for everyone (and, fortunately not, because some of the greatest teachers I have run across are here at the Y, and I am glad they chose their calling in that field), but it was right for me. You have to decide and know what yours will be.<br><br>Let me spend a moment on an item that I think a great many people, particularly members of the Church, do not understand. A lot of our people--including a lot of you--have great amounts of faith but sometimes tend to distort that faith a little by saying, "I am not going to move until I receive a positive assurance"--a burning in the bosom, as it were--"that that is the right thing to do."<br><br>You are all familiar with the scripture where Oliver Cowdery was trying to translate and could not do it. The Lord explained that Oliver had to figure it out himself, and if it was right He would give him a burning in his bosom; and if it was wrong he would have a stupor of thought. Many people say, "I am not going to move because I do not have that burning in my bosom. I am not positive about this, that, or the other . ..." Too often we want to be positive about everything. We feel that we need to have this burning all the time. Often people say, "I am confused. I don't know what to do"--and so they end up treading water and not doing anything, not making any real progress--and that, in and of itself, is a great sin. We should not do things wrong--and, as I said before, the Lord will let you know when things are wrong--but, for heaven's sake, we should do something! This lengthening of our stride and quickening of our pace about which our modern-day prophet, the Lord's spokesman, talks so much cannot happen if we are standing still. We must be moving, and we should be moving in the right direction.<br><br>Let me tell what I have discovered--and this is somewhat repetitious. I do not say that we will not get that burning in our bosom, for we will when it is the right thing. In my life there have been quite a few occasions where there was absolutely no question about it--that burning was there. For instance, I have had the experience of installing stake presidents when there was absolutely no question, when I was positive that "that is the man to be the stake president now." It has happened in other situations also, but generally it has worked the other way--that is by eliminating the wrong directions to reveal the right direction, especially concerning our opportunities for progress in life in what we often term the temporal sense. We must try to figure it out ourselves. In the past I have tried out whether I should go into business or into teaching or into the arts or whatever. As I have begun to proceed along one path, having more or less gathered what facts I could, I have found that if that decision was wrong or was taking me down the wrong path--not necessarily an evil one, but one that was not right for me--without fail, the Lord has always let me know just this emphatically: "That is wrong; do not go that way. That is not for you!"<br><br>On the other hand, there may have been two or three ways that I could have gone, any one of which would have been right and would have been in the general area providing the experience and means whereby I could fulfill the mission that the Lord had in mind for me. Because he knows we need the growth, he generally does not point and say, "Open that door and go twelve yards in that direction; then turn right and go two miles ... " But if it is wrong, he will let us know--we will feel it for sure. I am positive of that. So rather than saying, "I will not move until I have this burning in my heart," let us turn it around and say, "I will move unless I feel it is wrong; and if it is wrong, then I will not do it." By eliminating all of these wrong courses, very quickly you will find yourself going in the direction that you ought to be going, and then you can receive the assurance: "Yes, I am going in the right direction. I am doing what my Father in Heaven wants me to do because I am not doing the things he does not want me to do." And you can know that for sure. That is part of the growth process and part of accomplishing what our Father in Heaven has in mind for us.<br><br>Let me quote from 2 Nephi, again from the thirty-second chapter, in verses one through three, where Nephi says:<br><br><i>And now, behold, my beloved brethren, I suppose that ye ponder somewhat in your hearts concerning that which ye should do after ye have entered in by the way</i>[that is, after you have become members of the Church and been baptized and received the gift of the Holy Ghost or after you have really and seriously decided that you want to find out what your mission and calling is].<i>But, behold, why do ye ponder these things in your hearts</i>[--why are you not sure]<i>?</i><br><br><i>Do ye not remember that I said unto you that after ye had received the Holy Ghost ye could speak with the tongue of angels? And now, how could ye speak with the tongue of angels save it were by the Holy Ghost?</i><br><br><i>Angels speak by the power of the Holy Ghost; wherefore, they speak the words of Christ. Wherefore, I said unto you, feast upon the words of Christ</i>[that is, study the scriptures, and listen to the modern-day prophets and your priesthood leaders];<i>for behold, the words of Christ</i>[that is, what the Brethren tell you and what you read in the scriptures]<i>will tell you all things what ye should do.</i>[Emphasis added.]<br><br>That is rather powerful, is it not?<i>All</i>things? Even what I ought to do for a living? You read it--there it is in the thirty-second chapter of 2 Nephi. Yes,<i>all</i>things that are necessary.<br><br>I assure you that by following these procedures you can receive answers and assurances of all things necessary to the fulfilling of your mission and calling in life. That includes at least those two most important concerns of whom you should marry and what profession you should enter.<br><br>This talk is not on courtship and marriage--although I realize that this is a popular subject at the Y, but I do want to make just one point in this regard. Unless the feeling of love and desire to want to be together forever is mutual, between the boy and the girl, it is probably not of God. I have been a mission president and have known the positive sureness and aggressiveness of outstanding young elders, and I would only caution you--all of you--that you cannot receive a one-sided revelation from God that is sure and true and correct in regards to an eternal marriage. Only as both parties feel the same way can you have the assurance that it is from the Lord. Those who try to force another's free will into their supposed-revelation mold are doing a great disservice to themselves and to their friends. Until the feeling is mutual, the good envisioned in such a union will not come to pass. So do not succumb to a one-way revelation; but on the other hand, when you feel it is right--and it may not come all at once--do not try to fight it. The Lord's greatest institution and the means whereby he always has and always will bring to pass his greatest blessings is the family unit you have the opportunity of creating by making the proper decision. Just make sure that you are right--not forced, but not withholding either--and God will bless you now and forever.<br><br>As to the second concern--namely, a profession or occupation--I want to leave you my assurance that He will bless you in this area. You can know within general areas what He wants you to do for a living. Sometimes we feel that God is interested in helping us choose a companion, that he is interested in helping us on our full-time missions, and that he is interested in helping us fulfill our assignment as a bishop or elders quorum president or Sunday School teacher or whatever, but that for some reason or another he is not interested in helping us as we struggle to decide whether to become an engineer or a teacher or a building contractor or whatever. I do not believe that. I believe that God is very interested in what we do for a living. I believe that he is interested in our relationship to him, to our fellowmen, and to this earth that he has created for us. all things are spiritual to the Lord.<br><br>I have often thought that in our day and age--and I believe that there is some precedence in the scriptures for this, such as references to pollution in the last days and so on--one of the areas at which we could look seriously and about which we could feel good is this area of cleaning up our environment. I have a feeling that pollution is going to get worse and that there are going to be a lot of jobs in this area.<br><br>I am convinced that the Lord is against pollution. He is against perversion. He is against prostitution--and prostitution has a much broader meaning than just its limited sexual sense; it really means perverting something from its correct use to an incorrect use. I would think that prostitution and pollution and perversion are all about the same, and God is against such things. How we treat him is reflected in how we treat others who are his children, and how we treat the elements and other forms of life on this earth, which are his. He created them. If there were one safe area in which to look for a livelihood, I think it would be in this area. I do not know whether this would be your avocation or not, but you might think about it.<br><br>I am convinced in my own mind that we have not really fulfilled our mission in life as individuals or as a Church until we have demonstrated and shown as much advancement in other areas as we have in theology. We know how government ought to be, we know how society ought to be, we know what cleanliness ought to be, we know what the environment really should be; we should lead out in these areas. For instance, we recognize that we have environmental problems. I am not sure what the answer is, but I do not think the answer is what some "environmentalists" think it is--that is, to stop whatever we are doing--because we as a race must produce. I am not sure how to do it, but I am sure that there is a right way; we just need to discover it. I do not believe that the Lord is pleased with the constant corruption and pollution we so willingly endure--not just spiritually, but physically--to achieve some of our goals. I personally cannot help but believe that there is a better way. I cannot help but feel that God knows how to transform all of these base materials into useful tools without all the choking clouds of dust and the stench of pollution in our rivers and streams. He put our resources here, he put us here, and he knows what we need. He knows what is here and how to get things done. I do not think that he is against energy. I think that he is for all of these things, and wants us to use them in the proper way to get around, do his work, and build up his kingdom. But my faith is that there is a better way than we now know. He wants us to use the elements--to mold them for our use--but in a different way.<br><br>Now should that not be something that you students here at BYU could figure out--with the Lord's help? (And who should be closer to him than you?) We have talked about missions for individuals, and we are all aware of the Church mission. In my mind, BYU, as part of the Church, should become the pollution-control center of the world--not only spiritually, but physically. I feel that this is important. We take the gospel to all the world in a spiritual way; we ought to do it in other ways, also.<br><br>We can make great contributions to the world as we find better sources of energy, or a way to conquer cancer (and I understand that you are making some progress on that here at the Y), or a better method of transforming iron ore into steel, and so on. These are all things on which we could work and feel good. I guess we could say that, as far as our life's mission is concerned, both spiritually and physically, we could feel good about doing away with pollution and putting purity in its place. That is a real challenge and is something that we should do. You at this University should be the leaders in doing it.<br><br>I hope that you can catch the vision and see clearly the truth of these things. I hope that you can really understand that our Father in Heaven does have a mission for you to perform. I hope that we all understand that we can know what our mission is, and know it now--at least the part that we need to know--maybe not a long way ahead, but enough for the present. I hope that we can all understand that principle and fulfill that mission, and I hope that we can all have the assurance that we are on the correct path right now.<br><br>What does the Lord mean when he tells us that we cannot be saved in ignorance and that we must gain knowledge in order to be saved? Knowledge of what? (You are here to study something, I hope.) Knowledge of the gospel? Of course, but even more than that, I think. I believe that the knowledge he is talking about--the knowledge that saves and that he requests us to seek--is the knowledge or assurance that we are fulfilling our mission, that we are doing his will, and that he is pleased with our efforts.<br><br>Let me close by briefly relating an experience that occurred a few years ago, again in the islands. It will demonstrate the universality of the basic premise with which we began: That all people do have a mission and can perform it, no matter where they are or under what circumstances they may live, be it here in the United States or on a small island in the Pacific. As I conclude with that story and testimony, let us reevaluate our lives and make sure that we are doing with them what the Lord would have us do.<br><br>Years ago, as a young missionary, I was impressed by an older island couple who always seemed to be helping the missionaries and others. Every time I went to their home I would find them reading the scriptures, fixing a meal for a missionary, tending a neighbor's child, preparing a Relief Society lesson, or rendering some sort of service. They were not blessed with children of their own, but they were always helping so-called "outcast" children.<br><br>I was soon moved to another area and left for home without ever returning to that area. I often wondered about that couple who had so impressed me. I was sure that the Lord would bless them.<br><br>Years later I was again in the area and a messenger came and asked if I would visit a certain widow named Luisa. Upon inquiring, I realized that it was the family I had wondered about all these years. Her husband had obviously passed away; and as the messenger gave me the address I realized that she still lived in the same old house where she had lived those many years before. Of course we made arrangements to visit her.<br><br>It was late afternoon when we drove up to the home. I was surprised to realize that hardly anything had changed; it was a neat and clean home, but a very humble one. As I walked up to the house I noticed her waiting by the open door. She held her hand out in a slightly waving fashion, and I realized she had gone blind. As I took her in my arms, I realized also that she had not long to stay in this life, for I felt nothing but the frailest body of skin and bones.<br><br>As we sat and visited, she talked about her desire to help the "poor" people. I suggested that she might need some help herself rather than giving help. She kindly informed me that she was rich and had nothing to worry about. I was a little confused and began to inquire. I found that they had often saved money to pay their airfare to the temple, only to end up lending it to someone else who needed it more. When all the facts came out I asked, "Luisa, how can you say you don't have anything to worry about? You have no husband, you have no children, you're blind, you are in poor health, you live in a poor home, you haven't been to the temple. How can you say that you are rich?"<br><br>She stopped all of my questions by quietly informing me that she was rich because she knew that the Lord was pleased with her life. She said, "I know that I will be with my husband soon. I know that the Lord will bless us with a family. I know that I have not done all that I should, but I know that the Lord is pleased with what I have done."<br><br>I cannot express fully what happened at that time. However, I would like you to listen to the seventh verse of the sixth section of the Doctrine and Covenants, wherein the Lord says, "Seek not for riches but for wisdom, and behold, the mysteries of God shall be unfolded unto you [even the discovering of your mission and calling], and then shall you be made rich. Behold, he that hath eternal life is rich." You see, Luisa had taken the time to discover her mission and calling in life and had done whatever was necessary to fulfill it.<br><br>Again, what is your mission? I plead with you--discover it and fulfill it! I assure you that it is worth it. In the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>John H.

<br>
My brothers and sisters, it is an awesome sight to look at you and realize that I have the assignment to say something, beyond what you have already heard today, that will be of some assistance to you. It is a marvelous thing to realize that there are people such as you who are faithful to the gospel of Jesus Christ--faithful enough to attend a special meeting of this type on a very busy Sabbath day. I pray that the Spirit of the Lord will be with me so that I might say some things that will be of value to all of you. My wife told me to stand up here and pretend that I had a basketball in my hand and just to forget the rest of you. I wish something besides my heart were bouncing right now.<br><br>In a few hours, the first Sunday of May 1979 will become history. The closing of this day, a fast and testimony day to most members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, brings to an end the fasting, praying, singing, learning, and testifying activities conducted in Mormon congregations throughout the world. It is conceivable that many members will mark this day as just another Sabbath. For others, particularly those who actively participated in the bearing of personal testimony, this day will be recorded as something special and memorable.<br><br>According to my calculations, approximately ten thousand separate groups of Saints will have met today in fast and testimony meetings. If some fifteen persons per ward or branch expressed their testimonies, a mighty chorus of more than one hundred fifty thousand testimonies will have resounded over earth's surface during these past twenty-four hours. This means that a host of Saints large enough in number to fill seven and one-half Marriott Centers testified of God and of his goodness. If you were to add to that the full-time missionaries in the field, there would be more than enough to fill another Marriott Center.<br><br>It is thrilling to realize that so many testimonies can be borne in such a short time. I rejoice in the assurance that we are encompassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses, and my heart swells with pride to be numbered among those who have the desire to believe, the faith to know, and the courage to declare. How pleased our Heavenly Father must be to have observed and heard the expressions of testimony on this his holy day! He who responds to the fall of a single sparrow to the earth most assuredly responds to the single testimonies borne by his children.<br><br>As this day of stated testimonies closes, I wonder about tomorrow. I wonder if the Monday, the Tuesday, the Wednesday, and the other work days to follow will be filled with unstated testimonies. It is one thing to acknowledge evidences of a supreme being and to testify of God's existence, but it is a far better thing to live in accord with his divine will. Many people mouth the Sunday testimony, but all too few model it. We read in the New Testament:<br><br><i>But be ye doers of the word, and not hearers</i>[and I would add speakers]<i>only, deceiving your own selves.</i><br><br><i>For if any be a hearer</i>[or a speaker]<i>of the word, and not a doer, he is like unto a man beholding his natural face in a glass:</i><br><br><i>For he beholdeth himself, and goeth his way, and straightway forgetteth what manner of man he was</i>[or was purported to be]. [James 1:22–24]<br><br>When a member of the Church stands at the pulpit and shares his testimony with others, he does, in a real sense, place himself before the mirror--a mirror that reflects his desires, his faith, and his commitment to live the gospel of Jesus Christ. I might add that few men or women look better than when observed bearing their testimonies.<br><br>To turn away from the mirror of testimony and live in contradiction to one's stated belief is an affront to Deity and a serious form of mockery. We read of those who mocked the Christ during his mortal ministry, and we ask, "How could they do it?"<br><br><i>The rulers . . . derided him, saying, He saved others; let him save himself, if he be Christ, the chosen of God.</i><br><br><i>And the soldiers also mocked him, . . . offering him vinegar,</i><br><br><i>And saying, If thou be the king of the Jews, save thyself.</i>[Luke 23:35–37]<br><br>Such accounts of mockery are heartrending, and we wonder how people could be so hardhearted and cruel. Yet we display the same hardness--and some cruelty of our own--when we engage in serious mockery. When we, the professed believers, take the name of God in vain, we mock. When we desecrate the Sabbath, we mock. When we curse God during tribulations, we mock. When we permit any form of hypocrisy to enter our lives, we mock. We mock or ridicule Christ when one day we testify of his holy nature and calling and the next day abuse his teachings. It would be well for us to speak less condemningly of the Jews and the passersby at the Crucifixion who mocked God until all traces of mockery are erased from our own behavior.<br><br>Earlier today, I sat in a meeting north of here and heard several people express love for the Savior. Their testimonies were most touching. As I listened I thought of another congregation gathered nearly two thousand years ago to consider the matter of Christ. The congregation of which I speak looked to Pilate for direction. Pilate's instructions centered upon the question, "What shall I do then with Jesus which is called Christ?" (Matthew 27:22). These words from Pilate's lips opened the floodgate to all the whipping, the scourging, the slapping, and the spitting that the Jews and the Roman soldiers administered to Jesus; as the record attests they "spitefully entreated" him (Luke 18:32). When we read of these indignities inflicted by the Savior's persecutors, we wonder, "How could they do such wicked things?"<br><br>While pondering about Christ and his mistreatment two thousand years ago, I felt confident in my own heart that the Saints whose testimonies I heard this morning would treat him more kindly if he were to visit them today. But reflecting further, I wondered, "Am I and are all of the witnesses of Christ free from tendencies to scourge and mistreat the Savior of mankind?" It occurred to me that we too stand guilty and in danger of serious condemnation when we abuse our spouses and children, when we show disrespect to our parents or the aged, when we mistreat the Lord's servants--his missionary and priesthood leaders--when we neglect the poor or the disadvantaged, or when we offend any of our friends or speak evil of them. How do I justify such a statement? Did not Christ say, in reference to the last judgment, "Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me" (Matthew 25:40)?<br><br>From this and other scripture, I conclude that we in sense whip Christ when we whip innocent children. We slap Christ when we strike another in anger. We scourge him when we scourge his followers. Christ prayed to the Father that he would forgive the Jews and the Roman soldiers for spitefully entreating him, saying, "They know not what they do" (Luke 23:34). Will he be so lenient with us when we stand before congregations and bear our testimony, declaring his divinity, and then turn away and mistreat his children? I feel strongly that this morning's testimonies must be supported by tomorrow's deeds.<br><br>I would guess that most testimony meetings held today included some ward or branch business. I am certain that most of us heard a priesthood officer read aloud names or ward members. I am sure you heard him cite positions of call and invite members to sustain the action taken by the bishopric or branch presidency. As we raised our arms to the square in the usual sustaining fashion, were we really involved in this action? Did we really pledge our support of officers and teachers? Late in the meeting did you or someone else pay tribute to a teacher or a bishop? Did you express thanks to an associate or to a family member? I would suspect that many voiced promises of loyalty to God, to family, to servants in the Church, and to the gospel of Jesus Christ. If all of these things occurred in today's testimony meetings, what will occur in tomorrow's living? Will we remain true to our pledges to sustain the Lord's work and the Lord's workers?<br><br>In a bygone day, Christ's disciples expressed their love and devotion to him time and time again. On the occasion when Christ washed the feet of his disciples, Peter objected. Jesus said, "If I wash thee not, thou hast no part with me."<br><br>The chief apostle's quick response was, "Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands and my head." Total commitment and total loyalty to the Savior were the intent of these words and those that follow: "I will lay down my life for thy sake." (See John 13:5-9, 37.) Yet after all these fine words, Peter and the others forsook the Savior at the time of his trial and crucifixion. The record states simply, "All the disciples forsook him, and fled" (Matthew 26:56). As predicted, even Peter, the rock, denied him thrice (see Matthew 26:69–75).<br><br>Now before we condemn Peter and the others, should we not ask if we are in danger of similar kinds of acts? Should we not check to see if we ourselves are above the temptation to forsake or deny? It is my strong feeling that we forsake the Savior when we vote to sustain his priesthood officers but then turn down invitations to serve. When we testify that the gospel is true but refuse to share that testimony with nonbelievers, we are also denying; we are turning away. When we wilt before temptation, when we fail to stand for the truth, we betray and turn away.<br><br>I would hope that, after all our fine words and hand-raising, we are riveted to the gospel and to its author. I would that we all rally in defense of Christ and pledge to him our all, as did Peter and his associates.<br><br>Our testimony meetings today included an ordinance of great significance: the sacrament. We ate bread and drank water in remembrance of Christ's sacrifice, and as we did so we made specific promises. We in turn received the promise that his Spirit would always be with us. May I remind you that as we partake of the bread and water we witness unto God that we are willing to bear his name and to keep his commandments. Though two Aaronic priesthood holders pronounce the prayers, we are parties to that testament; we act as witnesses. While participating in sacrament or fast and testimony services on this and other days, I have often wondered about my worthiness and about the worthiness of others to do what we do in this sacred ordinance. I have wondered about purity of spirit, cleanliness of body, and singleness of purpose.<br><br>Years ago a certain Judas Iscariot participated in a sacred ordinance. In the course of conducting this ordinance, Christ said to his disciples, "Ye are clean, but not all" (John 13:10), for he knew who would betray him. Later, after the sop had been dipped, Satan entered into Judas. Still later Judas covenanted to deliver the Master to his tormentors for thirty pieces of silver. It seems obvious that impure motive, the worship of worldly goods, uncleanliness, and related factors caused Judas to betray the Savior. His deed was wicked, inexcusable, and out of harmony with his calling as a chosen disciple.<br><br>Our hearts break when we review the events surrounding the betrayal, and we cry in our minds, "Judas, how could you have done such a thing?" However, before we condemn the man, should we not search our own souls and determine whether we are free of all tendencies to betrayal? I fear that we betray the Lord when we entertain impure thoughts and allow ourselves to be led by motives contrary to those of glorifying God and building his kingdom.<br><br>When we set our hearts upon the treasures of the world and live mammon-centered lives, we betray. When we pollute our bodies, our tabernacles of flesh, and permit satanic influences to enter, we are vulnerable as was Judas.<br><br>There is no place among testifiers of the Lord Jesus Christ for mockery, scourging, forsaking, or betraying in any way. Oh, how I pray that we will bear testimony--pure testimony--and then live accordingly, that we might mouth the testimony on Sabbath and then live and model that testimony all the days of our lives! We should be filled with the desire to testify, but we should be filled also with the determination to live according to our testimonies. We should be faithful; we should be pure.<br><br>Earlier I made reference to a scripture recorded in Hebrews, and I would like to quote it again, this time adding to it.<br><br><i>Wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses</i>[the one hundred fifty thousand or more that I mentioned who have borne testimony today],<i>let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which doth so easily beset us, and let us run with patience the race that is set before us</i>. [Hebrews 12:1]<br><br>When I read those words, I feel that it is our holy obligation to lay aside these weights and sins and to go forward as disciples of Jesus Christ.<br><br>I am reminded that all of us were made in the likeness and image of God; all of us were made just a little lower than the angels (see Psalm 8:5). It is our challenge to keep ourselves clean and pure and to become like him. Did Christ not challenge us to be perfect, even as his Father in heaven is perfect (see Matthew 5:48)? Did he not also challenge us to be even as he is (see 3 Nephi 12:48)? That is the challenge, and that is what we will do if we really believe and want to testify with conviction.<br><br>I love the words written by James Talmage, as recorded in<i>Jesus the Christ</i>, wherein he talks of our divine mintage:<br><br><i>Every human soul is stamped with the image and superscription of God, however blurred and indistinct the line may have become through the corrosion or attribution of sin; and as unto Caesar should be rendered the coins upon which his effigy appeared, so unto God should be given the souls that bear his image. Render unto the world the stamped pieces that are made legally current by the insignia of worldly powers, and give unto God and his service yourselves--the divine mintage of his eternal realm.</i>[James E. Talmage,<i>Jesus the Christ,</i>23d ed. (Salt Lake City: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 1956), pp. 546–47]<br><br>All of us have had the experience of noting in the countenances of people the effects of sin. It is obvious--it can be observed--and it is heartbreaking. A few years ago my wife and I had the privilege of serving a mission in Texas. As we returned from visiting a stake in the eastern part of that state, we stopped at a café for lunch. We took places in a booth and began to order our meal, but were annoyed by the conversation in the booth next to ours. In that booth was a very ugly and very dirty woman. The smoke billowed around her, her language was foul, and her treatment of the people who were attending her was very abusive. It became so annoying to us that we decided to leave; but as we were getting up to do so, she left. She was in a wheelchair, apparently crippled. Since she had gone, we settled back and finished our meal. When it was over we went up to the register to pay the bill and were shocked to see her behind the counter; she owned the place. As we paid the bill we looked behind her and saw on the wall a lovely, almost life-size portrait of a very beautiful young girl. We studied that picture as we waited for her to give the change, and I noticed a similarity between her eyes and the eyes of the girl in the painting. I asked the old woman if the picture was of her, and she replied proudly that it was indeed a picture of her during her youth. In questioning her further, we discovered that she was somewhat near my wife's age. But it was heartrending to note how her beauty had been spent and lost through sin. It was obvious that she had abused her divine mintage and that she was bogged down with sin.<br><br>My brothers and sisters, it is imperative that we--as sons and daughters of God, as testifiers of the Christ--lay aside the weights, rid ourselves of sin, and become like him. How do we do that? We do it by setting our eyes single to his glory. We do it by making certain that truth passes through our lips. I find it interesting, in reading the Book of Mormon, that we are told how to speak. The 32nd chapter of 2 Nephi, verses 2 and 3 reads:<br><br><i>Do ye not remember that I said unto you that after ye had received the Holy Ghost ye could speak with the tongue of angels? And now, how could ye speak with the tongue of angels save it were by the Holy Ghost?</i><br><br><i>Angels speak by the power of the Holy Ghost.</i><br><br>If our eyes are single, if we speak with the tongue of angels, if we have the clean hands and pure heart spoken of by the Psalmist (see Psalm 24:4), and if we do all within our power to take on the countenance of Christ, we then will measure up as his witnesses.<br><br>In chapter 5, verse 14, of Alma, the prophet Alma poses these questions to a group of believers: "And now behold, I ask of you, my brethren of the church, have ye spiritually been born of God? Have ye received his image in your countenances?" Have we received his image? When I look at President Kimball, LeGrand Richards, and others who have lived the commandments, who have set aside the weights, and who have rid themselves of sin, I see purity, glowing countenances, and marvelous and effective witnesses of the truth.<br><br>Let us return to Hebrews, the twelfth chapter. Beyond what I have already read, there is something else of great importance to which I would like to refer. Starting at the beginning:<br><br><i>Wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which doth so easily beset us, and let us run with patience the race that is set before us,</i><br><br>[Now add this:]<i>Looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith; who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God.</i>[Hebrews 12:1–2]<br><br>As witnesses we certainly must look unto Christ. The scriptures state this idea clearly and beautifully, and I would like to share three in particular with you. The first is found in Helaman:<br><br><i>And now, my sons</i>[all of us],<i>remember, remember, that it is upon the rock of our Redeemer, who is Christ, the Son of God, that ye must build your foundation; that when the devil shall send forth his mighty winds, yea, his shafts in the whirlwind, yea, when all his hail and his mighty storm shall beat upon you, it shall have no power over you to drag you down to the gulf of misery and endless wo, because of the rock upon which ye are built, which is a sure foundation, a foundation whereon if men build they cannot fall.</i>[Helaman 5:12]<br><br>That should be our foundation. A scripture in Alma states a similar idea:<br><br><i>And now, my son, I have told you this that ye may learn wisdom, that ye may learn of me that there is no other way or means whereby man can be saved, only in and through Christ. behold, he is the life and the light of the world. Behold, he is the world of truth and righteousness.</i>[Alma 38:9]<br><br>In addition to those two, we have the following scripture, which is so beautiful and full of meaning:<br><br><i>I am the true vine, and my Father is the husbandman.</i><br><br><i>Every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away: and every branch that beareth fruit, he purgeth it, that it may bring forth more fruit.</i><br><br><i>Now ye are clean through the word which I have spoken unto you.</i><br><br><i>Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, except it abide in the vine; no more can ye, except ye abide in me.</i><br><br><i>I am the vine, ye are the branches: he that abideth in me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit: for without me ye can do nothing.</i>[John 15:1–5]<br><br>Brothers and sisters, this has been a marvelous testimony day. I was trying to count up all the testimonies I have heard just in the few hours that I have worshipped, and it goes beyond fifteen. We are surrounded by a cloud of witnesses--what a marvelous and beautiful thing that is! But it is imperative, brothers and sisters, that this cloud of witnesses be consistent, faithful, and true to all that they have expressed. Their Mondays, their Tuesdays, their Wednesdays, and the things they do on those days should certainly support all that they have voiced on Sunday. If that were so, what strength would come, and what beautiful power would accrue to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints!<br><br>I like to think of the example of the woman Mary, who during the final hours of the Savior's life came with her alabaster box of ointment and anointed his feet. Here was a woman who knew of his divine calling; I am certain that she had testified many times. But over and beyond that, she was interested in good works. The disciples tried to prevent her from what they thought was wasting the ointment. But the Savior forbade them and allowed her to do what she did, saying that her act would be spoken of as a memorial to her.<br><br>I would hope and pray that we would support our testimonies by opening our alabaster boxes of ointment and giving to him and his cause the very best. We should give of ourselves freely; we should give of our<i>best</i>selves freely. We should give of our substance; we should give our all if we are really and truly testifiers of the gospel of Jesus Christ. May we be appreciative of that cloud of witnesses; may we lay aside our sins; may we avoid all forms of mockery; may we avoid all forms of scourging; may we avoid all forms of betrayal of the Christ by living true and in harmony with our testimonies.<br><br>I testify that the gospel of Jesus Christ has been restored in this day. I know it with all my heart; and I know that the Savior is real, that he is alive, and that he directs his kingdom through a living prophet, even Spencer W. Kimball--and, oh, how I love to hear him bear his testimony!<br><br>I testify to you, brothers and sisters, that your happiness and mine will be received in proportion to our obedience, and our faithfulness to our declared testimonies. May we be true in every way; may you students be strong and stalwart witnesses; may you missionaries go out determined to be clean and pure and to live completely in harmony with your witnesses of Christ. This is a great work, and it is a privilege to be associated with it. That God will bless you to appreciate it always and to live worthy of all the blessings is my prayer in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Carlos E. Asay was a member of the First Quorum of the Seventy of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when this fireside address was given at Brigham Young University on 6 May 1979.</i></i><br><br><i>©Intellectual Reserve, Inc.

<h1>ies of Living - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
President Oaks and brethren and sisters, I am delighted to be here with you this beautiful morning to share the gospel of Jesus Christ with some of the most important people in the kingdom--you.<br><br>I would like to discuss five concepts with you today, and my prayer is that these concepts might awaken in you latent thoughts that, once utilized, will make your time on earth more rewarding and exciting. They are these: one, there are thoughts that need thinking; two, there are ideas that need sharing; three, there are words that must be said; four, there are characteristics that need to be developed; and five, there are acts that should be performed.<br><br>First, what are these thoughts that need thinking? There are three of them. The first is this: What you are to be you are now becoming. In<i>Hamlet</i>Shakespeare's Ophelia said, "We know what we are, but know not what we may be" (act 4, sc. 5, 11. 42–43). Of course, the gospel had not been restored in the seventeenth century, so even Shakespeare did not really know what man could become; but we do, and this knowledge adds a dimension to our lives that cannot be realized by those who do not have the gospel of Jesus Christ.<br><br>Spencer W. Kimball became a prophet not on December 27, 1973, but when he was your age or perhaps even younger, because he was preparing himself for the great things that were to happen. We are becoming exalted today by the acts we perform, by the thoughts we think, and by the words we speak.<br><br>At the University of Utah--and I shall not speak those words any more often than I have to--there was a young sorority president, a wonderful musician, who was taught by her parents that her eternal position was being determined by her daily actions. Kathy McKay was an exciting date and a great example to everyone that knew her. One athlete from out of state became interested in the gospel of Jesus Christ just by watching her and recognizing her purity. She knew that the person she was to become she was then becoming.<br><br>There are many examples, but let me continue. The second thought that needs thinking is this: Today might be one of your key days. Vince Lombardi, one of the greatest football coaches that has ever lived and taught, trained his players to give all they had in every play. He explained it this way: "In every football game there are only five or six key plays that determine the final outcome of the game; however, no one knows when those key plays will materialize, and so we must give all we have every play in order to stop the opposition from scoring or to score ourselves."<br><br>That is how life is, brothers and sister. There are only five or six or perhaps a few more key days in our lives--the day we decide to give all we are and all we have to the Lord Jesus Christ; the day we find that special person with whom we can hold hands throughout eternity; the day we say, "Yes, bishop, I will serve wherever I am sent." There are not many of those days; but we must live the very best we can every day, so when those key days come along we will respond properly and end up with the eternal reward that awaits all of us who are worthy.<br><br>The third thought that needs thinking is this: If you do not respond properly to a challenge, maybe no one will. My mind flashes back to Granite High School and a young lady there who had a number of problems. Economically speaking, she was very poor. She could not dress like the other students, and she was insecure and frightened. But there was a young man who knew her and who would say, "Hi, how ya doin'?" One day they were to take a test in history, and he said to her, "Let's sit down and study together." They did, and she could tell that she had value--not romantic value, but value as a fellow human being.<br><br>The weeks came and went, and then one day she confessed to that young man that he had saved her life. "What do you mean, I've saved your life?" he asked. "Do you remember the day we had that history test?" "Yes." "I was going to take my life that day. I knew no one cared, that no one loved me. People made fun of the way I dressed and the things I said and the way I looked. But you cared, and because of that I'm still alive."<br><br>Incidentally, I saw that woman several years ago. She is a nurse now in Salt Lake City and is doing well, ministering to the needs of others. She is alive because someone who sat in class with her cared. Brothers and sisters, there are people that need you.<br><br>Next, there are ideas that need sharing. The first is this: The only effective decision-making apparatus in this life is the gospel of Jesus Christ. In theory, all of the great resources found within a nation can be used for that country's well-being; yet this magnificent nation in which we live is not making the type of decisions that are helpful or lasting, that are providing the stability we need. The philosophies of men are confusing, conflicting, cumbersome, and often contrary to the time frames within which we must live.<br><br>Our great educational institutions do much to facilitate our specializations and career preparations and little else, with the exception of BYU. I say that kindly, but believe it with all of my heart. Our educational institutions worldwide do not provide the type of decision-making capacities that we need to live at peace and in love with others; neither do the great corporations with their millions and often billions of dollars. But the more we utilized this incredible tool of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the happier we will be today, tomorrow (when our todays become yesterdays), and forever. It behooves all of us in this incredible environment of Brigham Young University to study, along with physics and behavioral theory and English and physical development, the gospel of Jesus Christ, that our decisions might be eternally helpful.<br><br>The second idea that I would like to share--and it is not unlike the first--is this: We function best in an environment of freedom. We are free when we are independent, and we are totally independent only when we are completely dependent upon the Savior. The Master said, "I can of mine own self do nothing: as I hear, I judge: and my judgment is just; because I seek not mine own will, but the will of the Father which hath sent me" (John 5:30). He did all that he saw his Father do; may we emulate him as he emulated his Father.<br><br>Referring to freedom and our relationship with him, the Savior also said, "I, the Lord God, make you free, therefore ye are free indeed" (D&amp;amp;C 98:8). Freedom, like inspired decisions, cannot come from any source other than the Savior. If we were totally dependent on the Savior, we could even find ourselves in prison and still be free.<br><br>The next and third part of my discussion is this: there are words that need saying. The first words that need saying are the most beautiful words of all: "I love you," and "I appreciate you." I talked on love at a missionary zone conference in Philadelphia one day, and during interviews a young man from Utah County, a former football player at American Fork High School, came up and said, "President, I've never told my dad that I love him."<br><br>I said, "Elder, we're not leaving this office until you do." "I can't," he protested. "My father works for Geneva, and we can't reach him during the day; but I promise, president, that I'll call him tonight and tell him I love him."<br><br>I replied, "Elder, after you do, call me and let me know how it went."<br><br>After driving home from Philadelphia, I went through a tall pile of mail and did some dictation. Sister Pinnock went to bed, but I sat up for a while and wrote in my journal--still no telephone call. As I was finally going to bed, much later than I should have been going to bed, the telephone rang. "President, I did it," he announced.<br><br>I said, "Tell me about it." "Well, I was so frightened that I waited too long, and when I finally called, they had gone to bed. Mother answered the telephone, and because I had called late in the night on other occasions in my life, she thought I was in trouble; so I said, 'No, mom, everything's okay, but I must talk to dad.'"<br><br>She handed the telephone to her sleepy husband, who said, "Yes, son, what is it?"<br><br>The missionary son said, "Dad, I love you. I want you to know how much I love you."<br><br>His father began to sob and handed the telephone back to his wife, who demanded, "What did you tell your father?"<br><br>He said, "Mom, I told dad how much I love him, and I want you to know how much I love you." Then there was crying on both ends of the line.<br><br>Brothers and sisters, if you love and appreciate someone, it is a matter of integrity to communicate that fact, because it is not said often enough. I was speaking at a single adult conference in California a few weeks ago about this very topic when an individual jumped up and ran out of the meeting. I am fairly used to having that happen when I speak, so I was not alarmed; but he came back, and that was surprising. Afterwards we talked for a few minutes, and I asked, "Why did you leave?"<br><br>He explained: "It has been several years since I told my father I love him, and I couldn't wait until the end of the talk." He had run out and said, "Dad, I love you."<br><br>Whom have you thanked today? One of the things we tried to do in the mission field was to say "thank you" to someone each day, to express appreciation to someone deserving. What other words need to be said and said more often? These: "I know that the gospel of Jesus Christ is true and that Joseph Smith is a prophet of God." When seventeen years of age, I took a date to the Garden Park Ward in Salt Lake City to a sacrament meeting followed by a fireside. Elder Richard L. Evans was the speaker. I cannot remember his topic nor any of his words, except that he said, "Young friends, the gospel of Jesus Christ is true." Those words pierced me like a sword; they were exactly the right words at the right time for a young man who was searching and stumbling. Someone needs to hear you say those words and to observe you living the way that you know you should live. Bear your testimony often; bear it to those nearby, because sometimes it is those nearby who need you the most.<br><br>I am reminded of the story that Elder L. Tom Perry shared with us just a few weeks ago at general conference time. It took place in the mid-seventies shortly after he had lost his first wife. Before one of the sessions of general conference he looked over where the wives usually sit, and of course his wife's chair was vacant; she was not there. He stood up, ran outside the Tabernacle, and said, "I want to bring someone inside who would not have an opportunity to attend conference today." Accordingly, he went right to the end of the line, found a lovely young lady, and introduced himself. After she had introduced herself as a student from Ricks College, he brought her inside and gave her the privilege of sitting in the seat that his wife would have occupied were she alive. During the session, he glanced over to look at her and observed tears streaming down her face. Afterward he went over and said, "I noticed that you were crying." "I had lost my testimony," she explained. "I thought, 'One last chance--I'm going to come to Salt Lake to attend general conference, and perhaps then I'll know the gospel is true' and then you came out and singled me from the crowd, brought me in, and sat me here. Even though I appreciate the great words that were spoken this day, it was your kindly act that let me know the gospel of Jesus Christ is true." Each conference time, she writes a letter to Elder Perry, thanking him for his kindness.<br><br>Fourth, there are characteristics that need to be developed. What are they? The first is this: courage. I would suspect that a number of you know Jim Moss; he teaches here. I would like to share with you two instances of courage from his life in order that you will know by his example what I mean.<br><br>The first occurred at that educational institution north of here by some forty-five miles--Brigham Young established that school also, I hasten to add. Jim was student body president there; and, because there are so many there that do not believe or do not understand, he searched for a way to teach the gospel of Jesus Christ. The idea came to Jim to honor President David O. McKay as one of their great graduates. He shared that with other student leaders, many of whom were not members of the Church, and they too became enthusiastic. So for one week, the life of David O. McKay, the things that he had taught, and the things that he knew to be true were written in the student newspaper, the<i>Daily Chronicle</i>. In a mass teaching effort, thousands learned something about the gospel of Jesus Christ because of the courage of Jim Moss, whose imaginative mind wanted to teach the gospel to others.<br><br>I will tell you another story about Jim. After a marvelous mission, he finished an outstanding career as an undergraduate. From there he went to Stanford, graduated in law, and received many fine offers to labor in top law firms. But Jim wanted to teach young people, and so from law school he became a seminary teacher. Now, of course, he is blessing us by his time here.<br><br>Another example of courage happened just a few days ago. While I was in one of our great Eastern cities, a young woman came to me and said, "This will be the most difficult half-hour I have ever spent; but I want to go on a mission, and I have not lived a worthy life. I must tell you what I have done; I must confess."<br><br>As we sat there, the tears fell from her eyes as she told of a life that had been very difficult. Her relations with her father were almost unbelievable. She had experienced difficulty all through junior high school, high school, and college. But she wanted to live the way she knew she could, the way the Savior wanted her to live; she wanted to tell others about this great gospel of Jesus Christ. Therefore, with all the courage she had and in a very awkward way, she confessed in order that she might serve and live free.<br><br>Another example: A missionary in Pennsylvania came to me and said, "President, there is something I have not confessed--when I was a young man, I often stole." "How much did you steal, elder?" "Oh, five or six hundred dollars worth of merchandise and sometimes money." "Can you remember when you stole and from whom you stole?" "Yes, I can."<br><br>I said, "Then pay it back." The Spirit whispered to both of us that that is what he needed to do. "That means, elder, that you can't serve as a leader since you can't have an automobile, because every time you have another three or four or five dollars, you're to send it home."<br><br>He replied, "I understand, president." Because of his family and other personal considerations, he said, "I can't go to the people I stole from until I return. Would you mail the money back to them?" I said yes; and so I sent envelopes to my friends living in Chicago, New York, Pittsburgh, Saint Louis, and other cities, who would then forward the money in plain envelopes postmarked in cities far distant from where this elder was laboring.<br><br>About a year ago, I had the opportunity of sealing that young man in the temple; and one of the things he said was that the day his life really changed was when he had made full restitution. The Lord blessed him; he needed him to serve as a leader, but not for many months, because he needed to pay back that which he had taken.<br><br>Another characteristic that we must develop is that of personal authenticity. A number of years ago, at Universal International Studios, I watched the filming of television programs and movies. It was delightful, with one exception. Everything that I saw was false--the sheriff's office, the jail, even the running rivers and sagebrush were made from plastic. As I was observing this artificiality, a beautiful young television star came up and asked, "How do you like what you see here?" "I love it," I answered, "and I'm enjoying my self; but I'm sort of disappointed because everything is false."<br><br>She looked up and said, "But that's why we must be so real. The audience must focus on us."<br><br>And then I thought, "Oh, how true that is with life!" Almost everything we see outside in the world, brothers and sisters, is false; it is misdirected. That is why we must be so real, why we must be so honest, why integrity must be tattooed upon the spirits of us all.<br><br>In conclusion, brothers and sisters, there are acts that need doing. You are the most adequately trained college people the world has ever known. You have not only the finest training available, but also the gospel of Jesus Christ; these form a combination that cannot be found anywhere else. Therefore, the acts that you do today, tomorrow, and forever will affect countless others. What are these acts? The first is this: Being worthy. Staying worthy is a daily task. One of the saddest situations that I have observed lately is that of a marvelous man--top in his field, a wonderful Church leader--who, within twenty minutes during a period of discouragement, injured himself, hurt all of us that know him and love him, injured those in his profession, and impeded the direction of the Kingdom. He did not work to remain worthy every day. He slipped just once.<br><br>I am sure a number of you are familiar with John Greenleaf Whittier's poem "Maud Muller," which tells the story of a farm girl who had fallen in love with an attorney. (Dallin, that is a dangerous procedure at any time.) The attorney thought, "Well, perhaps I'd be more comfortable at home"; and she thought, "Well, I know I'll be more comfortable with my friends in the rural setting." Despite their love for each other, they did not marry. The years quickly came and went as they do, brothers and sisters, and the poem ends this way:<br><br><i>God pity them both! and pity us all,</i><br><i>Who vainly the dreams of youth recall.</i><br><i>For of all sad words of tongue or pen,</i><br><i>The saddest are these: "It might have been!"</i><br>[L1. 103–6]<br><br>So many "might have been's" in life are tied directly to our remaining worthy.<br><br>It has been said that when your heart tells you things of which your mind is not sure, the Spirit is guiding you. If you will live the gospel of Jesus Christ every day, your future will be exciting and peaceful, and all of your innate potentialities will be realized.<br><br>What are some of the other acts that need doing? Life is here to be lived. Jump in; never stand off at the side, watching things happen. It is far better to be an awkward, struggling performer than to be a secure observer. Just the very act of living life should make our time on earth exciting, meaningful,and full of learning.<br><br>Another act that needs doing is the seeking out and developing of meaningful friendships and relationships. Some of my most enjoyable hours are spent with friends that I met when I was your age. Dr. H. Gill Hilton, Dr. Barbara Vance, Dr. James T. Duke, and a number of others at this institution are friends from twenty and twenty-five years ago. I shudder sometimes as I wonder, "What if those relationships had not been developed? What if those delightful people had not made the effort to be friends to me, and what if I had not expended the energy to earn their friendships?" These acts that require an expenditure of energy are the acts that need doing.<br><br>The great battles of this world often are not fought on the front lines but back in the general's tent, where tears are shed as difficult decisions are made that mean the expenditure of lives and equipment. Still, those battles must be fought. Your great battles should not be fought in the back seat of automobiles when sexual temptation or moral conflicts are at their strongest; these great battles should be fought and problems overcome back in the general's tent. You must decide ahead of time how you are going to live; after the decision is made, all is easy. You will be able to travel in circles of people anywhere you feel secure, because you know that you will live the Word of Wisdom. Financially you will be secure because you know you will live an honest life and pay your tithes and offerings. You know from this moment on that you will live a secure life sexually because you have decided that there is a time and a place for everything. Make those decisions now, brothers and sisters, so that when you are on the battlefield all of the tough decisions will have already been made.<br><br>I would like to finish by sharing an experience that I had here last December. I came down at Christmas time and spoke to a small group of students; and sometime during my talk I made this comment: "The Lord forgives us in a millionth of a millisecond." I had talked of repentance, but only for a moment. Afterward a young man came up and said, "I don't believe I'm forgiven; I don't think what you said is right, Elder Pinnock."<br><br>I replied. "Well, perhaps I made a mistake--the Savior forgives us instantly. It doesn't even take him a millionth of a millisecond."<br><br>The young man faded away, and I went out and got into the automobile and drove home. Several days later the telephone rang and he reintroduced himself. "I'm the young man that questioned whether I had been forgiven or not."<br><br>I said, "You were forgiven, if . . ." and we reviewed the steps. "Oh yes," he said. "I've talked to my bishop. I have not reverted to those things I did before." "Then you are forgiven," I told him.<br><br>But the telephone rang once again. This time I said, "Listen, dummy, you are forgiven." But oh, how he wanted that feeling, and what a struggle he was having to obtain it!<br><br>Perhaps one of the acts that we need to do even today is to clear our life from the seaweed that sometimes hangs onto it. If your transgression was serious, go to your bishop and talk with him; bishops are a marvelously equipped group of men serving the Master. You are not fair to your spirit, you are not fair to your friends or to your eternal self, and you are certainly not fair to the Savior if you carry upon your shoulders unresolved sins. May I finish by pleading with you to put your lives in order and to do all the things that we have discussed today and the other things that you know you must do, in the name of Jesus Christ, our Master. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Hugh W.

<br>
President Oaks and members of your leadership here, members of the faculty, and students: It is a privilege and an honor to be here at Brigham Young University. It is unfortunate that not all who would like to attend this University are able to attend. In fact, it is a very limited number that can attend.<br><br>We want to do a little thinking tonight on matters about which we have already thought many times. When we leave I hope that we feel a little better about who we are and what the Lord expects of us than we did when we came in. I hope that this time will be spent under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit.<br><br>You are students deeply involved in the study of Jesus Christ as well as in the study of the main subject matters of the courses you are taking. You remember that the Lord said, "What shall a man give in exchange for his soul?" (Mark 8:37). You could be the most brilliant student in this institution and still fail unless you accomplish on this earth what you came to the earth to accomplish.<br><br>I am going to mention just two or three elementary matters that most of you have memorized. We should often read and recall the words of the Lord regarding the creation of man. Most of you were not here on the earth as a mortal being until just a few years ago. This most sacred information about you and your mortal body is recorded in the first chapter of the Holy Bible. (I think the good Lord expected his children to read at least the first chapter; that they would let them know who they are and why they were placed here and what, in part, he expected of them. Then, if they developed enough enthusiasm from that, they could go on and read much more deeply.)<br><br>"And God said ..." Nowhere in the universe is there a greater source of information for mankind than God; when God speaks we should pay attention, and his words should have a governing effect in our lives. The Lord said,<br><br><i>For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, saith the Lord.</i><br><br><i>For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways, and my thoughts than your thoughts.</i>[Isaiah 55:8–9]<br><br><i>And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: ...</i><br><br><i>So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.</i><br><br>You can memorize it in just a moment, but you cannot put it into the heart and the soul and the governing powers of your mind and body until it penetrates deep enough for you to realize your relationship to God. "And God blessed them, and God said unto them,<i>Be fruitful, and multiply</i>,<i>and replenish the earth, and subdue it"</i>(Genesis 1:26–28, emphasis added). For if you do not subdue this earth, it will subdue you. I hope you heard that.<br><br>The Lord is the one who gave the commandment for His children to subdue the earth. Remember that this injunction comes from a sacred source of truth and thus means much more than just casual understanding. This is the most important and most sacred information there is about the origin and purpose of man. The Lord said, "I have made the earth, and created man upon it: I, even my hands, have stretched out the heavens, and all their host have I commanded" (Isaiah 45:12). And from the Book of Mormon we read, "Behold, the Lord hath created the earth that it should be inhabited;<i>and he hath created his children that they should possess it"</i>(1 Nephi 17:36, emphasis added).<br><br>I asked one of the Brigham Young University students if he had any evidence that God lived. He said, "Yes, I have a testimony."<br><br>"I then asked him, "When you were being formed as a baby inside of your mother, who performed that creation?"<br><br>And he replied, "God."<br><br>Except for Jesus, there has never been a mortal man or a mortal woman on this earth that could create even a hair that would live. I have been looking for such a person for a long time. [Laughter] I asked this young man further, "Who created your brain?"<br><br>He said, "God."<br><br>"Who created your eyes, ears, nose, hands, legs, and all the mortal parts of your body?"<br><br>He answered that God had created them inside of his mother.<br><br>"Who created your earthly mother and father and all the people that live on the earth?"<br><br>He answered, "God; only God knows how to create a living human soul that is in the image and likeness of God with Jesus Christ as the great example."<br><br>If someone had asked you the question, "Do you have any evidence that there is a God?" what would you have said? The Lord has given us so much evidence that we are left without excuses. You are each a product of divine power.<br><br>"Who keeps the earth and all that pertains to the earth so that God's children can live upon it?" I asked the young man.<br><br>His answer was brief: "God."<br><br>"What is God's greatest creation on this earth?"<br><br>He answered, "Man; male and female."<br><br>"How much do you owe God?"<br><br>"I owe God for everything I have that is purposeful and good."<br><br>"Did God counsel His children that He had placed the devil with legions of evil helpers on this earth?"<br><br>"Yes."<br><br>"Did God send the devil with his legions to this earth and give them power to tempt mankind to see if man would be obedient to the ways of God or obedient to the ungodly, evil ways of the devil?"<br><br>His answer was, "Yes, God placed the devil and his legions upon this earth, and they have power to deceive and to tempt men when they will not follow the Lord Jesus Christ and God's program of life."<br><br>I asked, "How much do you owe the devil?"<br><br>He answered, "I don't owe the devil for anything."<br><br>"Does the devil or any of his helpers ever tempt you?"<br><br>He replied, "I am often tempted to do things contrary to the commandments and the will of God."<br><br>You remember that when the devil tempted Jesus Christ with his ungodly, deceitful ways, Jesus rebuked him and commanded that he get behind Him. The devil obeyed Jesus. This is one of the great lessons that Jesus taught man. Each of you must love God and His teachings so that you, with authority, can tell the devil to get behind you. Do not sell your godly birthright to the devil, who is a deceitful, ungodly liar. And that is about as strongly as I can express my self without using other language.<br><br>But the devil is real--just as real as you are. And Jesus Christ is just as real as you are--He is no myth. You do not have to go to any philosopher. You do not have to go to Darwin, who was created inside of his mother just the same as you, or to anyone else to find out about you. Go to the Creator; go to God. It has been written down, and you will be held responsible for the information that he has given us.<br><br>I again asked this BYU student, "How much do you owe God?"<br><br>He said, "I owe God for everything that I have that is good."<br><br>"How much do you owe the devil?"<br><br>And again he answered, "I do not owe the devil for anything." I had him repeat that.<br><br>"The devil will continually try to get us to disrespect and disregard God's commandments. Therefore, in order to become godlike, you must love and respect God and not heed in any way the evil, ungodly temptations of the devil. The apostle James made this promise recorded in the Bible: "Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you" (James 4:7). The devil does not have power over those that follow Jesus Christ; the best protection that you can gain in this life is to be on the team of the Savior.<br><br>Our Heavenly Father directed and assigned Jesus Christ to be the God over this earth and to be the Savior and the example for God's children to follow. As you know, Jesus being the Son of God, had his mortal body created and formed just like yours inside of his mother, Mary. He was born a baby, grew to manhood on this earth, and represented his Heavenly Father in all of God's earthly programs. Jesus said:<br><br><i>I came down from heaven, not to do mine own will, but the will of him that sent me. ...</i><br><br><i>And this is the will of him that sent me, that every one which seeth the Son, and believeth on him, may have everlasting life: and I will raise him up at the last day.</i>[John 6:38, 40]<br><br>He taught men that their Heavenly Father had provided one way and only one way for His children to come unto Him and to return to the kingdom of heaven. This is not a program of philosophy of men, but a program of God, and it is as clear as can be when you examine the commandments of the Lord.<br><br>Jesus said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me" (John 14:6). As you know, if we desire God's ways and program for mortal life, we can find them in the life and teachings of Jesus Christ. Jesus taught God's children, and His teachings are recorded in His holy scripture; and they tell us that Heavenly Father has provided one way and only one way for His children to live on this earth--I repeat,<i>one way</i>--that would prepare them to return after death, and the resurrection, to the kingdom of God. If we want God's way of life as we live on this earth, we should follow the example and teaching of Jesus Christ. If we desire to know the purposes of death and the resurrection, we can learn about them through the life, teachings, and example of our Savior Jesus Christ.<br><br>Jesus Christ's birth was sacred. His mortal life was sacred. His teachings and example are sacred. His atonement and death were sacred. His resurrection from death to immortality was sacred. His ascension and return to the kingdom of God were very sacred. His membership in the Godhead is most important and most sacred.<br><br>Because of what we owe God--for all that we have that is good--He asked us to keep our hearts and minds in order by loving Him first. This is a command that we all know: "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind." It does not leave anything out. We should love God first with all the power that we have in the human soul. This keeps a child of God in a godly type of order.<br><br><i>This is the first and great commandment.</i><br><br><i>And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.</i>[Matthew 22:37–39]<br><br>Do you know that there are some of the Lord's children that do not like others of His children? They have enemies--people that they do not like. Can you imagine a child of God in the image of God not liking one of God's children? You have a brain like deity, and sometimes you can get into some very interesting circumstances. Remember this: If you ever feel so big and so great that you want to dislike one of the Lord's children, get yourself a wheelbarrow full of dirt and see what you can do with it. It will have a way of humbling you like you have never been humbled before.<br><br>To love God first is one of the most important and orderly laws that God has ever given man. This law will keep man closer to Heavenly Father and to His ways than any other commandment. But to love God first requires constant thought and effort, with prayer, gratitude, and affectionate appreciation. Our prayers should help us to be closer and more loving to our Heavenly Father. Jesus Christ was very close to his Father in Heaven, through the principle of prayer.<br><br>Some of us spend five or ten minutes in prayer; the Savior--we have a record of it--once prayed all night. He was literally a God in his own right, but He still wanted to talk for long periods of time with His Heavenly Father. He set the example for each of us to pray often to our Heavenly Father. He commanded, "After this manner therefore pray ye: Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name." Is that how you pray? It is a commandment. Hear the next part of it. The next thing you say to the Lord is, "Thy kingdom come"--you talk to the Lord about building His kingdom. You might as well add, "A little later, Father in Heaven, I'll get up off my knees and help build it." When you pray, "Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven," you had better mean if from the heart. This is part of the great commandment of the Lord's prayer. (See Matthew 6:9–13.) It has meaning when you utter it to your Heavenly Father. We have been asked by Jesus Christ to do His will and to help build His church and kingdom on this earth.<br><br>I would like to repeat God's most important commandment because of its power to fill, comfort, and mend many broken hearts and to ease the daily problems and difficulties of this life. It is to love God first. It requires constant effort to love God with all one's heart, might, mind, and strength.<br><br>Because of the devil and his evil, ungodly ways, we have been asked by the Lord to put on the whole armor of God. Hear these beautiful messages; they are as old as old. We must put on the whole armor of God to protect our love for God and to shield our godlike bodies from the evil, worldly ways that would take us away from loving God first and from following Jesus Christ.<br><br>The Lord warned man to stay as a little child. We are only infants in our progression toward godhood, but some of us take our godlike brains and fabricate ourselves a philosophy were we feel that we do not need our Heavenly Father or a savior as far as living in mortality is concerned.<br><br>The apostle Paul was inspired to give this important counsel. Again, you have read it; but it bears repeating. I like repetition. I have been breathing for over seventy years and still like it. I have been eating for over seventy years and still like it. The same goes for sleeping. Why, if you took the repetitious things out of my life, I would be all through. Some of us cannot stand to hear a few scriptures over a few times; we say, "Oh, I already know those." Do we know them to the extent that they put godliness into out character? Do we know them to the extent that they have brought out our divine nature?<br><br>Hear this great message from the Lord through Paul:<br><br><i>For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities against powers, against the rulers of darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.</i>[It is going on today, too.]<br><br><i>Wherefore, take unto you the whole armor of God, that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day. ...</i><br><br><i>Stand therefore, having your loins girt about with truth, and having on the breastplate of righteousness;</i><br><br><i>And your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace;</i><br><br><i>Above all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked.</i><br><br><i>And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God:</i><br><br><i>Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit.</i>[Ephesians 6:12–18]<br><br>By putting on the whole armor of God, you build godliness into your life and protect yourself against the ungodly ways of the devil and unholy men. Your sex appetites will be under godlike control if you put on the whole armor of God. Sex destroys the godliness in many people--a high percentage of the Lord's children. And you will find perfection coming unto you if you put on the whole armor of God--perfection will come into your mind and your body as Jesus Commanded when He said, "Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect" (Matthew 5:48). Every law of God that you live and keep adds that much perfection to your life. You can be just as perfect in keeping a law as Jesus was. It is those laws we fail to keep that bring out the imperfections.<br><br>I was asked what one needs to do in this life to put on the whole armor of god so as to be prepared to enter into the kingdom of god after death and resurrection. In answer to this important question, I referred to the scriptures and wrote down twenty-six basic requirements for entrance into the kingdom of God. As I list requirements, there may be some repetition; but as I have said, I like repetition.<br><br>1. Jesus was asked, "Master, which is the great commandment in the law?"<br><br>I have already cited his answer: "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind." (Matthew 22:37–38.) Master this principle. You will never be the same once you get it into your soul so that it is rooted there and begins to manage you.<br><br>Jesus counseled man, "If thou lovest me thou shalt serve me and keep all my commandments" (D&amp;amp;C 42:29). All of God's commandments were given by Jesus Christ and are recorded in the holy scriptures. They are not at all secondhand. Every commandment that you are required to live to enter into the kingdom of heaven was given by the Lord himself. They are not secondhand.<br><br>2. "Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself" (Matthew 22:39). As a child of God you should love and respect yourself. You should also love and help all of God's mortal children whenever you have the opportunity. Help them to know and love God and to know and keep His commandments. Every Latter-day Saint has the responsibility of missionary work.<br><br>3. You must know about your relationship to God: the fact that you are a child of God; that you were created by God; and that you are literally in God' own image and likeness. As I have already mentioned, Jesus Christ is our great example.<br><br>4. You must know the only true and living God and Jesus Christ. Jesus said, "And this is life eternal, that they may know thee, the only true god, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent" (John 17:3). That is the great purpose of life: to know our Heavenly Father and our Savior. It will not take away from your profession; it will add stature to your character.<br><br>The apostle John gives us the key for testing our knowledge of God. Hear this. If I were to ask you the question, "Do you know God?" what would your answer be? The apostle John gives us a clue here.<br><br><i>And hereby we do know that we know him, if we keep his commandments.</i><br><br><i>He that saith, I know him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is</i><br><br><i>not in him.</i>[1 John 2:3–4]<br><br>5. Jesus commanded, "Seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness"<br><br>(Matthew 6:33). Is that your goal, or is your profession your goal? Is it money or is it godliness that you seek? Which accomplished your purpose on earth? Jesus warned man against putting earthly treasures ahead of God's righteousness:<br><br><i>Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt, and</i><br><br><i>where thieves break through and steal:</i><br><br><i>But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor steal:</i><br><br><i>For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.</i>[Matthew 6:19–21]<br><br>6. (And I must hurry.) You need to follow the Jesus Christ of the New Testament and the Jesus Christ of all of God's holy scriptures. Jesus declared unto man, "I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me" (John 14:6). There is no other way--only through the living Savior. Jesus warned men against false gods and false Christs. He said,<br><br><i>For many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and shall deceive many. ...</i><br><br><i>For there shall arise false Christs, and false prophets, and shall shew great signs and</i><br><br><i>wonders; insomuch that, if it were possible, they shall deceive the very elect.</i>[Matthew 24:5, 24]<br><br>We must also follow the teachings of the Lord's past and living prophets and apostles, who emphasize and reemphasize the Lord's commandments.<br><br>7. You must strive for divine perfection. Jesus said, "Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect." Many of you have gained perfection in many parts of the Lord's program. The way to perfection comes by following Jesus Christ and by living His doctrine and commandments as recorded in His holy scriptures.<br><br>8. You must have faith. Faith is the first principle of the gospel of Jesus Christ. The scriptures tell us, "Now the just shall live by faith" (Hebrews 10:38). "But without faith it is impossible to please [God,]" the scriptures teach us (Hebrews 11:6).<br><br>9. We must pray to a living personal Father in Heaven through Jesus Christ, our mediator. Jesus stated, "No man cometh unto the Father, but by me." He also promised each of us, "Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you." All three of these actions--asking, seeking, and knocking--require prayer from the heart. Such prayer has tremendous meaning, and the Lord knows that it indicates the development of the human soul of the one praying. "For every one that asketh receiveth;" the Lord said, "And he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened." (Matthew 7:7–8.)<br><br>10. You must continually use the divine principle of repentance. Divine perfection and godliness come through continued and full repentance. If I were to ask you the question, "When did you use it last?" what would your answer be? Not a day should go by when we do not use this principle, because repentance takes out weakness and imperfection and also causes us to be more interested in the things that God wants us to learn and to know and to live. Prayer can rid us of both the sins and weaknesses of omission and the sins of commission that we have.<br><br>Jesus commanded, "Repent: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand" (Matthew 4:17). This was the first commandment He gave when He started His ministry on the earth. He also said, "Behold, he who has repented of his sins, the same is forgiven, and I, the Lord, remember them no more." Can you think of a greater promise in all the scriptures? "By this ye may know if a man repenteth of his sins--behold, he will confess them and forsake them." (D&amp;amp;C 58:42–43.)<br><br>11. You must be baptized in water by immersion the way Jesus was baptized at the River Jordan. This was a most sacred occasion, one of the very few--and maybe the only one--where all three members of the Godhead appeared at the same time. You remember that our Heavenly Father was represented in voice, the Holy Ghost was represented, and the Savior was coming up out of the water.<br><br><i>And Jesus, when he was baptized, went up straightway out of the water: And, lo, the heavens where opened unto him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove, and lighting upon him:</i><br><br><i>And lo a voice from heaven, saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.</i>[Matthew 3:16–17]<br><br>Your Father in Heaven and the Holy Ghost were also pleased when you were baptized; and I am talking to literally thousands that have been baptized by the proper authority. Jesus said, "Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God" (John 3:5).<br><br>People do not believe that the scriptures tell the story any more. There is no source on this earth as clear as the scriptures of God are about salvation and the purposes of man's life and mission here on the earth.<br><br>12. You must be born of the Spirit by receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost, by the laying on of hands, from one holding the priesthood of God--the Melchizedek Priesthood.<br><br>13. You must be morally and mentally clean. Your thoughts must be clean and pure. Jesus said, "Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God" (Matthew 5:8), Most of you have heard this marvelous message from the Lord on cleanliness time and again, but let me repeat it.<br><br><i>Let virtue garnish thy thoughts unceasingly; then shall thy confidence wax strong in the presence of God; and the doctrine of the priesthood shall distil upon thy soul as the dews from heaven.</i><br><br><i>The Holy Ghost shall be thy constant companion, and thy scepter an unchanging scepter of righteousness and truth; and thy dominion shall be an everlasting dominion, and without compulsory means it shall flow unto thee forever and ever.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 121:45–46]<br><br>Self-control in a divine way is God's way for man to attain perfection, godliness, and eternal life in the kingdom of God. But If you only have the self-control of a beast, you will not be morally clean. Some of us at times almost reduce ourselves to animal stature.<br><br>14. It is written in the holy Bible, "Precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of his saints" (Psalms 116:15). Can you imagine that being in the scriptures? I was at a funeral the other day and used that text. And why would the death of His saints be "precious in the sight of the Lord"? Because they have arrived; they have come back to him saintly. They have heeded his words. They have not taken their great, powerful, godlike brains and fabricated a philosophy of their own. They have stayed close to their Creator.<br><br>15. You must be valiant. Good, clean people that are not valiant will not go to the celestial kingdom of heaven but will go to the terrestrial kingdom of glory. You can read this in the seventy-sixth section of the Doctrine and Covenants. Speaking of those in the terrestrial kingdom, Jesus said, "These are they who are not valiant in the testimony of Jesus; wherefore, they obtain not the crown over the kingdom of our God" (D&amp;amp;C 76:79).<br><br>You remember the parable of the ten virgins. That is one of the most interesting parables you will ever read. It is not about five bad people and five good people; it is about ten pure people--all wanting to enter with the Lord, all wanting to be with Him. Apparently they all had testimonies, but five had time to do service to the Lord, to do the things that He had asked them to do, and five were too busy. But they all had testimonies. Have you ever had any experience with that?<br><br>Five entered the kingdom, and five came back a little later and knocked on the door. But the Lord said, "I do not know you." It hardly seems Christian, does it? Do you know why He did not know them? Because they did not know the Lord when they had a chance to know Him. They were too busy--too busy with worldly interests, or too busy, I guess, just being virgins. There is nothing wrong with that, but you had better be careful that you also follow the plan of the Lord; because when the Lord says, "I do not know you" when you knock on his door, I think it has tremendous meaning. And such a case is recorded in his sacred scriptures.<br><br>16. You need to love and honor your earthly father and mother, your brothers and sisters, your wife or your husband, and your children. You truly need to love God's greatest creation, His children.<br><br>I am going to make a statement here, even though I said that I would hurry. The Lord only made one like you--only one. That is the pattern of the Lord. That is interesting, is it not? Some of us do not like what He did; we think that He made someone else just a little better because He placed their eyes a little farther apart or some such thing. But He has asked us to love all of His children--although of course, there are some that have many more problems than others.<br><br>17. You need to master the ability to be a peacemaker. Jesus said, "Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called the children of God" (Matthew 5:9). Are you a peacemaker?<br><br>18. You must not blaspheme against the Holy Ghost nor take the name of God in vain (Exodus 20:7).<br><br>19. You must be honest with God and man. Tithing is a law and commandment of God. The Lord asked this question: "Will a man rob God?" Are there any within the sound of my voice that would rob Him? The Lord has said that if a man robs God by not paying his tithes and offerings he will not be able to enter the Kingdom; He said, in fact, "Ye are cursed with a curse" (Malachi 3:8, 9).<br><br>If you want to read an interesting commandment, read that one. Reread it because some of you will be tempted, saying that the Lord's church has plenty. But there is not one thing that you will ever have that God has not provided. If you rob God, the Lord has asked you to repent of it.<br><br>20. You must "remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy," for "the Lord blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it" (Exodus 20:8, 11). On the Sabbath day, man is to humbly and worthily partake of the sacrament and take upon him the name of Jesus Christ and renew his sacred covenants with the Lord. It only takes about one week to forget some of the things we should remember. The Lord has asked us to come back weekly and participate. The sacrament prayers are so important and sacred that the Lord personally revealed them to His children. They came from heaven. You know them well, so I shall not repeat them.<br><br>21. You must read and know all of God's holy commandments. You should read the scriptures every day. Even if you read only one verse, it is a habit that had to be built. "Search the scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life: and they are they which testify of me" (John 5:39). And we will not be held accountable for anything that is not recorded in the scriptures.<br><br>22. To qualify for entrance into the kingdom of heaven you must put on the whole armor of God, as I mentioned earlier in my remarks. Jesus Christ even repeated the analogy of putting on the whole armor of God when he spoke to the Prophet Joseph Smith, and it is recorded in the modern-day scriptures as well as in those of ancient times.<br><br>23. You should not be guilty of murder.<br><br>24. Mortal death is required before the resurrection and before entrance into the kingdom of God. Death is part of God's plan for man's progression in eternal life. A prophet of God said,<br><br><i>For since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection of the dead.</i><br><br><i>For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive.</i>[1 Corinthians 15:21–22]<br><br>These are scriptures that you know and know well.<br><br>25. You must qualify to come forth in the first resurrection--the resurrection of the just, which will take place before and after the opening of the Millennium. Some think that the Savior will come to open the Millennium, but we read in the Doctrine and Covenants that He will come after the Millennium opens.<br><br>26. On judgment day you will be judged by the Lord from His commandments that are recorded in His holy scriptures. You shall take on the heavenly light of life and be prepared to enter and live in the presence of God in His heavenly kingdom. Jesus said: "In my Father's house are many mansions" (John 14:2). If you are to qualify for the higher mansions in the kingdom of heaven, you must partake of the sealing powers and covenants and blessings that are performed by His priesthood in one of His holy temples.<br><br>President Kimball offers this information:<br><br><i>The road of life is plainly marked according to the divine purpose; the map of the gospel of Jesus Christ is made available to the travelers; the destination of eternal life is clearly established. At that destination our Father waits hopefully, anxious to greet His returning children. Unfortunately many will not arrive.</i><br><br>They will be too busy. The prophet Nephi added, "There cannot any unclean thing enter the kingdom of God" (1 Nephi 15:34).<br><br>I would like to read a statement from the Doctrine and Covenants, a very interesting passage found in the sixth section, verses twelve and thirteen. The Lord said,<br><br><i>Trifle not with sacred things.</i><br><br><i>If thou wilt do good, yea, and hold out faithful to the end, thou shalt be saved in the kingdom of God, which is the greater of all the gifts of God; for there is no gift greater than the gift of salvation.</i><br><br>That is what we are working and striving to gain.<br><br>May the Lord bless us to be about our Father's business. May you be great students. There is no university in all the world with more students that respect God than Brigham Young University. I was talking to a professor from here just the other day. He had come from another university, taking a cut in pay of almost half of what he had been getting at the other university, because he wanted to be at the Lord's university. He preferred to live a little more humbly and a little more happily in the Lord's university than with a little more money outside of it. Are you that way?<br><br>May the Lord bless us to be about our Father's business and to love God with all our heart, might, mind, and strength. It is a great blessing even to be in the atmosphere of this University. There is no place like it in purpose anywhere on earth.<br><br>I bear testimony to you that God lives. He is so close to us nowadays, in these latter days, that sometimes we can almost see His hand in operation. You ought to see how the world is opening up. Keep your eyes on how the nations of the earth where Communists now control will open up to missionary work. Keep your eyes on them; it will come in your time. It is quite likely that the coming of the Lord will be in your time, too. I hope you heard that. Will you be ready? Or will you be chasing money or something else?<br><br>I bear witness to the power and reality of God and to the latter-days--for we are in the last of the latter days. The latter days have lasted well over a thousand years, and we are living in the last few.<br><br>In the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Bernard P.

<h1>o You: Generation of Destiny! - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
My beloved brethren and sisters--President Oaks, this outstanding faculty, and you wonderful students--I feel highly honored to be here on this beautiful campus of Brigham Young University. I love and esteem and respect this great University for the wonderful ideals that it teaches and promotes in the world today. I pray that I may have that same spirit that my beloved friend and brother Milton Backman asked for in his beautiful prayer.<br><br>You have all heard, I suppose, about the<i>Guinness Book of World Records</i>. It tabulates all sorts of unique and amazing things ranging from the ridiculous to the sublime, such as what snake has the longest fangs; who has gone the longest period without solid food; who has the largest mushroom farm in the world; who grew the lemon with the greatest circumference; what person demonstrates the largest chest measurement; who set the record for eating the most bananas in ten minutes; what it is that human beings fear most; who lost the most weight in the shortest time; and so on, ad infinitum.<br><br>Looking at the list so far, I must admit that there is not very much in evidence that is truly sublime. Rather than desiring solid achievement, too many people are captured by the uncontrollable passion for notoriety, publicity, and sheer power of any kind--however futile, foolhardy, or fatal. For utter futility and absurdity consider this: a group of college students, intent on getting in Guinness's record book, sponsored a widely publicized thumb-twiddling contest. One young man was proclaimed the champion thumb-twiddler in all the world. He had twiddled his thumbs without interruption for more than twenty hours. It is quite likely that these students had never heard of or at least had never taken seriously the advice of Benjamin Franklin, one of the wisest of Americans. He warned: "Do not squander time, for that is the stuff life is made of."<br><br>Right in line with Franklin's stern pronouncement is a memorable legend. A sage of great wisdom was asked by an inquisitive young man, "What is the greatest gift in the world?"<br><br>"The greatest gift in the world? What that, my son," replied the sage without hesitation, "would be to have all the time you need" (Robert R. Upegraft,<i>All the Time You Need: The Greatest Gift in the World</i>[Englewood Cliffs, N.J." Prentice-Hall, 1960], p.1).<br><br>But, mark you, such a measure of time can be given to no one. Each of us must help himself to his portion and learn to use it wisely, else many blessings of this most precious gift will be denied him. For every human being, time is a resource--indeed, a unique resource. It can neither be accumulated like money nor stockpiled like raw materials. We are forced and compelled to spend it at a fixed rate of sixty seconds every minute; it passes at this predetermined rate no matter what we do. We have no choice, no freedom or free agency in this regard. Time, unlike water or practically anything else one can name, can neither be turned off nor replaced. No spigot can be installed to regulate and control its flow, as can be done with water, and no refilling device may be applied to replenish the quantity. And it is now and always irretrievable.<br><br>The question is not one of managing the clock, but one of managing ourselves with respect to the clock. In essence, time is the most unrelenting and inelastic element in our entire existence. As Peter Drucker, distinguished management consultant, has said, time is the scarcest resource; and unless it is managed, nothing else can be managed. It is, then not how much we have, but rather what we do with what we have. (Peter Drucker, "How to Be an Effective Executive,"<i>Nation's Business 49</i>, no.4 [April 1961]: 44.)<br><br>The proper use of time implies an understanding of two basic concepts that most of us have been slow to grasp. Concept number one is the haunting thought that time carries no guarantee that it will serve us; it is merely made available to us. Concept number two is the reality that it remains for each one of us, alone and singly, to learn how to get the most out of the passing hours, days, weeks, months, and even eternity.<br><br>In this context, the T in<i>time</i>stands for the tenacity to achieve worthy ideals and goals. Thus, instead of squandering time in senseless causes and useless pursuits--such as twiddling thumbs, or spending endless hours watching miscellaneous and all-too-often degrading television shows, or participating in other equally certain killers of the spark of life itself--we can productively engage ourselves in meaningful pursuits.<br><br>Here is the classic example of how we became what we are now and what we may ultimately become. Jesus taught that "the light of the body is the eye." This, in plain words, means that whatever we think, see, understand, conceive, and imagine acts as the instigator and forerunner of all of our actions. Jesus added, "If therefore thine eye--that is, understanding and imagination--"be single"--that is, tenaciously directed toward worthy goals and objectives-- then, says Jesus in these divine and lovely words, "thy whole body shall be full of light"--or the highest degree of insight and understanding, will-power and motivation, which constitute the sure road to supreme effort and thus to accomplishment and achievement.<br><br>Continuing, Jesus depicts the ultimate tragedy in these words: "But if thine eye"--understanding and purpose--"be evil, thy whole body shall be full of darkness. If therefore the light that is in thee be darkness. If therefore the light that is in thee be darkness, how great is that darkness!" (Matthew 6:22). Or, as another translator has expressed it, "If your eye is pure, there will be sunshine in your soul. But if your eye is clouded with evil thoughts and desires, you are in deep spiritual darkness. And oh, how deep that darkness can be" (Matthew 6:22 in<i>The Living Bible</i>[Wheaton, Ill.: Tyndale House Publishers, n.d.]).<br><br>Never in all philosophy has there been a clearer, stronger condemnation of self-willed arrogance, blindness in discerning the meaning and purpose of life, or even defiance of God himself. And in the sublime passage that follows, we read: "No man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon." (Matthew 6:23–24.) And in straight, unvarnished language mammon means anything that weakens reason or establishes the power of the body, with its physical hungers and appetites, over the spirit.<br><br>Jesus was not uncertain in any way about what he stood for. Every one of us should have etched on his mind and in his heart in this irreverent and materialistic world these immortal words of the Master Teacher: "The life is more than meat, and the body is more than raiment" (Luke 12:23).<br><br>A poor attitude, ignorance of the purpose of life on earth, a self-sufficient arrogance, and a spiritually chaotic and undisciplined life may be fickle, defeating, and tragic.<br><br><i>And he</i>[Jesus]<i>spake a parable unto them, saying, "The ground of a certain rich man brought forth plentifully:</i><br><br><i>And he thought within himself, saying, What shall I do, because I have no room where to bestow my fruits?</i><br><br><i>And he said, This will I do. I will pull down my barns, and build greater; and there will I bestow all my fruits and my goods.</i><br><br><i>And I will say to my soul, Soul, thou hast much goods laid up for many years; take thine ease, eat, drink, and be merry.</i><br><br><i>But God said unto him, Thou fool, this night thy soul shall be required of thee: then whose shall those things be, which thou hast provided?</i><br><br><i>So is he that layeth up treasure for himself, and is not rich toward God.</i>[Luke 12:16–21]<br><br>A modern translator has Jesus putting the same idea in these emphatic words: "Don't store up treasures here on earth where they can erode away or may be stolen. Store them in heaven where they will never lose their value. If your wealth is in heaven, your heart will be there, too. Yes, every man is a fool who gets rich on earth, but not in heaven" (Matthew 6:19 in<i>The Living Bible</i>).<br><br>Urging us to press on to higher and better things, our own President Spencer W. Kimball, in the concluding speech of the last conference, said, "We have paused on some plateaus long enough. Let us resume our journey, onward and upward. . . . We have been diverted at times from fundamentals on which we must now focus in order to move forward as a person or as a people." (Spencer W. Kimball, "Let Us Move Forward and Upward,"<i>Ensign</i>, May 1979, p. 82.) And one of the fundamentals that President Kimball is presently emphasizing is the full utilization of our time.<br><br>I recall an incident concerning our prophet that highlights this fundamental. Early in the morning several years ago, during an area conference in Amsterdam, I was waiting for an elevator. When it arrived and its door opened, to my surprise there stood President Kimball. In his usual warm and friendly way he said, "Step in and join me." We rode only to the next floor together, but in that short time of about thirty seconds he gave me enough challenges and assignments pertaining to our missionary labors in Europe to fully occupy my time for years to come. Since then, I have often wondered what the assignments and challenges might have been had we ridden another floor together.<br><br>My purpose thus far has been to make significant and urgent the phenomenon of the fleeting moments in our lives--the stuff of which both dreams and reality are made. Let us now listen to a word from Thoreau, American philosopher and immortalizer of Walden Pond: "If you have built castles in the air, your work need not be lost: That is where they should be. Now put a foundation under them."<br><br>The foundation might be described by words represented by the last three letters in the word<i>time</i>. These are integrity, morality, and example--qualities so lacking in nearly every stratum of our national life that General Omar Bradley of World War II fame brilliantly discussed the problem in these words:<br><br><i>Humanity is in danger of being trapped in this world by its mortal adolescence. Our knowledge of science had clearly outstripped our capacity to control it.</i><br><br><i>We have too many men of science: too few men of God.</i><br><br><i>We have grasped the mystery of the atom, and rejected the Sermon on the Mount.</i><br><br><i>Man is stumbling blindly, through spiritual darkness, while toying with the precarious secrets of life and death. The world has achieved brilliance without wisdom, power without conscience.</i><br><br><i>Ours is a world of nuclear giants and ethical infants.</i><br><br><i>We know more about war, than we know about peace, more about killing than we know about living</i>. [Omar Bradley, Armistice Day Speech, Boston, Massachusetts, November 11, 1948]<br><br>And Henry J. Taylor, noted news analyst of an era long gone, said this:<br><br><i>Essentially, the problem is one of integrity. In a home, in a business, in a nation, integrity is what upholds all. it is this weakening of integrity that seems to be the greatest illness everywhere. The grand corruption of our age, in fact, is the inability of so many eminent human beings the world over, to practice simple honesty, and speak, the simple truth.</i>[Henry J. taylor, Radio Address No. 288, "Let the Truth Be heard," from the series<i>Your Hand and Mine,</i>sponsored by General Motors]<br><br>Arnold Toynbee, a great scholar, studied twenty-six civilizations. Of these, sixteen are now dead, and nine of the remaining ten are broken down and in decline. His research shows that history is filled with the record of nations that rose to power and then died because their people lacked spirituality, courage, and integrity.<br><br>Jesus gave significance to a scathing word in our vocabulary that describes human inconstancies: he called this instability hypocrisy and the offenders hypocrites. Seldom have human beings so labeled been so harshly indicted. Said Jesus to those who profess and declare one thing and act in a compromising or opposite way:<br><br><i>Woe unto you, . . . hypocrites! for ye are like unto whited sepulchers, which indeed appear beautiful outward, but are within full of dead men's bones, and of all uncleanliness.</i><br><br><i>Even so ye also outwardly appear righteous unto men, but within ye are full of hypocrisy and iniquity.</i>[Matthew 23:27–28]<br><br>In Roman times, sculptors sometimes sought to conceal breaks and cracks in statues with melted beeswax. The purchaser, thus deceived and believing that he was buying a flawless piece of marble, would place such a statue proudly in his atrium. In a few weeks the beeswax would dry out, crumble away, and expose the ugly defects. This practice of beeswax trickery became so widespread that reputable sculptors guaranteed their works<i>sine cera</i>, which literally translated means "without wax." Our word sincere comes from this rebellion against the use of wax to deceive and to cheat.<br><br>Jesus cried out for followers who would spurn hypocrisy in both thought and deed, for disciples<i>sine cera</i>--sincere, engaged in cultivating and maintaining integrity and morality-- whose daily conduct would glorify the flawless example and of whom he would say, "Ye are the light of the world. A city that is set on an hill cannot be hid" (Matthew 5:14). Neither can a good example, nor its force and power.<br><br>Perhaps the poet summarizes more sulimely my feelings concerning that attitude and yearning which, if developed in each of us, will sustain--through example and integrity--morality in our own personal lives. Listen to the poet as he petitions our Heavenly Father for the essential help; these are his words:<br><br><i>My heart, dear God.</i><br><i>Give me a pure heart--</i><br><i>That I may see thee;</i><br><i>A humble heart--</i><br><i>That I may hear thee,</i><br><i>A heart of faith--</i><br><i>That I may abide in thee!</i>[Dag Hammarskjold,<i>Markings,</i>trans. Leif Sjoberg and W. H. Auden (New York: Knopf, 1966), p.100]<br><br>The term<i>generation gap</i>is constantly used to describe the chasm that may exist between youth and an older generation. A little thought, however, will expose the hoax in such a posture. We so often get tangled in words to the extent that the words become more important than the facts. In general semantics this is called "mistaking the map for the territory." And this is exactly what it is.<br><br>In our religion and our wonderful Church, there is no generation gap. Age does not divide us; rather, eternal timeless principles unite us. Believing in Jesus Christ and his gospel are basic interests and aspirations that at any age are the same as are the ideals and principles by which we live from day to day. These too are summarized by Jesus in a most dramatic manner during his earthly ministry.<br><br>According to the account in Matthew, "One came and said unto him, Good Master, what good thing shall I do, that I may have eternal life?" And what individual would not yearn to know, or give anything he possessed for the answer, especially if it came from the Lord himself?<br><br>And here it is: "If thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments." Note the magical words, "If thou wilt enter into life." Enter into life, indeed! Is not that the real quest of each of us? seriously, is there any other?<br><br>When asked what he meant by the statement, "Keep the commandments," Jesus said, "Thou shalt do no murder, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness"--and then fall the positive, glorious admonitions: "Honor thy father and thy mother; and Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself." (Matthew 19:16–19.)<br><br>What a magnificent program for life at its best! These commandments and all that they encompass constitute a glorious challenge and an unassailable fortress against evil. They involve the use of time in the best and highest sense and will certainly safeguard our integrity and morality and perpetuate the good example.<br><br>There is no generation gap in the Church--only shared ideals, principles, aspirations, enthusiasm, and increasing perfection as we continue to enter into life together, remembering these two great guidelines from the Book of Mormon: first, that "wickedness never was happiness" (Alma 41:10); and second, that "men are, that they might have joy" (2 Nephi 2:25).<br><br>As we diligently strive to crown our lives with meaning, accomplishment, joy, and happiness, let us ponder this magnificent passage from a modern play by Samuel Beckett entitled<i>Waiting for Godot</i>. Two tramps are lingering along a country road, and in the darkness a cry suddenly rings out for help. Cautiously and at length they discuss the risks and the dangers of responding and becoming involved. Then one of them says, "Let us not waste time in idle discourse! Let us do something, while we have a chance! To all mankind they were addressed, those cries for help, still ringing in our ears! But at this place, at this moment, all mankind is<i>us</i>, whether we like it or not. Let us make the most of it before it is too late!" (quoted by William T. Gossette in "Born to Action," University of Utah baccalaureate address, June 4, 1961).<br><br>In actual fact, those cries are for you. You are the vital and critical link, the ones who are on the verge of making it all happen, the ones representing the loftiest gospel ideals to all the world, and in you they live or die. You are, at this moment, the "generation of destiny." For you it is not too late; it is just the beginning. Life for each of you is on the threshold if, as Jesus said, you are "entering into life"--eternal life.<br><br>The influence of the gospel will not only dispel the darkness from our own lives but will cast a radiance into the lives of those around us. No one is saved solely and simply for himself alone, just as no lamp is lighted merely for its own benefit.<br><br>I bear humble testimony to you on this occasion that God lives, that Jesus is the Christ, that this is the true Church that was restored through revelation to the Prophet Joseph Smith. I pray for each of us that we may be motivated to achieve the life-stretching, soul-stretching ideals of the gospel. I bear my sincere testimony that there is only one way in which this may be done. That way is to enter fully into life, as taught be our Savior, by the Prophet Joseph Smith, and by our own divinely inspired President Spencer W. Kimball. In the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Joseph B.

<br>
Seriously, this is a fireside? As I commence this assignment, I do not see the fire, but I feel the heat. I am grateful to be here; I am thankful to be one of you, a fellow student with you. I regard myself as a lifetime student and have a very fond affection for this campus and this school although I was never a student here.<br><br>Many years ago there was a beautiful, talented, brown-eyed brunette freshman girl here on this campus, and I fell in love with her. Even though I was a student at another institution of higher learning, which is a few miles north of here, I managed to find my way down regularly. In fact, during my sophomore year, although I was a class officer at the University of Utah, I was accused of attending more social functions at the Y than I did at the U. And the accusation was accurate. That beautiful girl eventually became my wife, after I had served a mission. She always said that she waited for me; and I observed that she was still single when I came home, which was fortunate for me because there was a lot of competition.<br><br>I know that many of you are married students, and I feel a sense of identification with you because I was in school for five years after we were married. By the time I had completed undergraduate work and three years of graduate school we had two children, so I have a little understanding of what that kind of life is like. Now two of our children are married and in school, and so I am sharing that experience again with them.<br><br>I have always had a great interest in academia. Even thought I had completed seven years of college, I was reluctant to leave, and as a matter of fact thought it would be enjoyable to become a professional student. I suspect that there are some among you who could almost qualify for that, but I do not know you individually.<br><br>As I look into the faces of you in this large congregation, I have the impractical desire to know each of you personally and individually, because I know that each of you is unique, an individual divinely created. I feel what seems an unrealistic but is nevertheless a real desire to be able to call you my friends and to be able to feel that each of you is my friend. I reflect upon the possibilities that in the antemortal existence we may well have been companions and associates; and I am confident that in the years to come, both here in mortality and hereafter, we will share personal, individual companionships and friendships. That is a great thing to anticipate. And so, as I speak to you tonight, I am not so concerned with what I might say and what you might hear as I am hopeful that our spirits might touch and that the Holy Spirit will enable us to communicate in a way that words might not permit.<br><br>I was thinking as I drove here this evening about the similarities between becoming a General Authority and going to college. As Ed has already told you, I was called a year ago last April--and so I guess that I am about a sophomore. Both becoming a General Authority and going to college involve a major transition, a relocation. I came back to Utah after living nearly a quarter of a century in California. Both you new students and I, a new General Authority, are faced with the unknown and the unfamiliar. We have greater responsibility. There is increased pressure upon us to perform. There is expanded opportunity, but also increased expectations; and we are aware of our dependence upon others and our indebtedness to those who make it possible for us to have the kind of experiences coming to us. we feel a certain urgency to make correct decisions and an intensified desire to be accepted and liked and loved. And there is a great opportunity in both instances to make many new friends.<br><br>As I review my life and think about the things that are important to me, I am aware of the stimulation of ideas--which is very significant to me--the beauties of art and of nature, and the satisfaction of creature comforts; but, without any doubt, the most important of all are people, individuals, and personal relationships. A number of years ago, a member of the Church wrote a book and dedicated that work to President David O. McKay with these lines:<br><br><i>'Tis human fortune's happiest height to be</i><br><i>A spirit melodious, lucid, poised, and whole;</i><br><i>Second in order of felicity</i><br><i>To walk with such a soul.</i><br>[Obert C. Tanner,<i>Christ's Ideals for Living</i>(Salt Lake City: Deseret Sunday School Union Board, 1955), p. v]<br><br>To have good friends and good companions is an outstanding blessing, but there are requirements that we must fulfill to merit it. It takes time. There is a certain amount of selectivity necessary if we are to find good companions and good friends. And there is a responsibility on our part to be a good companion, to be concerned about personal development and growth, and to be conscious of the needs of others and responsive to those needs. One of the great things about good friends and companions is that they help us learn more about ourselves.<br><br>There are some neglected sources of friendship; sometimes they are close by. One of these neglected areas is our own family. I am grateful to know that among the members of my own family are also some of my very closest friends. In fact, I have thought often of my own children and said to them, "If you weren't my child and I weren't your father, I'd want you to be my friend." But that also takes some effort and cultivation on our part, and sometimes we family members take each other for granted and do not take the time or make the effort to cultivate the kind of relationship we might have with a non-family member.<br><br>Also, there comes to most of us at some time an opportunity for association with the noble and great ones of the earth. Among the great opportunities in my present association are the companionships and indeed personal friendships that I enjoy with the other General Authorities. I sat down the other day to lunch with Elder LeGrand Richards and thought as we did so what a tremendous opportunity it was to sit and visit with this man while we ate lunch together. It reminded me of an experience that I had over a year ago, shortly after I was called to my present responsibility, when I was assigned to go with Elder Richards to a conference. We traveled by car and therefore had some time to visit together, and I was using the opportunity to question him about some of his recollections. I asked him about his grandfather, Elder Franklin D. Richards, who was also a member of the Quorum of the Twelve, and Elder LeGrand Richards said, "Well, I know a great deal about my grandfather. I've heard about him and I've read about him, but I only remember seeing him once. I was only seven years old and it was at the dedication of the Salt Lake Temple."<br><br>I looked over at him and asked, "Brother Richards, were you present at the dedication of the Salt Lake Temple?"<br><br>He replied, "Of course; everyone went."<br><br>In 1893, LeGrand Richards was present at the Salt Lake Temple dedication.<br><br>Association with people like that is a great blessing and an inspiration, as you might well expect. It also raises one's goals and sights in terms of what he would like to become and be able to accomplish in the service of our Father in Heaven.<br><br>Occasionally, when we know we are going to have the opportunity to be in the presence of someone special, we make particular preparation. This has happened to me in professional or civic affairs when I have known that I was going to be attending a dinner or an occasion where one of the famous or powerful or influential people of the world was to be there. I have done a little research to make sure that I maximize the opportunity in that kind of association.<br><br>Among some of the neglected and overlooked opportunities for friendship and companionship are often the books that we read, the literature that we approach. In fact I have often thought that some of my closest companions are people that I have never met personally but only through the written word. There also, in order to enjoy that companionship fully, it is necessary to spend time, to be selective, and to be engaged in a process of self-improvement, so that those interactions and those companionships become increasingly significant and rewarding to us. It would be well, in light of that, to evaluate periodically our literary companions.<br><br>I personally have found that one of the greatest sources of my most treasured and valued friendships and companionships is the scriptures. The people whose lives are depicted there are real people. I expect someday to meet them, and I have been trying to prepare to do so. There are some that stand out--too many for us to consider tonight--but one of the individuals who has always had a great appeal to me is Joseph, the son of Jacob and Rachel. The reason for that special appeal is that Joseph lived a life much like many of the rest of us in that he was primarily concerned with temporal things. He was not basically a prophet and religious teacher, as were many of the other characters depicted in the scriptures, but was rather a man of worldly affairs; and his practical life and temporal concerns seemed, through most of my life, to be similar to my own experience.<br><br>As we all know, Joseph lived an exemplary life as a young man. I am sure that if he had lived in our modern day he would have won all of the individual Aaronic Priesthood awards and all the Duty to God awards and all else that could be offered--his was a very exemplary boyhood. And yet, at the age of seventeen years he was sold into slavery, which would not seem to be much of a reward for all of his effort. But Joseph was an unusual boy and decided that, if he was going to be a slave, he was going to be the best slave possible; and so he served his master, Potiphar, with all of the diligence and ability he had.<br><br>Very shortly he became the trusted overseer of all that Potiphar possessed. It would seem that he was being rewarded. Then Potiphar's wife looked upon this handsome young Hebrew boy and tried to tempt him into activity that he knew was contrary to the law of God. Now imagine: he was in a strange land, totally separated from his parents and his family and his religious leaders, where the people did not believe in the kind of laws of chastity and morality that he had been taught. Still, although he was a young virile man, he would not succumb to that temptation. His faith and his confidence were great, even though he was a slave in a strange land. So he spurned that temptation until, as you know, Potiphar's wife falsely accused him and he was imprisoned.<br><br>I think that at this point most of us would begin to become discouraged. But not Joseph. It would appear that he decided that if he was going to be a prisoner, he was going to be the best prisoner in the jail. And indeed, he rose to the point where the keeper of the jail put him in charge of all the other prisoners. And so his virtue again appeared to be rewarded. Then, as you know, the Pharaoh's butler and baker had been imprisoned also and in the course of their imprisonment came under Joseph's direction in the prison. Both came to him for counsel, each of them having had a dream which he could not interpret. Joseph, because he possessed spiritual gifts and because he was living in tune with the Holy Spirit, was able to interpret those dreams, and the interpretations proved correct. The butler was restored to his position of honor, and the baker, as Joseph had prophesied, had his life taken.<br><br>Joseph had asked the butler to remember him when he was returned to favor with the Pharaoh and to say a good word for him; but the butler, having returned to his former easy life, forgot about Joseph until the Pharaoh had some dreams that the wise men of the court were unable to interpret. The butler then remembered Joseph in prison and mentioned it to the Pharaoh, and Joseph was brought forward. Again, under the inspiration of our Father in Heaven, he interpreted the dreams and as a result of that spiritual gift and of his own skill and ability became, at thirty years of age, in effect the prime minister of all of Egypt, second only to the Pharaoh himself. This enabled him subsequently to deliver his father, Jacob, and his brothers and their families from the famine which pervaded the entire area.<br><br>Here we find an example of consistent application of spiritual principles in temporal affairs: constant faith, patient endurance, and the very wise use of power. Joseph is a man worth knowing personally, and you can know him personally as you study his life in the scriptures.<br><br>David is the classic hero--physically attractive, a courageous warrior, a poet, a musician, a skilled administrator, a philosopher, a man conscious of his dependence upon God as the source of his individual strength. All this made him a man worth knowing, but he is worth knowing also as a penitant transgressor of some of the most important commandments of our Father in Heaven, and who recognized that and began the long, difficult way back through repentance to complete acceptance again in the Kingdom and eventually in the presence of our Father in Heaven. David is indeed a man worth knowing.<br><br>Hosea is a man who appeals to me personally, though he may not appeal to some; but Hosea was a man who learned to forgive, to accept, and even to love again an unfaithful wife. In the process he learned and was able to teach the people of Israel about the love of God for his wayward children and the desire of our Heavenly Father to accept us back if we will return and repent and accept his divine gift of love. Hosea is a worthwhile friend, someone to get to know.<br><br>We all know about Paul, and there are many things about him that are intriguing. To cite one example, Paul was on one of his missionary journeys and came to Athens. He had made an appointment to meet Silas and Timothy there, and he arrived early, so he walked around sightseeing in Athens. It was known who he was and that he was teaching this Christian doctrine, and so he was asked by some of the philosophers of Athens to tell them more about the doctrine. They went up to Mars' hill which was, I guess a kind of Hyde Park equivalent in Athens, where anyone who had anything they wanted to say could go and talk and anyone who wanted to listen would go and provide the audience.<br><br>Paul, having gathered these people around him, said in effect, "I've walked around your city, and I've seen your various shrines." (The Greeks practiced polytheism and an idolatrous form of worship of their many gods, and there were shrines to various and sundry gods throughout the city.) "I've seen them all, and I saw one shrine in particular that was inscribed, 'To the Unknown God.' Now that God whom you ignorantly worship I declare unto you." And Paul began to explain to them who is the only true and living God. Here is a man who was very clever at creating opportunities to teach the gospel.<br><br>Through Paul you can meet Priscilla and Aquila her husband. These are interesting people. You have to look carefully to get acquainted with them, but they are worth knowing. They were Jewish and had been living in Rome, but the emperor Claudius had decreed that all of the Jews should be expelled from Rome, and so they had moved to Corinth. Apparently they had become members of the new Christian church, for when Paul arrived in Corinth he went to stay with them--both because they were members of the Church and also because they were tentmakers. Paul, though he was a learned man, had also learned a craft, a skill. He was a tentmaker, and he and Priscilla and Aquila worked together as tentmakers in Corinth while at the same time filling the role of missionaries and teaching the gospel to the people of that city. At that time the church met in their homes, and apparently they were true stalwarts. Later on it appears that they returned to Rome, because Paul in his letter to the Romans asks that special greetings be carried to Priscilla and Aquila. This is some time later. So they had remained faithful and were obviously a couple who had been stalwarts and pillars in the early church. Through them we can learn to know another very interesting man, Apollos.<br><br>Apollos was a Jew from Alexandria, a seat of Jewish leaning and intellectualism. We are told that he was very eloquent, an avid scriptorian, very fervent in spirit, and a diligent teacher. He came to Ephesus--and here we find Priscilla and her husband Aquila again. We do not know how they got to Ephesus, but there they are. And they heard Apollos teaching with all the vigor and enthusiasm of a new convert. He was, they perceived, a man who understood the Old Testament scriptures and who was an intellectual giant, but he needed a little additional information; so they took him into their home and instructed him more perfectly in the principles of the gospel and the doctrines of the Church. He went on to become an outstanding missionary, effective especially among the Jewish people, and a strength to new converts because of his enthusiasm and the careful instruction and teaching he had received from Priscilla and Aquilla. I would like to meet them someday; I plan to meet them someday. I regard them even now as my friends.<br><br>We all know about Timothy. Timothy is interesting to us particularly when we are younger because he was called at a very early age to be a missionary and had the privilege of being a missionary companion to Paul, the apostle. We might wonder what qualified him to be a missionary; and we learn that from Paul himself, as a matter of fact, in a letter he wrote to Timothy. As you know, Timothy was Paul's protégé, and Paul was so fond of Timothy that he referred to him as "my son," though he was not literally Paul's son but they merely had a very close, affectionate relationship. And in the second letter that we have preserved and recorded in the New Testament, Paul comments that "the unfeigned faith that is in thee . . . dwelt first in thy Grandmother Lois, and thy mother Eunice" (2 Timothy 1:5). Later in that same letter to Timothy, Paul says, "From a child thou hast known the holy scriptures" (2 Timothy 3:15). I like to think about Lois, that grandmother, and her daughter Eunice, the mother of Timothy. The faith of those women and the teachings that they apparently were able to convey to this young boy enabled him to accept at a very early age in his teens a call to serve as a missionary companion to the apostle Paul. Lois and Eunice are people worth knowing. They are worth some time and effort.<br><br>I suppose that all of you have, as I have, some personal friends who did not particularly impress you when you first met them. As a matter of fact, I can think of a few in particular with whom I felt no particular interest in becoming better acquainted. But it seemed that circumstances brought us together; and we learned to know each other a little better and eventually discovered some mutual feelings, concerns, interests, and hopes. Gradually we opened up to one another, came to trust one another, and became very close friends with a great influence on each other.<br><br>I am going to confide in you that initially I was not all that taken with Nephi, the son of Lehi. He seemed just too good to be true, and I could not identify with him. I thought that his story was all very nice, but I did not see how I was ever going to be able to emulate that kind of an example until one day when I was in the midst of a successive reading of the Book of Mormon. Each time I read it something new has been added since the last time--of course, that which has been added is the fact that I am a new person, and so things stand out to me that I did not notice before. But that day, during a fairly early reading of the Book of Mormon, I came to that fourth chapter in 2 Nephi where he talks about all of the wonderful manifestations that have come to him and all of the outstanding spiritual experiences that he has had. Then he begins to wonder why, in spite of all of those blessings and opportunities and reinforcing spiritual experiences, he still succumbs to temptation and gets discouraged and loses his temper–the usual litany of the kind of things that we all resolve never to do again and then find ourselves doing before we realize it. I read and reread that fourth chapter of 2 Nephi, and Nephi became my friend; then I read everything else that he had to say in an entirely different light, because now I could identify with him. Now he was somebody with whom I could interact, and I felt as though my spirit could touch his spirit and his mine.<br><br>There are many such examples of spiritual friendships. I suppose that at my stage of life a relationship between a parent and child is particularly poignant and touching. And can you imagine a better way to develop an insight into a man than to listen in while he, as a devoted and loving father, talks with a wayward son? We have the opportunity to do that in the book of Alma, in chapters 39 through 42, as Alma II talks to his son Corianton.<br><br>You recall the setting. Alma, often referred to as "the Younger" (but he did eventually get older, so I call him Alma II), had been a wayward youth. His youth had been characterized by unbelief and ever persecution of the Church, although his father was the head of the Church. But he had been converted and had received the witness and had devoted his life to missionary work and to sharing the message of the gospel with his fellowman. And now his son Corianton had been called on a mission.<br><br>Corianton had gone out in the mission field to teach the Zoramites; but he did not have the spirit of his calling, and he left the mission field and went to visit his girlfriend Isabel. That is a rather shocking thing in itself, and does not happen in this modern age. Not only was it a breach of the trust that had been placed in Corianton for him to go visit his girlfriend, but Isabel was a girl of questionable moral standards. Thus, Corianton's relationship with her caused many to question the truthfulness of the teachings of Alma; his credibility was undermined because of the questionable behavior and lack of diligence of his own son in carrying out his mission. So Alma sat down with Corianton to try to help this young man understand the fundamental truths of the gospel of Jesus Christ and to try to share with him his own testimony, which burns so brightly.<br><br>It is a beautiful, tender, inspiring experience to listen to that father and to get to know him, to make him your friend as you listen to him counsel his son, who he loves and with whom he wants to be able to share all of those blessings that he, Alma, has learned to enjoy and knows are possible to the faithful. He teaches Corianton some of the most profound, sacred, and fundamental doctrines of the gospel of Jesus Christ, and in that context the effect on me is overwhelming, because I identify so with the son and with the father. In fact, Corianton intrigues me, because he did accept his father's counsel and he was called again as a missionary and apparently served effectively.<br><br>Much later, before Alma passed away, he turned the sacred records over to his son Helaman; and Helaman, before he died, turned them over to his brother Shiblon. As we read toward the end of the book of Alma, Shiblon, knowing that he is about to die and needs to find someone who will take the responsibility for the sacred records, makes the notation that Corianton is not available because he had sailed north on a ship to take some supplies to some adventurers who had journeyed somewhere to the north. So Corianton still exhibited this kind of adventurous spirit which, when tamed and influenced by the sweet spirit of our Father in Heaven, is a dynamic force in the world. Alma and Corianton are indeed worth knowing and worth making one's friends.<br><br>When I was a young boy I developed a friendship, which has lasted and continues to this day, with a boy whose name I shall call Doug. Doug and I were friends from the time that we were about nine or ten years old, and we worked and played together through our teenage years. When we were in about our early teens--I suppose about fourteen or fifteen--one Saturday afternoon we were playing touch football with a group of other fellows. In the course of the game I was hit rather hard in what I thought was an unfair sort of way; and in the intensity of the competition and the discomfort and pain I was experiencing I got up and, thinking that Doug was the cause of my distress, swung my fist and hit him. He hit me back, and then we stood there, toe to toe, glaring at one another. Then each of us turned and walked away and went home.<br><br>That was Saturday afternoon. Sunday morning I went to priesthood meeting, and I was able to avoid Doug until just before Sunday School. When I walked into the chapel, no one else was there except for Doug, who was at the sacrament table preparing the sacrament for Sunday School. I stopped and he looked up. I did not say anything, and I was about to turn and leave when he asked, "Would you come and help me, Ron?" That was all it took. I did, and he forgave the offense of the day before. My friendship with him is one of the most treasured relationships I have to this very day.<br><br>It reminds me very much of the correspondence of Pahoran and Captain Moroni, also recorded in the book of Alma in the Book of Mormon. There is not time to tell the whole story, but I will summarize. This is Captain Moroni, not Moroni the son of Mormon; although it is my personal belief that possibly Mormon named his son Moroni after Captain Moroni, who was such an outstanding individual and a great man. As we hear him described, he again is a man for all seasons--a man of great spirituality, great administrative skills, and outstanding military strategy, called at the age of twenty-five years to lead the Nephite armies against the Lamanite invasion. He has some success but is short on provisions, and he writes a letter back to Zarahemla to his friend Pahoran, who is the chief judge. He receives no answer. So he writes another letter, that contained in the sixtieth chapter of Alma, and it is an interesting insight into human nature.<br><br>This great man starts out fairly calmly, but the more he writes the angrier he becomes. He accuses Pahoran of all kinds of horrible things for which there is no justification in fact; but Moroni is out there in the field--short of provisions, about to be attacked, his men suffering hunger and thirst and wounds--and he needs help. When he does not get it, he flies off the handle and writes this terrible letter to Pahoran.<br><br>As recorded in Alma, chapter sixty-one, Pahoran writes back and explains to his friend and colleague Moroni that the reason he has not responded is that there has been a political uprising. A group of monarchists have attempted to overthrow the legitimate government in Zarahemla, and he, Pahoran, and the legitimate government have been forced to flee; but he assures Moroni that as soon as possible he will send him the help for which he has asked. In effect, he says, "In your letter you censured me a little, but that doesn't matter; I think you're a terrific guy anyway." He forgives him, although it would have been easy for him to have taken offense.<br><br>In his reply Pahoran talks about the importance to him of liberty and of the freedom of their people, saying that they would not resort to force if it were not necessary to protect their liberty and freedom, but that the Lord had given them the opportunity to defend themselves by force if necessary. Then, in verse fourteen he says to Moroni,<br><br><i>Therefore, my beloved brother, Moroni, let us resist evil, and whatsoever evil we cannot resist with our words [which is the first resort], yea, such as rebellions and dissentions, let us resist them with our swords, that we may retain our freedom, that we may rejoice in the great privilege of our church, and in the cause of our Redeemer and our God.</i><br><br>Thus are Moroni and Pahoran--both worth knowing and worth having as friends.<br><br>There are many more examples. Good friends lead us to other good friends; and so it is with those whom we can come to know and who we can make our friends in the scriptures, for they lead us to companionship with our Father, the Lord God, and with Jesus Christ, our elder brother. Through the scriptures we can come to know them intimately and personally, to feel their spirit, and to know that they are aware of us personally and individually. I am so grateful to those who, with tremendous effort and sacrifice, have recorded and preserved and translated the holy scriptures to make them available for us, that we might come to know these people and through them to know the truths of the gospel. I think that most of us recognize that we tend to become like those with whom we associate; so it is also with our scriptural companions and specifically with our Father in Heaven and with the Savior. Both John in his first epistle and Mormon, as recorded by Moroni in the Book of Mormon, tell us that when we meet the Savior we will know him because we will be like him (see 1 John 3:2; Moroni 7:48). We can become like him by learning to know him through the scriptures and through the scriptural companions about which we have talked tonight and many others like them. The greatest good, the most important success, the supreme happiness, and the most complete understanding is to know God, our Father, and his son Jesus Christ; that is eternal life, which is the greatest of all the gifts of God (see John 17:3; D&amp;amp;C 14:7).<br><br><i>'Tis human fortune's happiest height to be</i><br><br><i>A spirit melodious, lucid, poised, and whole;</i><br><br><i>Second in order of felicity</i><br><br><i>To walk with such a soul.</i><br><br>That we may do so is my prayer for each of us, as I leave you my witness that God lives, that Jesus of Nazareth is the promised Messiah, the atoning Savior, the resurrected Christ. I bear you this record in the sacred name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Ronald E. Poelman was a member of the First Quorum of the Seventy of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when this fireside address was given at Brigham Young University on 5 August 1979.</i></i><br><br><i>© Intellectual Reserve, Inc.

<br>
Brothers and Sisters, I am very pleased to be with you today. I recollect the story of a very voracious reader, a woman who had a study filled with books. Each night she came home and read from books in her library, and she always finished every book she read.<br><br>One night she came to a particularly interesting crossroads: She decided that she would read a book that she had been especially avoiding. Finally she picked the book up, sat down, and began to read. It was very dull and uninteresting, but she had made herself a promise that she would never read a book without finishing it. She continued, night after night, until days later she finally turned the back cover of the book, took it back, placed it on the shelf, and made this mental note to herself: "That was the dullest book I have ever read in my life."<br><br>Sometime later she was out with a gentleman friend, and after dinner they started talking. He asked if she had ever read such and such a book. The mental note came back, "That was the dullest book I have ever read in my life."<br><br>She said, "Yes; why?"<br><br>He said, "I wrote it."<br><br>Then they talked about the book. Finally, that evening about midnight when he dropped her off, she went into her study, pulled this same book off the shelf, and read through the long hours of the night. When the first streaks of sunlight shafted across the sky, she closed the back cover of the book, placed it back again in its place on the bookshelf, and made another mental note to herself: "That was the most beautiful book I have ever read in my life." The difference was that she knew the author.<br><br>In the forty-fifth section of the Doctrine and Covenants, the Lord said:<br><br><i>Hearken, O ye people of my church, to whom the kingdom has been given; hearken ye and give ear to him who laid the foundation of the earth, who made the heavens and all the hosts thereof, and by whom all things were made which live, and move, and have a being.</i><br><br><i>And again I say, hearken unto my voice, lest death shall overtake you; in an hour when ye think not the summer shall be past, and the harvest ended, and your souls not saved.</i><br><br><i>Listen to him who is the advocate with the Father, who is pleading your cause before him--</i><br><br><i>Saying: Father, behold the sufferings and death of him who did no sin, in whom thou was well pleased; behold the blood of thy Son which was shed, the blood of him whom thou gavest that thyself might be glorified;</i><br><br><i>Wherefore, Father, spare these my brethren that believe on my name, that they may come unto me and have everlasting life.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 45:1–5]<br><br>We can know the author, and everlastingly so much is at stake whether or not we do know Him.<br><br>I am thrilled with the subject matter today. I suppose that in my limited schooling the subject of Jesus Christ figures the most of all subjects. I know and have read more about him than about any other subject, and I have served more in his cause that I have done anything else in my life. I suppose that it touches on the greatest degree of my learning. So I am thrilled with this assignment to discuss with you my feelings about him and my relationship to him.<br><br>Something else that I would like to share with you is my realization that the men I most love, admire, and respect also seem to have their lives most nearly intertwined in his. They model the things that he has taught. I suppose that President Spencer W. Kimball is the measure in our generation of the perfect man--truly a man of Christ.<br><br>Last night at a late hour when I was studying, I had a thought come to me that has passed by me many times. I would like to share it with you. We oftentimes quote from the poet of "A Poor Wayfaring Man of Grief," and when we quote this we relate it back to the martyrdom of the Prophet Joseph, or we may relate it to a great Saint in this day who has lived that kind of life. But the poet was really talking about a certain poor wayfaring man of grief. This morning, in light of the thought of the poet, would you go back with me again and rehearse it? He said:<br><br><i>A poor wayfaring Man of grief</i><br><i>Hath often crossed me on my way,</i><br><i>Who sued so humbly for relief</i><br><i>That I could never answer, Nay.</i><br><i>I had not power to ask his name,</i><br><i>Whereto he went, or whence he came;</i><br><i>Yet there was something in his eye</i><br><i>That won my love; I knew not why.</i><br><br><i>Once, when my scanty meal was spread,</i><br><i>He entered, not a word he spake;</i><br><i>Just perishing for want of bread,</i><br><i>I gave him all; he blessed it, brake,</i><br><i>And ate, but gave me part again;</i><br><i>Mine was an angel's portion then,</i><br><i>For while I fed with eager haste,</i><br><i>The crust was manna to my taste.</i><br><br><i>I spied him where a fountain burst</i><br><i>Clear from the rock; his strength was gone;</i><br><i>The heedless water mocked his thirst;</i><br><i>He heard it, saw it, hurrying on.</i><br><i>I ran and raised the sufferer up;</i><br><i>Thrice from the stream he drained my cup,</i><br><i>Dipped and returned it running o'er;</i><br><i>I drank and never thirsted more.</i><br><br><i>'Twas night; the floods were out; it blew</i><br><i>A winter hurricane aloof;</i><br><i>I heard his voice abroad and flew</i><br><i>To bid him welcome to my roof.</i><br><i>I warmed and clothed and cheered my guest</i><br><i>And laid him on my couch to rest,</i><br><i>Then made the earth my bed, and seemed</i><br><i>In Eden's garden while I dreamed.</i><br><br><i>Stript, wounded, beaten nigh to death,</i><br><i>I found him by the highway side;</i><br><i>I roused his pulse, brought his breath,</i><br><i>Revived his spirit, and supplied</i><br><i>Wine, oil, refreshment–he was healed;</i><br><i>I had myself a wound concealed,</i><br><i>But from that hour forgot the smart,</i><br><i>And peace bound up my broken heart.</i><br><br><i>In prison I saw him next condemned</i><br><i>To meet a traitor's doom at morn;</i><br><i>The tide of lying tongues I stemmed,</i><br><i>And honored him'mid shame and scorn.</i><br><i>My friendship's utmost zeal to try,</i><br><i>He asked if I for him would die;</i><br><i>The flesh was weak; my blood ran chill;</i><br><i>But the free spirit cried, "I will!"</i><br><br><i>Then in a moment to my view</i><br><i>The stranger started from disguise;</i><br><i>The tokens in his hand I knew;</i><br><i>The Savior stood before mine eyes.</i><br><i>He spake, and my poor name he named,</i><br><i>"Of me thou hast not been ashamed;</i><br><i>These deeds shall thy memorial be,</i><br><i>Fear not, thou didst them unto me."</i><br>["A Poor Wayfaring Man of Grief,"<i>Hymns,</i>no. 153]<br><br>We need to go back occasionally and think about the Savior's life and all that transpired in it. I suppose that more beautiful yet than the words of the poet are the words of the prophets. Alma said,<br><br><i>And behold, he shall be born of Mary, at Jerusalem which is the land of our forefathers, she being a virgin, a precious and chosen vessel, who shall be overshadowed and conceive by the power of the Holy Ghost, and bring forth a son, yea, even the Son of God.</i><br><br>[Now listen to these words and think about "A Poor Wayfaring Man of Grief":]<i>And he shall go forth, suffering pains and afflictions and temptations of every kind; and this that the word might be fulfilled which saith he will take upon him the pains and the sicknesses of his people.</i><br><br><i>And he will take upon him death, that he may loose the bands of death which bind his people; and he will take upon him their infirmities, that his bowels may be filled with mercy, according to the flesh, that he may know according to the flesh how to succor his people according to their infirmities.</i><br><br><i>Now the Spirit knoweth all things; nevertheless the Son of God suffereth according to the flesh that he might take upon him the sins of his people, that he might blot out their transgressions according to the power of his deliverance; and now behold, this is the testimony which is in me.</i>[Alma 7:10–13]<br><br>Finally, the prophet Nephi concluded the last verses in 2 Nephi by saying:<br><br><i>And now, my beloved brethren, and also Jew, and all ye ends of the earth, hearken unto these words and believe in Christ; and if ye believe not in these words believe in Christ; and if ye believe not in these words believe in Christ. And if ye shall believe in Christ ye will believe in these words, for they are the words of Christ, and he hath given them unto me; and they teach all men that they should be good....</i><br><br><i>And now, my beloved brethren, all those who are of the house of Israel, and all ye ends of the earth, I speak unto you as the voice of one crying from the dust: Farewell until that great day shall come.</i><br><br><i>And you that will not partake of the goodness of God, respect the words of the Jews, and also my words, and the words which shall proceed forth out of the mouth of the Lamb of God, behold, I bid you an everlasting farewell, for these words shall condemn you at the last day.</i><br><br><i>For what I seal on earth, shall be brought against you at the judgment bar; for thus hath the Lord commanded me, and I must obey.</i>[2 Nephi 33:10, 13–15]<br><br>What great words are the words of Nephi!<br><br>As I mentioned, the major part of my learning has touched upon the life of the Savior; I have read hundreds of books and have spent thousands of hours in his service. Although few men would truly be qualified to speak about him, know that--as limited though I am--my concern, my interest, my commitment, and my love could not possibly be greater. I suppose that to really examine his life I should share with you some of the things I feel so keenly about him.<br><br>I have wondered about the men who have enlisted their hearts and souls in his cause. What manner of men, indeed, could enlist in the very beginning? The man Adam, after he was driven out of the Garden of Eden, built an altar and offered sacrifice. "And after many days an angel of the Lord appeared unto Adam, saying: Why dost thou offer sacrifices ...?" This great soul, in a formula that all of us ought to understand, simply said, "I know not, save the Lord commanded me."<br><br><i>And then the angel spake, saying: "This thing is a similitude of the sacrifice of the Only Begotten....</i><br><br><i>Wherefore, thou shalt do all that thou doest in the name of the Son [of God] forevermore.</i>[Moses 5:6–8]<br><br>Had we no further scriptures than that simple verse, we would have the pattern for living. Yet we oftentimes need much more.<br><br>We could also consider Enoch, who was slow of speech and only a lad. All of the people hated him and called him a wild man, as it has been described in the scriptures (see Moses 6:31, 38). Enoch beheld the heavens weep, and he cried to the Lord:<br><br><i>How is it that thou canst weep, seeing thou art holy, and from all eternity to all eternity?</i><br><br><i>And were it possible that man could number the particles of the earth, yea, millions of earths like this, it would not be a beginning to the number of thy creations; and thy curtains are stretched out still; and yet thou art there, and thy bosom is there; and also thou art just; thou art merciful and kind forever;</i><br><br><i>... How is it thou canst weep?</i>[Moses 7:29–31]<br><br>And then God let Enoch behold all the myriad of souls who have walked upon the earth. He beheld their wickedness and the misery of all of those. Finally, after Enoch had the privilege of seeing these through his spiritual eyes, even with the discernment of God, he cried out; his heart swelled wide as eternity; he stretched forth his arms; his bowels yearned; and all eternity shook. I believe there have been a few times when, although we do not feel quite that degree and magnitude, we feel something akin to it--where our souls are so filled with love that we understand. So we catch from Enoch the prophet a dimension that we normally would not have--heart and soul enlisted in the cause of the Master.<br><br>And Moses also--after he had beheld the same things, all of the things that pertain to this life and every soul who had walked the earth, who was walking the earth at that time, or who would walk the earth--after the vision had departed from Moses and he was left unto himself, he said, "Now ... I know that man is nothing, which thing I never had supposed" (Moses 1:10).<br><br>Man<i>is</i>something, but I suppose that if we could have looked through the eyes of Moses and seen all of these things--millions, yea, billions of souls who had walked the earth--we may, with Moses, have cried out, "Now I perceive that man is nothing." Those kinds of things help me to understand Him.<br><br>I believe that the same understanding comes when I read again the words of Daniel, chapter three, where Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, three of the Hebrew officers who were in the councils of Babylonia, were thrown into the furnace. King Nebuchadnezzar had built the marvelous golden image, threescore cubits high (in other words, about ninety feet high) and nine feet across, and placed it in the plains of Dura. Then he had all his officers, governors, counselors, sheriffs, and all others who held any position of worth come to this dedication. Then he had his herald proclaim to all those who were there.<br><br><i>That at what time ye hear the sound of the cornet flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, dulcimer, and all kinds of musick ye [shall] fall down and worship the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king hath set up:</i><br><br><i>And whoso falleth not down and worshippeth shall be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace.</i><br><br>And so the cornet and the flute and the harp and the sackbut and the psaltery were sounded and all of those who were there bowed down before the golden image, except for Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. Others who were jealous of these three Hebrew lads came to King Nebuchadnezzar and said, "O, king, live for ever," and went on to tell him that there were three who, when these musical instruments sounded, would not bow down before nor worship the golden image and would not accept it. King Nebuchadnezzar was wroth, and he had these three young men brought before him and in the wrath of his heart he said to them:<br><br><i>Now if ye be ready that at what time ye hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and dulcimer, and all kinds of musick, ye fall down and worship the image which I have made, well: but if ye worship not, ye shall be cast the same hour into the midst of a burning fiery furnace.</i><br><br>Now, can you comprehend what is taking place–these three fine young Hebrew lads and this kind of pressure put on them? I mean not just a little bit of pressure, where it is a temptation– their lives really were hanging in the balance. But they responded in this manner:<br><br><i>O, Nebuchadnezzar, we are not careful to answer thee in this matter.</i><br><br><i>If it be so, our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace, and he will deliver us.</i><br><br>[And here is their commitment:]<i>But, if not, be it known unto thee, O king, we will not serve thy gods, nor worship the golden image.</i><br><br>In that selfsame hour the furnaces were heated seven times hotter than they were wont to be heated, and the mightiest men were wrapped in robes and hosen so that they might not perish in the flames; but even as they cast Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego into the burning fiery furnace, they perished in the flames because they were so hot. Then you recall that Nebuchadnezzar could see inside the furnace; and he said, "Did we not cast three men bound into the midst of the fire? ...I see four men ..., and the fourth is like the Son of God." (See Daniel 3:1–25.)<br><br>I believe that for someone to have that kind of an influence over three young men, as He does over my life and your lives, there must be something substantial to which we can anchor our souls. We think of Peter and Thomas and the declaration so often quoted from Peter--"Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God" (Matthew 16:16)--and Thomas's affirmation--"Let us also go, that we may die with him" (John 11:16). I appreciate them.<br><br>We think also of the Prophet Joseph, Hyrum, Willard Richards, John Taylor, and others whose lives hung in the balance. Willard Richards said to the Prophet Joseph, "If you are condemned to [die] ... I will [die] in your stead."<br><br>Joseph, knowing something that many did not know at that time, said, "But you cannot." Willard Richards said firmly, "I will." (See B.H. Roberts,<i>A Comprehensive History of the Church</i>, 2:283.) I think that these things help us to understand the kind of men enlisted not only in the service of Joseph and the other prophets but also in the greater work of the Master.<br><br>I think of President Kimball, whose whole life--in spite of open heart surgery--is given to service. And he is still probably the youngest man in the Church. I am impressed with President Benson, who in a great area conference in Sweden three or four years back stood up and--as a prophet would--in that faraway European country declared to the leaders, kings, and presidents of nations that they should accept the Lord Jesus Christ and repent. That is what one would expect a prophet of God to do.<br><br>Along with all of these things, I would like to suggest to you that there are certain places at which we arrive when we walk in his footsteps where we would not suppose that life would ever lead us. Let me share with you just a few of the places where walking in his steps has led me.<br><br>I remember one Christmas Eve, not too many years back, when I went to sit in the home of a little widow in our ward and spent thirty or forty minutes with her. She discussed with me the things that were in her heart that lonely Christmas Eve, and I received a little jar of jelly from her as I prepared to depart. I found out a few months later that she was in a rest home, so I dropped by occasionally and visited her there. Then again, just a few short months after that, I was privileged to speak at her funeral. I suppose that acts such as this are performed outside the Church as well; but I feel that the greater act was hers, because she gave me an opportunity and blessings that I would not have had otherwise.<br><br>My experiences include the privilege of standing by men, women, and children in dire poverty whose lives are committed to Him--to see them feed the missionaries when all the food they had in the house was on the table and what little was left over would go to the children; and if there was none left, the children would have none. They just trusted totally in the fact that it was an act of Christianity--one that they could not forego--to feed the Lord's servants.<br><br>I have seen His teachings reflected in our day. We so often read about the widow and her placing into treasury her mite--bitterly embarrassed as she did it, I suppose, for fear that it was such a little bit to be given. I once saw a widow come before the bishop at tithing settlement and say, "That is my full tithing: $55.00." Her income, then, would have been $550 with which to pay her taxes, buy her food, take care of her phone and light and heat bills and make other contributions to the Church. When the fifty-five dollars for tithing was taken it left $495. With a sweet, humble attitude she said, "That's all there was, bishop, but it is a full tithing." We talk about poverty at the $4,500 income level, and now the $7,500 level; I am not certain that we understand. There are those who have poverty of the spirit; and there are those who are rich with the spirit, as this sweet sister whom I recollect.<br><br>We talk about the woman who had an issue of blood--twelve years of suffering every single day. She had gone to many physicians and had spent all of her money, but she was none the better. And in fact she was even worse. Then she found out that Jesus would be in the streets. Watching in desperation as he came by--and, I am sure, pushing herself through the multitude, thinking in her heart, "If I may touch his clothes, I will be whole"--and she finally reached out, touched his garment, and was healed; the blood was stanched.<br><br>The Savior stopped and asked, "Who touched my clothes?" The disciples said, in effect, "What do you mean who touched you? There are all these people thronging around." As he turned around and looked on the body of people near him, this woman undoubtedly stood out to him as though she were a light globe. If I read correctly between the lines, she felt guilty: "I should have asked." So she came forward and knelt before him and simply confessed that it was she. Then he said, "Daughter, thy faith hath made thee whole." I love him for that. (See Mark 5:24–34.)<br><br>I love him for other things; I love him for a phone call from Idaho. A little couple had just had twins prematurely. One of them was doing fairly well, but the other, weighing just a little over a pound and a quarter, was brought into the University of Utah Medical Center. Think of five cubes of butter, if you would--that was the size of this little soul. I received a call: "He has been administered to, but would you mind dropping by the hospital and giving him a blessing? We'd like to have that done, and we're up here in Idaho. Would you please do it?"<br><br>I found that about the only hour I had available that particular day was 5:00 a.m. I dropped by the University of Utah Medical Center, went into the room, and found the oxygen canopy. I put my fingers--all that would fit--on the forehead of this little soul, gave a blessing, and had the impression from God that one day this boy--six feet tall and weighing two hundred pounds--would be a young ambassador for the Lord. This kind of experience has built my understanding and love for the Savior.<br><br>As I left a conference and was on the way out of the airport, I met a sweet family of members. They had contacted a nonmember man who was having severe problems and wondered if I would give him a blessing. We dropped by the home to find an apartment in a condominium or large apartment complex. In the living room were two pieces of furniture--a bean bag and a stereo set--and nothing more. A little girl, age nine, was taking care of her father because the mother, when she heard that her husband had cancer, had abandoned him and the nine-year-old girl and a seven- or eight-year-old boy.<br><br>The girl said, "I don't think my father is expecting you. I don't think he is expecting anyone."<br><br>We said, "Would you please go ask him?"<br><br>She went into the bedroom, and in a minute she came out and said, "Yes, he is expecting you. Will you please come in?"<br><br>She took us down the hallway into his room, and here on the bottom bunk of a bunkbed set we saw this man; he was six feet tall and weighed only sixty-seven pounds. We administered to him, that feeling he would not live; but we felt impressed to bless him with the thing that would be of most worth to him: that his son and daughter would be protected, that angels would walk through this life with them, that they would be protected when he was no longer there to do it. I suppose that those of us who have been involved in such experiences (and all of us have) would not sell them for all the money in the world.<br><br>I had the privilege of being involved with a young man and a father recently. The young man and a friend were up hiking in the lower foothills near Cody, Wyoming. The friend jumped across a high-power line that was down, but the young man got tangled in it and was electrocuted. The friend turned and ran all the way back down to where the father lived--and it was no short distance--and told him that his son had been electrocuted and was dead. The father, who was not a young man, ran all the way back up, taking about fifteen minutes. When he got where the boy was lying across the wires, he in some way removed the boy from the wires with a board or large stick. Then he picked his son up in his arms and held him, saying, "In the name of Jesus Christ and by the power and authority of the Holy Melchizedek Priesthood, I command you to live." The dead boy in his father's arms opened his eyes. He was taken to the University of Utah Medical Center for treatment and a blessing. I believe that it is this kind of experience that we have as we walk through this life with Him.<br><br>I believe that we also experience the miracle of forgiveness. Once a couple drove all the way from one of the central California stakes, came to my office, and said, "We just need half an hour with you." The husband continued, "At conference you mentioned that every single major transgression must be confessed. Monday after conference my wife and I were sitting at home for home evening, and not a word had been spoken. Then my wife said to me, 'Are you thinking what I'm thinking?' And I said, 'Yes, I think I am.' She said, 'How soon should we leave?' And I said, 'Why not right now?'" So they had climbed into their car and driven the sixteen hours to the Church Office Building.<br><br>The man went on, "We have come to confess a major transgression. Forty-three years ago, before we were married, we committed fornication once. My father was the bishop of the ward, and so he didn't ask us the questions, but just signed our temple recommends. We went to the stake president and he saw that they were signed, so he didn't ask the questions. We went to the temple unworthily.<br><br>"While we were out on our honeymoon we decided that we would make it up to the Lord. We would give every particle of energy all of our lives in order to repent: he couldn't ask us to do anything we wouldn't do. We'd pay more than our share of tithing, more than our share of building fund. We would go forth and really serve. We wouldn't go to the temple that next year because we weren't worthy." It was almost a self-imposed restitution program.<br><br>"We've done that," he said, "I've been a bishop and I've been on two high councils. My wife has been stake Relief Society president for six years. We know now--and I guess we've known all along, although we have repented--that we still had to confess."<br><br>Normally we send people back to their bishops or stake presidents for such confessions; they do not need to come to the General Authorities, because every single member of the Church has a priesthood leader. But General Authorities are common judges, and so I called President Kimball on the phone and said, "President Kimball, I have this lovely couple in my office." I explained to him the story of this couple and said, "I feel that they've repented. Would you feel all right if I exercised my common judgeship and simply closed this case for these two wonderful people, so they will not have to drive the sixteen hours back to California just to go through this experience again?"<br><br>He asked, "Are they still in your office?"<br><br>"Yes," I replied.<br><br>"Would you bring them right up?"<br><br>I know that it shocked me. I said yes, hung up the phone, and said to them, "President Kimball would like to see you in his office right now." The blood drained from their faces.<br><br>I took them up to the twenty-fifth floor, where his office was at that time, and we walked back through the reception area to Arthur Haycock's office, where Brother Haycock said, "The President is expecting you."<br><br>The President got up from his desk and came to the door to meet us. I introduced him to this lovely couple and said, "President, I need not stay. I'll run back downstairs. When you're finished, call me and I'll come right back up and get them."<br><br>He said, "Bishop, I want you to come in, too."<br><br>I went into his office along with the couple. We sat down in front of his desk, and he went around behind the desk. Then, for three or four minutes, he visited with them tenderly and sweetly about the things he had in his office. Then he turned to the man and said, "Bishop Featherstone has told me about this condition. Have you suffered equal to the transgression?" In other words, "It has been a major transgression; have you suffered?"<br><br>Tears came to this brother's eyes, and he said, "President, we think we have suffered many times more."<br><br>President Kimball asked, "Have you prayed for forgiveness?" The man said, "I have prayed for forgiveness, and my wife has. We haven't offered a prayer in forty-three years in which we haven't asked for forgiveness."<br><br>Let me digress here just to say this: Do you know that the President of the Church is the only man on the face of the earth who can actually forgive on behalf of the Lord? The rest of us who are common judges forgive on behalf of the Church, as the Lord's agents. President Kimball has said that he never uses this authority unless he really knows.<br><br>After talking to them and counseling with them, he said finally, "Would you feel all right if I came around and knelt down and had a prayer with you?" He came around from behind his desk. The couple knelt, and we knelt facing the couple. President Kimball offered the prayer and said these words in the very beginning: "Heavenly Father, we love thee." he said "We love thee" in a way I have never heard it said before. Tears came to my eyes and streamed down my cheeks. I could hear them dropping on the carpet, and they sounded like thunder, to me at least.<br><br>He continued to pray; and I understood a little better then what an advocate is, because he pleaded for this couple. He felt that they had repented, but he needed to know.<br><br>Finally, as he concluded his prayer and stood up, he came over, put his arm through my arm, pulled me close to him, and asked me a question. Do you know, I still do not know what the question was? I never did answer it. All I know is that I turned to him with tears in my eyes and said, "President Kimball, I love you." And I did--every particle of my heart and soul loved the man President Kimball.<br><br>He then went over to this man and said to him, as he shook his hand, "I want you to forgive yourself, and I want you to forgive your wife. I don't want you ever to think about it again. You are forgiven." The man put his head down on President Kimball's shoulder and sobbed. In a few moments President Kimball walked over to the woman, took both of her hands in his, and said, "I want you to forgive yourself. I want you never to think about it again. You are forgiven."<br><br>I could not have had that experience except for the fact that I had tried to walk in the Savior's footsteps. Every one of you who has had similar experiences has had them because you have tried to walk in his steps.<br><br>Who could forget the Canaanite woman who cried incessantly after the Savior as he traveled between Sidon and Tyre with the disciples? Finally the disciples said to the Master, "Send her away; for she crieth after us." The Savior--addressing not the woman but the disciples--then said, "I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel." And then the woman, knowing that they were talking about her--mind you, this Canaanite woman--ran to him and worshipped him. I suppose that she probably knelt down before him, maybe even clasping his knees or laying her cheeks up against him or looking up into his face, and pleaded for her daughter, who was grievously vexed with a devil. "Have mercy on me, O Lord, thou son of David."<br><br>And the Lord said something that at the time seemed so harsh: "It is not meet to take the children's bread, and to cast it to dogs."<br><br>Now, she could have stood up and said, "I'm not a dog; and I have some pride, too, you know." And she could have worked her way out of the crowd. But she taught us one of the great lessons in humility, and there is no question in my mind that the Savior knew exactly what her response would be. She said, "Truth, Lord: yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their master's table."<br><br>"Woman, great is thy faith: be it unto thee even as thou wilt." The blessing was granted. (See Matthew 15:21–28.)<br><br>We find also that when the Savior taught some extremely hard doctrine the disciples began by ones and twos to veer off, and they never walked again with him. Finally, all that were left were the twelve apostles, and he said to them, possibly with a heavy heart, "Will ye also go away?" At this Peter said,<br><br><i>Lord, to whom shall we go? Thou hast the words of eternal life.</i><br><br><i>And we believe and are sure that thou art that Christ, the Son of the living God.</i>[See John 6:66–69]<br><br>Indeed, think about that. To whom shall we go if not to him? Where in all the world? In whom could we put our trust? Where could we find the peace that surpasseth understanding? When we have gone to the very limit--to the mountains too high and too wide and too deep in the earth to get across--where can we go when we need to reach the other side, except to him?<br><br>I suppose that we should think how this affects you and me. We need to live a Christlike life. President Harold B. Lee said, "I came to a night, some years ago, when on my bed, I realized that before I could be worthy of the high place to which I had been called, I must love and forgive every soul that walked the earth, and in that time I came to ... a peace and a direction, and a comfort, and an inspiration, that told me things to come ... [which] I knew were from a divine source" (Harold B. Lee, in Conference Report, October 1946, p. 146).<br><br>I wonder if in that hour he knew that he would be the prophet, seer, and revelator of this Church. I think, like him, that we must love and forgive every soul that walks the earth--a wayward son, a husband, a wife, maybe a divorced former companion, maybe someone who has offended us bitterly. If we would be Christlike, we must love and forgive every soul that walks the earth. Then are we entitled to that peace.<br><br>We also find the answer in three of the Lord's parables:<br><br><i>Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto treasure hid in a field; the which when a man hath found, he hideth, and for joy thereof goeth and selleth all that he hath, and buyeth that field.</i><br><br><i>Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a merchant man, seeking goodly pearls:</i><br><br><i>Who, when he had found one pearl of great price, went and sold all that he had, and bought it.</i><br><br><i>Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a net, that was cast into the sea, and gathered of every kind</i><br><br><i>Which, when it was full, they drew to shore, and sat down, and gathered the good into vessels, but cast the bad away.</i>[Matthew 13:44–48]<br><br>James E. Talmage says that the cost is always the same for every single one of us as we accept Christ and him crucified. The cost everlastingly and always will be the same; it is, simply, all we have. If we are truly going to be his disciples it could never be less than all we have. If, we say, "I'll go so far, and that's as far as I can go," then I am not certain that we measure up as true disciples.<br><br>Listen to the words of a modern prophet, President Kimball:<br><br><i>We extend to every listener a cordial invitation to come to the watered garden, to the shade of trees, to unchangeable truth. Come with us to sureness, security, ...</i><br><br><i>Come, listen to a prophet's voice and hear the word of God.</i>[Speech given at youth conference, Long Beach, California, April 9, 1978]<br><br>I believe that we have in this generation those who are simply responding. The Lord has said, "My sheep hear my voice" (John 10:27), and they are coming to the shade, to the watered gardens, to the cool waters.<br><br>One of the great poets, William Ernest Henleys wrote a verse entitled "Invictus." As you will recall, in those verses he said:<br><br><i>Out of the night that covers me,</i><br><i>Black as the Pit from pole to pole,</i><br><i>I thank whatever gods may be</i><br><i>For my unconquerable soul.</i><br><br><i>In the fell clutch of circumstance,</i><br><i>I have not winced nor cried aloud:</i><br><i>Under the bludgeonings of chance</i><br><i>My head is bloody, but unbowed.</i><br><br><i>Beyond this veil of wrath and tears</i><br><i>Looms but the Horror of the shade,</i><br><i>And yet the menace of the years</i><br><i>Finds, and shall find, me unafraid.</i><br><br><i>It matters not how strait the gate,</i><br><i>How charged with punishment the scroll,</i><br><i>I am the master of my fate:</i><br><i>I am the captain of my soul.</i><br><br>But a modern apostle who saw the Savior in Gethsemane, Orson F. Whitney, replied:<br><br><i>Art thou in truth?</i><br><i>Then what of Him who bought thee with His blood?</i><br><i>Who plunged into devouring seas</i><br><i>And snatched thee from the flood,</i><br><br><i>Who bore for all our fallen race</i><br><i>What none but Him could bear--</i><br><i>The God who died that man might live</i><br><i>And endless glory share.</i><br><br><i>Of what avail thy vaunted strength</i><br><i>Apart from His vast might?</i><br><i>Pray that His light may pierce the gloom</i><br><i>That thou mayest see aright.</i><br><br><i>Men are as bubbles on the wave,</i><br><i>As leaves upon the tree,</i><br><i>Thou, captain of thy soul! Forsooth,</i><br><i>Who gave that place to thee?</i><br><br><i>Free will is thine--free agency,</i><br><i>To wield for right or wrong;</i><br><i>But thou must answer unto Him</i><br><i>To whom all souls belong.</i><br><br><i>Bend to the dust that "head unbowed,"</i><br><i>Small part of life's great whole,</i><br><i>And see in Him and Him alone,</i><br><i>The captain of thy soul.</i><br>["The Soul's Captain"]<br><br>I think that we need to come to the point where we find Him and know that he is the captain of our soul. If we can "bend to the dust our 'head unbowed'" and accept him and strip the pride from our beings and serve our fellowmen, we walk in his steps.<br><br>The great prophet Job wrote:<br><br><i>Oh that my words were now written? oh that they were printed in a book!</i><br><br><i>That they were graven with an iron pen and lead in the rock for ever!</i><br><br><i>For I know that my redeemer liveth, and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the earth:</i><br><br><i>And though after my skin worms destroy this body, yet in my flesh shall I see God.</i>[Job 19:23–26]<br><br>And then, in this last day, Joseph Smith and Sidney Rigdon, two great prophets, declared our gift to this generation:<br><br><i>And now, after the many testimonies which have been given of him, this is the testimony, last of all, which we give of him: That he lives!</i><br><br><i>For we saw him, even on the right hand of God; and we heard the voice bearing record that he is the Only Begotten of the Father--</i><br><br><i>That by him, and through him, and of him, the worlds are and were created, and the inhabitants thereof are begotten sons and daughters unto God.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 76:22–24]<br><br>Finally, in the words quoted in the beginning:<br><br><i>Hearken, O ye people of my church, to whom the kingdom has been given; hearken ye and give ear to him who laid the foundation of the earth, who made the heavens and all the hosts thereof, and by whom all things were made which live, and move, and have a being.</i><br><br><i>And again, I say, hearken unto my voice, lest death shall overtake you; in an hour when ye think not the summer shall be past, and the harvest ended, and your souls not saved.</i><br><br>My prayer is that our learning and education will not only touch on the great truths of life, but more importantly will focus on the life of the Master. That we might hear his voice and follow in his sacred and holy footsteps I pray this day in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Vaughn J.

<h1>at BYU: A Formula - Dallin H. Oaks - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
My dear brothers and sisters: Last week at this same hour we heard a message from the prophet of God. President Spencer W. Kimball gave us a message of love and admonition and challenge: he expressed his love for each of us, he admonished us to behave with integrity toward our commitments and to do what we know to be right, and he challenged us "to equip [ourselves] to be honorable, productive citizens of the Kingdom" (Spencer W. Kimball, "Integrity: The Spirit of BYU," in<i>Speeches of the Year</i>,<i>1979</i>[Provo: Brigham Young University Press, 1980], p. 163).<br><br>In this annual President's Message I will follow this same pattern of love and admonition and challenge.<br><br>As I look out upon this great audience of faculty and students, my heart overflows with feeling for each of you. I feel like the Prophet Joseph Smith must have felt as he said of Nauvoo and its people: "This is the loveliest place and the best people under the heavens" (<i>History of the Church</i>, 6:554). There is nothing more exciting and rewarding than to observe the growth of a human soul, and that is the daily blessing of those who are privileged to serve at BYU. We who serve here are grateful that our life's work can be associated with the processes of creation and learning, which are the unique concerns of the University.<br><br>We are also grateful that we can work in this atmosphere. There is no group of thirty thousand anywhere on the face of the earth who are comparable to those who study and work on this campus. Our relationships with one another are expressive of love and trust. We are truly friends to one another. In another great statement made during the closing period of his life, the Prophet Joseph Smith said:<br><br><i>Friendship is one of the grand fundamental principles of "Mormonism" . . . to revolutionize and civilize the world, and cause wars and contentions to cease and men to become friends and brothers. . . .</i><br><br><i>It is a time honored adage that love begets love. Let us pour forth love--show forth our kindness unto all mankind, and the Lord will reward us with everlasting increase. . . .Friendship is like . . . [a blacksmith] welding iron to iron; it unites the human family with its happy influence.</i>[<i>History of the Church,</i>5:517]<br><br>This is a campus of friendship and love in the greatest and best sense of those words. I know that I speak for all of your teachers and other servants at BYU when I say how much we love the students of Brigham Young University and how much we want them to succeed. We are committed to your success, not just in the classroom and the examination, but in the greater and more lasting accomplishments of learning and eternal growth.<br><br>You are worthy of special love and concern. Surely there is no group of men and women anywhere on the face of the earth who are more worthy of Heaven's blessings or more willing and committed to serve their Father in Heaven and their brothers and sisters than those who gather on this campus.<br><br>Our loving relationships include those who are not of our faith. This year, as always, our student body includes about one thousand students who are not members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. We welcome you as friends and brothers and sisters, and we anticipate that your presence here will enrich our education as well as yours. We invite you to take part in the active religious life of our campus wards and stakes. If you choose not to, we urge you to affiliate with a church of your choice and to have an active religious life so that your college years will be times of spiritual as well as intellectual growth.<br><br>Not just the Church, but the whole world has a great stake in what happens at BYU. We live in a world of sin and ignorance. I heard it said the other day that when there is a problem to be solved God sends a child. All the hopes of this troubled world rest with its youth. We who are teachers and exemplars have the holy calling of helping you to prepare for the missions that will give reality to these hopes. You are our future.<br><br>As we begin this new school year some of you are having your first experience in higher learning. Others have transferred here after beginning studies in another place. Still others are resuming their studies at BYU after service in the mission field or continuing after studies here last year. But all of you are here because you desire to grow in intellect and spirituality. You have come to the right place. BYU is a unique place for growth and learning.<br><br>Often, during the hours that I have spent preparing this message, my thoughts have gone back to my own experiences at BYU. I graduated twenty-five years ago this spring. BYU was a small college then, with about five thousand students. It was little known beyond the valleys of the mountains and the enclaves of Mormon culture. In paper credentials its faculty were less qualified, and I seem to recall that its students were less serious. The educational program was less exacting then than now. Yet the concern for spirituality and eternal values that makes this University unique today was present then, and so were those loving relations between and among students and teachers.<br><br>As I look back and identify the most important ingredients in my experiences at BYU they are the same you would cite to explain why you have chosen to study here. There is something special about this place, something easier to feel than to describe. It is what the alumni call "The Spirit of the 'Y'." President Kimball referred to it last week when he said that, although there are vast differences between the size and physical facilities of the BYU he attended and the BYU of today, "what matters most is the spirit of the program." To use his words:<br><br><i>Brigham Young University was established for the purpose of helping men and women to learn all that the world has to teach them, but to do so in a setting infused with faith in the continuing concern of God for man, in the redemptive sacrifice of Christ, and in the capacity and willingness of the Lord to speak to us today, both through the quiet whisperings of the Spirit which come to us as individuals and through the words of leaders he has called to give us guidance. That is the spirit I felt here when I was young; it is still the spirit which animates this great institution.</i>[Kimball, "Integrity," p. 161]<br><br>Also unchanged is the formula for success at BYU. It is unchanged because it is grounded on eternal truth. It is the same for you as it was for those who enrolled a century or a half-century or a quarter-century ago. I can identify four ingredients; I share them with you and use them as the organizing principle for the words of admonition and challenge I will offer. The ingredients of success at BYU are: first, be worthy; second, seek learning; third, work hard; and fourth, help others.<br><h2><b>Be Worthy</b></h2><br>First, be worthy. Our focus on personal worthiness is unique. We are concerned with behavior and consider personal worthiness an essential ingredient of our educational enterprise. This concern stems from our knowledge that we learn best when we are in harmony with the commandments of Him who is the source of all truth. By this means we can have the companionship of the Holy Ghost, the great teacher whose mission is to testify of Christ, to guide us into all truth and to bring all things to our remembrance (John 14:26, 15:26, 16:13). Pray for the companionship of the Holy Spirit. Pray for help in your studies. By this means you "seek learning, even by study and also by faith" (D&amp;amp;C 88:118).<br><br>We must also keep the commandments of God. The Holy Spirit will not dwell in us if we are not clean and pure. Sin drives out the Spirit of the Lord, and we lose the promised assistance. This is one of those eternal principles that you can verify by immediate personal experience. Recall a time when you were resentful or quarrelsome or angry or filled with hate. Could you study effectively? Could you think clearly? Did you receive any enlightenment during that period?<br><br>Sin and anger darken the mind. They produce a condition in men and women that is the opposite of the light and truth that characterize the word intelligence, which is the glory of God. Repentance, which can cleanse us from sin through the atoning sacrifice of Jesus Christ, is therefore an essential step along the path of learning for all who seek light and truth.<br><br>In the 88th section of the Doctrine and Covenants the Lord gives this great promise, which clearly ties personal worthiness to the enlightenment of the mind: "And if your eye be single to my glory, your whole body shall be filled with light, and there shall be no darkness in you; and that body which is filled with light comprehendeth all things" (D&amp;amp;C 88:67).<br><br>As President Kimball said last week:<br><br><i>I have learned that where there is a prayerful heart, a hungering after righteousness, a forsaking of sins, and obedience to the commandments of God, the Lord pours out more and more light until one finally has power to pierce the heavenly veil and to know more than man knows.</i>[Kimball, "Integrity," p. 163]<br><br>This is the ideal toward which we strive, but none of us measures up completely. None of us is perfect. Though our desires are good, we are all capable of foolish and self-destructive acts and omissions. We all have need of repentance. We all need to be tolerant and loving with one another. At some time of our lives, each of us needs help in getting over what someone has called "Fools' Hill," that steep slope between the foolishness and self-centeredness of boys and girls and the wider unselfish perspective of men and women.<br><br>The provisions of BYU's Code of Honor identify our commitments to behave so that we will be worthy of the companionship and teaching influence of the Holy Ghost as we pursue our studies in this unique institution. In doing so we draw closer to our Savior, the light and life of the world, who enlightens our eyes and quickens our understanding (D&amp;amp;C 88:11). The importance of knowing Him and qualifying for His blessings was impressively described in these words of Malcolm Muggeridge, British journalist, author and broadcaster:<br><br><i>I may, I suppose pass for being, a relatively successful man. People occasionally stare at me in the streets--that's fame. I can fairly easily earn enough to qualify for admission to the higher slopes of the Internal Revenue--that's success. Furnished with money and a little fame even the elderly, if they care to, may partake of trendy diversions--that's pleasure. It might happen once in a while that something I said or wrote was sufficiently heeded for me to persuade myself that it represented a serious impact on our time--that's fulfillment. Yet I say to you--and I beg you to believe me--multiply these tiny triumphs by a million, add them all together, and they are nothing--less than nothing, a positive impediment--measured against one draught of that living water Christ offers to the spiritually thirsty.</i>[Quoted in George C. Roche III, "Faith and Freedom," in<i>Imprimis</i>8, no.8 (August 1979):2.]<br><h2><b>Seek Learning</b></h2><br>Second, seek learning. If you would be successful in pursuing an education at BYU, be hungry to learn. If you desire to obtain a good education, one that will increase your joy and enlarge your capacity to serve your family, your community, and your profession, seek learning for the sake of learning. Do not limit yourself to a grudging compliance with minimum requirements of attendance, assignments, and degrees. Pursue learning for the purpose implied in the motto of this University--"The Glory of God is Intelligence."<br><br>Remember that you are here to gain an education, to become a person of learning. This qualification or status often involves degrees and an increased value on your services in the marketplace, but it is distinguishable from either of them. A learned person can think clearly and communicate effectively and has a fund of knowledge and understanding about people and social institutions and the physical world. There is no better indicia of a learned person than that contained in the Lord's commandment that His people should be instructed in:<br><br><i>Things both in heaven and in the earth and under the earth; things which have been, things which are, things which must shortly come to pass; things which are at home, things which are abroad; the wars and the perplexities of the nations, and the judgments which are on the land; and a knowledge also of countries and of kingdoms."</i>[D&amp;amp;C 88:79]<br><br>An educated person will be adaptable, because his or her skills and knowledge are the general kind that equip a person to live and lead in society, not just to perform a highly specific individual task. The trouble with highly specialized skills is that technology can make them as obsolete as the skills involved in manufacturing clipper ships, carriages, or slide rules.<br><br>A learned person is an enemy to ignorance, and there is so much ignorance in the world. People by and large lack literacy in economics, history, and government; in nutrition, ethics, and education; in law and medicine. We are too easily victimized by quacks and demagogues, by rain-makers, panacea-peddlers, and political and other practitioners of the cults of something-for-nothing and get-rich-quick. A learned Latter-day Saint should seek answers to the important physical, social, and political problems of the day. He or she should be prepared to defend the truth, to withstand social pressures, and to make a positive contribution to society.<br><br>Can you identify our most important current problems? Do you know what is happening in the world around you? Do you read a newspaper every day, or do you depend on the fragments of news you receive on television or radio? In addition to the<i>Universe</i>, which should be read for campus news, each BYU student should read at least one other daily newspaper. Some will choose the Provo<i>Daily Herald</i>, which has fine coverage of local and community events in addition to national and international news. Others will read the morning<i>Salt Lake Tribune</i>or the evening<i>Deseret News</i>. The<i>Deseret News</i>, of course, includes, the<i>Church News</i>on the weekend, which is of vital interest to every Latter-day Saint. Others may wish to go to the library and read one of its collection of 30 daily newspapers from all parts of the world. Whether by individual trips to the library or other source or by subscription in each apartment or by some other cooperative arrangement, each student should read a daily newspaper.<br><br>If you miss one single forum assembly in this year, you will have missed a great opportunity for learning. No matter what the subject, all of our forum assemblies, and a selective sampling of the other lectures given on campus, are an essential part of your education at BYU. It has been my personal experience that the intellectual excitement produced by an excellent lecture--whatever the subject--stimulates my mind and brings a flood of ideas, even in subjects unrelated to the lecture. Do not miss that stimulation and the added perspective given by the superior lecturers we have on this campus.<br><br>At Brigham Young University you are privileged to take a guided tour with the best thinkers and through the best information available in the world today. Most of you will be eager and alert, stimulated by ideas, struggling with the exciting process of learning. Most BYU students are busy preparing themselves for the important responsibilities that they will bear. Do so. Do not be one of that smaller but painfully visible group of students who are still struggling up the far slopes of "fools' hill," chasing butterflies, giggling on the fringes, and pursuing the frivolous things of life while the sands of their study time at the University fall through the hourglass at their inexorable rate. These will finally leave--perhaps with a degree, hopefully with some kind of a job, but almost certainly without the education and learning that is the purpose of our mission here.<br><br>Those who are not willing to seek learning should voluntarily withdraw from the University and allow their place to be taken by some of the thousands who are clamoring for admission. It is wrong to do otherwise. The resources devoted to the education of each student at BYU are enormous. You are aware that for every dollar you pay in tuition the Church appropriates more than two additional dollars out of its sacred tithing resources. In addition, those tithing resources have built this huge campus with all of its beautiful and serviceable facilities. If you take the annual capital cost of the investment in this campus and add it to the annual appropriation for the costs of education here, the total exceeds the earnings on a capital fund of more than $50,000 for each of the students at BYU. Stated otherwise, this means that each student at BYU is supported by a capital investment in excess of $50,000 per year. Considering the source of that capital investment, it is appropriate to point out that faithful Mormons all over the world have had to earn and pay an honest tithing on a half-million dollars to provide the capital necessary to support each individual student in this enormous student body. That is what the Church and its members are investing your education. Are you doing your share? Are you investing a commensurate amount of time and effort to seek learning?<br><h2><b>Work Hard</b></h2><br>Third, work hard. I love the lines of Longfellow's poem:<br><br><i>The heights by great men reached and kept</i><br><i>Were not attained by sudden flight,</i><br><i>But they, while their companions slept,</i><br><i>Were toiling upward in the night.</i><br>["Ladder of St. Augustine"]<br><br>As you analyze your own study habits and self-discipline, ask yourself whether you are, in effect, sleeping or just lazing along waiting for some kind of "sudden flight" to a lofty position. Be the kind of person who uses time carefully, making every minute count for learning and earning and living. If so, you will be "toiling upward in the night," taking the steps necessary to move you to the heights.<br><br>There are few things that give me more pain than to see young men and women who do not realize their potential, who do not "get their act together" and discipline themselves into the work necessary to acquire the skills and learning characteristic of a good education. There is too much sunning on the lawn, too much seeking after pleasure, too much dependence upon the opinions and work of others, too little self-reliance.<br><br>I know of no better words of advice on this subject than to "work first, and play later." The discipline of forcing oneself to work first until the job is completed--whether it be a daily assignment, a term paper, or other needed task--and only then to enjoy the pleasure of play is a master secret of life. It bears immediate fruits in accomplishment, but its most important long-range effect is self-discipline, which unlocks the door to undreamed-of accomplishments. How do you spend your time? Are you the master of your own time, or do others control your time by flicking the switch on a television or by impromptu invitations to pleasures or diversions that you have no willpower to resist? Work first, and play later.<br><br>We are fond of saying that BYU is the Lord's university, but we do not make it so by self-labeling or self-congratulations. Nor do we achieve that standing by whining excuses, by self-righteous posturing, or by trivial rhetoric in the<i>Universe</i>or other public press. Neither do we become great scholars or educated persons by being hired by or admitted to the University. Academic accomplishments and standing come from an accumulation of individual effort in the classroom, the laboratory, and the library, not by University action in the office of admissions or public relations.<br><br>One of the greatest obstacles to achieving the University's prophetic destiny is the thought that we have already arrived, either as an institution or as students or faculty in it. In the Second Century Address he delivered on this campus four years ago, President Spencer W. Kimball challenged us to greatness by reciting many things we have yet to do. Then, he promised, in the process of time, as we put forth the enormous effort required, "this will become the fully anointed university of the Lord about which so much has been spoken in the past" (Spencer W. Kimball, "The Second Century of Brigham Young University," in<i>Speeches of the Year</i>,<i>1975</i>[Provo: Brigham Young University Press, 1976], p. 253). A great work remains to be done. Many lives are yet to be blessed. There is work enough to do for all of us. Let us each commit our best efforts toward that great destiny.<br><h2><b>Help Others</b></h2><br>Fourth, help others. The final ingredient of success at BYU requires us to lift our eyes from the essentially personal concerns of being worthy, seeking learning, and working hard. We should make a contribution to the lives and well-being of those around us, of the University, and of the Church that sponsors, supports, and directs us.<br><br>There are many ways to help others on this campus. In the course of the year we will encourage everyone to make a cash contribution, even a nominal one, to help the University's fund-raising. But more importantly, I hope that each of you will find a variety of ways to give of yourself in personal service to others. Some can work in student government; some in student development; some in the Cougar Band; some by representing the University on athletic teams, in performing groups, or in other competitive activities; some in community service projects; some in various social, political, or service organizations. All can assist in the national energy crisis by walking when possible and by being conservative in thermostat settings. All can help keep our campus clean and beautiful, and all can serve in Church callings.<br><br>But even as I urge you to serve others, I need to caution you to keep your lives in balance. Remember that your primary activity during this period of your life is to get an education. Do not spend so much time in service activities that you neglect your priority responsibility to obtain an education during your years at BYU. Even as King Benjamin, that great Book of Mormon prophet, exhorted his people to impart of their substance to the poor, he cautioned them to "see that all these things are done in wisdom and order; for it is not requisite that a man should run faster than he has strength" (Mosiah 4:27).<br><br>Our Code of Honor also commits us to help others to "fulfill their responsibilities under this Code." There are many ways to do this. At a minimum it means that we should set a worthy example of observance ourselves. Also, we should discourage others from violating the Code. In more serious instances, it will be appropriate to seek the help of a bishop or other ecclesiastical officer. And where the violation poses a serious and immediate threat to members of the University community, it will even be necessary to report the conduct to responsible University officials. Such would be your obligation, for example, if you knew someone who was engaging in predatory sexual behavior or was using drugs, both of which offenses can involve others in serious moral transgressions. Already this semester we have had one such incident. Two days before classes began two young men who had come to BYU from another state were smoking marijuana in their room in one of our dormitories. Smelling something suspicious, an alert student notified Security and these prospective students were arrested, charged, dismissed from school, and sent home, all before classes began. I am grateful for the student who reported this serious incident. We are determined not to have any drug abuse at BYU, and with that kind of cooperation we never will.<br><br>As a less serious level, your obligation of consideration for others should rule out the kind of juvenile horseplay or distractions that make if difficult or impossible for roommates to study. These are serious breaches of courtesy in a learning community. Help create an atmosphere where all BYU students can meet their responsibilities--including their responsibilities to seek learning by study and also by faith. Have concern for the safety of others. Never be part of the kind of destructive prank that disables a fire extinguisher or misuses the emergency phones we have installed to provide an immediate communication line to Security for those persons who feel physically threatened and need immediate assistance or reassurance.<br><br>Another way to help others is to keep your commitment to observe our Dress and Grooming Standards. I receive many questions from students on this subject, and many letters from alumni. Some ask why we have such standards; others ask why, when we have them, we do not have one hundred percent observance. President Kimball answered most of these questions last week. Once you have promised--as you have--observance is a matter of integrity. Why is this promise a condition of enrollment? As President Kimball told us last week, BYU is "a showplace," a "city set on an hill, which cannot be hid" (Kimball, "Integrity," pp. 161–162). What we do here is noted far and wide.<br><br>President Kimball also expressed his approval of the fact that visitors can come to this campus and "see young men and young women who look like men and women, who have not succumbed to the morally destructive trend toward a unisex appearance in dress and grooming." He reminded us that "if we dress like the opposite sex, we tend to lose our sexual identity or some of the graces that distinguish the eternal mission of our sex." (Kimball, "Integrity," p. 162.) Be especially watchful to observe those portions of the Dress and Grooming Standards that distinguish visibly between men and women. Men, wear your hair in a way that will not confuse you with feminine fashions. Women, dress so that your clothing will not be confused with men's apparel.<br><br>Those who come to BYU have elected, as President Kimball said, to become part of a special community that has a "special calling to represent the Church and its highest standards" (Kimball, "Integrity," p. 162). We have, in short, a sacred responsibility to conduct ourselves and to present ourselves--including our dress and grooming--so that we fulfill what President Kimball called our "special calling to represent the Church and its highest standards." If we fail to do this we have broken a covenant and failed in a sacred responsibility to help and build others, including the faithful members of the Church whose tithes support our education. Are you measuring up to that responsibility? Will you measure up all day, every day, everywhere, as long as you are a student at BYU? Please resolve that you will.<br><br>I will close with some comments on a current religious and social problem that sweeps across all of my four ingredients for success at BYU, touching worthiness, learning, working, and helping. The subject is men and women.<br><br>The scriptural account of creation tells us that God created man in his own image, "male and female created I them" (Moses 2:27; see also Genesis 1:27). The differences between men and women therefore have their origin in God's deliberate creation. There are many forces in our society that seek or tend to eradicate differences between men and women: in laws, in matters of physical appearance, in forms of address, in cultural amenities, in ecclesiastical functions, and, at the extreme level, even in physical attributes. The leaders of our Church--the living prophets--have set their influence against these tendencies and have taught and counseled members of this Church in terms too clear to misunderstand that the attempted eradication of many of these differences is evil and threatens the appropriate relationship between the sexes and the God-ordained institution of the family.<br><br>At the same time, some efforts to do away with discrimination on the basis of sex are praiseworthy. As the First Presidency said in a recent public letter: "Women, as daughter of God, should have without discrimination every political, economic, and educational opportunity. Where there now exist deficiencies concerning these matters, they can and should be directed by specific legislation." (First Presidency to General Authorities, Regional Representatives, Stake Presidents, Mission Presidents, Bishops, and Branch Presidents in the United States, October 12, 1978.) We have not yet grappled with this problem long enough to define clearly those differences between the sexes that are merely discriminatory social customs rooted in the selfish interests of the dominant male sex, which should be changed, and those differences that are essential and eternal, which must be preserved. The subject is obviously one for continued prayerful consideration and careful attention to the teachings of our leaders.<br><br>In the meantime, what are we doing at BYU? Our Dress and Grooming Standards require some important visual differences between men women, as already noted, but in most respects they make no distinction between the sexes. Both men and women are committed to wear clothing that is neat and clean. Both are required to avoid coming onto campus in bare feet, shorts, or immodest clothing, as well as grubby attire, which is defined as any clothing that is ragged, torn, excessively faded, or conspicuously patched or altered to give a shabby appearance.<br><br>More importantly, we make no distinction in the educational opportunities we offer to our men and women students. Any person on this campus giving counsel that any particular major or field of study is not open on the same basis to young women and young men is doing so without authorization and directly contrary to our policies. The choice is up to you.<br><br>From the beginning of this institution, well over a hundred years ago, we have been committed to coeducation. The founder of this institution was so concerned about the education of women that on one occasion he said that he would rather educate women than men, because a woman's influence through the home and the schooling of sons and daughters would magnify the effect of her education so profoundly. Both men and women need to learn how to become effective parents; both should learn the qualities that make for a happy married life. Both need to be concerned about earning power. Young men generally assume that they will have to earn a living, and this is appropriate; but it is a mistake for young women to assume that they need not be concerned with that subject. I hope that each of us is aware that approximately half of the young women now enrolled in this University will have to earn a living for themselves at some time in their life because they have not married, because they have been widowed, divorced, or separated, because their husband is unable to provide for them, or for some other reason.<br><br>All of the admonitions and challenges I have given can be summarized in this one overarching challenge: keep all of your commitments and make the most of all of your opportunities at BYU. Like the Savior's commandment to be perfect (see Matthew 5:48), it is an impossible challenge to achieve completely and consistently. But it is an ideal that all should seek. We merit blessings and acquire learning as we do. When we slip we should, as President Kimball admonished, use the principle of repentance, "rising again whenever we fall, brushing ourselves off, and setting off again on that upward trail" (Kimball, "Integrity," p. 164).<br><br>You are on the upward trail. You have chosen the high road, where expectations are lofty, effort is great, and blessings are unnumbered. You will succeed. We know that you can. We love you and pray our Heavenly Father's choicest blessings upon you in your righteous efforts, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Dallin H.

<h1> It Worth It?&quot; - M. Russell Ballard - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
My brothers and sisters, I am honored to be here tonight. I would seek an interest in your faith and prayers that what I say might be meaningful and might touch your hearts and cause you to want to be better tomorrow than you have ever been before. It is an awesome responsibility--I think that all of you can sense that--for anyone to take the time of this large audience of wonderful young Latter-day Saints. I assume this assignment with fear and trembling, seeking that the will of the Lord may be done.<br><br>I received the BYU football schedule with an invitation to attend the football games, but was disappointed to find that my travel schedule prevents me from attending any of the games this fall. Still, I thought I would share with you the Ballard family's involvement in BYU athletics.<br><br>My father, who is in his eighty-third year, was assigned here during World War I as an Army officer. While he was in Provo and assigned to this campus, he felt that Brigham Young University should have a football team. He secured permission from the University officials to organize a team but was informed that no funds were available to buy uniforms or other necessary equipment.<br><br>My father, being the enterprising young man that he was--and still is--went about raising money through the communities of Utah County and was successful in raising enough money to buy the first uniforms for the first football team at BYU. He still takes great pleasure in talking about that involvement with this great University. I hope that we have a successful season this year--playing in better uniforms.<br><br>We have had an interesting experience in our family during the last few days. One of our married children and her husband decided to buy a home, and they spent a long time looking everywhere in the valley for a home that they could afford and that would meet their needs. I watched their search with interest. When they came to me for counsel and we went out and looked at the home that they had chosen, I had but one comment to my son-in-law. I would like to have that comment become my theme tonight. I asked him, "Is it worth it?"<br><br>How many times in life do you and I have to ask the question: "Is it worth it?"? I suppose that many of you have purchased automobiles or stereo sets or televisions or something else that you felt was very important. I would guess that as you struggled with the question of whether or not to part with your hard-earned dollars you wrestled in your mind with the question, "Is it worth it?"<br><br>Every day we wrestle with this same question, my dear brothers and sisters. I understand that fifty percent of you are on this campus for the first time, beginning your college career at Brigham Young University. You will be in the throes of academic classwork beginning next week, and some of you are in for some surprises. Some of you are going to find that school at Brigham Young University is a little different from high school. You are going to find that the expectations are higher. You are probably going to find that the opportunities for learning are greater and wider and broader than you ever dreamed possible. I believe I can predict with safety that many times you will go back to your apartment with that question in you mind: "Is it worth it?"<br><br>What are your goals as you enter this great University? Will you pay the price for excellence? Are you willing to become the very best in the field you choose? Have you missionaries who are here from the Missionary Training Center made the commitment in your hearts and in your minds that you are going to be the very best missionaries that you are capable of being. Are some of you students or missionaries just walking through this experience--putting in the time, so to speak? Or have you gotten right down to the heart and core of the purpose of being a student here or being in training at the Missionary Training Center? I would hope that every one of us is wise enough to realize that we can be excellent, that we can reach the top, that we can be the very best if we are willing to pay the price. We must be willing to establish in our minds this fact: In order to be great in whatever we attempt to do in life, we have to decide in advance that it is all worth it.<br><br>Have you set your priorities? Are they solidly and clearly defined in your minds? Were they clear when you got up this morning, And will they be clear tomorrow morning and each morning while you are on this campus? Each morning as you are serving in the mission field, is it clear in your mind what your first priority is? Are your priorities established clearly in relationship to the scriptures? What I would like to convey to you is that we are the sons and daughters of God. We have a great destiny, a great challenge, and a great work to do. Our number one priority could well be: Am I doing and living and acting each day as a candidate for the highest degree of glory in the celestial kingdom? If I asked you to raise your hand if you are interested in entering the highest degree of the celestial kingdom, I would be very surprised if every person's hand did not go up. I think that this is our ultimate long-range goal and our number one priority. I believe that as we think about this, and as we understand a few of the insights that the Lord has given us in the scriptures, we can easily come to the conclusion: Yes, it is worth it.<br><br>If you have brought your scriptures with you, you might like to join me in reading a few verses that demonstrate what I have just said. I invite you to turn to the seventy-sixth section of the Doctrine and Covenants, the fiftieth verse. I will read several verses of scriptures, skipping through the section in the interest of time; but I would encourage each of you to read these instructions carefully as you try to answer in your mind the question, "Is it worth it?" Beginning with verse fifty and fifty-one:<br><br><i>And again we bear record--for we saw and heard, and this is the testimony of the gospel of Christ concerning them who shall come forth in the resurrection of the just--</i><br><br><i>They are they who received the testimony of Jesus, and believed on his name and were baptized after the manner of his burial, being buried in the water in his name, and this according to the commandments which he has given.</i><br><br>I will pause here for just a moment. I would guess that most of you were baptized into the Church when you turned eight years of age. I was; and as I read that scripture and contemplate the kind of decision I made I conclude that I really did not make much of a decision on that day. My mother and father, to whom I am grateful, felt that I should be baptized. I can remember my interview with the bishop when I was eight, and I can remember the coaching from my mother before the interview. I remember her telling me, "Now, the bishop is going to ask you why you want to be baptized"--and I listened to her with great interest to hear what answer I should give the bishop. She also told me that I would be asked about receiving the Holy Ghost and being confirmed; she taught me why that was important. I went to my interview and passed it with flying colors for an eight-year-old; all of the questions were exactly as my mother had said they would be, and I gave all the right answers. But I really did not make much of a decision.<br><br>Many of you are converts to the Church and have had to ponder the question of whether or not you would be baptized--whether or not you would receive this sacred ordinance of the holy priesthood. But all of us, converts or not, have to deal with verse fifty-two every single day, if not every minute, of our lives. The Lord said: "That by keeping the commandments, they might be washed and cleansed from all their sins, and receive the Holy Spirit by the laying on of the hands of him who is ordained and sealed unto this power."<br><br>"That by keeping the commandments . . ." We are faced at this moment with the question, "Is it worth it?" Is it worth keeping all of the commandments? Is it worth being morally clean? Is it worth living the Word of Wisdom? Is it worth being honest--honest in our business and in our dealings here on the campus in classes and tests? Is it worth paying tithes and fast offerings? Is it worth serving faithfully wherever we are called?<br><br>Each moment of each day we are faced with the decision-making based on the evaluation system that we have developed through training in our homes and the training of the Church. The guidelines are clear, and our vision should be riveted on the long-range goal of qualifying to inherit the highest degree of glory in the celestial kingdom.<br><br>I do not believe for a minute that simply wanting that great and glorious blessing will bring it to you, unless you are willing to repent where necessary and keep the commandments. I wish that somehow, by some gift, I could reach into your hearts and minds and build a sensitivity and love for the Lord. I would unite the force of that spirit within you with his spirit, so that you could rivet your eyes on that great goal and be willing to pay the price and keep the commandments.<br><br>Verse fifty-three: "And who overcome by faith, and are sealed by the Holy Spirit of promise, which the Father sheds forth upon all those who are just and true." Just a word about that: it is possible to fool your bishop, your mother and your father, your stake president--and even your mission president, you elders and sisters. But you cannot fool the Holy Ghost.<br><br>Oftentimes when we had a question-and-answer session in my mission, and invariably during such sessions in the missions that I have toured since becoming a General Authority, this question is asked: "Brother Ballard, what must we do to have our calling and election made sure?"<br><br>The answer seems relatively simple--perhaps too simple for some of us--but as I have studied that question I feel safe in answering it by saying, "Live your life in such a way that the Holy Spirit, or the Holy Ghost, can testify to the Father on your behalf that you have in very deed been just and true in keeping all of the commandments." You and I cannot fool the Holy Ghost. It is not wisdom to try that. It is safety just to strive to keep the commandments every day by riveting our goal in our minds.<br><br>Is it worth the commitment that is necessary? Let me read to you verse fifty-five: "They are they into whose hands the Father has given all things." I want to explain that because I am not sure that it has completely penetrated your mind yet, and it must in order for you to keep in focus the questions I am placing before you tonight: Is it worth it? This means those who keep all of the commandments, those who are just and true in the eyes of the Holy Ghost and on whose behalf the Holy Ghost can testify before the Father--"they are they into whose hands the Father has given all things."<br><br>Ponder for a moment the meaning of the statement that all our Father has will be given you and me if we will keep all of the commandments. When I ponder that our Heavenly Father, through his great and glorious and exalted understanding and mastery of the holy priesthood, organized this world on which we live with the assistance of his beloved Son, Jesus Christ; when I contemplate that matter unorganized was organized into a world upon which you and I could dwell; when I contemplate that by the power of almighty God daylight was separated from darkness and the land from the sea, and the fishes were placed in the sea and the fowls in the air; when I contemplate the creation process--reread it in the book of Genesis--and realize that the Father promises to all his sons and daughters who are willing to pay the price of keeping all his commandments that he will give unto them<i>all</i>he has, I feel that it is indeed worth the price.<br><br>Verse fifty-eight describes further those who learn to be obedient, to master themselves, to set priorities, and not to lose sight of the long-range priority in the process of life: "Wherefore, as it is written, they are Gods, even the sons of God." Oh, my brothers and sisters, if you could only contemplate and really understand, while you are here at this great University at your young age, what that means! And then, if you could just place that priority properly in your life and live up to it, you would never have any difficulty making the right decisions. You would always have tucked in the back of your mind this concept: "It is worth it. I am not going to compromise; I am not going to shortcut; I am going to go all the way, because it is worth it."<br><br>Verse sixty-two: "These shall dwell in the presence of God and his Christ forever and ever." Is that where you want to go? Is that where you want to be?<br><br>May I take a moment and share with you the feeling of Melvin J. Ballard, my grandfather and an apostle of the Lord? His recorded testimony is one of the great witnesses of this generation. He stood in the presence of the Savior of this world and was embraced by him and blessed by him, and he recorded in his testimony before the Quorum of the Twelve and the First Presidency in the temple on January 9, 1919, "Oh! if I could live worthy, though I would require four-score years, so that in the end when I have finished I could go into His presence and receive the feeling that I then had in His presence, I would give everything that I am and ever hope to be!" (Melvin R. Ballard,<i>Melvin J. Ballard . . . Crusader for Righteousness</i>[Salt Lake City; Bookcraft, 1966], p. 66.) That is where we are talking about trying to go. We are trying to qualify for that blessing and that honor.<br><br>[Verse seventy:]<i>These are they whose bodies are celestial, whose glory is that of the sun, even the glory of God, the highest of all, whose glory the sun of the firmament is written of as being typical . . .</i><br><br>[Verse ninety-two:]<i>And thus we saw the glory of the celestial, which excels in all things--where God, even the Father, reigns upon his throne forever and ever. . . .</i><br><br>[Then we have these powerful words in verses ninety-five and ninety-six--let them penetrate:]<i>And he makes them equal in power, and in might, and in dominion. And the glory of the celestial one, even as the glory of the sun is one</i>.<br><br>My brothers and sisters, that is a lofty goal and a great objective; but it is a promised objective, a real objective obtainable by you and me if we are willing to pay the price.<br><br>Could you turn quickly to the eighty-fourth section of the Doctrine and Covenants, the thirty-third through thirty-eighth verses? This, you young men all know, is the oath and covenant of the holy priesthood. There are some words here, though, that I would like you to hear to fortify what the Lord taught earlier in the seventy-sixth section.<br><br><i>For whoso is faithful unto the obtaining these two priesthoods of which I have spoken</i>[listen carefully to the next few words because I think that this is the key],<i>and the magnifying their calling, are sanctified by the Spirit unto the renewing of their bodies.</i><br><br><i>They become the sons of Moses and of Aaron and the seed of Abraham, and the church and kingdom, and the elect of God.</i><br><br><i>And also all they who receive this priesthood receive me, saith the Lord;</i><br><br><i>For he that receiveth my servants receiveth me;</i><br><br><i>And he that receiveth me receiveth my Father; And he that receiveth my Father receiveth my Father's kingdom; therefore all that my Father hath shall be given unto him.</i><br><br>Is it worth it? Is it worth giving all the attention and all the energy that we can to the building of this great Kingdom here upon the earth? I say yes, it is.<br><br>Now, you missionaries and returned missionaries, let me talk to you for a minute or two about one of the keys that I think is important in keeping the highest degree of the celestial kingdom foremost in our objectives. It will also help keep in our minds the thought, "It is worth it; I am not going to weaken; I am going to go forward; I am going to make it--because that's the promise of the Father to me, his child."<br><br>You and I must learn, as we walk through this life, how to become powerful spiritually. The spirit that dwells within this tabernacle of flesh and bone is the literal offspring of our eternal heavenly parents. We know that; we have all talked about it in Sunday School and priesthood meeting. Because of that spiritual side of our existence, we have a spark of divinity within us; for we trace our common parentage back to our heavenly parents, thus making us all brothers and sisters. We all understand that concept, I am sure. But our great struggle in life (and I must tell you that I have had my struggles and continue to have them, and I believe that everyone else does, too--I would be concerned for someone who did not) is to learn this principle of obedience and reliance upon the Lord. We must educate, feed, and build our academic side, or our temporal or physical side. The spirit has to be powerful and magnified in order to qualify for these great blessings. Section eighty-eight of the Doctrine and Covenants gives us helpful insight on the subject in verses fifteen through twenty-two:<br><br><i>And the spirit and the body are the soul of man.</i><br><br><i>And the resurrection from the dead is the redemption of the soul.</i><br><br><i>And the redemption of the soul is through him that quickeneth all things, in whose bosom it is decreed that the poor and the meek of the earth shall inherit it.</i><br><br><i>Therefore, it must needs be sanctified from all unrighteousness, that it may be prepared for the celestial glory;</i><br><br><i>For after it hath filled the measure of its creation, it shall be crowned with glory, even with the presence of God the Father;</i><br><br><i>That bodies who are of the celestial kingdom may possess it forever and ever; for, for this intent was it made and created, and for this intent are they sanctified.</i><br><br><i>And they who are not sanctified through the law which I have given unto you, even the law of Christ [or the commandments], must inherit another kingdom, even that of a terrestial kingdom, or that of a telestial kingdom.</i><br><br><i>For he who is not able to abide the law of a celestial kingdom cannot abide a celestial glory.</i><br><br>I do not know whether I can totally bring into focus what this means to me, but let me try.<br><br>I think that we should be trying to live the celestial law today. Is there any use in waiting until we are dead to try to live the celestial law? What difference should there be in the way we behave today and the way we will behave when the body and the spirit are separated--is there going to be a difference?<br><br>Grandfather Ballard taught with great power and I have enjoyed studying his sermons. I believe that he spoke with great insight as an apostle and a prophet. He said that when we die we will not even know that we are dead until we try to do something that requires a body and find that we cannot do it when the body and the spirit have been separated. Then, he said, would come our full realization of and great appreciation for the ministry and the atoning sacrifice of the Christ. Then we would all look forward in great anticipation to the day of resurrection, when the body and the spirit could be reunited once again, never to be parted.<br><br>If you have a bad habit, do you think death is going to change it? Do you think that habit will simply dissolve in some miraculous way and will no longer be with you? I believe that the Lord impresses upon you and me the need to repent and live the law, keep the commandments, and keep our lives aligned to the celestial goal; because it is when we are here in mortality that the body and the spirit can learn together.<br><br>For example, when a man who smokes dies and his body is placed six feet into the ground, is there any reason for us to believe that when his body comes back up out of the ground it will no longer have the desires that it had when it was laid down? I do not think so. I think that the body will rise in the resurrection with the same desires and that the body and the spirit together must work out this matter of eternal salvation. This is why you and I must be believing enough and willing enough while we are here on this earth to strive with all our power to keep the commandments. "Is it worth it?" We need to ask ourselves; and I hope that I have made the point clear that it certainly is worth it.<br><br>To receive all that our Father has to give unto his sons and his daughters--by any reasonable standard of thinking, my brothers and sister, we would have to come away from this meeting tonight saying, "Yes, certainly it's worth it." "But," you might say, "It's hard, Brother Ballard. There are so many things out there that I have to conquer." Heavenly Father knows that; he knows that it is difficult. But he is getting to know you and me. I used to tell my missionaries--and I will tell you great young men and women the same--that I do not think there will be a time in your life when the Lord will get better acquainted with you than he will on your mission. Do not tamper with mission rules; do not tamper with the commandments. Just do it because it is right, because that is what the handbook says, because that is what your mission president counsels you do to. Why? Because there is safety in it. They will not counsel you to do anything that will not help exalt you and prepare you to become celestial.<br><br>The importance of such obedience comes home hard to me when President Benson telephoned with an assignment to speak at a funeral service for a missionary who had lost his life in the mission field. Do you have any feeling, brothers and sisters, for what it is like to speak at a service for a missionary who was serving well and lost his life on his mission--who was called home, in effect, to continue to another mission? I was impressed to tell that family that he had been transferred to a greater work, a higher work; but can you sense the feeling that goes through a General Authority's mind in that position? Oh, how grateful I was that I could call the mission president and ask him this brief question: What kind of an elder was he?<br><br>"Outstanding," the president said. "He could have been as assistant. He could have had any assignment in our mission. Brother Ballard, I just didn't have any finer missionary than this young man."<br><br>What a thrill it was to know that that missionary was living the celestial law on his mission. I am sure that he did not expect to be called home. I am sure that he did not expect that accident to occur. But it happened. He was alive and well in the morning and gone in the afternoon. Gone where? Back to the presence of our Father in Heaven.<br><br>Do you think that it was important that he was living the celestial law to the best of his ability? Will you ponder and determine as you walk through this experience at Brigham Young University or on your mission that you are going to live as close to that celestial law as you know how? Determine that you will strive to keep the commandments and strive to build the power of your spirit. Oh, that every one of us might have the power and the feeling of the great prophet Nephi! I love these words in the second chapter of 1 Nephi, the sixteenth verse:<br><br><i>And it came to pass that I, Nephi, being exceeding young</i>[I believe that he was younger than most of you],<i>nevertheless being large in stature, and also having</i>[the key words; listen:]<i>great desires to know of the mysteries of God, . . .</i><br><br>Do you have that desire, a great desire to know of the mysteries of God? Do you desire it enough to pay the price? Nephi did.<br><br><i>Wherefore I did cry unto the Lord;</i>[he said,]<i>and behold he did visit me</i>[When I read those words, chills run up and down my spine],<i>and did soften my heart that I did believe all the words which had been spoken by my father; wherefore, I did not rebel against him like unto my brothers.</i><br><br>Oh, the power there is in having a desire to know with all your heart the things of God! Do not permit your quest to become a doctor, lawyer, scientist, educator, salesman, or marketing executive overshadow your quest for a testimony of the divine mission of Jesus Christ, the divine mission of Joseph Smith, the truthfulness of the Book of Mormon, and the knowledge that we are led by a prophet of God, even Spencer W. Kimball. Oh, that that assurance would burn in our hearts! Oh, that we would have the desire burning in our hearts, with all of the power we are capable of mustering, to know the mysteries of God! That the spirit might be educated and prepared for that great day of promise when we will go back into the presence of our Heavenly Father!<br><br>May I close my remarks, with a few great words from our prophet, and may I say to you that we desperately need every single one of you young people prepared--spiritually prepared and with all question out of your mind as to whether or not it is worth it. We need you fully resolved and solidly entrenched, certain that it is worth the goal, worth the quest, and worth the effort; because here is your job, and it is going to be a bigger job for you, I think, than it is for us. the job was given to you and me by President Kimball last April as he closed that great general conference:<br><br><i>Now, my brothers and sisters, it seems clear to me--indeed this impression weighs upon me--that the Church is at a point in its growth and maturity when we are at last ready to move forward in a major way. But the basic decisions needed for us to move forward</i>[listen carefully]<i>as a people must be made by the individual members of the Church. . . .</i><br><br><i>We have paused on some plateaus long enough. Let us resume our journey forward and upward. Let us quietly put an end to our reluctance to reach out to others, whether in our own families, wards, or neighborhoods. We have been diverted at times from fundamentals on which we must now focus in order to move forward as a person and as a people.</i>[Spencer W. Kimball, "Let Us Move Forward and Upward,"<i>Ensign,</i>May 1979, p.82]<br><br>Oh, brothers and sisters, it is worth it! May God bless each one of you that in your individual lives you will find peace in your hearts and your minds. If there is transgression holding you back, seek out your bishop and get your life righted to the celestial path, and then commit yourself to that course if you have not already done so. Commit tonight as you write your goals: "I am going to do my part. I am going to be ready when the brethren need me, whether it is to be a Sunday School teacher or president of the stake or a General Authority. I will be ready because it is worth it."<br><br>I leave my witness and testimony that Jesus is the Christ. He lives; this is his church. How blessed we are to know that! We are on the road back into his holy presence. I testify that, if we will listen to the voice of the prophets and the apostles and strive to keep the commandments, all the blessings of eternity will in very fact become ours. May the Lord bless us to that end. May his peace be in your lives and in your activities on this campus this coming year. Have a great year, have a lot of fun, and in it all find yourself spiritually--find the real, deep roots of your own spirituality. May they be fed and nourished as never before, I pray humbly in the sacred and beloved name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>M. Russell Ballard was a member of the First Quorum of the Seventy of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when this fireside address was given at Brigham Young University on 2 September 1979.</i></i><br><br><i>©Intellectual Reserve, Inc.

<h1>y: The Spirit of BYU - Spencer W. Kimball - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
My dear brothers and sisters: what a thrilling sight it is to look out over this marvelous assemblage of young people--to see the thousands of you students, drawn from nearly every state and nation to pursue your education, and to see you many hundreds of missionaries, gathered together to prepare yourselves for the greatest event of your lives! I am glad to be with you to celebrate the beginning of another year.<br><br>I do not know how eager President Oaks and the University would be to admit it, but I was also a student here at this University. That was a long time ago--before most of you were born--but I was a college student here, and I had anticipated and looked forward all my younger life to someday coming to BYU. It was back in 1917--figure it out for yourselves. I was just a country boy from southern Arizona who had returned from a mission and had done some college work at the University of Arizona before coming to BYU.<br><br>One day I arrived in Provo on the train (the interurban train--some of you will even remember that) and as I got off the train and looked up Center Street toward the east, I saw an impressive white building up on the foot of the mountain. I picked up my heavy bags and started out for what I was sure was BYU. But as I got nearer the building, which was a mile or so up Center Street, I noticed that there were some people out working on the grounds and as I came nearer them they did not change their position very much. I finally realized that this building that I had mistaken for BYU was another building well known in the state of Utah. You can imagine how I felt. Still I was not about to let my embarrassment show. I set my bags down outside, went inside the building with a brave face, and looked the place over as if I were going to inspect it or even buy it. Then I turned around, picked up my bags, and walked quickly back to town.<br><br>The First World War was going on then, and I had been in school just a week when I received a telegram from the Draft Board notifying me that I should appear for a preinduction physical examination. A week after that I was pronounced fit and ready for the Army. I may have set some kind of record for the shortness of my stay here. I have frequently admitted since then, that it took me only a week to get through BYU.<br><br>The classes I took were small. I took theology from President Brimhall and there were only six in my class. There were four of us in history and two in math, and I was all alone in a public speaking class, in which I learned a few things during those few days I spent at college here. I learned how to breathe deeply, how to roar like a lion and squeak like a mouse, and how to gesticulate with my hands. Those are skills I have been using ever since.<br><br>The whole student body then at BYU was a relative handful compared with the great company gathered together today, but I believe that the essential things are unchanged. There may be a vast difference in the number of students and in the scope of the Physical Plant, but what matters most is the spirit of the program. Brigham Young University was established for the purpose of helping men and women to learn all that the world has to teach them, but to do so in a setting infused with faith in the continuing concern of God for man, in the redemptive sacrifice of Christ, and in the capacity and willingness of the Lord to speak to us today, both through the quiet whisperings of the Spirit which come to us as individuals and through the words of leaders he had called to give guidance. That is the spirit I felt here when I was young; it is still the spirit which animates this great institution.<br><br>This is a place where there is a broad commitment on the part of both faculty and students to serve the Lord in whatever he asks of them. That commitment makes them better scholars than they would be otherwise. I want to commend all of you on the depth of dedication to both intellectual and spiritual excellence that I perceive in you here. [At this point President Kimball, who was suffering from cataracts and had difficulty reading, asked President Oaks to read the remainder of this speech.]<br><br>In the stakes made up of BYU students, there is an exceptionally high level of faithfulness in the more easily measured aspects of gospel living: the expenditure of countless hours in service to others, the unselfish financial contribution to worthwhile cause, the participation in gospel study and in meetings. What is not so directly observable, but what I sense to be true, is that nowhere in the world is there a more concentrated group of people who have it as their goal to please God and to return to his presence, worthy of his acceptance.<br><br>This is "a city . . . set on a hill [which] cannot be hid" (see Matthew 4:14). What you do here is noted far and wide; an act of vandalism at BYU or an irritated letter to the editor of the school newspaper often makes national news. There are millions of people watching. Among them some are hostile, some are jealous, and a great many are curious. They stand in wonder at what we have here set ourselves to achieve. The Lord's standards, which we strive to meet, are high indeed--so high that we are likely sometimes to fail. But temporary setbacks are no disgrace if we try without ceasing. Never, never give up in well doing!<br><br>Much is expected of us because much has been given. That is a principle of the Lord. It is important for you to realize that all the facilities and organizations you see about you at this University did not just happen. You have a marvelous setting for your task--fine classrooms, efficient laboratories, extensive libraries, comfortable dormitories, generous recreational facilities, beautiful grounds. And all this comes to you at a small fraction of its actual cost. Most of the balance comes from the tithes of faithful members of the Church--your parents, neighbors, and others throughout the world--who give gladly from their wealth or their poverty in the firm conviction that they are giving the Lord his due. The Church has a sacred responsibility to use those funds well, and in fulfillment of that responsibility we allocate many millions of dollars to the operation of this school. Why? For your benefit, and through you for the benefit of the Kingdom, whose future leaders you are. Since you are the beneficiaries of a great spiritual heritage, of a great fund of the world's knowledge, and of institutional means for blending the two, we ask you to make this University all that it can be, all that it should be, and all that it must be if we are to fulfill our "errand from the Lord."<br><br>Brigham Young University brings together students and faculty who are committed by covenant to live by a unique standard--a standard of freedom from such ills of the world as dishonesty, sexual immorality, disrespect for others, the seeking of pleasures from harmful or addictive drugs, and scorning of the law. And that high standard is largely met by you students and faculty. People are amazed, for example, at the large number of pencils turned in to the Lost and Found Department. That is the kind of meticulous honesty of which we are proud. In addition, there exists here a friendliness, concern, modesty, and self-restraint that are remarkable in a community so large. I only wish that such conduct were universal. But, even here there are a few who still have some maturing and repenting to do. We hear too many reports of destructive pranks, of plagiarism or cheating, or petty shoplifting, of self-appointed censorship or selfish removal of library materials, and of disregard of the University standards of dress and grooming.<br><br>When I was here last year, I spoke in the same vein of the need for integrity. I make no apology for returning to that theme, because integrity (which includes the willingness and ability to live by our beliefs and commitments) is one of the foundation stones of good character, and without good character one cannot hope to enjoy the presence of God here or in the eternities. In this institution students and faculty commit themselves explicitly to abide by a code of conduct which includes both living by the moral precepts of the gospel and conforming to a dress and grooming code. Some purport to accept the moral standards as important and denigrate the other as trivial and as intruding on their freedom of choice. These people fundamentally misperceive the question, which is not whether the dress or grooming code is wise, but whether they should consider themselves bound by a promise. It is not that such a code is forced upon anyone; there is free choice to come here or to go to some other institution which makes no such demands. Indeed, other schools, often supported by tax monies, may be less costly to attend, may have equally high academic standards, and will probably have associated with them a Church-sponsored institute of religion--a program which provides for wholesome social life and gospel study without binding the students to abide by BYU standards. There is no disgrace in making that choice; it is a wholly legitimate option. But once having elected to come here and to participate in this community with its special calling to represent the Church and its highest standards, you must not compromise your integrity by promising what you will not do. By taking covenants lightly, you will wound your eternal self.<br><br>I use the word<i>covenant</i>deliberately; it is a word with sacred connotations and I mean to use it with all its special spiritual force. Self-justification is easy and rationalization seductive, but the Lord explains in modern revelation that "when we undertake to cover our sins, or to gratify our pride, or our vain ambition . . . the heavens withdraw themselves; the Spirit of the Lord is grieved; and . . . he is left unto himself to kick against the pricks . . ." (D&amp;amp;C 121:37–38). Of course we can choose; the free agency is ours, but we cannot escape the consequences of our choice. If there is a chink in your integrity, that is where the devil concentrates his attack.<br><br>I assure you that all the standards, both those relating to moral conduct and those relating to dress and grooming, are the result of intense, prayerful consideration by those entrusted with the overseeing of this University. BYU is in the best sense of the word a showplace. You might be surprised at the great number of inquiries we get from people wanting to know more because of what they have seen of BYU, its students, its faculty, and its graduates. They see here the beautiful grounds and buildings, which you help to keep almost spotless; they see students who have mastered the skills and knowledge they came here to learn as well as learning self-discipline and hard work, and whom employers are eager to hire; they see men and women whose virtue makes them shine in a crowd; they see young adults whose clean-cut appearance demonstrates that they feel no need to follow after the pattern of the world, which often revels in filth and disorder and garish fads; they see young men and young women who look like men and women, who have not succumbed to the morally destructive trend toward a unisex appearance in dress and grooming; they see people living cheerful, orderly lives, devoted to improving their ability to serve God and their fellowmen.<br><br>Shakespeare had Polonius truly say, "The apparel oft proclaims the man" (<i>Hamlet</i>, act 1, sc. 3). We are affected by our own outward appearances; we tend to fill roles. If we are in our Sunday best, we have little inclination for roughhousing; if we dress for work, we are drawn to work; if we dress immodestly, we are tempted to act immodestly; if we dress like the opposite sex, we tend to lose our sexual identity or some of the graces that distinguish the eternal mission of our sex.<br><br>Now I hope not to be misunderstood: I am<i>not</i>saying that you should judge one another by appearance, for that would be folly and worse; I am saying that there is a relationship between how we dress and groom ourselves and how we are inclined to feel and act. By seriously urging full conformity with the standards, we must not drive a wedge between brothers and sisters; for there are some who have not heard or do not understand. These are not to be rejected or condemned as evil, but rather loved the more that we may patiently bring them to understand the danger to themselves and the disservice to the institutions to which they owe loyalty, if they depart from their commitments. We hope that the disregard we sometimes see is mere thoughtlessness and is not deliberate.<br><br>Perfection is our goal, but we all still have a long road to travel. Maintain your integrity and seek to live by the Spirit. Keep all the commandments, so that you will one day stand blameless before God. Give the Lord this year and every year your faith and loyalty, that he may look with pleasure upon what you have done.<br><br>My beloved young brothers and sisters, I have enjoyed being invited to this place each year to share with you some of my concerns as I, with you, look forward to another season of learning and growing. I commend you for your great faithfulness and devotion to the educational task while living by faith at the same time. You have achieved much already in life to have come this far. Strive to equip yourselves to be honorable, productive citizens of the kingdom.<br><br>I have some final thoughts that I would like to share with you. Love one another. I look forward to reunion one day with my parents--a loving mother whom I lost seventy-three years ago, and a faithful father by whose deathbed I sat fifty-five years ago. I have often felt their continuing concern for my welfare, and I know from my own experience how sweet the love of family can be. But I am also grateful for the larger family of which you are all part: my brothers and sisters in Christ. I love you, in all of your variety and in spite of your human failings, and I know that the Lord loves you more--much more--than is in our mortal capacity to love.<br><br>I know that those whom the Lord has called to give leadership to his children in this dispensation of time are recipients of divine inspiration. My grandfather sat in the first Quorum of the Twelve; My father served as mission president and stake president in a much smaller Church under five presidents of the Church; I have served as a stake officer and General Authority for sixty-one years. Our three lives have spanned essentially the whole period of the restored Church; taken together, we have known with some intimacy almost all of the General Authorities since the Restoration. On that basis I tell you that those Church leaders were men whose great accomplishments have transcended even their substantial innate abilities, for the Lord has given them power to do his work.<br><br>What I say of the Lord's influence on leaders I say also of his influence on countless thousands of others in whose homes I have stayed, whose testimonies I have heard, and whose good works and unselfish service I have seen. I have learned that where there is a prayerful heart, a hungering after righteousness, a forsaking of sins, and obedience to the commandments of God, the Lord pours out more and more light until one finally has power to pierce the heavenly veil and to know more than man knows. Such a person has a priceless promise that one day he will see the Lord's face and know that he is (see D&amp;amp;C 93:1).<br><br>Oftentimes special notice is taken of the General Authorities--and rightly so, since we are under responsibility to pray for them that they may be successful in their callings–but I know that the Lord is just as pleased with any soul on this earth who magnifies whatever calling the Lord has given him as he is with those whose lives and accomplishments are more visible. President J. Reuben Clark, Jr., said simply but eloquently, "In the service of the Lord, it is not where you serve but how. In The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, one takes the place to which one is duly called, which place one neither seeks nor declines." And he lived by that precept. I have all my life sustained my leaders, praying for their welfare, and I have in these past years felt a great power coming to me from similar prayers of the Saints, raised to heaven on my behalf.<br><br>I am grateful for the Lord's longsuffering. He seems to get so little in return for his investment in us. However, the principle of repentance--of rising again whenever we fall, brushing ourselves off, and setting off again on that upward trail--is the basis for our hope. It is through repentance that the Lord Jesus Christ can work his healing miracle, infusing us with strength when we are weak, health when we are sick, hope when we are downhearted, love when we feel empty, and understanding when we search for truth.<br><br>Above all, I declare that Jesus Christ is the center of our faith; I testify to you that he lives. He leads his Church today; he hears our prayers when we humbly, earnestly, unceasingly seek to know his will, making this, too, a day of miracles and of revelation.<br><br>[At this point President Kimball arose to conclude the speech.] I should like to give a very grateful thanks to President Oaks for continuing my talk, and I would like to express to all of you--as you go forth to serve the Lord, keep his commandments, and prove his words--a very great thanks also. I bear witness that this is the truth, that that which my fathers and I and your fathers and you have been teaching to the world is true and divine. God bless you, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Spencer W. Kimball was President of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when this devotional address was given at Brigham Young University on 4 September 1979.</i></i><br><br><i>© Intellectual Reserve, Inc.

<h1>to All People&quot; - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Thank you, President Oaks. My beloved young people, I just wish you could see what I am seeing and feel what I am feeling. I am grateful to be here, and I pray to my Heavenly Father that my expressions might be significant, that I might bear my testimony with each and every line and also let you know what a wonderful opportunity it was for us to be with this group in eastern Europe.<br><br>President Oaks, I did not really realize until this morning how significant our success was. I notice that we have a hotline here--this red telephone is our hotline with the officials over there, and we expect it to ring any minute. (I am joking, of course.)<br><br>May I begin by referring to the very first page of the Doctrine and Covenants.<br><br><i>For verily the voice of the Lord is unto all men, and there is none to escape; and there is no eye that shall not see, neither ear that shall not hear, neither heart that shall not be penetrated.</i><br><br><i>. . . Unto all people, by the mouths of my disciples</i>[that is, you and me]<i>, whom I have chosen. . . .</i>[I believe in foreordination; I hope you do too.]<br><br><i>. . . And none shall stay them, for I the Lord have commanded them.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 1:2, 4, 5]<br><br>Is it not thrilling to see what has happened in Red China? Is it not thrilling to know that we have been making friends in eastern Europe and all over the world in places where we have not been before?<br><br>I am grateful to Brigham Young University, and I am grateful that the Lord has given us the commandment to go unto all the world, and I am grateful for the faith that Nephi had and that you and I share, that the Lord gives no commandment to his children except he prepare a way for us to accomplish that which he has given us to do (see 1 Nephi 3:7). Also in the Doctrine and Covenants, in the ninetieth section, eleventh verse, we read that "Every man shall hear the fullness of the gospel in his own tongue, and in his own language." Thus saith the Lord. How thrilling it was to hear our young people speak in Romanian, to greet the people in Bulgarian, Russian, Polish, and all the other languages, just as they did in China!<br><br>Just a year ago President Kimball had this to say: "We've hardly scratched the surface. We need far more missionaries, and we need more countries that will think of us as being their friends. And this will give us an opportunity to come into their nations and give to their people the finest thing in the world--the gospel of Jesus Christ--which can be their salvation and their great happiness." (Spencer W. Kimball, "Fundamental Principles to Ponder and Live,"<i>Ensign</i>, November 1978, pp. 45-46.) I think that many friends have been made this year, President Kimball. Yes, young people, significant as this past year has been, we have hardly scratched the surface. It is just the beginning. The door is opening; and we are not standing still, I promise you that.<br><br>There are thousands here this morning who have filled missions during the last five years. We congratulate you, and we say to you that you have planted fertile seeds that are beginning to bear fruit. May I review, for just a moment, these past five years since President Kimball has been the prophet and the president of the Church? Just a little over five and a half years ago, when President Kimball was sustained, there were a hundred and eight missions. Today there are one hundred and seventy-five missions--that is a sixty percent increase. The missionary force has grown from 17,258 missionaries to 28,549--a seventy percent increase in total missionaries. About five and a half years ago, missionaries were baptizing on the average about ten people during their two-year missions. Now those missionaries are baptizing about fourteen people each during their two-year missions--a forty percent increase in their effectiveness because of better discussions and better preparation in our Missionary Training Center and by our stake presidents and bishops.<br><br>Finally, the bottom line: in 1973 there were 77,820 baptisms; and this year, if we stay on target--and I know we will--there will be approximately 200,000 convert baptisms. This is not an increase of forty percent or seventy percent or sixty percent, as we review these other figures, but an increase of one hundred fifty-six percent. The dividends are unbelievable in the service of the Lord; and when we do our part and put forth our vital effort, the Lord magnifies us, and he brings forth a one-hundred-fifty-six-percent increase when all that we have done is improve our effort by forty, fifty, or sixty percent. Congratulations to all of you who have been a part of this great success, and special congratulations to you wonderful young people who have gone overseas this year, who have won friends for the Lord, and who have radiated the spirit of this Church and this great land of America.<br><br>Now, my wonderful young people, earlier this year--just about six months ago--in a meeting of the Regional Representatives, President Kimball asked all of the Church to pray for the missionaries. He asked us to pray for the investigators. He invited us to pray for the nations that doors might be opened. Let me just give you a part of that comment from President Kimball.<br><br><i>We should continue to pray individually and in our homes and in our councils and in our meetings and petition the Lord to assist us to find a way to reach the hearts and minds of leaders of nations--China, Russia, eastern European countries, yes, all countries that are now closed or have restrictions on the teachings of the truth of the gospel of Jesus Christ--so that the word might go forward in all the world as has been commanded. Our Father does and will hear our prayers, of this I am certain; but we must "ask in faith, nothing wavering"</i>(James 1:6)<i>. Then we must be prepared to enter once the gates are opened.</i>[Speech to Regional Representatives, September 29, 1978]<br><br>We would be hard pressed to find a thousand people in the Church who can speak Mandarin Chinese, and we would be hard pressed to find a few dozen who can speak Russian; but we must be prepared to enter once the doors are opened. "It appears," the prophet says, "that the time is not too distant when the gospel might be preached to those good people in China." This is what he said six months ago. "There are nine hundred million of them. Are we ready for such an undertaking?" (Speech to Regional Representatives, April 1979.) I hope we are, and I hope we can be. Again, I am grateful for the missionary work that has been done by those in these great overseas groups that we honor this morning.<br><br>Now let us take a brief glimpse into eastern Europe, or the Communist bloc of nations, with another band of the Lord's disciples known as the Brigham Young University Folk Dancers. Oh, how grateful Sister Simpson and I will ever be for the privilege of being with this group! I was just telling this group the other night that every once in a while something significant happens in our life, and we put under 1965 a couple of headline notes and under 1970 another couple of headline notes. Do you know what our headline note is going to be for 1979? We met Mary Bee Jensen--wow! Have you ever met Mary Bee Jensen? Your life would never be the same. She was tremendous, and these young dancers responded in kind to her leadership. May I quote for you a few of the comments they received? From Doyna Buchachadoo (you have to be careful about these names): "The finest group that Friendship Ambassadors has ever sent out."<br><br>Another comment from Bushung Spiruscue: "The American Folk Dancers are the same caliber as our finest Rumanian ensemble, known as Rumanian Rhapsody. On your next trip, we would like to book you in the largest theatres of Romania for four weeks."<br><br>Another comment from the American Embassy in Bucharest: "We will always welcome you in Bucharest, for you are the American image that we want the people of Rumania to see."<br><br>From Alexandru Dema: "We are very proud to have you here in Rumania and proud to be your friends. America must be very proud of you also."<br><br>Come with me to the Black Sea in Bulgaria. As you heard just a few moments ago, these young people had standing ovations everywhere, and they won the first prize in the Mime Neptune Festival and, of course, on the final night the gold medal for first place for the entire festival. But life is not all roses every day as you go into these countries. Let me tell you about tragedy striking on the shores of the Black Sea.<br><br>Brother Clayne Jensen, the husband of Mary Bee Jensen, was taking photographs of sixty or seventy young people from every nation of the western and eastern Europe--arms around one another, having enjoyed the comradery of the festival, they were posing on the shores of the Black Sea with their swimming suits on. Of course everyone wanted a photo record of this great moment--so down came one camera and came another camera, and soon Brother Jensen was standing with one camera in his hand and another twenty-five cameras at his feet. Just as he was ready to snap the shutter, here came a big wave. Sand, sand, salt water, twenty-five cameras, all were churned up together--the wave got every one of them except for the fifteen-dollar camera he had in his hand.<br><br>Let me take you to Russia. Listen to this from the director of all cultural and music programming in Soviet television: "It is an honor to have such a professional group perform for national television. You may be an amateur group, but your show is highly professional and would be accepted on any stage, no matter where. We are sorry you are not booked better in the Soviet Union." (They did not realize what a fine group was coming.) Then she concluded with this comment that I think is very significant: "I wish that my sons could be Mormons and could be more like your boys." How tremendous! We had seventeen young men on this tour; sixteen of those seventeen were returned missionaries, and they conducted themselves accordingly. The seventeenth young man, Ron Egans, will be watching the mailbox very carefully during the next couple of weeks because he is expecting an important letter.<br><br>From Michael Kosinsky, Minister of Culture in Warsaw: "Superb, excellent; I have no words to describe the excellence and the joy I see in your people." And, of course, it has already been explained how the Polish government through Mr. Kosinsky has extended a very generous invitation for us to come back. They wanted us to stay right after the tour for the first two weeks of September, to continue our tour and come home a little late (but I am glad that fell through because I would have missed the Texas A and M football game on television). Instead we are going back in 1981 on a tour with all expenses paid, because they love us.<br><br>Young people, let me tell you about our first guide. She approached us a little warily, not knowing exactly what we were going to be like; but during that first evening she warmed up to us. As our bus pulled by the hotel, we had a group prayer with the bus door closed before we dispersed to our rooms. Brother Ray Beckham, one of your great professors here, offered a prayer for the group; and this guide said, "That's the most beautiful prayer I've ever heard in my life." She had never heard a Mormon prayer before. I am sure that this young lady will never be the same. Dave Douger was kind enough to give her his four-in-one because she wanted to read the Mormon scriptures, so now she has them for her very own. Now Dave will have to earn the money to buy a new set, but he is glad to do that.<br><br>Another guide, a professed atheist, on about the third day really warmed up to the group. Sitting up near the front of the bus, she became a little intimate in her conversation; and she confided in us that not quite a year ago her husband had committed suicide. She told us how depressed she had become, how immersed in total despair. She even contemplated taking her own life, but she did not, perhaps for the sake of her little child.<br><br>Then Sister Simpson, who was sitting by her, said, "Well, what do you think of death?"<br><br>Her face grew somber and she said, "Darkness. Blackness. It's nothing; it's the end. I'm afraid of it."<br><br>Sitting across the aisle was Dennis Seeley, returned from the Taiwan mission; and he said, "Did you know that your husband still lives?"<br><br>For the next twenty minutes, Dennis Seeley explained to her the plan of salvation. He would have stopped at any moment had she expressed resentment or any disinterest; but instead we saw a young lady with her mouth open, with tears on her cheeks; and we heard this young lady say, "I have never heard anything like this before. You don't know what you've done for me." She will never be the same again, and it happened in the front of a bus as we rode through this Communist bloc of nations.<br><br>Let me tell you about one more guide; she was also an atheist. We were in a fast and testimony meeting, and we wondered why she was really there; but I suppose it was her job to keep track of us. A wonderful brother from that particular nation, who had been invited to be with us, wanted to stand and bear his testimony; but he spoke an unusual language, so he invited the guide to interpret for him. We all wondered about this arrangement, but she consented to do so. Everything went fine as she began translating, but after about two minutes her words came with more difficulty. She was obviously a little overwrought and rather upset, and soon she stopped altogether. Then a peace and composure seemed to come over her, and she started translating again and telling about the Savior and the Prophet Joseph Smith. She bore a testimony about the restoration that came from the member's mind but from her lips. Soon tears began to course down her cheeks. This young lady will never be the same again, for she has borne testimony, and she knew that what she was saying was the truth. The Spirit so manifested to her. This was in a crowded little hotel room, with hardly room for one more person to squeeze in.<br><br>My time is nearly up, but I must tell you about a young man whom we met–we were given his name before going over there but we did not know if we were going to be able to make contact with him. But on our first night in his area he made contact with us, and we made arrangements the following evening to go to his home. He met us on a corner and led us there. His wife could speak a little English; and Brother Jarvis, our tour director, could speak Russian and this man knew some Russian. We got along quite well.<br><br>On the basis of a little Church history book written in about 1965, this man had drawn close to the Church. He had found it in one of the English sections of the library there. And oh, how he loved the Church! He had gathered around him ten people who felt the same way, and they were meeting every week. None had been baptized; it was against the laws of the land to baptize in that country. But oh, how he wanted to be baptized! His information from this little history book was meager and outdated; he once asked, "Would you please take my love back to President McKay?" The material was so obsolete that he thought President McKay was still the President of the Church.<br><br>We would return to his area after five weeks of touring, so we left him with a copy of the Book of Mormon and a copy of<i>A Marvelous Work and a Wonder</i>, and his wife was going to translate them. When we came back, that little group of so-called Mormons was not ten strong but had grown to twenty-five in number. And a young man who had been helping us on our bus became so interested by our young people that he insisted on leaving this young man his name so that he could affiliate with this group of so-called Mormons and join in praying for the day when they might be baptized into this Church. Young people, do not ever take your Church membership for granted. It is vital; it is important.<br><br>I could go on, but I must stop for lack of time. But just in a word, at Red Square we met a wonderful man who also loves the Church but has never been baptized. He wanted to meet us on Red Square just before we left on the last day. And there, out of his little briefcase he took a copy of the three-in-one, and turning to the Doctrine and Covenants read at the top of his voice on Red Square what the Lord said to his children about being patient and waiting on the Lord's kindness, and eventually all would come. There were guards around, and we were a little nervous. But then he made one last request: would we please sing "Come, Come, Ye Saints" for him? So we sang "Come, Come, Ye Saints" at the tops of our voices, and we felt so good about that we also sang "God Be with You Till We Meet Again." Then this man put his scriptures back into his bag and said good-bye. Hopefully there will be a time when he will be able to receive the fullness of the gospel.<br><br>My wonderful young people, an all-knowing and wise Heavenly Father has created man in his own image. He has also planted with him an instinct to worship and to be God-fearing--a strong desire to revere one who has achieved perfection. Today, as in all generations past, there are those of Heavenly Father's children who have momentarily lost contact with their Supreme Being, because of conspiring, selfish, and egotistical men and their nefarious schemes which are designed to negate the basic eternal principle of free agency. Such arrangements and deceptions are contrary to the fundamental nature of man and shall one day collapse, for they lack a foundation that is firm and true and eternal. There are millions who have been temporarily deceived into believing that hero worship can take the place of faith and belief in the living God of the universe.<br><br>I bear testimony that Satan's plan is a delusion. It never has worked, and it never will work; and Communism with its hero worship and atheism will eventually fade in the bright light of priesthood authority and eternal truth. Such is our challenge, such is our obligation; such is the obligation of four million Latter-day Saints. We are a part of that process. Our mission is clear; the commandment has been given; our prophet has shown us the way. May God bless us to follow up on these great inroads that have been made on these trips to China and eastern Europe and elsewhere by these and all the other wonderful young people who have let their influence be felt in so many directions, I pray humbly in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Robert L.

<h1>st Be Called of God - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
It is certainly a great privilege and a greater inspiration to be here in your presence. I think that I have never seen this many people in this building before, and to know that you are all here worshipping God and wanting to hear more about his work makes me feel very humble before you.<br><br>But I want you to know that I am grateful for the privilege of being here; I am grateful for the inspiration you are to me; I am grateful for this great University and for the marvelous work that it is doing, not only on this campus but in many parts of the world as your groups travel from place to place.<br><br>I believe that you represent one of the finest testimonies for the truthfulness of this Church for which we could ask. It is a marvelous thing in a day like this, with all of the difficulties there are in the world, to have this many young people all under one roof--more than 20,000 of you--here believing in the Lord Jesus Christ and coming to worship him and to receive the gift of his Holy Spirit as you sit here. I think that it is a great tribute to the Church, and a great tribute to all of you and to the homes from which you come, and that it shows the depth of your conversion.<br><br>When President Pearson spoke about the Lord Jesus Christ, I thought it would be quite appropriate to read one of the testimonies that Paul gave of the Savior. It is one of the finest that we have in holy writ--it is found in the first chapter of Colossians, verses fourteen through eighteen. He is talking here about the Savior:<br><br><i>In whom we have redemption through his blood, even the forgiveness of sins:</i><br><br><i>Who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of every creature:</i><br><br><i>For by him were all things created</i>[and that is something that we should remember]<i>, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by him, and for him:</i><br><br><i>And he is before all things, and by him all things consist:</i><br><br><i>And he is the head of the body, the church: who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead; that in all things he might have the preeminence.</i><br><br>What a marvelous testimony to the Savior! You remember that when Paul wrote of the Savior to the Hebrews and said very much the same thing in the first and second verses of the first chapter of that epistle.<br><br><i>God, who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in times past unto the fathers by the prophets,</i><br><br><i>Hath in these last days spoken unto us by his Son, whom he hath appointed heir of all things, by whom also he made the worlds.</i><br><br>Again Paul testifies that Jesus Christ is the Creator and that creation came about by an act of the Son of God. It did not come about by accident; it did not come about just spontaneously. It came about by an act of God working through the Son, Jesus Christ. And that is why John spoke as he did:<br><br><i>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.</i><br><br><i>The same was in the beginning with God.</i><br><br><i>All things were made by him; and without him was not anything made that was made.</i>[John 1:1–3]<br><br>I have become interested in some of the other translations of that first verse, because it has led many people astray and made them think that there was one God with three different names or personalities. It is interesting to see how some of these other translations read. William Barclay of the Church of Scotland wrote this as his translation:<br><br><i>When the world had its beginning, the Word was already there, and the Word was with God, and the Word was a God; he was the agent through whom all things were made.</i><br><br>The<i>Goodspeed American Bible</i>says:<br><br><i>In the beginning the Word existed. The Word was with God, and the Word was divine. It was he that was with God in the beginning. Everything came into existence through him and apart from him nothing came to be.</i><br><br>I like what the<i>New World Translation</i>has to say:<br><br><i>In the beginning the Word was; and the Word was with God, and the Word was a God. This one was in the beginning with God. All things came into existence through him, and apart from him not even one thing came into existence.</i><br><br>We bear testimony with Paul and John and the others that Jesus Christ indeed is the Son of God. He lives! He is as much alive today as he ever was. He is a being, a real being--physical, resurrected, glorious, celestialized--and he has come back into the world in this day and raised up new prophets of God and speaks through them. It is the testimony of the modern prophets whom he has raised up that indeed Jesus Christ does live. He is the Son of God; he is divine. That is the testimony that we bear, and that is the testimony that we hope every one of you will bear in your hearts and in your actions and in your thoughts.<br><br>Jesus Christ lives. He is the Savior of the world, the Redeemer of all mankind, the Messiah of the Jews, the Savior of the Christians. Jesus Christ is the Son of God!<br><br>I am grateful for our first article of faith. Would you recite that with me? You remember that first article of faith--let us say it together. [Elder Petersen and congregation recite in unison] "We believe in God, the Eternal Father, and in His Son, Jesus Christ, and in the Holy Ghost." And we mean it. We<i>do</i>believe, and we know that he is the Son of God, that God is our Father, and that the Holy Ghost is our minister.<br><br>Would you repeat another one? You remember the fourth article that speaks about the principles and ordinances of the gospel. Say that with me, will you? [Elder Petersen and congregation recite in unison] "We believe that the first principles and ordinances of the Gospel are: first, Faith in the Lord Jesus Christ; second, Repentance; third, Baptism by immersion for the remission of sins; fourth, Laying on of hands for the gift of the Holy Ghost."<br><br>And tonight, because I would like to talk a bit about our great prophet, President Kimball, would you repeat the fifth and sixth articles also? The fifth: [Elder Petersen and congregation recite in unison] "We believe that a man must be called of God, by prophecy, and by the laying on of hands, by those who are in authority to preach the Gospel and administer in the ordinances thereof."<br><br>And you remember the sixth one: [Elder Petersen and congregation recite in unison] "We believe in the same organization that existed in the Primitive Church, namely, apostles, prophets, pastors, teachers, evangelists, etc."<br><br>Very good; thank you. I hope that you said that not only as a recitation but as a pledge of allegiance also, because we surely love the great men who run this Church.<br><br>General conference begins this week. For us General Authorities, conference will begin Tuesday, when we will have training meetings with the brethren who come in from various parts of the world. All of the General Authorities will be here with the exception of Brother Busche in Germany, who has had an illness come upon him suddenly, and whose doctors said it would be better if he were not to come.<br><br>But I am glad to be able to tell you that President Kimball will be there, and we are thrilled by that. He has had a serious illness, but he has also had a most remarkable recovery. His expectation is that he will attend all of the sessions of the conference and that he will speak in most of them. We are very grateful for that.<br><br>It is going to be a significant occasion. I mentioned to some people earlier that I thought this would be a different kind of conference, because it will be a culmination of the faith and prayers of all of the Saints throughout the world looking toward President Kimball's recovery. Now he will be there and they can see him, either in the flesh in the Tabernacle or over the television.<br><br>We are thrilled with President Kimball's recovery. He is such a marvelous, remarkable man--humble, but so devoted and so dedicated in every way to the work. And we are grateful for his counselors, who have stood by his side through this illness especially, but also all through the five or six years in which he has served; and for the Council of the Twelve, who stand by and about him and sustain him in every way. They are the prophets of God.<br><br>Years ago one of the minor prophets, as we sometimes refer to him, gave us one of the basic doctrines of the Church. It is one that each of us needs to remember; it is one that has particular application to us as a result of the restoration of the gospel. This was the prophet Amos, and the statement he made that is so significant is: "Surely the Lord God will do nothing, but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets" (Amos 3:7).<br><br>That precept is so true and has held so firmly all through the years that every one of us must recognize it; God simply does not work except through prophets. There has never been a period in the history of the Church from Adam down through all the dispensations when he has labored with the people that he did not so labor through prophets. That is one of the fundamental principles of the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ: God will work only through prophets.<br><br>When the apostle Paul wrote to the Ephesians, he spoke to them as new converts to the Church--and I suppose that most of them were, because he had helped to convert them. Apparently some of them were not fellowshipped very well, as is the case even now with some of our new people, because Paul wrote and said, "Now therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners, but fellowcitizens with the saints, and of the household of God." He then went on to the subject about which I would like to talk tonight: that they, the members of the Church, and the Church itself were<br><br><i>built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner stone;</i><br><br><i>In whom all the building fitly famed together groweth unto an holy temple in the Lord.</i>[Ephesians 2:19–21]<br><br>We do not hear this taught very much, and I do not know why. Try to grasp the significance of this, if you will. What is the foundation of the Church of Jesus Christ? The apostles and the prophets, together with Christ, who is the chief cornerstone.<br><br>Get it clearly in mind. The apostles and prophets are not ordinary appointees or officers in the Church. We have many officers in the Church, but the apostles and prophets are entirely different because they are actually the foundation on which the Church is built, with Christ being the chief cornerstone. We cannot separate Christ from the apostles, and we cannot separate the apostles from Christ; they are the foundation of this Church, with the Christ being the chief cornerstone.<br><br>I would like to read to you what some of the other Bible translations say about this, in case anyone should argue about it. The<i>American Translation</i>by Goodspeed put it this way: "You are built upon the apostles and prophets as your foundation [note that wording], and Jesus Christ himself is the cornerstone."<br><br>The<i>Moffatt</i>version says: "You are a building that rests on the apostles and prophets as your foundation with Christ Jesus as the cornerstone."<br><br>The<i>Standard Revised Version</i>says: "Built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Christ Jesus himself being the cornerstone."<br><br>The Roman Catholic Church has recently produced a wonderful translation of the Bible. It was published in 1972 and is known as the<i>New American Bible</i>. It says: "You form a building which rises on the foundation of the apostles and prophets with Christ Jesus himself as the capstone."<br><br>The Church of Scotland Bible by Barclay: "It is on the foundation of the prophets and apostles that you have been built up, and the cornerstone is Christ himself."<br><br><i>The New World Bible</i>: "You have been built up upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets while Christ Jesus himself is the foundation cornerstone."<br><br>And the Knox, another Catholic Bible, says: "Apostles and prophets are the foundation on which you are built, and the chief cornerstone is Jesus Christ."<br><br>And a third Catholic Bible, the<i>Jerusalem Version</i>: "You are a part of a building that has the apostles and prophets for its foundation, and Christ himself for its main cornerstone."<br><br>Do you see the significance of what I am trying to point out? Do you see that when you listen this coming week to President Kimball and his counselors and the members of the Council of the Twelve you should think of them in terms of the very foundation of the Church? That is the way it was anciently, and there has been a restoration of everything in this day.<br><br>You remember when Peter spoke on that marvelous day when he announced the second coming of Christ. You remember that he said that Christ would come again, but that he would be retained in heaven "until the times of restitution of all things, which God hath spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets" from the beginning of the world. (See Acts 3:20–21.) Everything was to be restored.<br><br>That is indication, of course, that there would be a complete and universal apostasy. That is why there had to be a complete and universal restoration, and part of that restoration was the restoration of the foundation of the Church: the apostles of the Lord Jesus Christ, with he himself as the chief cornerstone.<br><br>We can understand a little better, then, why Amos spoke as he did. "Surely the Lord God will do nothing, but he revealeth his secret unto his servants, the prophets."<br><br>Let me read you some thing from Brigham Young:<br><br><i>Could Joseph Smith have built the kingdom without first being an apostle? No, he never could. The keys of the eternal priesthood which is after the order of the Son of God are comprehended by being an apostle. All the priesthood, all the keys, all the gifts, all the endowments and everything preparatory to entering back into the presence of the Father and the Son is in, composed of, circumscribed by, or I might say incorporated within the circumference of the apostleship</i>. [<i>Millennial Star</i>15 (April 6, 1853):489]<br><br>Do you see how the apostles and the prophets are the very foundation of the Church of Jesus Christ, and why we cannot separate them from Christ and why Christ is not separated form them? Can you see how this becomes a great evidence for the restoration of the gospel? Why, all through the centuries, have the Christian churches declared that there was to be no more prophecy, no more apostles, no more current revelation? In so saying they repudiated the very foundation of the Church of Jesus Christ. But we declare, as you know, that the Church was fully restored and was built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, just as Paul said.<br><br>I would like to review with you now Paul's epistle to the Ephesians, fourth chapter, eleventh and twelfth verses. If you have Bibles, I would be glad if you would follow with me. Here he is talking about the Savior's gift to us before he ascended to heaven:<br><br><i>And he gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers;</i><br><br><i>For the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ.</i><br><br>I shall read more of that scripture in a few moments, but note the wording used here. Why was it that provision was made "for the perfecting of the saints"? Why should the saints become perfect? Why should anyone become perfect? This comes to the very heart of our religion.<br><br>You remember that in the Sermon on the Mount the Savior gave us one of the marvelous commandments: "Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect" (Matthew 5:48). What is the meaning of that, anyway? We cannot understand it unless we comprehend the fact that God is our Father. Just as we say in the first article of faith, "We believe in God the Eternal Father"; but not only that--we believe in him<i>as the Eternal Father</i>. We believe, as Paul told the people on Mars' Hill that day, "we are the offspring of God"--his literal children. Remember what he said to the Hebrews in the twelfth chapter, ninth verse: "Furthermore we have had fathers of our flesh which corrected us, and we gave them reverence: shall we not much rather be in subjection unto the Father of spirits, and live?"<br><br>It is fundamental to our religion to believe that we are dual beings. We have a spirit within us, and we have a body of flesh and bones in which we live. But the real person is the spirit, and the spirit is in the form of the body, if it is a healthy one. The body is merely the house in which we live. If my spirit were to stand alongside my body here, you would think that you were seeing twins, because my body is tailored after the proportions of my spirit.<br><br>But what about my spirit? My spirit, as yours, is the offspring of God. We are his literal children. That is the reason the Savior told us to pray, "Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name" (Matthew 6:9). You remember also that when he was resurrected and Mary came to touch him he said, "Touch me not; for I am not yet ascended to my Father: but go to my brethren, and say unto them, I ascend unto my Father, and your Father; and to my God, and your God" (John 20:17). To reject the fatherhood of God is to reject the whole gospel of Christ. We are the children and the offspring of God.<br><br>Do you remember what Paul said in his epistle to the Romans, the eight chapter, sixteenth and seventeenth verses? This is a very significant scripture.<br><br><i>The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the children of God:</i><br><br><i>And if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ.</i><br><br>What does that mean? It means, coming back to the Savior's command: "Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect."<br><br>Why should we become perfect? Because we are to become like God. That is our destiny. It is natural for us to become like our Father in Heaven--just as natural as it is for us to become like our parents here on this earth. Because we are the offspring of God we have a spark of divinity within us; and because we have divinity within us it is possible for us to blossom and grow to become like God, who is divine.<br><br>And so we are commanded to become perfect, even as our Father which is in heaven is perfect. So what did the Savior do? He gave us a church founded on the apostles and prophets. And their primary function was what? "For the perfecting of the saints, . . . the edifying of the body of Christ." In other words, these apostles and prophets are to train us in such a way that we can become perfect like God.<br><br>So the gospel becomes the curriculum of perfection, and the Church becomes the school of perfection in which we develop perfection by living the gospel. But we do not perfect ourselves or develop in the gospel unless we are active in the Church, do we?<br><br>I have a friend who has a membership with the gymnasium, and he is sick half the time. I have asked him why he does not use his membership to the gymnasium, because he never goes over there. What good does the gymnasium membership do him when he never goes over there and is not actively exercising? It is exactly the same thing with the Church. Unless we are active in the Church we do not develop these potential talents of perfection that are inherent in us because we are the offspring of God.<br><br>Therefore, the reason God gave us this Church, based on this foundation of the apostles and prophets, was so that we could develop and become like him, inasmuch as we are his children and inasmuch as we have this spark of divinity within us which eventually will grow until we become like our Father in Heaven. That is why we have apostles and prophets in the Church, and that is why they are the foundation of the Church.<br><br>I would like to read to you again from some of these other Bible translations, if you do not mind. Again, the reference is Ephesians, fourth chapter, beginning with the eleventh verse. Here is the<i>Moffatt Bible</i>, and this is very interesting. "He granted some men to be apostles and some to be prophets, some to be evangelists, some to shepherd and to teach, for the equipment of the saints." Think about that for a minute--the Church had to be equipped in order to operate.<br><br>The<i>Philips Bible</i>has the same idea and says that these officers were put in the Church "that Christians might be properly equipped for the service that the whole body might be built up until the time comes when, in the unity of common faith and common knowledge of the Son of God, we arrive at that measure of development which is meant by the fullness of Christ."<br><br>The<i>Knox Catholic Bible</i>says that these officers are in the Church to "order the lives of the faithful, minister to their needs, and build up the frame of Christ's body."<br><br>And the New English Bible uses the same expression: "Some to be apostles, some prophets, some evangelists, some pastors, and teachers, to equip God's people for the work of his service."<br><br>Apostles and prophets and other such officers exist for the equipment of the people and for the equipment of the Church; and we cannot function without this equipment. That is why the equipment, if I may use that expression, had to be restored as part of the restoration of the gospel in these the last days. It was necessary.<br><br>Schonfield in his Bible says that they were placed in the Church "for the training of the saints, for the work of administration and the development of the body of Christ."<br><br>Let us look further at this question. Most of the Christian churches laugh at this idea of current revelation and living apostles and prophets. They forget that Paul, when he described the Christian church, said that these officers are to be in the Church "till we all come in the unity of the faith"--and yet we have hundreds of different, conflicting denominations today. We are farther from the unity of the faith, and [further,] of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man." You see, they are to teach us to become perfect; and what kind of perfection is he talking about? "Unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ." (Ephesians 4:13.)<br><br>They are also to be in the Church "for the work of the ministry." That does not mean just that they should preach, but also that they should call people into the ministry. How are people to be called into the ministry? Again, it requires prophets. Surely the Lord God will do<i>nothing</i>, except through prophets. He will not even call a man to the ministry except through a prophet, and how do we know that? You remember that Paul talked to the Hebrews on that subject; he said that "no man taketh this honor [to have the priesthood] unto himself, but he that is called of God, as was Aaron" (Hebrews 5:4).<br><br>And how was Aaron called? In Exodus, chapter twenty-eight, verse one, God in heaven gave a current revelation to a living prophet, Moses, and commanded him to call Aaron and his sons into the ministry; and that is the pattern by which people are called. There has to be a prophet because "surely the Lord God will do nothing, but he revealeth his secret to his servants, the prophets."<br><br>You remember that Paul was called in this way. Acts, chapter thirteen, verses two and three, records that the Christian prophets were having a meeting in Antioch, and<br><br><i>As they ministered to the Lord, and fasted, the Holy Ghost said, Separate me Barnabas and Saul for the work whereunto I have called them.</i><br><br><i>And when they had fasted and prayed, and laid their hands on them, they sent them away.</i><br><br>Here was a perfect example again: God, through the Holy Ghost, spoke to the Christian prophets assembled there in Antioch and commanded that Barnabas and Saul be set apart. And chapter fourteen, verse fourteen, says that they were then apostles: "Which when the apostles, Barnabas and Paul, heard of, they rent their clothes," and so on.<br><br>That is the way in which men are to be called to the ministry--by revelation. The Lord cannot possibly guide his Church unless he speaks to it and communicates his will. We talk much about communication these days; it should be obvious to us that God cannot run his Church without communication and that he will not do anything except through prophets. Therefore, he places prophets in the Church as the foundation upon which the Church is built.<br><br>I have always been interested in what the Savior said about his apostles when he first chose them, as we read in the tenth chapter of Matthew. You remember that he made it abundantly clear that they were his representatives, and that if the people would accept them it would be the same as if they accepted him. Then he said this in verses fourteen and fifteen:<br><br><i>And whosoever shall not receive you, nor hear your words, when ye depart out of that house or city, shake off the dust of your feet.</i><br><br>[And verse fifteen is particularly interesting:]<i>Verily I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of judgment, than for that city.</i><br><br>Think of the significance of that, if you will: people who rejected the apostles in that day would have a more severe condemnation than Sodom and Gomorrah. That is something to think about, is it not? And essentially the same thing was said by the Savior in this day about the modern apostles. I think that that is extremely significant.<br><br>Paul says something else about these apostles and prophets who were in the Church "for the perfecting of the saints" and who should stay in the Church until there was a unity in all of Christianity: he says that they were in the Church "that we henceforth be no more children, tossed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the sleight of men, and cunning craftiness, whereby they lie in wait to deceive" (Ephesians 4:14).<br><br>These apostles and prophets, the revelators of God, were to act as a protection for the people against false prophets and false teachings. Therefore, if somebody secretly comes to you claiming to have had a secret revelation and trying to lead you astray, all you have to do is remember that this person is not an apostle. If you want to know what the word of God is, go to the Council of the Twelve or the First Presidency. They are the foundation of the Church; they will keep you on the right track so that you will not need to worry.<br><br>You notice that even in Paul's day people went astray wholesale because they would not accept the apostles and prophets of the Church. It is interesting to note how Paul spoke, for instance, to the Galatians.<br><br><i>I marvel that ye are so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of Christ unto another gospel:</i><br><br><i>Which is not another; but there be some that trouble you, and would pervert the gospel of Christ.</i><br><br><i>But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed.</i><br><br><i>As we said before, so say I now again, If any man preach any other gospel unto you than that ye have received, let him be accursed.</i>[Galatians 1:6–9]<br><br>These same principles were established in our day--exactly the same ones. Everything had to be restored. You remember that Peter said that all things were to be restored, whatsoever "God hath spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets" from the beginning of the world. One of the great prophecies is in Revelation, chapter fourteen, verse six, you remember. You missionaries will remember that, especially all of you who have returned from your missions. And what does it say? It says that in the hour of God's judgment an angle should fly through the midst of heaven, bringing the everlasting gospel back to earth again, and that it would be preached unto "every nation, kindred, tongue, and people."<br><br>Immediately the question arises: To whom would the angel come? There were no prophets, and Christianity did not believe in modern-day prophets; and yet the prophet Amos said, "Surely the Lord God will do nothing, but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets." To whom would the angel come to restore the gospel without a prophet on the earth? For God has said that he will not act except through a prophet.<br><br>What would be done? Only one thing: God would raise up a new prophet, just as he did in the days of Moses. So what did he do? He raised up the Prophet Joseph Smith as the great new modern prophet and dealt with him in fulfillment of the words of Amos, and the angel came to Joseph Smith as did likewise so many others who came afterward. Thus we have prophets established in the Church, together with the apostles.<br><br>You remember what is recorded in the twentieth section of the Doctrine and Covenants, verses one and two:<br><br><i>The rise of the Church of Christ in these last days, being one thousand eight hundred and thirty years since the coming of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ in the flesh, it being regularly organized and established agreeable to the laws of our country, by the will and commandments of God, in the fourth month, and on the sixth day of the month which is called April--</i><br><br><i>Which commandments were given to Joseph Smith, Jun., who was called of God, and ordained as apostle of Jesus Christ, to be the first elder of this church.</i><br><br>Then we have this in verse twelve of section twenty-seven, where the Lord speaks about those who came to Joseph Smith to restore powers: "And also with Peter, James, and John, whom I have sent unto you, by whom I have ordained you and confirmed you to be apostles, and especial witnesses of my name." Then again, in section eighty-four, he speaks of the same subject and in verse sixty-three says, "And as I said unto mine apostles, even so I say unto you, for you are mine apostles . . .; ye are they whom my Father hath given me; ye are my friends."<br><br>When the Church was organized on April 6, 1830, a revelation was given:<br><br><i>Behold, there shall be a record kept among you</i>[this addressed to Joseph Smith, who was to be the President of the Church]<i>; and in it thou</i>[that is, the President of the Church]<i>shall be called a seer, a translator, a prophet, an apostle of Jesus Christ, an elder of the church through the will of God the Father, and the grace of your Lord Jesus Christ,</i><br><br><i>Being inspired of the Holy Ghost to lay the foundation thereof, and to build it up unto the most holy faith.</i><br><br>Joseph had been chosen as a prophet while still a fourteen-year-old boy and had received revelations, angels, and ordinations; but when the Church was formally organized on April 6 there came the formal appointment of the President of the Church as the prophet, seer, and revelator--a thing which, of course, has been perpetuated right down to our day. And the Lord gave with this formal appointment a promise which I hope you will keep in mind during this general conference as you listen to the prophet of God and the other men who are called to these high offices.<br><br><i>Wherefore, meaning the church, thou shalt give heed unto all his words and commandments which he</i>[that is, the President of the Church]<i>shall give unto you as he receiveth them, walking in all holiness before me;</i><br><br><i>For his word ye shall receive, as if from mine own mouth, in all patience and faith.</i><br><br><i>For by doing these things the gates of hell shall not prevail against you; yea, and the Lord God will disperse the powers of darkness from before you, and cause the heavens to shake for your good, and his name's glory.</i><br><br>[And again speaking about the President of the Church, Joseph Smith:]<i>For thus saith the Lord God: Him have I inspired to move the cause of Zion in mighty power for good, and his diligence I know, and his prayers I have heard.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 21:1–2, 4–7]<br><br>I would like to read you something else about the Prophet Joseph Smith. You remember that the Prophet Joseph was inspired to know that he was to become a martyr to the cause and therefore would be taken out of the ministry. All the angels had given to him the keys of these previous dispensations, just as Peter had said when he spoke of a restoration of all things from the beginning of the world. These ancient prophets came to Joseph Smith and gave to him the keys of their various dispensations, and that is how it came about that this dispensation in which we live is the fullness of times--that is, all the former times brought together in one in this dispensation. Joseph Smith held all these keys and powers bestowed upon his head by these previous prophets all the way back to Adam; and even Adam came, you remember, and gave the keys of the First Presidency.<br><br>Now Joseph knew that he was going to die. Was he to take all these keys and powers with him into the grave? Of course not--these keys and powers were for building up the Kingdom and preparing the way for the second coming of Christ; therefore, they would have to stay on the earth. So what did he do? Again, keep in mind who the twelve apostles are. Joseph Smith laid his hands on the head of each of the Twelve and gave to all the Twelve individually all the keys and powers and authorities which all the angels had given to him. In that way these keys were perpetuated, and now every time a new apostle is ordained he receives all of these keys and powers that the angels gave to Joseph Smith and that Joseph Smith then gave to all of the Twelve. Thus they have been handed down even to our day.<br><br>Here is what the Prophet Joseph said regarding the apostles: "They are to hold the keys of this ministry, to unlock the door of the Kingdom of heaven unto all nations, and to preach the gospel to every creature" (<i>History of the Church,</i>2:200). On another occasion he said about the Twelve: "These men that are set behind me here on this stand, I have conferred upon them all the power, Priesthood and authority that God ever conferred upon me" (in<i>Journal of Discourses</i>, 1:206). And then again he said:<br><br><i>Now I have received, as prophet, seer and revelator, standing at the head of this dispensation, every key, every ordinance, every principle, and every priesthood that belongs to the last dispensation and fullness of times. And I have sealed all these things upon your</i>[the twelve apostles']<i>heads.</i>[in Conference Report, April 1898, p. 89]<br><br>And that is why Brigham Young said at one time: "There is no church without the apostles."<br><br>You remember that the Savior made quite a point of the fact that the Twelve in his day represented him, and that if people rejected the apostles they rejected him and their condemnation would be worse than that of Sodom and Gomorrah. Here is what he has said in modern scripture:<br><br><i>And also all they who receive this priesthood receive me, saith the Lord;</i><br><br><i>For he that receiveth my servants receiveth me;</i><br><br><i>And he that receiveth me receiveth my Father;</i><br><br><i>And he that receiveth my Father receiveth my Father's kingdom; therefore all that my Father hath shall be given unto him.</i><br><br><i>And this is according to the oath and covenant which belongeth to the priesthood.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 84:35–39]<br><br>And then he said this: "And the arm of the Lord shall be revealed; and the day cometh that they who will not hear the voice of the Lord, neither the voice of his servants, neither give heed to the words of the prophets and apostles, shall be cut off from among the people" (D&amp;amp;C 1:14).<br><br>We have false prophets that arise right here in this city. They have been right here on this campus and in a number of places. How can you tell whether or not they are divinely called? Verse eleven in section forty-two of the Doctrine and Covenants gives us the key; I read it to you. "Again I say unto you, that it shall not be given to any one to go forth to preach my gospel, or to build up my church, except he be ordained by some one who has the authority, and<i>it is known to the church that he has authority and has been regularly ordained by the heads of the church"</i>(emphasis added).<br><br>Ask any of these false prophets if they have been ordained by the heads of the Church. "For verily I say unto you, that he that is ordained of me shall come in at the gate and be ordained as I have told you before" (D&amp;amp;C 43:7). They have to come through the gate, and what is the gate? Nobody can preach for the Lord Jesus Christ except he be called of God as was Aaron, and that means by revelation through the prophet and head of the Church. So unless this false prophet can prove to you that he has been called by modern revelation through the President of the Church and has been duly ordained--coming in at the gate--you may know that he is a false prophet.<br><br>There is one further caution: "And all things shall be done by common consent in the church, by much prayer and faith, for all things you shall receive by faith" (D&amp;amp;C 26:2). He must be accepted by common consent. So if a man is going to come to you and preach his doctrine, in order to justify himself he has to prove that he was called by modern revelation through the President of the Church, that he was duly ordained by those having authority, and that it was well known by everybody that they did have authority--that he came in at the gate--and then that it was confirmed by the voice and vote of the people. Not one of them can ever do that--not one!<br><br>We will be holding general conference in a few days. I would like to bear you testimony that President Kimball is the divinely appointed prophet of God for this time. He has been raised up for this purpose. And I testify to you that he, by the laying on of hands, has received all the powers that the angels ever gave to Joseph Smith, and that he exercises these powers; and as such he is the greatest prophet on earth and one of the greatest of all time.<br><br>Which of the prophets before Joseph Smith ever had all these keys? None of them. It is only the prophets of the restored Church who have all these keys--nobody else. And remember that they, with the Twelve, form the foundation of the Church, and that they cannot be separated from the Christ and that Christ is not separated from them. Together, as a group, they form the foundation of the Church, with Jesus Christ as the chief cornerstone.<br><br>I bear you testimony that these things are true, and I bear you testimony that when you hear the Brethren speak on the coming weekend you will hear revelation through the mouths of these apostles and prophets who have been divinely called of God. I earnestly hope and pray that we will not only listen, but that we will obey. Remember that salvation comes through activity in the Church, not by passive membership--by activity in the Church under the direction of the apostles and the prophets who are in the Church for the perfecting of the Saints. This is my testimony to you, given to you in all earnestness, in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Mark E.

<br>
<br>
I first greet all of you and tell you how honored I feel to be invited to address you this morning, and how surprised I am to see so many of you here. I thought that you would be on the way to Jerusalem with the President of the Church; he is on his way over there to dedicate the Orson Hyde Memorial Gardens. I have a great interest in what is going on over there because I was appointed president of the Orson Hyde Foundation, although I am not a relative but simply have a great love for the people of Israel. And I have a deep feeling of gratitude in my heart for the twenty-five thousand people that contributed to the raising of a million-dollar fund, for which I was responsible, to make possible the dedication of that park.<br><br>While I was thinking of what I might say to you today, I thought of all the beautiful sermons you have heard in the last ten days in connection with the General Conference. And since we have a multitude of young Mormon missionaries here, I thought I might talk to you today of some of my experiences as a missionary, hoping that it might strengthen your testimony and that you might enjoy what I have to say to you.<br><br>I went on my first mission back in 1905, and four sons of the President of the Church went at the same time. One was my cousin; he was sent up to the Land of the Midnight Sun in Norway, and I was sent to the little land of Holland. I had never met a Hollander nor heard a Dutch word before in my life, and we did not have a language school in those days as we have now. After I had been in Holland a few weeks, you know, I used to like to hear a dog bark. They bark just the same in Holland as they do here. I felt then as though I had a friend, because I could not understand those Dutchmen at all. But I figured that if the dog could learn to understand them, I ought to be able to do the same, so we got along all right.<br><br>This cousin of mine who went to Norway--and he had been raised so that he had no experience with difficult situations--wrote me when he had been there a few weeks, and he said, "LeGrand, I met a man the other day who knows more about religion than I've ever dreamed of, and I told him that if he had something better than I had, I'd join his church."<br><br>I wrote back and, calling him by name, I said, "You told him just the right thing. If he has something better than you have, you ought to join his church. Does he have something better than a personal visitation of God the Father and his Son, Jesus Christ, after centuries of darkness, when the heavens had been sealed and not one religious leader believed that there was any direct communication from God upon this earth today? Does he have something better than the coming of Moroni, and the knowledge of the gold plates, and the marvelous message that those plates contain and that was translated by the gift and the power of God? Does he have something better than the coming of John the Baptist with the Aaronic Priesthood, the power and the authority to lead men down into the waters of baptism for the remission of their sins? Does he have something better than the coming of Peter, James, and John with the holy Melchizedek Priesthood, the power to organize again the Church and the kingdom of God upon the earth and to bestow the Holy Ghost by the laying on of hands?" Then I went on to recall the mission of Moses and Elijah and Elias, and I said: "If he has something better than that, you ought to join his church." Now, I hope that all of you feel as I do regarding this matter.<br><br>It reminds me of an experience I had when I was doing missionary work in New Bedford, Massachusetts. One morning I came to the door of a woman who said, "Now, Mr. Richards, what are you trying to do? Are you trying to make Mormons out of all of us?"<br><br>"Well," I said, "I will promise you one thing. I will never ask you to join the Mormon church." That seemed to put her mind at ease. Then I said, "But if I could show you where you could trade one dollar for five dollars, would I have to ask you to do it?"<br><br>She said, "I get you."<br><br>When I had been home a few weeks, I received a letter from her calling me "Brother Richards." She said, "I decided to trade the dollar for five dollars. I was baptized a member of the Church last Friday night."<br><br>For thirty years or longer I taught every group of missionaries that came through the Salt Lake missionary home before they were all moved down here, and I used to tell those missionaries that if they could not make Mormonism look better than five to one of any religion or philosophy in this world, I would think that they were mighty poor missionaries. I am saying that to these missionaries so that they will know what we expect of them.<br><br>When I went on that first mission, President Anthon H. Lund spoke to us missionaries before we left and he told us that the people in the mission field would love us. But he said, "Don't get lifted up in the pride of your hearts and think they love you because you are better than other people. They will love you because of what you bring to them." I did not realize just what that meant at that time, but before I left Holland to come home, I knew what Brother Lund had meant. I shed many more tears bidding goodbye to my friends and converts there than I had when I bid farewell to my mother and father and brothers and sisters.<br><br>For instance, over in Amsterdam where I finished my mission, I went into the home of a short little woman, the mother of eight children, to say goodbye. Looking up into my face, the tears rolling down her cheeks and down the front of her apron, she said, "Brother Richards, it was hard to see my daughter leave for Zion a few months ago, but it is harder to see you go." Then I thought I could understand what Brother Lund meant when he said that they would love us, because I was the first missionary that she had ever met, and her whole family had joined the Church. One of her boys returned from his second mission just a short time ago--but I had better not give you the history of the whole family.<br><br>Then I went to say goodbye to a man who stood erect in the uniform of his country--a tall man with a little Dutch beard. He got down on his knees, took my hand in his, and hugged it and kissed it and bathed it with his tears. Then I thought I could understand what Brother Lund had meant when he said that they would love us because of what we brought to them.<br><br>Brother Lund also said, "If you are ever called upon to speak and you don't know what to say and you haven't had time to figure it out, just stand up and bear testimony of the divine mission of the Redeemer of the world and of his Prophet of this dispensation, and I promise you that the Lord will give you something to say." A child in Primary can bear witness of those things. And that reminds me of an experience that I had.<br><br>I was secretary of the mission in Holland. Our headquarters at that time were in Rotterdam. President Grant was then president of the European Mission, and he came over to attend one of our mission conferences. We had rented a theatre, and we had over 1,500 people there. Men came with their stovepipe hats and their walking canes, and it was a great meeting. My mission president had promised me that if I would take down President Grant's talk (I could write shorthand) they would not ask me to speak, so I sat down at the little table in front of the stand. Right in the middle of that meeting the mission president stood up and said, "Our next speaker will be Elder LeGrand Richards, the secretary of the mission." And he had promised me that I would not have to speak! But there was one higher in authority than he was: President Grant had said that he wanted to hear from me.<br><br>As I walked up onto the stand, I remembered the words of Brother Anthon H. Lund: "If you are ever called upon to speak unexpectedly and you don't know what to say, bear your testimony." And as I stood there, brothers and sisters, I am not exaggerating when I tell you that I felt as though I were lifted right off that floor--they could have moved the floor out from under my feet and I would have remained standing there, bearing witness of the truth. I did not know whether I had done any good or not, but a few weeks after that I attended a baptismal service in Rotterdam--and I am always one who goes around and shakes hands with everybody; I like to shake hands--and I shook hands with a man and his wife. He said, "You don't know us, but we know you."<br><br>I asked, "How do you know me?"<br><br>"We were in that conference when you bore your testimony, and that is what started us investigating the gospel."<br><br>The mission president was there, an apostle presiding over the European Mission was there, and I was just a young man with broken language who had only been in the mission a few months; yet the testimony that I bore as Brother Lund advised was what touched their hearts. These are the things that make life worthwhile.<br><br>Now I want to tell you about a debate I had in Amsterdam before I finished my first mission. My companion and I had been invited to the home of one of the Saints; she wanted to invite her neighbor over so that we could teach her the gospel. When we arrived, the neighbor was there but she had brought her minister with her. In conversing with him we had a little difference of opinion on priesthood. I don not want to discuss the details with you because it would take too much time; but right there he challenged me to a debate in his church. In those days we were not advised not to debate; and I was young and had a lot of pep, so I accepted his challenge. We were to meet in his church a week from Saturday night.<br><br>When we arrived his church was full: all of his people were there, and all of our people were there. How our people found out about it I never knew; I had not told them. This minister then stood up and said, "Now, Mr. Richards, inasmuch as you're a guest in our church, we'll accord you the privilege of opening the debate. We'll each talk twenty minutes. Is that satisfactory?<br><br>I told him, "Very much so." I did not tell him that I would have given him the shirt off my back for the privilege of opening that debate, and he had just handed it to me on a silver platter. I do not know whether or not the Lord had anything to do with that, but I always thought that he did. So I stood up and said something like this:<br><br>"The last time I talked to my friend, we had a difference of opinion on the principles of the priesthood. I've come tonight prepared to discuss that subject, but I don't propose to start at that point. If you were going to build a house, you wouldn't try to put the roof on before you got the foundation in, would you?" I got nods from the congregation. "Therefore," I said, "I propose to open this debate tonight be discussing the foundation of the gospel of Jesus Christ. I choose for my text the sixth chapter of Hebrews, verses one and two, where Paul said, 'Therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ, let us go on unto perfection'--I suppose everybody wants to go on to perfection after they have laid the foundation of his gospel--'not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works, of faith toward God, " 'Of the doctrine of baptisms, and of laying on of hands, and of the resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment.'"<br><br>I hurried over faith and repentance; I thought that they would believe that. I spoke about baptism by immersion for the remission of sins until everybody was giving me a nod. And then I came to the laying on of hands, and they would not believe that. In all the missionary work I have done--and I spent nearly ten years in the mission field--I have never found a church that believed in the laying on of hands for the gift of the Holy Ghost except for our own Church. As I spoke on the laying on of hands, I reminded them of the occasion when the apostles at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had accepted the word of God through the preaching of Philip. Peter and John were sent to these saints; and when the apostles came they prayed for them and laid their hands upon them, and they received the Holy Ghost. When Simon the sorcerer saw the Holy Ghost was conveyed by the laying on of the apostles' hands, he offered them money, saying, "Give me also this power, that on whomsoever I lay hands, he may receive the Holy Ghost."<br><br>Why, I argued, would Simon have offered to purchase that power if he could have obtained the Holy Ghost in any other way? And what was Peter's answer? "Thy money perish with thee, because thou hast thought that the gift of God may be purchased with money." (See Acts 8:14–20.)<br><br>Next I reminded them that Paul in his travels came to Ephesus and found there men who had been baptized, and he asked them, "Have ye received the Holy Ghost since ye believed?"<br><br>And they answered, "We have not so much as heard whether there be any Holy Ghost."<br><br>Paul knew then that they had been baptized by one without authority; and so he baptized them over again and laid his hands upon them, and they received the Holy Ghost. (See Acts 19:1–6.) I gave a few more references to the laying on of hands and then sat down.<br><br>This minister stood up and, without mentioning a word I had said, he started in on the Mountain Meadow Massacre and the "Golden Bible" and Joseph Smith's admission that he had made many mistakes. Then he turned and said, "Now, if Mr. Richards will enlighten us on these matters, I'm sure this audience will be most appreciative."<br><br>I was on my feet just like that. I could not wait.<br><br>My companion later asked, "How did you think so fast?"<br><br>And I asked, "What had you been praying for all week?"<br><br>"In the days of the Savior," I said, "his enemies tried to trick him. I don't suppose there's anybody here today who would like to see us return to those old tricks. I understand that a debate is the presentation and the answering of argument. Has this man answered any of my arguments?" They all shook their heads. I said, "All right; you may have your twenty minutes over again."<br><br>He did not do it, and I knew that he could not. Finally, his wife stood up from among the audience and said, "What Mr. Richards is asking is fair. You ought to answer him." Even then he could not do it.<br><br>I said to my companion, "Hand me my coat and hat"--it was wintertime--"and stand up." Addressing the minister, I said, "One more chance. I'm willing to remain here until ten o'clock tomorrow morning when I have to be in my own church meeting, provided that this debate can go forward on the basis on which you set it up; if not, I'm going to leave. You accorded me the privilege of opening the debate, as the guest in your church; now you want to steal from me the very privilege that you accorded me, and I don't propose to let you do it."<br><br>And even then he could not. We all walked out on him; I invited our people to leave with me and they did. I met him on the street time and time again after that, but he always ducked his head so that he would not have to speak to me. It is wonderful to have the truth and to have no fear of meeting anybody. As I told the missionaries, if you learn how to tell our story and you know what the Lord has given us through his holy prophets, you do not need to be afraid of anybody.<br><br>I preached a sermon in Quitman, Georgia, when I was mission president in that area, on the eternal duration of the marriage covenant and the family unit. I quoted from Rulon Howe's graph, where he listed all of the main churches and their answers to these important questions, and not one of them believed in the eternal duration of the marriage covenant and the family unit. At the close of that meeting, as I stood at the door to shake hands with the people as they went out, a man came up and introduced himself to me as a Baptist minister. I asked, "Did I misquote you here tonight?"<br><br>"No, Mr. Richards, but just as you say, we don't all believe all the things our churches preach."<br><br>I said, "And you don't believe them either. Why don't you go back and teach your people the truth? They'll take it from you, and they're not ready to take it from the Mormon elders yet."<br><br>He said, "I'll see you again." That was all I got from him that night.<br><br>The next time I went there, about four months later, I walked up to that little church and there stood that same minister. As I shook hands with him I said, "I'd certainly be interested to know what you thought of my last sermon here."<br><br>He replied, "I've been thinking about it ever since, and I believe every word you said. Only I'd like to have heard the rest of it."<br><br>You know that one never can finish talking about these marvelous truths that the Lord has restored. There was a man occupying the pulpit that believed every word I said, yet he could not tell his people.<br><br>I wonder if any of you have read the book or seen the movie shown sometime back entitled<i>A Man Called Peter</i>. Peter Marshall was a Presbyterian minister down in Atlanta, Georgia, when I was the president of the mission there. Later he went to Washington, and he was the chaplain of the United States Senate at the time he died. Many of the things that he and his wife taught in that show he got from our Church. He used to send his representatives over to get our MIA outlines in order to hold his young people, because we were stealing them all away from him. As I sat in his study one day I asked, "Reverend Marshall, what is the attitude of your Church with respect to the eternal duration of the marriage covenant and the family unit?"<br><br>He said, "Well, Mr. Richards, we're not allowed to preach that in our church. But in my heart I find stubborn objections." Then he gave this little illustration--I used it in<i>A Marvelous Work and a Wonder</i>, but I did not give him credit for it because I was afraid that he would not let me if I asked to use his name. So I just told about a minister (but it was Peter Marshall), and he said,<br><br><i>When you take</i>[the kitten]<i>away from the cat, in a few days the mother cat has forgotten all about it. Take the calf away from the cow and in a few days the cow has forgotten all about the calf. But when you take a child away from his mother, though she lives to be a hundred years old, she never forgets the child of her bosom. I find it difficult to believe that God created such love to perish in the grave.</i>[LeGrand Richards,<i>A Marvelous Work and a Wonder</i>, rev. ed. (Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Company, 1971), pp.203–4]<br><br>Are we not happy that we know differently? The Lord did not create love like that to perish in the grave. What a comfort it is to those of us who have lost children! We had a little girl born in Holland who would be a little older than this daughter with me here today if she had lived, and she has gone into the eternal world. What a comfort and a joy this knowledge is! And then her oldest brother, our first son after four girls, we lost in an accident at the beach in California. What a world it would be if we did not expect ever to see them again and to know that they belong to us! Thank God for the restored truths of the gospel.<br><br>That reminds me of a sermon that I preached in Atlanta at the funeral of the president of our branch there. He was at the head of the hat department in one of the large stores there in Atlanta, and many of the people from the store attended the funeral service. It was held in a mortuary. When I went to the store some time after that a member of the Church saw me and said, "President Richards, there's a man up on the third floor in the lingerie department who attended that funeral, and he said that if you ever came in he'd like to meet you. Would you like to meet him?"<br><br>I said, "I certainly would."<br><br>We went up to the third floor and met the head of that department, and he said, "Mr. Richards, I'm a religious man, and my friends are religious. We go to church every Sunday and we hear the minister preach. But half an hour after the church service is out, we couldn't tell you a thing about what he said. All we know is that we've had a good talk. I attended that funeral service weeks ago, and I came home and told my wife I'd heard something I wished all Atlanta could hear. It's been weeks now, and I can still remember what you said." That is the difference between God's simple eternal truth and the philosophies of men. My, how grateful we ought to be for what we have!<br><br>One of our missionaries in that mission preached in one of our conference meetings on the dream of Nebuchadnezzar. You remember that Nebuchadnezzar forgot his dream, and he sent for the wise men and astrologers and soothsayers, but none of them could tell him what his dream was. Then he heard of the man Daniel in Israel and sent for him. Daniel told King Nebuchadnezzar that there was a God in heaven that would make known the dream and the interpretation thereof. Then Daniel told him about the rise and fall of the kingdoms of this world, including his own kingdom, until the latter days when the God of heaven would set up a kingdom that should never be destroyed or given to another people. Like a little stone cut out of the mountains without hands, it would roll forth until it should become as a great mountain and fill the whole earth.<br><br>When the meeting was over I stood at the door, and a man came up and introduced himself to me as a minister of the gospel. He said, "You don't mean to tell me that you think the Mormon Church is the kingdom that God was to set up in the last days, do you?"<br><br>And I answered, "Yes, sir; why not?"<br><br>He said, "It couldn't be."<br><br>"Why couldn't it?" I asked.<br><br>"You can't have a kingdom without a king, and we don't have a king so we don't have a kingdom."<br><br>"Oh," I said, "my friend you didn't read far enough. You just read the seventh chapter of Daniel, and you'll see where Daniel said that he saw 'one like the Son of man [coming] with the clouds of heaven, and came to the Ancient of days,' and unto him was given the kingdom; and all other kingdoms, powers, and dominions under the whole heaven should serve and obey him (see Daniel 7:13–14). Now, my friend, tell me: how can the kingdom be given to him when he comes in the clouds of heaven if there's no kingdom prepared for him? That's what we're doing. We have that kingdom that was never to be thrown down or given to another people.<br><br>"Maybe you'd like to know what's going to become of the kingdom. If you'll read a little further in that same chapter you'll see where Daniel made this statement: 'And the kingdom and dominion, and the greatness of the kingdom under the whole heaven, shall be given to the people of the saints of the most High,' that they might 'possess the kingdom forever.' And as if that were not quite long enough, Daniel adds, 'Even for ever and ever.'" (Daniel 7:18, 27.) Should we not be grateful to know that we are the Saints of the most high God? And others are scattered throughout this world--over 2 and a half million at the present time. We are honored to live upon the earth at this time and to be a part of that great latter-day kingdom revealed by the God of heaven through Daniel--the kingdom that should be established, never to be thrown down or given to another people. How I thank the Lord for my membership in that kingdom!<br><br>I have two minutes left, so I shall not tell you any more stories. I shall just tell you how much I love our youth and how proud I am of you. I was at conference Saturday and Sunday in La Verne, California; and while it is not scheduled as part of the conference, I always ask for a meeting with the young people. We meet at eight o'clock Sunday morning, and we had over 450 young people there. How I enjoyed talking to them, realizing that they are the future leadership of this Church just as you people here today are! How important it is that you get your education and that you keep yourselves sweet and clean and unspotted from the sins of the world, so that you will be worthy of all the honors and privileges that the Lord has in store for you through your faith and faithfulness!<br><br>I shall tell you one more story in closing, one that I think I have told you before. In the days before I went on my first mission, the Saltair Dance Hall was thought to be the finest dance hall in all America. I was there one night, and a young lady came up and said, "LeGrand, we're having a wonderful banquet downstairs. Wouldn't you like to join us?"<br><br>You know the old saying that the way to a man's heart is through his tummy. I could not turn that invitation down. So we took hold of hands and went hopscotching down the steps into the north end of that pavilion. As we neared a long table spread, I noticed that by each plate was one of those tall beer bottles they used to have when I was a boy. When I saw that we were headed for that table, I stopped as though I had been shot. The girl I had by the hand looked at me and asked, "What's the matter? Are you too good to drink a little beer?"<br><br>I had to think awfully fast, so I said, "Well, Elsie, I guess I am. I thought you were. Good-bye." And I went up those steps a lot faster than I had come down.<br><br>I have asked myself time and time again if I would ever have become a Presiding Bishop of this Church, to preside over all the young boys of this Church--the Aaronic priesthood and the girls of the same age--if I had sat at that table that day. If one never takes the first beer he never needs to worry about the second one. If he never takes the first cigarette, he never needs to worry about the second one. And so I stand before you here today thanking God for the inspiration of the Holy Ghost that has been my companion through life, that has given me the power to make the decisions that I needed to make so that I can stand here in honor today and advise you to do the same. I leave my love and blessing with each one of you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, whom I love with all my heart. Even so, amen.<br><br><i><i>LeGrand Richards was a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when this devotional address was given at Brigham Young University on 16 October 1979.</i></i><br><br><i>© Intellectual Reserve, Inc.

<h1>e Royal Road to Happiness&quot; - J. Richard Clarke - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I am honored to be here, but I must confess that it does not get any easier. I hope that all of you will remember as you attend Brigham Young University that your parents have been undergoing a very liberal education in how to be parents. I hope too that as you gain greater knowledge you gain some compassion for the process of that liberal education which they have been experiencing.<br><br>Not too long ago I read a speech by Max Isaacson. He talked about his frustration as a parent in this educational process. He said that someone has reported that<br><br><i>by the time the average person dies, he has spent two years of his life in the bathroom, three years in the car, and five years eating. That describes my teen-age son perfectly and he isn't even seventeen yet. ... He says you should see his bedroom. It is a real disaster area. My son is an accident looking for a place to happen. He spends so much time in the family car that</i>his<i>rear end ought to be checked every five thousand miles. His friends are really something, too. His friends have tee-peed our yard so many times that we haven't had to buy toilet paper for over a year.</i>[Max D. Isaacson, "After You Get Where You're Going, Where Will You Be?" in<i>Vital Speeches of the Day 44</i>, no. 7 (January 15, 1978): 204]<br><br>I love BYU and I am proud of you. I am proud to be identified and associated with this great University. I am proud of the work that you do around the world and the impact that you are making on so many lives in so many places. I hope that each of you appreciates that you are here at this University when there are many other members of the Church throughout the world who are not able, nor will they be able, to attend here. Perhaps most of them will never even be able to see BYU. So I hope that you appreciate that this is a great blessing and an opportunity.<br><br>Many people are concerned about you. They have great faith in you, but they are also very concerned that you represent yourselves well in the years to come. I think about you when I remember a story about Chief Justice Oliver Wendell Homes. He was on a train and, when the conductor came by to pick up his ticket, he started to rustle through his coat and could not find it. Recognizing who he was, the conductor thought that he would make it a little easier for him, and he said, "Well, I'm sure, Mr. Holmes, that you'll be able to find your ticket when you return home. I'm certainly sure that the Pennsylvania Railroad can get by without that ticket until you find it. Why don't you just mail it to us?"<br><br>"Young man, you don't understand at all," he said. "The problem is not where is my ticket; it's where am I going?"<br><br>Each of us has a challenge to identify where he or she is going, and those who attend Brigham Young University have a great opportunity to prepare themselves well for the journey. This is a unique University, perhaps the most unique in all the world. It sees itself and its mission in a very broad educational perspective, and others share this view. President Smith of Swarthmore College once wrote,<br><br><i>We have no intention of relinquishing our academic excellence. ... But it is not enough for us to be training ground for scholars. It is not enough to develop intellect, for intellect by itself is essentially amoral, capable of evil as well as good. We must develop the character which makes intellect constructive, and the personality which makes it effective</i>. [Quotes by Robert P. Lisensky, "Competence and Conscience," in<i>Vital Speeches of the Day 34</i>, no. 12 (April 1, 1968): 383]<br><br>Someone has said that education is the process of leading an individual to full maturity. We believe that, with the balance of the educational curricula here, this is being accomplished. Part of the reason is the wonderful gathering place that this is--the bringing together of youth from all over the world who have the same ideals and the same commitment to education--and the dedicated faculty who could, I am sure, receive elsewhere many more times the income they receive here but who are dedicated to preparing a unique people for their world mission.<br><br>We are indebted to all those who have attended here who have touched our lives. I think back with great pride to the friends that I made here, as well as to the faculty members, and the contribution they made to enrich my life. Granville Kleiser once said, "Nothing touches the soul but leaves its impress and thus, little by little, we are fashioned into the image of all we have seen and heard, known and mediated; and if we learn to live with all that is fairest and purest and best, the love of it all will in the end become our very life" (quoted from Bishop Clarke's personal file).<br><br>I am proud of President Oaks. I am proud of him for many reasons, but especially because he stands up and is counted on issues that are important to the future of this University--important in maintaining our integrity, which is based upon sound principles of freedom and election, and he is known throughout the country for the contribution he is making as someone who is willing to stand firm in defense of these principles, as are other members of the faculty who teach these correct principles.<br><br>You recall from the Book of Abraham that when the gods were preparing the plan for the spirit children to come forward and continue their education they said,<br><br><i>We will prove them herewith, to see if they will do all things whatsoever the Lord their God shall command them;</i><br><br><i>And they who keep their first estate shall be added upon; ... and they who keep their second estate shall have glory added upon their heads for ever and ever</i>. [<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/pgp/abr/3.25,26?lang=eng#24">Abraham 3:25–26</a>]<br><br>We are here today because we were faithful in our first estate. We learned to keep the laws that magnified us for future opportunity. We were indeed added upon and have entered our second estate with a successful record of performance. Just as our advance from high school to university has shown us, the pace of the second estate is quicker than that of the first. We are learning to achieve the promised glories and we must, to quote the prophet, "lengthen our strides." Now that we have the desires of the flesh to subdue, we must once again master the laws that bring us joy in this life and the glories of eternity. Once again, we must be proven in all things.<br><br>The Prophet Joseph Smith said that "happiness is the object and design of our existence" (Joseph Smith,<i>Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith</i>, sel. Joseph Fielding Smith [Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Company, 1938], p. 255). Much has been said about the pursuit of happiness, but not quite so much about the happiness of pursuit. That has a lot of applications. I see some girls' face lighting up--that is not exactly what I had in mind. Rather, we must vigorously pursue that which enlarges our vision. We must, in fact, get on the offensive. Phillips Brooks once wrote, "Bad will be the day for every man when he becomes absolutely contented with the life that he is living, with the thoughts that he is thinking, with the deeds that he is doing; when there is not forever beating at the door of his soul some great desire to do something larger" (quoted from Bishop Clarke's personal file). To the Philippians Paul said,<br><br><i>This one thing I do, forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching forth unto those things which are before,</i><br><br><i>I press toward the mark. ...</i>[<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/philip/3.13-14?lang=eng#p12">Philippians 3:13–14</a>]<br><br>If happiness is the object and design of our existence, it seems to me that we must set some criteria for achieving it. One of the great souls of this generation was a philosopher by the name of William George Jordan, whose son, David Starr Jordan, was formerly president of the Stanford University. He wrote an impressive essay which he titled "The Royal Road to Happiness" and in which he said,<br><br><i>There is a royal road to happiness; it lies in Consecration, Concentration, Conscience, and Conquest. Consecration is a dedicating the individual life to the service of others, to some noble mission, to realize some unselfish ideal. Concentration makes the individual life simpler and deeper. It cuts away the shams and the pretenses of modern living and limits life to its truest essentials. Worry, fear, useless regret--all the great wastes that sap mental, moral or physical energy must be sacrificed, or the individual needlessly destroys half the possibilities of living. Conscience, as the mentor, the guide and compass of every act, leads ever to Happiness. When the individual can stay alone with his conscience and get its approval, without using force or specious logic, then he begins to know what real Happiness is. Conquest is the overcoming of an evil habit, the rising superior to opposition and attack, the spiritual exaltation that comes from resisting the invasion of the groveling material side of life</i>. [William George Jordan,<i>The Majesty of Calmness</i>(Old Tappan, N.J.: F.H. Revell, n.d.), pp. 51–53]<br><br>It is not possible, in the time I have, to elaborate on each of these points in the formula. I leave it up to you to fill in some of the blanks about which you perhaps might be stimulated to think, but I would like to just touch briefly on each one.<br><br>First,<i>consecration</i>. As you know, President Kimball has indicated that probably the number one problem we all face in our lives is that of selfishness. The happiest people I know are those who have developed an acute sensitivity to the feelings and needs of other people. I think that President Kimball is a personification of those great impulses.<br><br>Karl Menninger, the psychologist, was once asked by a lady, "If you knew for a certainty that you were going to have a nervous breakdown, what would you do?"<br><br>He said, "I would close my house; I would move over onto the other side of the tracks; I would knock on doors until I had an opportunity to meet somebody who had more problems than I did; and then I'd spend my time helping them solve those problems." (Quoted from Bishop Clarke's personal file.)<br><br>We read about bread being cast upon the water. There is a great multiplier effect in people's willingness to give of themselves that others might be blessed. In 1978 Brother Jeff Holland spoke to the faculty here and referred to an interesting account that I would like to share. It has to do with a lovely mother in the nineteenth-century frontier of Kentucky. Life was pretty rough for Sally Bush Johnston. She was left a widow with three children. She was getting older before she wanted to, and certainly hers was a much more difficult existence than she had ever imagined. Then she saw a chance for an easier life when an old friend of hers, a suitor that she had known before she married and who was now a widower, came courting. He was dressed in a fine suit and a new pair of boots. He spoke of prosperity, of farming. He spoke of servants and of a way of life that seemed to be an improvement over that which she was experiencing. So she went with him.<br><br>When she got there, she found the "prosperous" farm to be a ramshackle, rundown farm covered with wild blackberry bushes and sumac. The house was a floorless hut--a log cabin, in fact, without windows. The only evidence of servants was two small children, a boy and a girl.<br><br>Her first thought was an obvious one: "I can't stay. I've got to return." She knew that she had been duped. But as she turned to leave, she looked at the children, especially the younger --a boy whose thin face and melancholy gaze made upon her soul an impression as deep as it was instantaneous. At that moment a great spirit subdued her disappointment. She slipped off her sweater and began to straighten and clean the house. In determined words which she felt deeply within her, she said quietly, "I'll stay for the sake of this boy."<br><br>A neighbor was to write sometime later, "Oh, Sally Bush, what a treasure trembled in the balance that day." But Sally Bush could not have known that her stepson, this young boy whose melancholy eyes had penetrated her heart, was to become the president of these United States, states remaining "united" through a tragic civil war which would claim his life among the numbered dead. Sally Bush Lincoln, discouraged and tired and disappointed, looked into the eyes of a ten-year-old boy and said, "I'll stay for the sake of this boy."<br><br>In another place and another time, a wealthy family in England, spending the weekend with another wealthy family, had a near-tragic occurrence. Their son, playing with the children, fell into a swimming pool and was in the process of drowning when the screams of the children attracted the attention of a gardener who came, plunged into the pool, and saved the boy.<br><br>The boy's name was Winston Churchill. His parents, deeply gratified, attempted to reward the gardener who had saved their son. At first he hesitated, but as they insisted he said, "I have a son whose lifetime dream is to be a doctor, and I don't know how we can provide that opportunity for him."<br><br>Mr. Churchill said, "We will see him through and pay for his education."<br><br>Later on, when Winston became prime minister of Great Britain, he contracted a severe case of pneumonia. The king sent word out that they wanted the finest physician they could find to attend him. Sir Alexander Fleming, the developer of penicillin, was called and selected to care for the prime minister; he was the son of the gardener. After he was healed, Churchill was to say: "Rarely has one man owed his life twice to the same person." (<i>Bits and Pieces</i>, August 1979.)<br><br>Many people, I suppose, fantasize that if they were blessed with great wealth they would generously share with those who are in need. That is not probable unless they have already developed a generous spirit and give of themselves to those with whom they serve while living from day to day.<br><br><i>Concentration</i>. The ability to concentrate is really a mark of genius, I believe. Certainly we ought to focus our lives on the essentials. We ought to set high goals and meet high standards of performance. We ought to live with anticipation.<br><br>One of the sweetest people I know is lovely Margaret Wells, who has been widowed for over forty-five years, the wife of John Wells who was formerly second counselor in the Presiding Bishopric. We had the privilege of picking her up at one time to take her to a social activity for the General Authorities and their wives. At that time she was eighty-four years old, and we were impressed at how bouncy she was and what a marvelous, positive attitude she had. As we talked about it she said, "I never go to bed at night until I can think of at least one good reason for waking up in the morning, at least one important job that I have to do. Even if it's only one thing, I wake up with anticipation. I look forward to getting up. If I waited until morning to plan my work, I'm afraid I'd just lie there and not put forth much effort."<br><br>I would suggest, young brothers and sisters, that you learn to wait to worry. Just about every time that you get some bad news, chances are that it has either already happened and you can not do anything about it or else it was not worth worrying about in the first place. Psychologists have said that probably fourteen percent of all the bad news we initially hear is even worth the worry at all. I think that we would do well to wait to worry.<br><br>I am impressed with how important attitude is in our lives. No matter how old we are or how educated we are, we are still mightily affected, both positively and negatively, by what we allow our attitude to be. I remember reading of a Russian psychologist who told the story of a Russian railway worker who worked with refrigerator cars. One day he got himself locked inside of a refrigerator car. Of course, understanding as he did what usually happens, he began to prepare himself to freeze to death. As he felt his body becoming numb, he recorded the story of his approaching death on the walls of the refrigerator car. This he scribbled: "I'm becoming colder. ... Still colder now. ... Nothing to do but wait. ... I am slowly freezing to death. ... Half asleep now, I can hardly write. ... [And finally,] these may be my last words."<br><br>And they were. He died; and yet, when they came and opened the car, they found that at no time was it ever colder than 56 degrees. The refrigeration apparatus had not worked; it was malfunctioning. This man was the victim of his own illusion. All his conclusions were wrong. He knew about refrigeration; he knew what happened. He just failed to understand that, in this particular case, the refrigeration apparatus was not working. The mind has great power and produces magical effects on our bodies.<br><br><i>Conscience</i>is our contact with the Spirit. Spiritual power is the greatest form of energy that I know. Spiritual power alone can sustain us in a time of crisis. Ethics are not enough. Spiritual power comes from God and is administered and controlled upon principles of righteousness. Our goal, as Peter advises us, is to be "partakers of the divine nature of Christ," and one way is by "escaping the corruption that is in the world through lust" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/2-pet/1.4?lang=eng#p3">2 Peter 1:4</a>).<br><br>Jesus warned about those who might destroy our bodies but said that the real problem is he who can destroy both body and spirit. The adversary has ever been with us to try to tempt us and to destroy our lives and to convince us of incorrect and unsound and untrue principles that so often take us off course.<br><br>Every time I think of the processes of withstanding the adversary, I thrill as I remember the encounter which Moses had as recorded in the first chapter of Moses. As you remember, he had just completed a marvelous spiritual experience. It had taken much out of him physically, but it had built him up tremendously and deeply in the spirit. The scripture says, in verses twelve, thirteen, and sixteen of the first chapter:<br><br><i>Satan came tempting him saying: Moses, son of man, worship me.</i><br><br><i>And it came to pass that Moses looked upon Satan and said: Who art thou? For behold, I am a son of God, in the similitude of his Only Begotten; and where is thy glory, that I should worship thee? ...</i><br><br><i>Get thee hence, Satan; deceive me not; for God said unto me: Thou art after the similitude of my Only Begotten.</i><br><br>So many times, if we would simply run those words through our minds: "Satan, why should we worship you? Where is your glory? I am a son of God created in the image and likeness of Him who saved the world," we could banish his influence from our lives. I am impressed by the twentieth section of the Doctrine and Covenants where it says in the twenty-second verse of Jesus, "He suffered temptations but gave no heed unto them."<br><br>In one of the Sunday programs of Richard L. Evans, he quoted Heber J. Grant, former President of the Church, who said:<br><br><i>We have no right to go near temptation, or in fact to do or say a thing that we cannot honestly ask the blessings of the Lord upon, neither to visit any place where we would be ashamed to take our sister or sweetheart. The good spirit will not go with us on the devil's ground, and if we are standing alone upon the ground belonging to the adversary of men's souls, he may have the power to trip us up and destroy us. ... Virtue is more valuable than life. Never allow yourself to go out of curiosity to see any of the undercrust in this world. We can't handle dirty things and keep our hands clean.</i>[Bruce B. Clark,<i>Richard Evans' Quote Book</i>(Salt Lake City: Publishers Press, 1971), p. 201]<br><br>Another great soul was the mother of John and Charles Wesley. In counseling them she said, "Would you judge the lawfulness or unlawfulness of pleasure? Take this rule: ... Whatever weakens your reason, impairs the tenderness of your spirit, obscures your sense of God, takes off your relish for spiritual things, whatever increases the authority of the body over the mind, that thing is sin to you, however innocent it may seem in itself." (Quoted from Bishop Clarke's personal file.)<br><br>A number of years ago I was attending a management training seminar in New York, and they had a coffee break where everyone in the room left but the instructor and myself. In conversation with him I inquired, "Don't you drink coffee?"<br><br>"No," he said.<br><br>"Well, that's interesting," I said. "You'd better be careful, or they'll be accusing you of being a Mormon."<br><br>"No, I'm a Baptist; but," he said, "years ago I made a decision about my life, and it was that I will do nothing which will take away from me my freedom. And therefore, as of that time, I quit smoking, drinking, and taking any kind of intoxicants or anything that's addictive."<br><br>I thought, "What a marvelous reason to abstain from anything that might be of harm to us! It takes away our freedom."<br><br>Another trainer of salesmen, Zig Zeigler, wrote in his book<i>See You at the Top:</i><br><br><i>To build a healthy self-image, there are some things you must avoid. Pornography is the primary one. Literally everything that goes into your mind has an effect and is permanently recorded. It either builds and prepares you for the future or it tears down and reduces your accomplishment possibilities for the future. Psychologists say that three viewings of Deep Throat, The Last Tango in Paris, The Exorcist, or any of the "X-rated" films or television programs have the same psychological, emotional, destructive impact on your minds as one physical experience. The people who have seen these "shows" are in agreement; they were sexually stimulated and viewed themselves with less respect. The reason is simple. These films or programs present mankind at its worst and when you see your fellow man degraded, you, in effect, see yourself degraded. It is impossible to view mankind at its worst and not feel that your own value has diminished and you can neither be nor do any better than you think you can or are. Ironically most X-rated films are advertised as "adult" entertainment for "mature" audiences. Most psychologists agree that they are juvenile entertainment for immature and insecure audiences.</i>[Quoted from Bishop Clarke's personal file]<br><br>What is the harmful effect of sin upon the soul? Sin places us in bondages. Sin enslaves the sinner by making him love sinful things. Karl Menninger says:<br><br><i>The wrongness of the sinful act lies not merely in its nonconformity, its departure from the accepted, appropriate way of behavior, but in an implicitly aggressive quality--a ruthlessness, a hurting, a breaking away from God and from the rest of humanity, a partial alienation, or act of rebellion.</i><br><br><i>Standing on one's head is nonconforming, and it is neither aesthetic nor congenial behavior nor expressive of a moral ideal, but it is not likely to be considered sinful. Sin has a willful, defiant, or disloyal quality; someone is defied or offended or hurt. The willful disregard or sacrifice of the welfare of others for the welfare or satisfaction of the self is an essential quality of the concept of sin. ... And sin is thus, at heart, a refusal of the love of others.</i>[Karl Menninger,<i>Whatever became of Sin?</i>(New York: Hawthorn Books, 1973), p. 19]<br><br>Finally,<i>conquest</i>. Habits are an enemy to progress. Confucius said that the nature of men is always the same; it is their habits that separate them. The power to change, the power to banish the desire for evil practices or the fierceness from our hearts comes through the Lord Jesus Christ. We must learn as we read and reread the thirty-sixth chapter of Alma that we must experience a godly sorrow if we are to be forgiven of the sins which we would like blotted from our memory and from our heart. We must come to terms with the Lord's anointed, our bishops, and through proper confession obtain a full and lasting forgiveness.<br><br>I was interested in the psychologist's point of view of the need for confession. He said, "Confession must include a recognition of the aggression of the sins committed. 'So long as a person lives under the shadow of real, unacknowledged, and unexpiated guilt,... he ... will continue to hate himself and to suffer the inevitable consequences of self-hatred. But the moment he ... begins to accept his guilt and his sinfulness, the possibility of radical reformation opens up; and ... a new freedom of self-respect and peace.'" (O. Hobart Mowrer, quoted by Menninger,<i>Whatever Became of Sin?,</i>p. 195.)<br><br>So all habits, then, are a challenge. Elder Stapley once said that we are not born into this life with fixed habits any more than we are born with noble character, and that when anybody boasts about their bad habits one can be sure that they are the best he has. The only way we can pay the price is to be motivated to have the blessing that accompanies the change. Remember: If bulls had no horns, anybody could be a matador.<br><br>We are so fortunate as members of the Church to understand the great power of redemption. Through the Lord Jesus Christ we can be and are redeemed. We are able to enjoy peace of mind and the beauties of the hope and the fulfillment of lives in harmony with sound and basic principles and values. Is it worth it?<br><br>Recently I was reading in the third chapter of Malachi the scripture to which we often refer as an explanation of the Lord's law of tithing. Malachi continues:<br><br><i>Ye have said, It is vain to serve God: and what profit is it that we have kept his ordinances, and that we have walked mournfully before the Lord of hosts?</i><br><br><i>And now we call the proud happy; yea, they that work wickedness are set up; yea, they that tempt God are even delivered.</i>[In other words, "How come everybody else who doesn't keep these commandments gets along so well?]<br><br>[And then the Lord says:]<i>Then they that feared the Lord spake often one to another: and the Lord hearkened, and heard it, and a book of remembrance was written before him for them that feared the Lord, and that thought upon his name.</i><br><br><i>And they shall be mine, sayeth the Lord of hosts, in that day when I make up my jewels; and I will spare them, as a man spareth his own son that serveth him.</i><br><br><i>Then shall ye return, and discern between the righteous and the wicked, between him that serveth God and him that serveth him not</i>. [<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/mal/3.14-18?lang=eng#p13">Malachi 3:14–18</a>]<br><br>In conclusion, I would bear my testimony, through the words of King Benjamin, that if we would in fact be happy and enjoy the blessings of eternal life we must remember these words: "And moreover, I would desire that ye should consider on the blessed and happy state of those that keep the commandments of God. For behold, they are blessed in all things, both temporal and spiritual; and if they hold out faithful to the end they are received into heaven, that thereby they may dwell with God in a state of never-ending happiness. O remember, remember that these things are true; for the Lord hath spoken it." To this I would add my testimony, humbly, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>J.

<h1>mith: &quot;Praise to the Man&quot; - Gordon B. Hinckley - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I would like to say first that it is a very genuine pleasure to be with you tonight. It is always an inspiration to come to these firesides. I do not know why we call them firesides. The word connotes a small group of friends sitting about the hearth where a warm fire burns, talking with one another in an informal way. Tonight you are numbered in the thousands, and we have neither hearth nor fire; but I hope we can speak together as friends, and in a rather informal manner. I seek the direction of the Holy Spirit, because I wish for nothing more than to say to you those things which will add to your faith as we are met together in a spirit of worship.<br><br>I am responsible for the singing of that first song by the congregation: "Praise to the Man." I would like to say a word or two about that great hymn from the pen of W. W. Phelps.<br><br>Many years ago when at the age of twelve I was ordained a deacon, my father, who was president of our stake, took me to my first stake priesthood meeting. In those days these meetings were held on a week night. I recall that we went to the Tenth Ward building in Salt Lake City. He walked up to the stand, and I sat on the back row, feeling a little alone and uncomfortable in that hall filled with strong men who had been ordained to the priesthood of God. The meeting was called to order, the opening song was announced, and--as was then the custom--we all stood to sing. There were perhaps as many as four hundred there, for it was a very large stake. Together these men lifted their strong voices, some with the accents of the European lands from which they had come as converts and all singing with a great spirit of conviction and testimony:<br><br><i>Praise to the man who communed with Jehovah!</i><br><i>Jesus anointed that Prophet and Seer,</i><br><i>Blessed to open the last dispensation,</i><br><i>Kings shall extol him, and nations revere.</i><br>["Praise to the Man,"<i>Hymns</i>, no. 147]<br><br>They were singing of the Prophet Joseph Smith, and as they did so there came into my young heart a great surge of love for and belief in the mighty Prophet of this dispensation. In my childhood I had been taught much of him in meetings and classes in our ward as well as in our home; but my experience in that stake priesthood meeting was different. I knew then, by the power of the Holy Ghost, that Joseph Smith was indeed a prophet of God.<br><br>It is true that during the years which followed there were times when that testimony wavered somewhat, particularly in the seasons of my undergraduate university work--not at this university, but at another.<br><br>However, that conviction never left me entirely; and it has grown stronger through the years, partly because of the challenges of those days which compelled me to read and study and make certain for myself. I think that all of you go through similar experiences. President Lee once said that our testimonies need renewing every day. In harmony with that principle, I wish to say a few words tonight about Joseph Smith. Perhaps I shall not say anything that is new to you, but I hope and pray that the very repetition of matters with which you may be familiar will stir within you a renewal and strengthening of your testimony.<br><br>I am led to this subject by a letter, which I read only Friday, written by a New York evangelist who with diatribe and hate lashed out against the Prophet Joseph, calling him a wicked imposter, a fraud, a fake, and a deceiver and declaring that he was undertaking a national campaign to prove it. I do not know whether anything will come of his campaign; whatever happens, it will not be significant. It may topple a few of the weak, but it will only strengthen the strong. And long after this man and others of his kind have gone down to silence, the name of Joseph Smith will ring with honor and love in the hearts of an ever-growing band of Latter-day Saints in an ever-increasing number of nations of the earth.<br><br>Two weeks ago today I was in Nauvoo, the City of Joseph, with two of my brethren of the First Quorum of the Seventy and twelve mission presidents and their wives for a mission presidents' seminar. The touch of autumn was on the land--the leaves golden, a little haze in the air, the nights cool, the days warm. The tourist season was over, and the old city was quiet and beautiful. We held our first meeting in the restored Seventies Hall, where in the 1840s men prepared themselves, through study and through teaching one another the doctrine of the Kingdom, to go out to declare the message of the gospel to the world. This was the forerunner of the Missionary Training Center. As we met in that and other homes and halls in Nauvoo, it was as if the figures of the past were with us--Joseph and Hyrum, Brigham Young, Heber C. Kimball, John Taylor, Wilford Woodruff, the brothers Pratt--Orson and Parley--and a host of others.<br><br>This was indeed Joseph's city. He was the prophet who planned it, and his followers had built it. It became the largest and the most impressive in the state of Illinois. With sturdy brick homes, with halls for worship, instruction, and entertainment, and with the magnificent temple standing on the crest of the slope up from the river, this community on the Mississippi was put together as if its builders were to be there for a century or more.<br><br>Here, before that tragic day at Carthage, the Prophet was at the zenith of his career. Standing the other day where he once stood, I thought of the events that had brought him there, reviewing in my mind his inheritance. I thought of his forebears who generations before had left the British Isles and come to Boston; of their lives in the New World, through five generations on his father's side and four on his mother's; of their labors in clearing the lands of Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Vermont to build farms and homes; of their distinguished service in the War of Independence; of the adversities and the failures they experienced in trying to wrest a living from the granite hills among which they lived. I thought of the little boy, born in Sharon in December of 1805, given his father's name. I reflected on that terrifying period of sickness when typhus fever struck the family and osteomyelitis, with great pain and debilitating infection, settled in Joseph's leg. That was while the family lived in Lebanon, New Hampshire; and how remarkable it was that only a few miles away, at the academy in Hanover, was Dr. Nathan Smith, perhaps then the only surgeon in the United States--if not in the world--who had developed a procedure by which that infected leg might be saved.<br><br>But it was not to be accomplished without terrible suffering. In fact, today it is difficult to conceive of how the little boy stood it as his father held him in his arms and his mother walked and prayed among the trees of the farm to escape his screams while the surgeon made the long incision and with forceps broke off the portions of infected bone without benefit of anesthesia of any kind. Perhaps remembrance of that intense suffering made a little more bearable for Joseph Smith the later tarring and feathering at Kirtland, the foul jail at Liberty, and the shots of the mob at Carthage.<br><br>In my looking back from Nauvoo the other day I thought of the forces that moved the Smith family from generations of life in New England to western New York, where they had to come if the foreordained purposes of God were to be accomplished. I thought of the loss of the family farm, of poor crops in that thin soil, of the great freeze of 1816 when a killing frost in July forced upon them the decision to look elsewhere; then of the move to Palmyra, of the purchase of a farm in Manchester, and of the revival preachers who stirred the people and so confused a boy that he determined to ask God for that wisdom so lacking in the contending revivalists.<br><br>That was the real beginning of it all, as you know--that spring day in the year 1820 when he knelt among the trees, opened his mouth in prayer, and beheld a glorious vision in which he spoke with God the Eternal Father and His Son, the risen Lord Jesus Christ. Then followed the years of instruction, the instructor an angel of God who on a dozen occasions taught, rebuked, warned, and comforted the boy as he grew into the young man.<br><br>And so, while in Nauvoo the other day I reflected on the preparation for prophethood: I reflected on this amazing Joseph Smith. I cannot expect his detractors, including the writer of the letter I read on Friday, to know of his prophetic calling by the power of the Holy Ghost; but I can raise some questions for him and other critics to deal with before they can dismiss Joseph Smith as a false prophet. I have time for only three of many that might be asked: first, what do you do with the Book of Mormon? second, how do you explain his power to influence strong men to follow him, even unto death? and third, how do you rationalize the fulfillment of his prophecies?<br><br>Here is the Book of Mormon. I hold it in my hand. I read its words. I have read Joseph Smith's explanation of how it came to be. To the unbelieving it is a story difficult to accept, and critics by the score have worn out their lives writing books intended to refute that story and to offer explanations other than the one given by Joseph Smith. But their critical writing only has the effect of stimulating scholars to dig the deeper, and the more deeply they dig the greater the accumulation of evidence for the validity of the story.<br><br>For instance, I have been fascinated with the recent studies of Dr. Alvin C. Rencher of this campus and Dr. Wayne A. Larsen of the Eyring Research Center on the "wordprints" of different authors in the Book of Mormon. They and others have demonstrated that just as a man's fingerprints are peculiar to him alone, so each author has word patterns that are peculiarly his. Presumably, if Joseph Smith, Sidney Rigdon, Solomon Spaulding, or any other one man wrote the Book of Mormon its language style would be the same in all of its books. But now, with computer technology, these scholars are led to conclude that statistically "the odds against a single author for the Book of Mormon exceed 100 billion to one" (Marc Haddock, "Computer Wordprints Track Writer's Style,"<i>BYU Today</i>, November 1979, p. 1). Think of it. They further say: "All of our data point to one almost inescapable conclusion: No one man wrote the Book of Mormon. It seems impossible that Joseph Smith or any other writer, however brilliant, could have fabricated a work with 24 or more discernible wordprints." (Wayne A. Larsen, Alvin C. Rencher, and Tim Layton, "Multiple Authorship of the Book of Mormon,"<i>New Era</i>, November 1979, p. 13.)<br><br>Joseph Smith did not write the Book of Mormon. Rather, "by the gift and power of God" (Book of Mormon, title page) he translated the writings of many authors who wrote at different times and under various circumstances.<br><br>This "wordprint" evidence, made possible through the modern computer, is to me remarkable and greatly appreciated. It significantly supplements a great and growing body of evidence for the validity of this remarkable book and for the man who was the instrument in the hands of God in bringing it forth "to the convincing of the Jew and Gentile that JESUS is the CHRIST" (Book of Mormon, title page).<br><br>As has been demonstrated for a hundred and fifty years, the truth of the book will not be determined by literary analysis or by scientific research, although these are reassuring and most welcome. The truth will be determined today and tomorrow, as it has been throughout the yesterdays, by the reading of it in a spirit of reverence and respect and prayer. I received a letter the other day from a father who said that, in response to the challenge I offered at general conference that we read the book again before next April, he and his family are going to read the first edition which touched so deeply so many strong and able men who read it when it first came from the press. I commended him but hastened to add that no one need look for a first edition to get the spirit of this remarkable volume. Every one of the million copies that will be printed this year carries that same spirit, includes that same marvelous promise, and will yield the same result in testimony concerning the truth of the book.<br><br>To return to my first question to the critics: What do you do with the Book of Mormon? It is here to be handled and to be read with prayer and earnest inquiry. All of the work of all of the critics throughout the hundred and fifty years of its presence has lacked credibility in the cold light of fact and has been without effect on those who have prayerfully read the book and received by the power of the Holy Ghost a witness of its truth. If there were no other evidence for the divine mission of Joseph Smith, the Book of Mormon would stand as an irrefutable witness of that fact. To think that anyone less than one inspired could bring forth a book which should have so profound an effect for good upon others is to imagine that which simply cannot be. The evidence for the truth of the Book of Mormon is found in the lives of the millions, living and gone, who have read it, prayed about it, and received a witness of its truth.<br><br>My second question to the critics: How do you explain Joseph's power to influence strong men and women to follow him, even unto death? Anyone who has any doubt about Joseph Smith's power of leadership need only look at the men who were attracted to him. They did not come for wealth. They did not come for political power. They were not drawn by dreams of military conquest. His offering to them was none of these; rather, it concerned only salvation through faith in the Lord Jesus Christ. It involved persecution with its pains and losses, long and lonely missions, separation from family and friends, and in many cases death itself.<br><br>Take, for instance, Orson Hyde, whose name has been much in Church news of late because of President Kimball's dedication of the memorial park on the Mount of Olives in Jerusalem. Orson Hyde was a clerk in the village of Kirtland when he met Joseph Smith, the youthful prophet. It was to this unknown, unpromising young seller of buttons and thread and calico that Joseph, speaking in the name of the Lord, said that he, Orson Hyde, was ordained "to proclaim the everlasting gospel, by the Spirit of the living God, from people to people, and from land to land, in the congregations of the wicked, in their synagogues, reasoning with and expounding all scriptures unto them" (D&amp;amp;C 68:1).<br><br>This young man, this clerk in a village store, under the inspiration of that prophetic call, walked two thousand miles on foot through Rhode Island, Massachusetts, Maine, and New York, "reasoning with and expounding all scriptures unto" all he met.<br><br>We were at the scene of his home in Nauvoo the other day, the comfortable home he left to travel to England and Germany and to visit Constantinople, Cairo, and Alexandria en route to Jerusalem where on October 24, 1841, he stood on the Mount of Olives and dedicated by the authority of the holy priesthood the land of Palestine for the return of the Jews. That was a quarter of a century before Herzl, the powerful exponent of Zionism, undertook the work of gathering the Jews to their homeland.<br><br>As another example, take Willard Richards--educated, refined, a doctor of medicine. When Joseph and Hyrum surrendered themselves to the governor of Illinois and were placed in Carthage Jail, a handful of the brethren went with them. By the afternoon of June 27, 1844, most had left to take care of certain matters of business, leaving only John Taylor and Willard Richards with the Prophet and his brother Hyrum. That afternoon following dinner the jailer, knowing of the mob outside, suggested that they would be safer in the cell of the jail. Turning to Willard Richards, Joseph asked, "If we go into the cell will you go with us?" To this Elder Richards responded:<br><br><i>Brother Joseph, you did not ask me to cross the river with you--you did not ask me to come to Carthage--you did not ask me to come to jail with you--and do you think I would forsake you now? But I will tell you what I will do; if you are condemned to be hung for 'treason,' I will be hung in your stead, and you shall go free.</i>[B.H. Roberts,<i>A Comprehensive History of the Church</i>, 2:283]<br><br>Strong and intelligent men do not demonstrate that kind of love for a charlatan or a fraud. That kind of love comes of God and the recognition of integrity in men. It is an expression of the spirit and example of the Savior, who gave his life for all men and who declared, "Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends" (John 15:13).<br><br>If there were time we might speak of the others, so many of them--the Youngs, the Kimballs, the Taylors, the Snows, the Pratts, and their kind--who when they first met Joseph Smith were ordinary and unpromising in their appearance and ways, but who under his matchless energizing power became giants in achievement and immortal through their service to others.<br><br>Question three to the critics: What of his prophecies? There were more than a few, and they were fulfilled. Among the most notable was the revelation of the Civil War. You are familiar with it; it was spoken on Christmas Day, 1832. There were many high-minded men and women who deplored the institution of slavery then common in the South, and there was much talk of abolition. But who but a prophet of God would have dared to say, thirty-nine years before it was to happen that "war [would]be poured out upon all nations beginning at the rebellion of South Carolina" and that "the Southern States [would]be divided against the Northern States"? (D&amp;amp;C 87:1–3.) That remarkable prediction saw its fulfillment with the firing on Fort Sumter in Charleston Harbor in 1861. How could Joseph Smith have possibly foreseen with such accuracy the event that was to come thirty-nine years after he spoke of it. Only by the spirit of prophecy which was in him.<br><br>Or again, consider the equally remarkable prophecy concerning the movement of our people to these mountain valleys. The Saints were then living in Nauvoo and its sister community across the Mississippi and were enjoying a prosperity they had not previously known. They were building a temple and other substantial structures. Their new homes were of brick, constructed to endure. And yet one day in August of 1842, while visiting in Montrose, Joseph<br><br><i>prophesied that the Saints would continue to suffer much affliction and would be driven to the Rocky Mountains, many would apostatize, others would be put to death by our persecutors or lose their lives in consequence of exposure or disease, and [speaking to those who were present] some of you will live to go and assist in making settlements and build cities and see the Saints become a mighty people in the midst of the Rocky Mountains.</i>[<i>History of the Church</i>, 5:85–86]<br><br>Viewed in the context of the time and circumstances, this statement is nothing less than remarkable. Only a man speaking with a knowledge beyond his own could have uttered words which would be so literally fulfilled, as your presence here tonight attests.<br><br>Great was his vision. It encompassed all the peoples of mankind, wherever they live, and all generations who have walked the earth and passed on. How can his critics, past or present, speak against him except out of ignorance? They have not tasted of his words; they have not pondered him and prayed about him. As one who has done these things, I can echo the words of John Taylor who was with him at Carthage Jail when he was killed and who in his account of that tragedy wrote this appraisal: "Joseph Smith, the Prophet and Seer of the Lord, has done more, save Jesus only, for the salvation of men in this world, than any other man that ever lived in it" (D&amp;amp;C 135:3).<br><br>To these I add my own words of testimony that he was and is a prophet of God, raised up as an instrument in the hands of the Almighty to usher in a new and final gospel dispensation. May I leave you with this quotation:<br><br><i>When a man gives his life for the cause he has advocated, he meets the highest test of his honesty and sincerity that his own or any future generation can in fairness ask. When he dies for the testimony he has borne, all malicious tongues should ever after be silent, and all voices hushed in reverence before a sacrifice so complete.</i>[Ezra Dalby, speech given December 12, 1926]<br><br><i>Great is his glory and endless his priesthood:</i><br><i>Ever and ever the keys he will hold.</i><br><i>Faithful and true, he will enter his kingdom,</i><br><i>Crowned in the midst of the prophets of old.</i><br>["Praise to the Man,"<i>Hymns</i>, no.147]<br><br>In the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Gordon B. Hinckley was a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when this fireside address was given at BYU on 4November 1979.</i><br><br><i>© Intellectual Reserve, Inc.

<br>
Permit me first to express appreciation for the beauty of the music that we have just heard. As I thrilled with you to the beauty of that harmony and the sweet words that they have sung to us today, my mind reflected on the scripture recorded in the 25th section of the Doctrine and Covenants, verse twelve, where the Lord said, "For my soul delighteth in the song of the heart; yea, the song of the righteous is a prayer unto me, and it shall be answered with a blessing upon their heads." I certainly would pray this morning that that would be realized in their behalf because of the spirit that they have provided for us in this devotional.<br><br>I am honored to be here. It is a thrill to be on this campus and to feel of your spirit. I am grateful to have the chance to compliment Coach Edwards and his associates and this great football team for their accomplishments. Each weekend as I come home from a stake conference I can hardly wait to pick the paper up to see how BYU did. President Oaks announced that I was a graduate from the University of Utah; but, Coach Edwards, I think that you know for whom I will be cheering this weekend.<br><br>My experience in the past few years have brought me to this campus frequently, not as a student or a faculty member but one who came to this campus on business and enjoyed the atmosphere that I found here.<br><br>But today, my brothers and sisters, I find myself in a situation I never dreamed would be possible. I am moved by what I feel and see. Though it is humbling and frightening and a little bit overwhelming to look into your faces, I am excited with the challenge.<br><br>We live in a beautiful world--a world filled with opportunities and blessings. Too often, however, we hear the negative: that this is a wicked world, that it is a terrible time to live, that the challenges of today's life are too great, and similar pessimistic statements. There are, I am sure, reasons for such statements, but I feel that there has never been a greater period in which to live than today.<br><br>This is a day in which the gospel of Jesus Christ has been restored for the blessing of all mankind. This is the dispensation of the fullness of times. The priesthood has been given to man for the blessing of all our Father's children. The ordinances are available to provide the greatest of all the gifts of God, even eternal life, to each of our Father's children if they will live in obedience to the commandments and endure to the end. Through the Restoration, about which this choir has just so beautifully sung, there is available to us a sure knowledge of where we came from, why we are here, and where we go at the conclusion of this mortal probation. We are directed by apostles and prophets who, as the apostle Paul suggested, are the foundation upon which the church is built, with Jesus Christ as the chief cornerstone (see Ephesians 2:19–20). The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has been organized, and the Savior himself has said that this is "the only true and living church upon the face of the whole earth, with which I, the Lord, am well pleased" (D&amp;amp;C 1:30). This Church is directed by the Savior through a great prophet, even Spencer W. Kimball. He is the Lord's spokesman, and I bear my solemn witness to you today that he is one of the greatest that has ever been so called and ordained.<br><br>Yes, this is a wonderful time in which to live, and I am confident that because of your faithfulness in the premortal life the Lord has withheld your spirits to come forth<i>now</i>to accomplish a great work. In October of 1830 the Lord made the following statement: "For behold, the field is white already to harvest; and it is the eleventh hour, and the last time that I shall call laborers into my vineyard" (D&amp;amp;C 33:3). If it was the eleventh hour in 1830, may I ask what time it is today?<br><br>None of us knows the hour or the day when the Savior will make his appearance. However, we do know that before that day will come the "gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations" (Matthew 24:14) and "every man shall hear the fullness of the gospel in his own tongue, and in his own language" (D&amp;amp;C 90:11).<br><br>This is the reason that President Kimball has continually emphasized the urgency of this work. Hardly a conference passes in which he does not remind us of the need to pray for the work to expand and grow. Just a year ago, in the October general conference, President Kimball made the following statement:<br><br><i>There are many nations where we have not been able to get in, to get visas, or get passports; and it is very important. If we are to fulfill the responsibility given to us by the Lord on the Mount of Olives to go into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature, then we will need to open the doors to these nations. ...We've hardly scratched the surface. We need far more missionaries, and we need more countries that will think of us as being their friends and will give us an opportunity to come to their nations and give to their people the finest thing in the world--the gospel of Christ--which can be their salvation and their great happiness.</i><br><br>[And then this great soul who is our prophet continued:]<i>I'm hoping that every</i>[person]<i>listening to me ... will make it a solemn practice in regular life to pray constantly for this great blessing to bless the brethren who are making a special effort to reach the leaders of these nations and to convince them that we have only good for their people. We will make them good citizens, we will make them good souls, and we will make them happy and joyous.</i><br><br><i>I hope that</i>[in]<i>every family ... the father and the mother and the children in their turns will offer prayers which will be centered around this very important element--that the doors of the nations might be opened to us and then, secondly, that the missionaries, the young men and women of the Church, may be anxious to fill those missions and bring people into the Church. ...</i><br><br><i>So I'm hoping that, beginning now, the prayers of the Saints will be greatly increased from what they have been in the past, that we will never think of praying except we pray for the Lord to establish his program and make it possible that we can carry the gospel to his people as he has commanded</i>. [Spencer W. Kimball, "Fundamental Principles to Ponder and Live,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 1978, pp. 45–46]<br><br>How many of you, my brothers and sisters, are praying for these things as the Prophet has asked? How many of you prayed this morning for these things--that the doors of the nations might be opened and that there would be more missionaries? How many of you here who have not made that decision to serve a mission have not only offered that prayer but have committed to do as we have been asked not only by President Kimball, but also by the Lord? Remember, the Lord's prophet has said, "I'm hoping ... that we will never think of praying except we pray for" these things. Now, let me ask one further question: How many of you will pray this evening or this night for these things?<br><br>I remember that, shortly after we concluded the mission presidents' seminar in June of this year, we met in the Missionary Department of the Church with great concern that several of our new mission presidents who were going to Spanish-speaking countries could not get visas and would not be able to enter those countries. We were concerned because the mission presidents whose places they were to take were being released and there would be no leadership. Our prayers were unitedly offered in earnestness to the Lord, and within a matter of a week to two weeks those visas were received and our mission presidents were able to enter those countries.<br><br>I think it would be of interest to you to know where we are in this great missionary effort. When President Kimball became the President of the Church at the end of 1973--not yet six years ago--there were only 108 missions in the world. Today, under the direction of this great soul, we have 175. One of the Brethren was recently doing some figuring and concluded that if were to go into China today--for which opportunity President Kimball has asked us to pray--with missions organized at about the same rate as we have them here in the United States, we would need 240 missions just in China alone! Obviously we have a great deal of work ahead of us yet.<br><br>Back in 1973 there were 17,258 missionaries; that number has increased today to a number in excess of 29,000. And not only do we have more missionaries, but they are doing a more effective job: convert baptisms per missionary have increased from 4.6 per missionary in 1973 to 6.5 per missionary today.<br><br>In 1973 we baptized 77,820 converts. This year we expect to have as many as 190,000, and possibly 200,000, of our Father's children enter the waters of baptism.<br><br>Under the direction of our Prophet, great strides have been made; but much more is left to be accomplished. As President Kimball spoke to the Regional Representatives and others on March 30 of this year, he gave emphasis to those areas:<br><br><i>I continue to be impressed that we should do more to reach the large groups of language minorities in our major cities. We should continue to pray individually and in our homes and in our councils and in our meetings and petition the Lord to assist us to find a way to reach the hearts and minds of leaders of nations--China, Russia, eastern European countries--yes, all countries that are now closed or have restrictions on the teaching of the truth of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, so that the word might go forward in all the world as has been commanded. Our Father does and will hear our prayers--of this I am certain. But we must ask in faith, nothing wavering. Then we must be prepared to enter once the gates are opened.</i><br><br><i>It appears that the time is not too distant when the gospel might be preached to those good people</i>[in China].<i>There are 900 million of them. Are we ready for such an undertaking?</i><br><br>With President Kimball's question, "Are we ready for such an undertaking?" may I ask you another question: Are<i>you</i>ready for such an undertaking?<br><br>How does one determine his or her readiness to serve the Lord so that individually and collectively we might bring to pass the fulfillment of this divine injunction?<br><br><i>And this gospel</i>shall<i>be preached unto every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people.</i><br><br><i>And the servants of God shall go forth, saying with a loud voice: Fear God and give glory to him, for the hour of his judgment is come;</i><br><br><i>And worship him that made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters</i>. [D&amp;amp;C 133:37–39, emphasis added]<br><br>To answer the above question of how one determines his readiness, may I turn with you to the pages of the Book of Mormon? Being a father, I personally find the teachings of this great book of marvelous assistance in my stewardship. This volume of scripture begins on a family relationship, as Nephi states that he was born of goodly parents. "Therefore," Nephi continues, "I was taught somewhat in all the learning of my father" (1 Nephi 1:1). How grateful I am for the same experience in my life; for I was also taught in the learning of wise and good parents.<br><br>In the fifth chapter of Helaman, another individual by the name of Nephi, son of Helaman, speaks of the conditions that existed in his day (which was about thirty years before the birth of the Savior). Much as it is in our day, he indicates that "they who chose evil were more numerous than they who chose good." He continues by stating that, because of this,<br><br><i>They were ripening for destruction, for the laws had become corrupted. ...</i><br><br><i>And it came to pass that Nephi had become weary because of their iniquity; and he yielded up the judgment-seat, and took it upon him to preach the word of God all the remainder of his days</i>. [Helaman 5:2, 4]<br><br>The conditions existing in their days were much like they are in our day. I suggest that you and I must make the same commitment as did Nephi and his brother Lehi--that we take it upon ourselves to preach the word of God the remainder of our days. This does not mean that we leave our educational pursuits or our employment, but that we conscientiously make every attempt to share the priceless message of the gospel with those around us. We do this by example and by word.<br><br>Nephi and Lehi made this decision based largely on the teachings that they received from their father Helaman. The record states, "For they remembered the words which their father Helaman spake unto them." They then shared with you and me this great counsel which helped them to make wise decisions in this life and to be successful. Listen carefully to the counsel of a wise father: "Behold, my sons, I desire that ye should ... keep the commandments of God; and I would that ye should declare unto the people these words" (Helaman 5:6).<br><br>He then taught them of their progenitors that came from Jerusalem to America so that, as they remembered them, they would think of their works and faith and know that they were good. Then he continued in his counsel:<br><br><i>Therefore, my sons, I would that ye should do that which is good, that it may be said of you, and also written, even as it has been said and written of them.</i><br><br><i>And now my sons, behold I have somewhat more to desire of you, which desire is, that ye may not do these things that ye may boast, but that ye may do these things to lay up for yourselves a treasure in heaven, yea, which is eternal, and which fadeth not away; yea, that ye may have that precious gift of eternal life.</i><br><br>He then asked them to remember the words of King Benjamin and also of Amulek:<br><br><i>...There is no other way nor means whereby man can be saved, only through the atoning blood of Jesus Christ, who shall come, yea, remember that he cometh to redeem the world.</i><br><br><i>...That he should not come to redeem them in their sins, but to redeem them from their sins.</i><br><br><i>And he hath power given unto him from the Father to redeem them from their sins because of repentance; therefore he hath sent his angels to declare the tidings of the conditions of repentance, which bringeth unto the power of the Redeemer, unto the salvation of their souls.</i>[Helaman 5:7–11]<br><br>May I suggest to you this same counsel: first, keep the commandments of God, and declare them unto the people by word and deed; second, strive all the days of your life to do good; third, do it not to boast, but to lay up for yourselves a treasure in heaven, that you might have that precious gift of eternal life; and fourth, remember that there is only one way whereby men can be saved, and that is through the atoning blood of Jesus Christ, for he has come to redeem them from sin if they will but repent.<br><br>Helaman then concludes his instruction to his sons with one of my favorite passages of scripture. I pray that it will now rest on your souls with an intensity that you cannot forget for the rest of your lives.<br><br><i>And now, my sons, remember, remember that it is upon the rock of our Redeemer, who is Christ, the Son of God, that ye must build your foundation; that when the devil shall send forth his mighty winds, yea, his shafts in the whirlwind, yea, when all his hail and his mighty storm shall beat upon you, it shall have no power over you to drag you down to the gulf of misery and endless wo, because of the rock upon which ye are built, which is a sure foundation, a foundation whereon if men build they cannot fall.</i>[Helaman 5:12]<br><br>You are here at Brigham Young University because deep down inside you desire to be successful in life. No one wants to be a failure. The Lord wants you to be successful, and Helaman says if you will build you foundation "upon the rock of our Redeemer, who is Christ, the Son of God... which<i>is a sure foundation,</i>" you will not fall.<br><br>When we build on this foundation we commit all that we have to the Lord--our talents, energies, love--yes, our heart, might, mind, and strength to his service. When furthering our education we recognize that "the glory of God is intelligence" (D&amp;amp;C 93:36); and so we do our very best, realizing that this is a preparation not only for our professional life but, even more importantly, for better service to the Lord.<br><br>If you will build on this foundation you will have the physical, mental, and spiritual strength to withstand the winds, even the whirlwinds of evil, the hail and the mighty storms that are now being unleashed and will continue to be unleashed with even greater intensity than ever before. Satan's power and influence is frightening, and unless we are properly prepared, he can drag us "down to the gulf of misery and endless wo."<br><br>Helaman's children remembered their father's counsel, as I pray that you will. "They went forth," the scripture indicates, "keeping the commandments of God." They taught the gospel from city to city with great power, and they were so convincing that "eight thousand of the Lamanites who were in the land of Zarahemla and round about [were]baptized unto repentance" (Helaman 5:14,19). Think with me for a moment of the cities represented in this audience today! Think what can and should happen because of your influence--not just here at BYU, but as you eventually are scattered to the various cities and nations where the Lord will place you. I think frequently of the scripture in the 100th section of the Doctrine and Covenants, verse four, where the Lord says, "Therefore, I, the Lord, have suffered you to come unto this place; for thus it was expedient in me for the salvation of souls." A significant part of building on that sure foundation is imparting to others the "glad tidings" so that all of our brothers and sisters can achieve eternal life.<br><br>If we correctly understand our eternal destiny, we understand that success consists of becoming as God is. We are his children, and we have the potential of living as he lives and doing what he does. As we contemplate this awesome concept, however, we must remember that God is a missionary. It is his work and glory "to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man" (Moses 1:39). The essence of his work is missionary work, and the earthly ministry of his beloved son, Jesus Christ, exemplifies this true pattern for living. If we neglect missionary work in order to pursue other interests, even worthy interests, we can never expect to be like our Father.<br><br>Knowing this, our Father in Heaven has provided the means by which we can become like him. Joseph Smith said,<br><br><i>God himself, finding he was in the midst of spirits and glory, because he was more intelligent, saw proper to institute laws whereby the rest could have a privilege to advance like himself. ... He has power to institute laws to instruct the weaker intelligences, that they may be exalted with himself</i>. [Joseph Smith,<i>Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith,</i>sel. Joseph Fielding Smith (Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Company, 1938), p. 354]<br><br>It is not surprising to discover, therefore, that the really important things that we do in the Church are intimately associated with missionary work. In fact, our commitment to this work began even before we entered mortality. I quote a statement from John A. Widtsoe, former apostle of the Church:<br><br><i>In our pre-existent state, in the day of the great council, we made a certain agreement with the Almighty. The Lord proposed a plan, conceived by him. We accepted it. Since the plan is intended for all men, we become parties to the salvation of every person under that plan. We agreed, right then and there, to be not only saviors for ourselves, but measurably saviors for the whole human family. We went into a partnership with the Lord. The working out of the plan became then not merely the Father's work, and the Savior's work, but also our work. The least of us, the humblest, is in partnership with the Almighty in achieving the purpose of the eternal plan of salvation.</i>[Quoted in Roy W. Doxey,<i>Latter-day Prophets and the Doctrine and Covenants</i>(Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Company, 1978), 1:28-29]<br><br>Elder Widtsoe said this in the context of doing work for the dead, but it applies equally as well to the work we do for the salvation of the living, both members and nonmembers; for it is all the same work of saving souls.<br><br>As we progress in mortality, we renew these premortal covenants, primarily through the ordinances of the gospel. For instance, we all know that the covenant of baptism includes the obligation to "stand as witnesses of God at all times and in all things, and in all places that ye may be in, even until death" (Mosiah 18:9). Perhaps some of us have not recognized, however, that the Savior made specific reference to our missionary duties when he instituted the sacrament. Joseph Smith was inspired to add a significant phrase in both Matthew's and Mark's accounts of the Last Supper. To quote Mark, "And he said unto them, This is in remembrance of my blood which is shed for many, and the new testament which I give unto you;<i>for of me ye shall bear record unto all the world"</i>(Joseph Smith Translation, Mark 14:23, emphasis added).<br><br>Much more could be said about the power that comes through eternal covenants, but this is sufficient to show that the Lord has not left this important work to chance. But in addition, these obligations are the source of greatest joy. Missionary work is not a task we perform in order to qualify for the blessing of joy; it is an inherently joyful work. The Lord said, "if your joy will be great with one soul that you have brought unto me into the kingdom of my Father, how great will be your joy if you should bring many souls unto me!" (D&amp;amp;C 18:16). In addition, he said,<br><br><i>And blessed are they who shall seek to bring forth my Zion at that day, for they shall have the gift and the power of the Holy Ghost; and if they endure unto the end they shall be lifted up at the last day, and shall be saved in the everlasting kingdom of the Lamb; and whoso shall publish peace, yea, tidings of great joy, how beautiful upon the mountains shall they be</i>. [1 Nephi 13:37]<br><br>We are also promised that by testifying and warning our neighbors we are cleansed from our sins: "Nevertheless, ye are blessed, for the testimony which ye have borne is recorded in heaven for the angels to look upon; and they rejoice over you, and your sins are forgiven you" (D&amp;amp;C 62:3). Not only are our own sins forgiven, but we are cleansed from the responsibility for the sins of others. In Jacob's words:<br><br><i>And we did magnify our office unto the Lord, taking upon us the responsibility, answering the sins of the people upon our own heads if we did not teach them the word of God with all diligence; wherefore, by laboring with our might their blood might not come upon our garments; otherwise their blood would come upon our garments, and we would not be found spotless at the last day</i>. [Jacob 1:19]<br><br>I can testify of the joy and spiritual power that comes from being a missionary, because some of the most memorable experiences in my life are a result of this glorious work. I remember visiting with a young lady in a shopping mall in Arizona one day who was weeping because of the death of her husband. I suggested to her that there is a way that she could be with her husband for time and for all eternity. She was concerned and asked about it; I enlisted the help of our missionaries to teach her.<br><br>Several weeks later, while visiting in that same community, I went to her home with the stake president, was invited in, and walked to a piano where sat a beautiful picture of her and her husband Bob and their three lovely sons. This time she was weeping for joy as she pointed to the picture and indicated that on the morrow she would be baptized into the Church. Then, holding onto my hand tightly, she said, "Just think, Brother Goaslind--in one year from tomorrow we can be an eternal family." There is nothing that brings greater joy than doing missionary work in the kingdom.<br><br>I conclude with this statement from Elder John H. Taylor: "We only find happiness for the blessings that we have received by seeing that other people have the same opportunity" (in Conference Report, April 1944, p. 136). Therefore, if we desire to have the joy that is our potential, my brothers and sisters, we must participate in God's work of saving souls--right here and right now at BYU, throughout your entire life, and into eternity.<br><br>I bear witness to you that this is God's work, that he lives, that Jesus is the Christ, that Joseph Smith is a prophet of God; and my solemn and sacred witness today is that at the head of the Church today is a prophet, even Spencer W. Kimball. In the sacred name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Jack H Goaslind was a member of the First Quorum of the Seventy of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when this devotional address was given at Brigham Young University on 13 November 1979.</i><br><br><i>© Intellectual Reserve, Inc.

<h1> - Neal A. Maxwell - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Thank you very much, Bob. I appreciate this great privilege each time that it is mine, my brothers and sisters. I am grateful to the choral group today for that last number, the lyrics of which I hope will linger with you somewhat, because I will turn to them as I close my speech.<br><br>I have chosen to speak today about a very pedestrian principle: patience, I hope that I do not empty the Marriott Center by that selection. Perhaps the topic was selfishly selected because of my clear and continuing need to develop further this very important attribute. But my interest in patience is not solely personal; for the necessity of having this intriguing attribute is cited several times in the scriptures, including once by King Benjamin who, when clustering the attributes of sainthood, named patience as a charter member of that cluster (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/3.19?lang=eng#18">Mosiah 3:19</a>; see also <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/7.23?lang=eng#p22">Alma 7:23</a>).<br><br>Patience is not indifference. Actually, it means caring very much but being willing, nevertheless, to submit to the Lord and to what the scriptures call the "process of time."<br><br>Patience is tied very closely to faith in our Heavenly Father. Actually, when we are unduly impatient we are suggesting that we know what is best--better than does God. Or, at least, we are asserting that our timetable is better than His. Either way we are questioning the reality of God's omniscience as if, as some seem to believe, God were on some sort of postdoctoral fellowship and were not quite in charge of everything.<br><br>Saint Teresa of Avila said that unless we come to know the reality of God, including his omniscience, our mortal existence "will be no more than a night in a second-class hotel" (quoted by Malcolm Muggerridge in "The Great Liberal Death Wish,"<i>Imprimis</i>[Hillsdale College, Michigan], May 1979.) Our second estate can be a first-class experience only if you and I develop a patient faith in God and in his unfolding purposes.<br><br>We read in Mosiah about how the Lord simultaneously tries the patience of His people even as He tries their faith (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/23.21?lang=eng#p20">Mosiah 23:21</a>). One is not only to endure, but to endure well and gracefully those things which the Lord "seeth fit to inflict upon [us]" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/3.19?lang=eng#p18">Mosiah 3:19)</a>, just as did a group of ancient American saints who were bearing unusual burdens but who submitted "cheerfully and with patience to all the will of the Lord" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/24.15?lang=eng#p14">Mosiah 24:15</a>).<br><br>Paul, speaking to the Hebrews, brings us up short by writing that, even after faithful disciples had "done the will of God," they "[had] need of patience" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/heb/10.36?lang=eng#p35">Hebrews 10:36</a>). How many times have good individuals done the right thing only to break or wear away under subsequent stress, canceling out much of the value of what they had already so painstakingly done? Sometimes that which we are doing is correct enough but simply needs to be persisted in patiently, not for a minute or a moment but sometimes for years. Paul speaks of the marathon of life and of how we must "run with patience the race that is set before us" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/heb/12.1?lang=eng#primary">Hebrews 12:1</a>). Paul did not select the hundred-meter dash for his analogy!<br><br>The Lord has twice said: "And seek the face of the Lord always, that<i>in patience ye may possess your souls</i>, and ye shall have eternal life" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/101.38?lang=eng#p37">D&amp;amp;C 101:38</a>, emphasis added; see also <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/luke/21.19?lang=eng#p18">Luke 21:19</a>). Could it be, brothers and sisters, that only when our self-control becomes total do we come into the true possession of our souls?<br><br>Patience is not only a companion of faith but is also a friend to free agency. Inside our impatience there is sometimes an ugly reality: We are plainly irritated and inconvenienced by the need to make allowance for the free agency of others. In our impatience--which is not the same thing as divine discontent--we would override others, even though it is obvious that our individual differences and preferences are so irretrievably enmeshed with each other that the only resolution which preserves free agency is our patience and longsuffering with each other.<br><br>The passage of time is not, by itself, an automatic cure for bad choices; but often individuals like the prodigal son can "in process of time" come to their senses. The touching reunion of Jacob and Esau in the desert, so many years after their youthful rivalry, is a classic example of how generosity can replace animosity when truth is mixed with time. When we are unduly impatient, we are, in effect, trying to hasten an outcome when this kind of acceleration would be to abuse agency. Enoch--brilliant, submissive, and spiritual--knew what it meant to see a whole city-culture advance in "process of time." He could tell us much about so many things, including patience. Patience makes possible a personal spiritual symmetry which arises only, brothers and sisters, from prolonged obedience within free agency.<br><br>There is also a dimension of patience which links it to a special reverence for life. Patience is a willingness, in a sense, to watch the unfolding purposes of God with a sense of wonder and awe, rather than pacing up and down within the cell of our circumstance. Put another way, too much anxious opening of the oven door and the cake falls instead of rising. So it is with us. If we are always selfishly taking our temperature to see if we are happy, we will not be.<br><br>When we are impatient, we are neither reverential nor reflective because we are too self-centered. Whereas faith and patience are companions, so are selfishness and impatience. It is so easy to be confrontive without being informative; so easy to be indignant without being intelligent; so easy to be impulsive without being insightful. It is so easy to command others when we are not in control of ourselves.<br><br>I remember as a child going eagerly to the corner store for what we then called an "all-day sucker." It would not have lasted all day under the best usage, but it could last quite awhile. The trick was to resist the temptation to bite into it, to learn to savor rather than to crunch and chew. The same savoring was needed with a precious square of Hershey milk chocolate to make the treat last, especially in depression times.<br><br>In life, however, even patiently stretching out sweetness is sometimes not enough; in certain situations, enjoyment must actually be deferred. A patient willingness to defer dividends is a hallmark of individual maturity. It is, parenthetically, a hallmark of free nations that their citizens can discipline themselves today for a better tomorrow. Yet America is in trouble (as are other nations) precisely because a patient persistence in a wise course of public policy is so difficult to attain. Too many impatient politicians buy today's votes with tomorrow's inflation.<br><br>But back to the personal relevance of patience which, among many things, permits us to deal more effectively with the unevenness of life's experiences. I recorded the substance of this speech about three months ago while driving to a stake conference in Elko, Nevada, across that rather barren, but beautiful in its own way, stretch of desert. (Incidentally, as soon as most of this speech on patience was dictated my car threw two fan belts!) During that drive, it was brought forcibly to me that the seeming flat periods of life give us a blessed chance to reflect upon what is past as well as to be readied for some rather stirring climbs ahead. Instead of grumbling and murmuring, we should be consolidating and reflecting, which would not be possible if life were an uninterrupted sequence of fantastic scenery, confrontive events, and exhilarating conversation.<br><br>Patience helps us to use, rather than to protest, these seeming flat periods of life, becoming filled with quiet wonder over the past and with anticipation for that which may lie ahead, instead of demeaning the particular flatness through which we may be passing at the time. We should savor even the seemingly ordinary times, for life cannot be made up all of kettledrums and crashing cymbals. There must be some flutes and violins. Living cannot be all crescendo; there must be some dynamic contrast.<br><br>Clearly, without patience we will learn less in life. We will see less; we will feel less; we will hear less. Ironically, "rush" and "more" usually mean "less." The pressure of "now," time and time again, go against the grain of the gospel with its eternalism.<br><br>There is also in patience a greater opportunity for that discernment which sorts out the things that matter most from the things that matter least. The mealtime episode of the Savior in the home of Mary and Martha is an example. Anxious, impatient Martha focused on getting food on the table while Mary wisely chose "the good part"--companionship and conversation instead of calories--a good choice, the Savior said, which would not be taken from her.<br><br>In our approach to life, patience also helps us to realize that while we may be ready to move on, having had enough of a particular learning experience, our continued presence is often needed as a part of the learning environment of others. Patience is thus closely connected with two other central attributes of Christianity--love and humility. Paul said to the saints at Thessalonica, "Be patient toward all men"--clearly a part of keeping the second great commandment (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/1-thes/5.14?lang=eng#p13">1 Thessalonians 5:14</a>).<br><br>The patient person assumes that what others have to say is worth listening to. A patient person is not so chronically eager to put forth his or her own ideas. In true humility, we do some waiting upon others. We value them for what they say and what they have to contribute. Patience and humility are special friends.<br><br>Since our competition in life, as Elder Boyd K. Packer has perceptively said, is solely with our old self, we ought to be free, you and I, as members of the Church, from the jealousies and anxieties of the world which go with interpersonal competition. Very importantly, it is patience, when combined with love, which permits us "in process of time" to detoxify our disappointments. Patience and love take the radioactivity out of our resentments. These are neither small nor occasional needs in most of our lives.<br><br>Further, the patient person can better understand how there are circumstances when, if our hearts are set too much upon the things of this world, they must be broken--but for our sakes, and not merely as a demonstration of divine power. But it takes real patience in such circumstances to wait for the later vindication of our trust in the Lord.<br><br>Therefore, if we use the process of time well, it can cradle us as we develop patient humility. Keats tenderly observed: "Time, that aged nurse, /Rock'd me to patience" (John Bartlett,<i>Familiar Quotations</i>, 14th ed. [Boston: Little, Brown and Company, 1968], p. 580). Clearly, patience so cradles us when we are in the midst of suffering. Paul, who suffered much, observed in his epistle to the Hebrews: "Now no chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous, but grievous: nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/heb/12.11?lang=eng#p10">Hebrews 12:11</a>).<br><br>Patience permits us to cling to our faith in the Lord when we are tossed about by suffering as if by surf. When the undertow grasps us, we will realize that even as we tumble we are somehow being carried forward; we are actually being helped even as we cry for help.<br><br>One of the functions of the tribulations of the righteous is that "tribulation worketh patience" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/rom/5.3?lang=eng#p2">Romans 5:3</a>). What a vital attribute patience is if tribulation is worth enduring to bring about its development! Patience in turn brings about the needed experience, as noted in the stunning insight the Lord gave to the Prophet Joseph Smith: "All these things shall give thee experience, and shall be for thy good" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/122.7?lang=eng#p6">D&amp;amp;C 122:7</a>). Perhaps one can be forgiven if, in response to this sobering insight, his soul shivers just a bit. James also stressed the importance of patience when our faith is being tried, because those grueling experiences "[work] patience," and said, in what was almost a sigh of the soul, "Let patience have her perfect work . . ." (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/james/1.3-4?lang=eng#p2">James 1:3-4</a>).<br><br>To Joseph Smith, the Lord described patience as having a special finishing and concluding quality, for "These things remain to overcome through patience, that such may receive a more exceeding and eternal weight of glory" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/63.66?lang=eng#p65">D&amp;amp;C 63:66</a>). A patient disciple, for instance, will not be surprised nor undone when the Church is misrepresented. Peter, being toughminded as well as tender, made the test of our patience even more precise and demanding when he said, "For what glory is it, if, when ye be buffeted for your faults, ye shall take it patiently? but if, when ye do well, and suffer for it, ye take it patiently, this is acceptable with God" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/1-pet/2.20?lang=eng#p19">1 Peter 2:20</a>). The dues of discipleship are high indeed, and how much we can take so often determines how much we can then give. I believe it was George MacDonald who observed that, in the process of life, we are not always the already-tempered and helpful hammer which is shaping and pounding another. Sometimes we are merely the anvil.<br><br>Thus, as already indicated, patience is a vital mortal virtue in relation to our faith, our free agency, our attitude toward life, our humility, and our suffering. Moreover, patience will not be an obsolete attribute in the next world.<br><br>My brothers and sisters, the longer I examine the gospel of Jesus Christ, the more I understand that the Lord's commitment to free agency is very deep--indeed, much deeper than is our own. The more I live, the more I also sense how exquisite is His perfect love of us. It is, in fact, the very interplay of God's everlasting commitment to free agency and His everlasting and perfect love for us which inevitably places a high premium upon the virtue of patience. There is simply no other way for true growth to occur.<br><br>God's attributes of omniscience and omnipotence no doubt made the plan of salvation feasible. But it was His perfect love which made the plan inevitable. And it is His perfect patience which makes it sustainable. Do we not, again and again, get breathtaking glimpses of God's perfect patience in the execution of the plan of salvation, concerning which He has said that his "course is one eternal round" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/3.2?lang=eng#p1">D&amp;amp;C 3:2</a>)?<br><br>Thus it is that patience is to human nature what photosynthesis is to nature. Photosynthesis, the most important single chemical reaction we know, brings together water, light, chlorophyll, and carbon dioxide, processing annually the hundreds of trillions of tons of carbon dioxide and converting them to oxygen as part of the process of making food and fuel. The marvelous process of photosynthesis is crucial to life on this planet, and it is a very constant and patient process. So, too, is an individual's spiritual growth. Neither patience nor photosynthesis are conspicuous processes.<br><br>Patience is always involved in the spiritual chemistry of the soul, not only when we try to turn the trials and tribulations--the carbon dioxide, as it were--into joy and growth, but also when we use it to build upon the seemingly ordinary experiences to bring about happy and spiritual outcomes.<br><br>Patience is, therefore, clearly not fatalistic, shoulder-shrugging resignation. It is the acceptance of a divine rhythm to life; it is obedience prolonged. Patience stoutly resists pulling up the daisies to see how the roots are doing. Patience is never condescending or exclusive--it is never glad when others are left out. Patience never preens itself; it prefers keeping the window of the soul open.<br><br>I have struggled to find adequate words to express these concluding feelings and these thoughts about our need to be patient with ourselves and with our circumstances in this second estate.<br><br>Some of us have been momentarily wrenched by the sound of a train whistle spilling into the night air, and we have been inexplicably subdued by the mix of feelings that this evokes. Or perhaps we have been beckoned by a lighted cottage across a snow-covered meadow at dusk. Or we have heard the warm and drawing laughter of children at a nearby playground. Or we have been tugged at by the strains of congregational singing from a nearby church. Or we have encountered a particular fragrance which has awakened memories deep within us of things which once were. In such moments, we have felt a deep yearning, as if we were temporarily outside of something to which we actually belonged and of which we so much wanted again to be a part.<br><br>There are spiritual equivalents of these moments. Such seem to occur most often when time touches eternity. In these moments we feel a longing closeness--but we are still separate. The partition which produces this paradox is something we call the veil--a partition the presence of which requires our patience. We define the veil as the border between mortality and eternity; it is also a film of forgetting which covers the memories of earlier experiences. This forgetfulness will be lifted one day, and on that day we will see forever--rather than "through a glass, darkly" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/1-cor/13.12?lang=eng#p11">1 Corinthians 13:12</a>).<br><br>There are poignant and frequent reminders of the veil, adding to our sense of being close but still outside. In our deepest prayers, when the agency of man encounters the omniscience of God, we sometimes sense, if only momentarily, how very provincial our petitions are; we perceive that there are more good answers than we have good questions; and we realize that we have been taught more than we can tell, for the language used is not that which the tongue can transmit.<br><br>We experience this same close separateness when a baby is born, but also as we wait with those who are dying--for then we brush against the veil, as goodbyes and greetings are said almost within earshot of each other. In such moments, this resonance with realities on the other side of the veil is so obvious that it can be explained in only one way!<br><br>No wonder the Savior said that His doctrines would be recognized by His sheep, that we would know His voice, that we would follow Him (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/john/10.14?lang=eng#p13">John 10:14</a>). We do not, therefore, follow strangers. Deep within us, His doctrines do strike the promised chord of familiarity and underscore our true identity. Our sense of belonging grows in spite of our sense of separateness; for His teachings stir our souls, awakening feelings within us which have somehow survived underneath the encrusting experiences of mortality.<br><br>This inner serenity which the believer knows as he brushes against the veil is cousin to certitude. The peace it brings surpasses our understanding and certainly our capacity to explain. But it requires a patience which stands in stark contrast to the restlessness of the world in which, said Isaiah, the wicked are like the pounding and troubled sea which cannot rest (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/isa/57.20?lang=eng#p19">Isaiah 57:20</a>).<br><br>But mercifully the veil is there. It is fixed by the wisdom of God for our good. It is no use being impatient with the Lord over that reality, for it is clearly a condition to which we agreed so long ago. Even when the veil is parted briefly, it will be on His terms, not ours. Without the veil, we would lose that precious insulation which would constantly interfere with our mortal probation and maturation. Without the veil, our brief mortal walk in a darkening world would lose its meaning--for one would scarcely carry the flashlight of faith at noonday and in the presence of the Light of the World. Without the veil, we could not experience the gospel of work and the sweat of our brow. If we had the security of having already entered into God's rest, certain things would be unneeded; Adam and Eve did not clutch social security cards in the Garden of Eden.<br><br>And how could we learn about obedience if we were shielded from the consequences of our disobedience? And how could we learn patience under pressure if we did not experience pressure and waiting? Nor could we choose for ourselves if we were already in His holy presence, for some alternatives do not there exist. Besides, God's Court is filled with those who have patiently overcome--whose company we do not yet deserve.<br><br>Fortunately, the veil keeps the first, second, and third estates separate--hence our sense of separateness. The veil avoids having things "compound in one" to our everlasting detriment (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/2.11?lang=eng#p10">2 Nephi 2:11</a>). We are cocooned, as it were, in order that we might truly choose. Once, long ago, we chose to come to this very setting where we could choose. It was an irrevocable choice. And the veil is the guarantor that our ancient choice will be honored.<br><br>When the veil which encloses us is no more, time will also be no more (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/84.100?lang=eng#p99">D&amp;amp;C 84:100</a>). Even now, time is clearly not our natural dimension. Thus it is that we are never really at home in time. Alternately, we find ourselves impatiently wishing to hasten the passage of time or to hold back the dawn. We can do neither, of course. Whereas the bird is at home in the air, we are clearly not at home in time--because we belong to eternity. Time, as much as any one thing, whispers to us that we are strangers here. If time were natural to us, why is it that we have so many clocks and wear wristwatches?<br><br>Thus the veil stands--not to shut us out forever, but to remind us of God's tutoring and patient love for us. Any brush against the veil produces a feeling of "not yet," but also faint whispers of anticipation of that moment when, in the words of today's choral hymn, "Come, Let Us Anew," those who have prevailed "by the patience and hope and the labor of love" will hear the glorious words," 'Well and faithfully done; / Enter into my joy and sit down on my throne' " (<i>Hymns</i>, number 17).<br><br>May each of us live for that special moment patiently and righteously, I pray in the name of Him who is so patient with me as I strive to be an "especial witness" for him in all the world, even Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Neal A.

<h1> A Law of Peace and Security - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
My wonderful young friends, I express my love for each and every one of you. I express my love for the Lord, and I begin by bearing my personal witness that I know the work is true. I believe implicitly in the law of tithing, and I am grateful that you and I have had the privilege of reviewing again this tremendous film produced by Brigham Young University. It has been a blessing to all the Church for many years, and now it is being recycled in order that the people might once again have their faith renewed in this tremendous principle of tithing.<br><br>As this film was being produced in St. George, Sister Simpson and I had the privilege of being there, as I was a member of the Presiding Bishopric at the time; and I shall never forget that moment when Brother Uri, playing the part of Lorenzo Snow, came into the tabernacle and all the people, dressed in the appropriate attire of 1899, stood to sing "We Thank Thee, O God, for a Prophet." We shed tears along with everyone else, as though we were reliving that moment of 1899. What a glorious experience it was! We knew at that very moment that this film was being made by the Lord, and that this film was being produced to teach the Saints all over the world about this great and basic principle.<br><br>Brother Robert Stum, who was the cameraman on that project and who has since been responsible for filming many dozens of films, told us what happened as he stood at the side of the rail line to film that very precious shot of the old vintage train coming around the bend. They could not afford to hire the train for more than a couple of hours, so every shot had to be just right. And, he said, as it came around the corner he was so filled with emotion that tears filled his eyes and he could not see a thing through the camera sight. He thought that the whole thing was ruined; but the Lord was there and helping him, and when they developed the film it was exactly as it should have been, even though he could not see because of the tears that filled his eyes on that occasion.<br><br>And now, my wonderful young people, I hope that you have been able to catch the vision of what happened in this latter day. I hope that you have been able to catch the vision of how the Lord speaks through his servants. I hope that you have been able to catch the vision of this great law of tithing. The great promise given to these people in St. George was fulfilled: the promise was made that the rains would come, and the rains did come. One thing that was very significant to me was the fact that the rains did not come the next day nor the next week. Do you know that it was nearly eleven weeks before that rain came? President Spencer W. Kimball has authored a wonderful book entitled<i>Faith Precedes the Miracle.</i>These people had to demonstrate their faith; and then, almost at the hour of despair, the Lord blessed them and their souls were sanctified. So it will be with each of us who obeys the commandments of our Heavenly Father.<br><br>What a blessing it is to know that this great principle is benefiting people all over the world! And as you and I pay our tithing here in the center stakes of Zion, we have a great building program going on in these developing areas of the Church. Did you know that this year there will be some eight hundred projects completed and dedicated all over this world? Did you know that, in addition to these eight hundred projects, another seven hundred projects are in readiness for next year? And did you know that another six hundred and fifty projects are in the long-range development stage for two years from now? This work will not cease.<br><br>And when these wonderful people in faraway places dedicate their meetinghouses, which are paid in full, did you know that eighty percent of that fee has come from the general tithing funds of the Church? Are you not grateful to know that your tithing has helped to build a building in South Africa, in Germany, in Australia, in New Zealand? Are you not grateful that by this great cooperative effort the Church can go forward and people can be blessed in every land?<br><br>I am grateful to my Heavenly Father that this Church is free of debt. I am grateful that, with all the buildings and all the lands that we have to bless our people, not one piece of property has a mortgage on it. Every piece of property is paid in full because we are a tithe-paying people and because the Lord has blessed us and because we have caught the vision of what a prophet of God has instructed us to do.<br><br>The law of the tithe is this: that "one-tenth of all their interest [shall be paid] annually"--one-tenth of all their interest. I have always been intrigued by the verbage used by the Lord. He goes on to say that "this shall be a standing law unto [my people] forever" in order to "sanctify the land of Zion unto me" (D&amp;amp;C 119:4, 6). Is it not good to know that this nation will be blessed as you and I pay our tithing? For indeed, the land of Zion will be sanctified unto the Lord as his faithful people pay their tithing. I am so grateful for the quotation found in the 132nd section of the Doctrine and Covenants. Let me read the fifth and sixth verses:<br><br><i>For all who will have a blessing at my hands shall abide the law which was appointed for that blessing, and the conditions thereof, as were instituted from before the foundation of the world.</i><br><br><i>And as pertaining to the new and everlasting covenant, it was instituted for the fulness of my glory; and he that receiveth a fulness thereof must and shall abide the law, or he shall be damned, saith the Lord God.</i><br><br>For every law there is a blessing. I am grateful to my Heavenly Father that he has a perfect plan by which we might be blessed.<br><br>Several years ago a great film called<i>The Ten Commandments</i>was made; its producer was Cecil B. DeMille. He is not with us any longer, but he was a great soul; and this is what he had to say on one occasion concerning the ten commandments and the laws of our Heavenly Father: "We are too inclined to think of law as something merely restrictive, something hemming us in. We sometimes think of law as the opposite of liberty, but this is a false conception. God does not contradict himself; he did not create man and then, as an afterthought, impose upon him arbitrary, irritating, restrictive rules. He made man free, and then gave him commandments to keep him free. We cannot break the ten commandments; we can only break ourselves against them, or else by keeping them rise through them to the fulness of freedom under God. God means us to be free. With divine daring, he gave us the power of choice" (Prologue to movie,<i>The Ten Commandments</i>).<br><br>Are you not grateful, my wonderful young people, that we will reap a blessing for every law that Heavenly Father gives us? Are you not grateful that laws are given to keep us free; that we might be able to have bodies that are unrestricted as we keep the Word of Wisdom; that we might have peace of mind; that we might be able to bless our fellowmen as we pay our tithing and help the kingdom of God to grow and progress; and, probably most important of all, that the windows of heaven might be opened and a blessing poured out upon us so great that there shall not be room enough to receive it?<br><br>Nephi, as he was writing the third book of Nephi during the time of the Savior's visit to this continent, states that the Lord inquired of him whether certain things had been recorded, things that had been taught by Samuel the Lamanite and other great prophets. Nephi, it says, remembered that these things had not been written, and Jesus then commanded that they should be written. Those revelations that were commanded to be written at that time were from Malachi and included the great quotation that we heard in the film:<br><br><i>Will a man rob God? Yet ye have robbed me. But ye said: Wherein have we robbed thee? In tithes and offerings. . . .</i><br><br><i>Bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse, that there may be meat in my house; and prove me now herewith, saith the Lord of Hosts, if I will not open you the windows of heaven, and pour you out a blessing that there shall not be room enough to receive it. . . .</i><br><br>[Then a little further down he says,]<i>And they shall be mine, saith the Lord of Hosts, in that day when I make up my jewels. . . .</i>[3 Nephi 24:9–10, 17]<br><br>Would you not like to be included in that day when the Lord makes up his jewels? I would like to be included. I would like to be there and hear him say in the most pleasant voice I have every heard, "Well done, thou good and faithful servant; enter thou into my presence."<br><br>And so, my wonderful young people, what is meant by one-tenth of our interest annually? Sometimes we put a little money in the bank, and we earn interest; sometimes we invest our muscle power in a job and we get a little wage for it, the same as the interest that our money earns for us in the bank; sometimes a professional person will invest knowledge and skill, and for that he gets a salary; and a farmer will invest in seed and soil and water and tender care of his crops, and from that comes a profit at the end of the season. I would like to suggest to you that tithing is to be paid on that interest from the bank; it is to be paid on that wage; it is to be paid on that salary. I would like to suggest to you that we do not have the right to alter the word of the Lord. Some people say, "Well, after I pay a few of my bills, then I'll pay my tithing on what's left." but that is not what the First Presidency has directed. The First Presidency has directed that we should do exactly as we are instructed in section 119 of the Doctrine and Covenants: we should pay one-tenth of our interest annually.<br><br>Some people try to reason, "Well, how about my taxes? I never see my taxes; they are an automatic deduction; therefore I should not pay tithing on that part which includes my taxes that I never see."<br><br>My answer to that person would be this: "We have made arrangements for those taxes to be deducted from our paycheck; and just because our employer is good enough to pay some of our bills for us, why should we penalize the Lord?" Not only that, but I reason in my mind that when I pay income taxes to live in these United States of America--when I help to pay for the space program, and all of the other national programs, and when I help to pay for the national highways that I drive on and all the other benefits--I am paying rent for living in America. Just because I pay rent for the convenience of living in America and enjoying all that it affords me, why should I choose to penalize the Lord for it? I do not have the right.<br><br>I am grateful for the law of tithing. When I was in the Presiding Bishopric, Bishop Vandenberg received a letter from a minister of another faith. He was intrigued with the law of tithing in our church, and he wanted some information, some literature, and all that we could tell him. So we sent a letter back, and a few weeks later came the answer: gratitude and thanks for the letter, the information, and all that we had told him about tithing, then: "We're going to start it in our church next week, but unfortunately we can't go all the way yet. We are going to start with five percent tithing." I would like to suggest to you that there is no such thing as a five percent tithing, because the word itself means ten percent. And that is the way it should be. The Lord is the greatest paymaster in all this world, and any man who will put his faith in God and pay his tithing will receive the blessings of heaven just as surely as you and I meet in this auditorium here tonight. I am grateful to be on the Lord's team. He is the greatest paymaster of all time.<br><br>As I mentioned to some of you a few months ago just by example, President Kimball has been the prophet for nearly six years--I think it will be six years at the end of this month. During those six years we have increased our missions in the world from one hundred and eight up to one hundred and seventy-five--a sixty percent increase. We have increased the number of our missionaries worldwide from seventeen thousand to twenty-nine thousand--a sixty-five percent increase in the number of missionaries. Also, we have increased the efficiency of our missionary work because our missionaries are doing a better job with the discussions, and because they are being trained better in the Missionary Training Center, and because we are just doing a better job worldwide. The average missionary five years ago was realizing nine baptisms during a two-year mission; today that same missionary is baptizing fourteen during his two-year mission, and that is a forty-five percent increase in the effectiveness of the missionary force. So while we as a Church are bobbing along with a sixty percent increase and a sixty-five percent increase and a fifty-five percent increase and feeling very wonderful about it all, we depend on the Lord for the convert baptisms. And he gives us a dividend on the bottom line: an increase from seventy-seven thousand convert baptisms five years ago to what looks to be in the vicinity of two hundred thousand this year, probably at the end of this month. This means a one hundred and fifty-six percent increase--the Lord gives us not fifty-five percent or sixty percent, but a dividend of one hundred and fifty-six percent increase on the bottom line number of baptisms. And I would like to suggest to you that if you pay your tithing the dividend will be in somewhat the same ratio. It is wonderful! You cannot get out of the Lord's debt. It is impossible to do so.<br><br>A high-ranking member of the Communist Party from Moscow made this observation during a week-long visit here to observe the Church in action: "You Mormons are unique because of your ability to be dedicated to a cause and also your willingness to sacrifice." I assume that he had come all the way from Russia just to find out what makes us tick, and why we excel in these two things. He went on to suggest that these two traits were important to any major movement and that hopefully his visit here would help him to gain some insight that he might share with his comrades in the Soviet Union. Unfortunately, he was unable to accept the one factor that makes this kind of dedication possible--an implicit belief in a supreme being and an understanding of God's eternal plan for his children.<br><br>Are you not grateful, my young people, that we have the truth? Are you not grateful that we have the plan? Are you not grateful that Heavenly Father has foreordained you and me, and that we are privileged to live in this time of the world's history when all these great things are happening, and that you and I can participate in these great laws of eternity? Someone once observed, "It doesn't take money to pay tithing; it takes faith." I bear testimony to you that this is true. There are many wealthy individuals in the Church who choose not to pay their tithing, and you and I both know many widows in the Church who have minimal incomes but who insist on keeping their account with the Lord current each month. They do it without fail; they do it without complaint; they have a strong testimony that Heavenly Father has given a commandment, and their main desire is to abide the law and reap its attendant blessings. I certainly feel better when I go to the marketplace with nine dollars in my hand and the help of the Lord than I would if I went to the marketplace with ten dollars on my own. I think that I do much better with that nine dollars and the help of the Lord than I would with ten dollars on my own.<br><br>Just last year we completed our fundraising drive for the great Jordan River Temple. Do you know that the wonderful Saints of Utah Valley and a few other areas in Wyoming and the Midwest were able to donate eighteen million dollars, so that a new temple might be built? And did you know that a ward right in the middle of the Salt Lake Valley, composed almost totally of widows, was the first to meet its quota? In fact, it did not only meet the quote but nearly doubled it. This one ward of widows reported to the stake president, just weeks after the campaign had started, with one hundred thousand dollars for the new temple--this from one ward primarily made up of widows.<br><br>Do you know that over in East Germany, behind the Iron Curtain, we have nearly five thousand Saints? These Saints believe in the law of the tithe, but their tithing cannot come into the general tithing funds of the Church; it has to stay in East Germany. So our Church leaders there put it in the bank; we have an arrangement so that it can be banked. Ordinarily people are stimulated when they know their money is being used to send out missionaries and to build buildings, but here the money must simply remain in the bank until something changes. But month after month, without fail, these Saints of East Germany pay their tithing--not because the money is going anyplace, but because they want to fulfill a commandment of the living God, and they want to reap the blessings and have the windows of heaven opened that the blessing might be theirs.<br><br>Let me tell you briefly about a wonderful brother down in New Zealand by the name of Hoko Whitu. Hoko Whitu no longer lives; but many years ago he lived out on the seacoast well off the beaten track in New Zealand--so far off the beaten track that the missionaries were only able to visit perhaps two or three times a year. He lived in a little fishing hut. He loved to fish, and that was his livelihood and his means of earning a living. He lived alone in this little fishing hut because he was old and his children had all gone or moved to the big city. When the missionaries came on one occasion, Brother Hoko Whitu was very pleased to see them. He could not speak English but greeted them in Maori, took them in his little hut, went right over to a particular place, took out an envelope, and presented them with it. The missionaries found it bulging with money.<br><br>The elders took a letter out of the envelope; it was written in English. Brother Whitu could not read the letter, but he could recognize the Church letterhead. He recognized the signature down at the bottom as that of Matthew Cowley, his mission president. He could also read numbers, and he knew that in the middle it talked about a certain amount of money. Upon receiving the letter, he had said to himself, "My mission president needs some more money to run this mission." And he had saved that money in the envelope for the elders to take back. The elders read the letter to him, translating it into Maori:<br><br><i>Dear Brother Whitu:</i><br><br><i>This letter will serve as a receipt and an acknowledgment for all the tithing you paid last year. May the Lord bless you in it.</i><br><br>This brother was ready to pay the whole amount all over again, because he thought the Church was in trouble. That is the kind of Polynesian faith that you and I need.<br><br>My wonderful young people, may the Lord bless us. I would just like you to know that the main purpose of tithing is not to build hundreds of buildings all over this world this year. The main reason for the payment of tithing is what happens inside the individual--what happens as the soul is sanctified, what happens as the blessings of heaven unfold upon one as those windows are opened wide.<br><br>I would like to leave this thought with you: someone has observed that true worship is really not possible without sacrifice. Had you ever thought about that? I want to promise you that if you make sacrifice a part of your worship our lives will be sanctified. I want to promise you that your lives will be blessed and that the peace of heaven will be yours, even that peace spoken of by the Savior when he said, "Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, give I unto you" (John 14:27). Security will also be yours; and if there are two things that this world wants today, they are peace and security.<br><br>I promise each of you within range of my voice tonight that if you will pay an honest tithing--if you will live close to the Lord and follow this great commandment--you will have peace of mind and security in your life and you will have the blessings of heaven poured down upon you in such abundance that you shall not be able to receive them all. I so testify in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Robert L.

<h1>nt of Spirituality - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Good morning, my young brothers and sisters. It is always a humbling experience to come to this building, where great attendance is always in evidence--particularly at basketball games. You are always an inspirational sight. I think you scare opposing teams to death, which is to our advantage. But I feel strongly the spirit that emanates from this institution.<br><br>I bring with me a couple of quotes from President McKay which seems appropriate. He said to a group one time, as he arose to speak, "You are so good; you really should be a lot better than you are." And to another group he said, "You're so good that I hesitate to say anything to you, and yet still so far from perfect that I feel I must say something."<br><br>Here you are at this great University--and I like to feel that it is the Lord's university--developing your talents and your abilities. You are certainly the gifted generation. The technological advances and mechanical developments that are so commonplace today almost boggle the mind. One must be well trained to make his way in the world today; and that is what you are here to learn. You must make maximum use of your capabilities, your talents, and your opportunities just to keep pace. This you are doing, and I commend you for it.<br><br>It is great that you are acquiring an education, but in all of this getting and acquiring there is a danger that you will neglect the most important talent that you can develop on this earth. In the words of Elder Bruce R. McConkie, the greatest talent that you will develop upon this earth will be the talent of spirituality. This may come as a new idea to you. Perhaps you do not consider spirituality a talent, and yet it is precisely that. Why is it so important that this be developed? Because it will be the means of achieving everything in this life that is really worthwhile.<br><br>Another quote from President McKay expresses this thought well; he said:<br><br><i>Every noble impulse, every unselfish expression of love, every brave suffering for the right; every surrender of self to something higher than self; every loyalty to an ideal; every unselfish devotion to principle; every helpfulness to humanity; every act of self-control; every fine courage of the soul, undefeated by pretense or policy; every being, doing, and living of good for the very good's sake--that is spirituality.</i>[David O. McKay,<i>True to the Faith,</i>compiled by Llewelyn R. McKay (Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1966), p. 245]<br><br>Paul, in his letter to the Galatians, discoursed at some length on the importance of spirituality. He began with a shopping list of what spirituality is not, and he entitled the lack of spirituality "the works of the flesh." These are his words:<br><br><i>This I say then, Walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfill the lusts of the flesh.</i><br><br><i>For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh: and these are contrary the one to the other: so that ye cannot do the things that ye would. . . .</i><br><br><i>Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are these; Adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness,</i><br><br><i>Idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance</i>[or fussing and quarreling],<i>emulations</i>[meaning the unrighteous ambition to excel at all costs],<i>wrath, strife, seditions, heresies,</i><br><br><i>Envyings, murders, drunkenness, revellings</i>[which means disorderly merrymaking],<i>and such like</i>[that is not the whole list, but that is part of it]:<i>of the which I tell you before, as I have also told you in time past, that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God.</i><br><br><i>But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith,</i><br><br><i>Meekness, temperance: against such there is no law. . . .</i><br><br><i>If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit.</i><br><br><i>Let us not be desirous of vain glory, provoking one another, envying one another.</i>[Galatians 5:16–17, 19–23, 25–26]<br><br>He continues,<br><br><i>Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap.</i><br><br><i>For he that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption; but he that soweth to the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting.</i>[Galatians 6:7–8]<br><br>Life everlasting could be interpreted as eternal life, which, of course, is the greatest gift of God (see D&amp;amp;C 14:7). "The natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God:" said Paul, "for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned" (1 Corinthians 2:14).<br><br>Brother McConkie's statement takes on more sharp and pointed meaning the further we go. Obviously there is a great need for us, one and all, to develop and hold on to the talent of spirituality. How do we do it? I have listed eleven steps that we can follow. I am sure that there are more, but these will give us a beginning; and we may not finish, with the time restraint that we have, but we can stop anyplace. However, we cannot ever stop working on spirituality.<br><br>The first is prayer--"the simplest form of speech That infant lips can try" ("Prayer Is the Soul's Sincere Desire,"<i>Hymns,</i>no. 220). Man has always been commanded to pray unto the Father in the name of Jesus Christ, because this is our communication line with God. There is another, just as real as God, who tells us<i>not</i>to pray. He says things like, "It won't be necessary this time," or "There isn't time to pray this morning." Have you ever heard that? Or, "Isn't one prayer today enough?"<br><br>Nephi's words on the subject are very pointed:<br><br><i>For the evil spirit teaches not a man to pray, but teacheth him that he must not pray.</i><br><br><i>But behold, I say unto you that ye must pray always, and not faint; that ye must not perform any thing unto the Lord save in the first place ye shall pray unto the Father in the name of Christ, that he will consecrate thy performance unto thee, that thy performance may be for the welfare of thy soul.</i>[2 Nephi 32:8–9]<br><br>Enos adds the words which the Lord spoke to him, "Whatsoever thing ye shall ask in faith, believing that ye shall receive in the name of Christ, ye shall receive it" (Enos 15). The Lord seldom if ever gives before we ask. He frequently gives more than we ask or more than we expect. The old Jewish proverb seems to state the case very succinctly; it says: "Before there is a stirring above, there must be a stirring beneath."<br><br>The second principle is fasting--going without food or drink so that the senses are sharpened, the mind is alert, and humility is deepened. Awareness of our total reliance on God is a great boon to understanding and experiencing things of the Spirit. The Master fasted for forty days after his baptism. Moses fasted for forty days in the mountain before he received the commandments written by the finger of the Lord. I am not recommending forty days or five days or even two days in succession, but I am recommending twelve days a year and perhaps an additional day here and there as the Spirit directs. There is a special power that comes to the spirit through fasting. I notice how it always affects my children on fast day; as the blessing on the food is said, they really mean it!<br><br>The third factor is attendance at church. The question is asked, "Do you have to go to church to serve God? Can't you worship God on the golf course?" The answer: "Sure, you can worship God on the golf course six days a week, but on the Lord's day he indicates that he would have us pray to him and attend church." These are his words in the Doctrine and Covenants:<br><br><i>That thou mayest more fully keep thyself unspotted from the world,</i>thou shalt<i>go to the house of prayer and offer up thy sacraments upon my holy day;</i><br><br><i>For verily this is a day appointed unto you to rest from your labors, and to pay thy devotions unto the Most High;</i><br><br><i>Nevertheless thy vows shall be offered up in righteousness on all days and at all times;</i><br><br><i>But remember that on this, the Lord's day, thou shalt offer thine oblations and thy sacraments unto the Most High, confessing thy sins unto thy brethren, and before the Lord.</i><br><br><i>And on this day thou shalt do none other thing, only let thy food be prepared with singleness of heart that thy fasting may be perfect, or, in other words, that thy joy may be full.</i><br><br><i>Verily, this is fasting and prayer, or in other words, rejoicing and prayer.</i><br><br><i>And inasmuch as ye do these things with thanksgiving, with cheerful hearts and countenances, not with much laughter, for this is sin, but with a glad heart and a cheerful countenance--</i><br><br><i>Verily I say, that inasmuch as ye do this, the fulness of the earth is yours.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 59:9–16]<br><br>What a promise for those that attend church! President Kimball has also added in our own day and time something to bring us up to date when he says, "No Sunday buying."<br><br>Fourth is the payment of tithing. This is the Lord's law of financial management with success guaranteed. "Prove me now herewith, saith the Lord of hosts, if I will not open to you the windows of heaven, and pour you out a blessing, that there shall not be room enough to receive it." The Lord has never promised his faithful tithe payers that they will be independently wealthy, but he has promised them that they will have sufficient for their needs, and he also says that he "will rebuke the devourer for [their] sakes." The devourer means the devil, Lucifer, Old Scratch, or whatever name you may like. So you also receive special protection from the devil, which is a blessing of tremendous proportions. As a matter of fact, if we do not pay tithing, which is one-tenth of our annual interest--and<i>interest</i>is interpreted to mean<i>income</i>--according to the prophet Malachi we are thieves and robbers (see Malachi 3:8, 18, 11). Spirituality cannot flourish in a dishonest atmosphere.<br><br>The fifth factor for increasing spirituality is obedience to the Word of Wisdom--abstinence from alcohol, tobacco, tea, coffee, and drugs. We do not know all the reasons why we have the Word of Wisdom; certainly there are evil deigns which do and will exist in the hearts of conspiring men in the last days. Television is replete with these enticements; it makes them look awfully good. No doubt we would be deceived if it were not for what the Lord has told us.<br><br>President McKay made a statement on the Word of Wisdom that I think is very important. He defined the qualities that made the Lord Jesus Christ the perfect man as truth, justice, wisdom, benevolence, and self-control; and then he said this about self-control:<br><br><i>One of the most practical teachings of the Church regarding this principle is the Word of Wisdom. . . . Daily practice in keeping this commandment will do more in the development of true moral manhood than anything else I know. It is true. It deals principally with the appetite; but you show me a man who has complete control over his appetite, who can resist all temptations to indulge in</i>[stimulants, liquor, tobacco, marijuana, and other vicious drugs]<i>and I will show you a man who has likewise developed power to control his passions and desires.</i>[David O. McKay,<i>Treasures of Life,</i>compiled by Clare Middlemiss (Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Company, 1965), p. 457]<br><br>A person who indulges his appetite either secretly or otherwise has a manhood or womanhood that will not serve him when he is tempted to indulge his passions. That is an interesting statement, and it is true. Judging from the interviews I have conducted over the past eleven years with people who have violated the laws of chastity, I believe that there is a strong connection between abstinence from alcohol, tobacco, tea, coffee, and drugs and the ability to control passions and desires.<br><br>The sixth point is study of the scriptures. No one will ever by truly spiritual who does not understand or is not conversant with the scriptures. "All scripture is given by inspiration of God," said Paul to Timothy,<br><br><i>and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness:</i><br><br><i>That the man of God may be perfect, thoroughly furnished unto all good works.</i>[2 Timothy 3:16–17]<br><br>The word of the Lord is sharper than a two-edged sword (see Hebrews 4:12).<br><br>Alma found the word of God to be powerful, as is recorded: "And now, as the preaching of the word had a great tendency to lead the people to do that which was just--yea, it had had more powerful effect upon the minds of the people than the sword, or anything else, which had happened unto them--therefore Alma thought it was expedient they should try the virtue of the word of God" (Alma 31:5). We recommend the virtue of the word of God. You will be spiritually attuned as you become conversant with the word, and it should become part of your conversation. The word of the Lord will give you words to speak and thoughts to express; and as they speak, those who really have the spirit sound almost as though they were quoting scripture.<br><br>Seventh, we should use no profanity. Watch your words. "The Lord will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain" (Exodus 20:7). Paul's counsel to Timothy, recorded in the fourth chapter of 1 Timothy, verse twelve, was thus: "Be thou an example of the believers, in word, in conversation, in charity, in spirit, in faith, in purity."<br><br>King Benjamin offers a similar warning in Mosiah, the fourth chapter, verses twenty-nine and thirty, when he says that the ways to commit sin are so many and so diverse that he cannot tell us about all of them.<br><br><i>But this much</i>[he says]<i>I can tell you, that if ye do not watch yourselves, and your thoughts, and your words, and your deeds, and observe the commandments of God, and continue in the faith of what ye have heard concerning the coming of our Lord, even unto the end of your lives, ye must perish. And now, O man, remember, and perish not.</i><br><br>It is vitally important that we keep our words clean. You cannot keep the Spirit of the Lord and take his name in vain.<br><br>Factor number eight is to speak no ill. Paul's admonition to Timothy to be an example for believers in conversation is, I believe, the key to enjoying the Spirit daily. You cannot speak evil of your brother--and this is particularly true of the Lord's anointed--and still enjoy the Spirit of the Lord. Gossip turns off the Spirit every time. Of course, off-color stories and jokes are completely forbidden. You do not have to participate in these things; it is not necessary. As a matter of fact, your vocabulary increases tremendously when you use clean words. I know it does.<br><br>Point number nine is purity of thought and action, which means that pornography of all kinds is off limits--no playboy- or penthouse-type magazines, no R, X, Y, Z, or even some PG-rated movies. Pornography is everywhere. You will find your relationship with the Holy Ghost to be the tenderest relationship that you will ever enjoy. I guess that the Holy Ghost has the tenderest feelings of anyone with whom you will ever associate. If you just think the wrong thought, he is gone, and he does not come back until you clean it up. To court the Spirit, you must keep your thoughts clean.<br><br>Point number ten is simply to be sweet. No one likes a frowny face--there is a song about that, I think. Smile and the world smiles with you. In developing real spirituality you cannot be a sourpuss, because you have to be a blessing to people; they must enjoy your presence. The fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, and peace. Be happy, and you will find that it works miracles with everybody around you. And you really ought to smile even when you do not feel like it, because you become as you act. Do you sing because you are happy, or are you happy because you sing? If you are unhappy, try an experiment: start singing. I guarantee that you will not be unhappy very long. We become as we act.<br><br>Principle number eleven is sacrifice, which means that instead of endlessly doing what you want to do you must do what the Lord wants you to do. Sacrifice can mean one thing to one person and something completely different to someone else, but sacrifice is required of everyone who would have the Spirit of the Lord.<br><br>Brother Featherstone recounted an interesting story about Orson Spencer and his wife, Katherine. In the mid-1830s, the Prophet Joseph Smith sent missionaries back to Boston, Massachusetts. When they arrived, they started meeting with a man by the name of Orson Spencer; he believed and was converted. His fiancée was taught at the same time. They wanted to get married, and they both wanted to join the Church; so they went to her family to see if they could get permission. The interview did not last very long; Katherine's father told her, "If you choose to marry Orson and if you join this Church you are no longer welcome in our home. We never want to see you again. We disown you. We disinherit you." That was about the summary of the interview. As they left this interview, Katherine said, "Well, Orson, I only know one thing--I want to marry you and will do whatever you say."<br><br>So they joined the Church. They were married, and they had five children back in Massachusetts. But Katherine was a frail little girl, and I guess that having five children rather close together was really too much for her. Her health was not good. They decided that they ought to move to the west with the rest of the Saints, and so they made their way to Nauvoo, Illinois; no sooner did they arrive there than Brother Brigham gave the word that they were going to move on westward.<br><br>Brother Orson was concerned; he felt that his wife would never be able to make this kind of a trip. In desperation, he wrote back to her family and he said, in essence, "Please let Katherine come home to be nursed back to health. She has been sick; I despair for her life. I don't believe she will make it across the plains. We are going to leave soon. Please let me know." Then he added these words, "I will do anything that you ask."<br><br>The weeks passed and it became a month, and it was time to leave. They fixed a little pallet for a bed and put it in the wagon, and they began to roll westward. It was in the middle of the winter, as you know, and the going was very difficult. At night the roads froze hard as granite; but when the sun came out in the morning the roads became a quagmire, and the wheels were up to their axles in mud many times. They could only make a few yards an hour. Finally, about eighteen days out, they made an encirclement, and into the camp rode Porter Rockwell. He had picked up mail, and he distributed it around the camp. He gave Orson a letter written by Katherine's parents.<br><br>He read the letter, "Yes, we would love to have our daughter come home. We'd love to see her again, but only on the condition that she leave you and leave her newfound Church. Then we will nurse her back to health. We would love to see her again, but only on these conditions. If not, we never want to see her again. We disown her. We disinherit her, and she is not welcome in our home." Orson, feeling terrible, climbed into the wagon and gave the letter to Katherine. She read it; she had not known until then that he had written it. He said, "I told them that I would do anything. And this is their answer."<br><br>She asked, "Orson, would you hand me the Bible?" He did. She opened to a particular scripture; you will find it in Ruth, the first chapter, verse sixteen. She handed it back to Orson and said, "Would you read this, please?"<br><br>He read, "Intreat me not to leave thee, or to return from following after thee: for whither thou goest, I will go; and where thou lodgest, I will lodge: thy people shall be my people, and thy God my God."<br><br>"No, Orson," she said, "I won't leave you."<br><br>He sat by her a while. They held hands and shared a tender moment. And then he touched her pallid face as she closed her eyes, never to open them again in mortality. The next morning they held a brief service beside a shallow grave, with nothing but the lowing of cattle as music. Then Orson climbed up onto the covered wagon and prepared to roll westward. His oldest daughter came and climbed up beside him. Her name was Aurelia Spencer Rogers; she was to become the founder of the Primary.<br><br>I love Sister Aurelia Rogers for what she did. It has affected my family, and it will affect my family's family. It came as a result of sacrifice. But even more, I love Katherine, because it was her sacrifice that really made it possible. You see, sacrifice does bring forth the blessings of heaven, and I am convinced that sacrifice is absolutely necessary if one is to develop true spirituality. It may seem at the time to cost dearly, but in the end the Lord restores it all in full measure--pressed down, shaken together, and running over.<br><br>Obviously, this was not the only sacrifice that has been made to bring the gospel to where it is today. Almost every convert makes a similar sacrifice to come out of the world and up into the marvelous light of Christ; and this comes about because of the Spirit which is shed forth on those who are just and true and who keep the commandments of God. As I said a moment ago, there may be many more things that the Lord will ask you to do, but he will not ask you to do anything that you cannot do; and you will be the better for having done what he asks.<br><br>The Lord's promises are sure; they never fail. "He never doth vary from that which he hath said" (Mosiah 2:22). And he says that "eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the hearts of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him" and keep his commandments (1 Corinthians 2:9). I bear witness to you that God does live; that he hears and answers prayers; that he knows each one of us so well that he could call us by first name. I bear witness that Jesus is the Christ and that he came to break the bands of death, to show us how to live and how to walk that we might walk in the light. I bear witness that his is the only name given under heaven and among men whereby we must be saved. It is Christ or nothing.<br><br>I bear witness to you that this is God's true Church and that he has reestablished it upon earth through this great prophet, Joseph Smith. And I bear witness that we have a living prophet today--he is Spencer W. Kimball, a prophet of the living God whom the Lord is preserving to guide the Church in this day and time for our benefit. I bear this witness to you in all soberness, and leave you my love and my blessing and my fond affection and pray that you can develop the greatest talent that you will ever achieve in this life, even the talent of spirituality. I do this in Jesus' name. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Hartman Rector, Jr., was a member of the First Quorum of the Seventy of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when this devotional address was given at Brigham Young University on 11 December 1979.</i></i><br><br><i>© Intellectual Reserve, Inc.
