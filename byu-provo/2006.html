<h1>nd Understanding - Cecil O. Samuelson - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
It is wonderful with Sister Samuelson to welcome back those who were with us fall semester and also those who have been away for a season on missions, in the military, or elsewhere. We give a special welcome to those of you who are here at BYU for the first time. A very happy and productive new year to all of you!<br><br>In a number of settings over the years and reinforced now by my experiences at BYU, it has seemed to me that wisdom and understanding are much rarer traits or talents than are knowledge and impressive mental capacity. It has also become clear that wisdom and understanding are not of the same domain as knowledge and intellectual prowess. Stated another way, we see many examples of bright folks who are not very wise and others with excellent judgment and wisdom who seem to have modest intellectual gifts or limited knowledge.<br><br>A corollary observation is that while it is relatively easy for most of us to learn facts or a given body of information, it seems much more difficult to know how to use wisely that which has been learned. In fact, I have wondered if understanding and wisdom are not innate characteristics or limitations like perfect pitch or tone deafness. You have heard basketball coaches state the obvious that "you can't coach height." On the other hand, BYU professor Clayne Robison believes with good reason that almost everyone can learn to sing. Does this also hold true for acquiring wisdom? I think this is a very serious question, and I will return to it momentarily.<br><br>As I examine the work, priorities, and performance of universities, including BYU, it seems obvious that major emphasis is usually given to the acquiring of knowledge of theories, things, and facts. This constellation is what we are most successful in measuring at the Testing Center here on campus and also in our classrooms. I believe we do so with some justification because of educational tradition, but also because of doctrinal implications. Let me read some familiar Doctrine and Covenants verses that seem to support this notion:<br><br><i>And I give unto you a commandment that you shall teach one another the doctrine of the kingdom.</i><br><br><i>Teach ye diligently and my grace shall attend you, that you may be instructed more perfectly in theory, in principle, in doctrine, in the law of the gospel, in all things that pertain unto the kingdom of God, that are expedient for you to understand;</i><br><br><i>Of things both in heaven and in the earth, and under the earth; things which have been, things which are, things which must shortly come to pass; things which are at home, things which are abroad; the wars and the perplexities of the nations, and the judgments which are on the land; and a knowledge also of countries and of kingdoms.</i> [D&amp;amp;C 88:77–79]<br><br>Knowledge is essential and it is basic, but by itself it is often not very useful. Likewise, not all knowledge is of equal or lasting importance. For example, we don't have much current demand for the 2004–2005 campus phone book or last year's airline schedules.<br><br>To some, knowledge may be synonymous with wisdom, but I hope that we can also appreciate significant differences. All of us know bright people who on occasion do foolish things. I suspect that even the most knowledgeable in our circle can identify silly mistakes they have made. I know that it would take only modest effort for me personally to construct a top-10 list of the dumbest things I have said or done. As we all know, common sense often seems very uncommon!<br><br>In dictionaries, in addition to "knowledge," <i>wisdom</i> is defined as "insight, good sense, judgment, and a wise attitude or course of action." Likewise, a thesaurus adds synonyms like <i>discretion, foresight, insight, prudence, reason, sagacity,</i> and <i>sense.</i><br><br>I hope you will agree with me that wisdom is more than knowledge and that understanding is more than intellect. If this is so, can we really learn or gain wisdom or is wisdom something we are either born with or without?<br><br>Not long ago I read again about the gifts of the Spirit in section 46 of the Doctrine and Covenants. A verse struck me in a way that it never had before. In considering the various spiritual gifts given only to some, I read this: "To another is given the word of knowledge, that <i>all may be taught to be wise</i> and to have knowledge" (D&amp;amp;C 46:18; emphasis added).<br><br>From this brief verse we can learn two very important lessons:<br><br>First, that wisdom and knowledge are not necessarily the same, although knowledge seems to be necessary to be wise.<br><br>Second, that <i>all</i> may be taught to be wise. Not just some may learn to be wise, but everyone can learn wisdom because some have been given the word of knowledge so that they will be able to teach us.<br><br>It is my strongly held belief that here at Brigham Young University we are surrounded by those who have the gift of the word of knowledge, and, therefore, each of us can learn wisdom if we do our parts. Just as Professor Robison demonstrates with singing, so might we demonstrate with wisdom if we are willing to pay the price. I am also convinced that the acquisition of wisdom is central to our BYU opportunities and responsibilities.<br><br>As there is a doctrinal basis for our quest for knowledge, so is there a doctrinal foundation underlying our search for wisdom that reaches to the very beginnings of the Restoration and long before that. Think of Joseph Smith's earliest experiences. In his youth he witnessed what he described as "an unusual excitement on the subject of religion" (JS--H 1:5). He was interested and concerned, but felt the "great confusion" he observed in others (JS--H 1:6). Some of his family joined one denomination while he felt an inclination to another. He reported that his "mind was called up to serious reflection and great uneasiness" and his "feelings were deep and often poignant," but he was unable "to come to any certain conclusion who was right and who was wrong" (JS--H 1:8). Let me now share Joseph's words with which we are so familiar:<br><br><i>While I was laboring under the extreme difficulties caused by the contests of these parties of religionists, I was one day reading the Epistle of James, first chapter and fifth verse, which reads:</i> If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him. [JS--H 1:11; emphasis in original]<br><br>You know the rest of the story. Young Joseph Smith lacked wisdom, and he did what he needed to do to acquire wisdom.<br><br>Given its importance, how should we go about gaining wisdom? I believe the pattern is fundamentally the same, although we now have many helps and resources not available to Joseph. We must ask of God. Do we need to do more than ask? If so, what do we need to do and how do we go about doing it?<br><br>In the same wonderful section of the Doctrine and Covenants from which I read earlier that provides part of the doctrinal support for our pursuit of knowledge, the Lord said, "Seek ye out of the best books words of wisdom; seek learning, even by study and also by faith" (D&amp;amp;C 88:118). We understand that both study and faith are necessary and that neither is entirely successful when employed alone in our search for wisdom.<br><br>Sometimes the wisdom of God comes directly, as with the experience of young Joseph Smith in the Sacred Grove or as with the teaching of the Holy Ghost that can come to us when we are spiritually prepared. Sometimes wisdom comes in less direct but unmistakable ways. Listen to these words of President Gordon B. Hinckley:<br><br><i>God has not left us in ignorance to walk in darkness. His word, spoken both anciently and in our generation, is available to all to read, to ponder, and to accept. There are many books among us and many preachers, and I find virtue in the words of all. But the truest source of divine wisdom is the word of the Lord in these sacred volumes, the standard works of the Church.</i> ["Five Million Members--A Milestone and Not a Summit," <i>Ensign,</i> May 1982, 45]<br><br>Brigham Young once said:<br><br><i>There is no ingenious mind that has ever invented anything beneficial to the human family but what he obtained it from that One Source, whether he knows or believes it or not. There is only one source from whence men obtain wisdom, and that is God, the fountain of all wisdom; and though men may claim to make their discoveries by their own wisdom, by meditation and reflection, they are indebted to our Father in heaven for all.</i> [<i>JD</i> 13:148]<br><br>The book of Proverbs gives some wonderful insights and instruction on wisdom--many almost in shorthand. Let me share a few:<br><br><i>The fear</i> [meaning reverence] <i>of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge: but fools despise wisdom and instruction</i>. [Proverbs 1:7]<br><br><i>Incline thine ear unto wisdom, and apply thine heart to understanding.</i> [Proverbs 2:2]<br><br><i>For the Lord giveth wisdom: out of his mouth cometh knowledge and understanding.</i> [Proverbs 2:6]<br><br><i>Happy is the man that findeth wisdom, and the man that getteth understanding.</i> [Proverbs 3:13]<br><br><i>Wisdom is the principal thing; therefore get wisdom: and with all thy getting get understanding.</i> [Proverbs 4:7]<br><br><i>For wisdom is better than rubies; and all the things that may be desired are not to be compared to it.</i> [Proverbs 8:11]<br><br>There is so little we know from the current canon of scripture about the events of the Messiah's life between the time of His birth and the beginning of His mortal ministry. That which we do know about the boy Jesus is especially precious. Let me share just two verses germane to our discussion today:<br><br><i>And the child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, filled with wisdom: and the grace of God was upon him. . . .</i><br><br><i>And Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favour with God and man.</i> [Luke 2:40, 52]<br><br>I take comfort that even the perfect Savior of the World apparently learned and gained wisdom "line upon line, precept upon precept" (2 Nephi 28:30; D&amp;amp;C 98:12; see also D&amp;amp;C 93:12–14). Hence we should not be impatient even as we are "anxiously engaged" (D&amp;amp;C 58:27) in the intense and sometimes trying process of gaining knowledge and acquiring wisdom.<br><br>Listen to the words of Alma as he taught his son Helaman: "O, remember, my son, and learn wisdom in thy youth; yea, learn in thy youth to keep the commandments of God" (Alma 37:35). It is very wise for us to appreciate the relationship between obedience and wisdom.<br><br>Likewise, consider these words of Alma to another son, Shiblon: "And now, my son, I have told you this that ye may learn wisdom, that ye may learn of me that there is no other way or means whereby man can be saved, only in and through Christ" (Alma 38:9).<br><br>Alma was no less forthright and instructive when he spoke to the Zoramites who were feeling a little sorry for themselves. I suspect that on occasion even we, in our relatively comfortable circumstances, may feel a little oppressed or underappreciated. If that is the case, this counsel may apply equally to us:<br><br><i>I say unto you, it is well that ye are cast out of your synagogues, that ye may be humble, and that ye may learn wisdom; for it is necessary that ye should learn wisdom; for it is because that ye are cast out, that ye are despised of your brethren because of your exceeding poverty, that ye are brought to a lowliness of heart; for ye are necessarily brought to be humble.</i> [Alma 32:12]<br><br>For those of you who are impatient that you have not yet reached perfection in your quest for wisdom, keep striving--but also keep King Benjamin's advice in mind:<br><br><i>And see that all these things are done in wisdom and order; for it is not requisite that a man</i> [or woman] <i>should run faster than he</i> [or she] <i>has strength. And again, it is expedient that he</i> [or she] <i>should be diligent, that thereby he</i> [or she] <i>might win the prize; therefore, all things must be done in order.</i> [Mosiah 4:27]<br><br>This principle was true more than 2,100 years ago, and it is true today:<br><br><i>For behold, thus saith the Lord God: I will give unto the children of men line upon line, precept upon precept, here a little and there a little; and blessed are those who hearken unto my precepts, and lend an ear unto my counsel, for they shall learn wisdom; for unto him that receiveth I will give more; and from them that shall say, We have enough, from them shall be taken away even that which they have.</i> [2 Nephi 28:30]<br><br>For those of us in the BYU community who have the great blessing and privilege of learning in such a superb environment, we must be very careful that we do not get overly impressed by what knowledge we have acquired or by what wisdom we think we have gained. Listen to these warnings from Jacob, the brother of Nephi:<br><br><i>O that cunning plan of the evil one! O the vainness, and the frailties, and the foolishness of men! When they are learned they think they are wise, and they hearken not unto the counsel of God, for they set it aside, supposing they know of themselves, wherefore, their wisdom is foolishness and it profiteth them not. And they shall perish. . . .</i><br><br><i>And whoso knocketh, to him will he open; and the wise, and the learned, and they that are rich, who are puffed up because of their learning, and their wisdom, and their riches--yea, they are they whom he despiseth; and save they shall cast these things away, and consider themselves fools before God, and come down in the depths of humility, he will not open unto them.</i> [2 Nephi 9:28, 42]<br><br>I might add parenthetically that knowing what we don't know is a good measure of wisdom.<br><br>And, now, here is Jacob's wonderful summary statement: "O be wise; what can I say more?" (Jacob 6:12).<br><br>As you know, there are many other statements by the prophets that we might address with respect to gaining wisdom. Let me summarize from those that I have shared several considerations for us in our quests for wisdom:<br><br><b>First,</b> we must ask God in faith for the wisdom and understanding that we need.<br><br><b>Second,</b> we should study and think carefully and thoroughly to acquire the knowledge that in most cases is a necessary antecedent to wisdom.<br><br><b>Third,</b> since real wisdom always comes from heaven, we need to consider regularly, deeply, and seriously the word of God found in the scriptures.<br><br><b>Fourth,</b> we need to remember that gaining wisdom and understanding is a lifelong process and not a one-time event.<br><br><b>Fifth,</b> we must be cautious that we become and remain humble, particularly when we begin to feel that we have gained considerable knowledge from our endeavors here at BYU and when we go elsewhere.<br><br><b>Sixth,</b> we must really believe that gaining true wisdom is possible and then act accordingly.<br><br>As I conclude and share my testimony of the veracity of what I have said and of the truthfulness of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ, think of this benedictory counsel from President Gordon B. Hinckley at general conference in April 2003:<br><br><i>Pray for wisdom and understanding as you walk the difficult paths of your lives. If you are determined to do foolish and imprudent things, I think the Lord will not prevent you. But if you seek His wisdom and follow the counsel of the impressions that come to you, I am confident that you will be blessed.</i> ["Benediction," <i>Ensign,</i> May 2003, 100]<br><br>May we all take advantage of our opportunities to increase in wisdom, understanding, knowledge, and faithfulness is my prayer in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Cecil O. Samuelson was BYU president when this devotional address was delivered on 10 January 2006.</i><br><br><i>© Intellectual Reserve, Inc. All rights reserved.</i>
<h1>f-Worth: We Have &quot;A Place Within His Heart&quot; - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
It is a pleasure to welcome all of you back to Brigham Young University in 2006. It is a new year and a time for many resolutions to improve and change, but hopefully most of these are made throughout the year when needed and appropriate. For all of you 2006 is a year for realizing countless opportunities, setting goals, and anticipating accomplishments. It will present many choices and decisions for you. They are yours to grasp, make, and lead you forward--if you always remember to seek and do the Lord's will amidst the challenges and excitement of life each and every day. It is both my husband's and my wish that this year of your time here at the university will be a wonderful and successful one.<br><br>It was a little over a year ago when the devastating tsunami occurred in parts of Asia. We were all shocked and saddened by this news. Our hearts were deeply touched as we witnessed the devastation and loss of life as well the examples of compassion and goodness of people throughout the world seeking to help those who were suffering. A few days following the tragedy, I was watching a television program that was describing and discussing the tsunami and its aftermath. I can't recall the names or titles of the participants on the program; however, I vividly recall--and have never forgotten--a response to a question by the commentator given by a woman associated with and knowledgeable about the efforts being done to help the victims as well as to account for those who had lost their lives.<br><br>The interviewer put forth this question: "Can you give an estimate of how many lives have probably been lost as a result of this natural disaster?"<br><br>Her response was, "In many parts of the area where much damage was done, people are not counted in life; therefore, it is impossible to count them in death."<br><br>My first thought after a short and shocked hesitation--caused by the bluntness of her answer--was: "You are wrong. You neither are knowledgeable about nor understand the Lord's magnificent plan of salvation. If only you really knew that our Heavenly Father counts each one of these men, women, and children as His son or daughter."<br><br>We are instructed in the Doctrine and Covenants and reassured many, many times throughout the scriptures to "remember the worth of souls is great in the sight of God" (D&amp;amp;C 18:10). These souls include those who may never have had the opportunity in mortality to hear the message of our Savior, Jesus Christ, and the principles of the gospel it teaches. As I listened to that program, I was so thankful for my testimony of these principles and the knowledge that all who have lived, are living, and will yet live in this earthly realm are sons and daughters of a loving Father in Heaven.<br><br>There have been times in my life when I have been in the midst of hundreds or thousands of people: for example, at a football game in LaVell Edwards Stadium, with 65,000 people screaming and cheering; a crowded metropolis at Christmastime with people scurrying in and out of stores shopping for gifts; or a busy airport with people hurrying to catch planes headed in a multitude of directions. You have had these experiences too. Maybe you too have felt as I have at times and also pondered the thought "I am but one person among all these hundreds and thousands of people." Then the mind tries to comprehend the millions and billions who have gone before, who are here now, and who will people the earth in the future. Have you at times asked yourselves, as I have, "Am I really that important? Just how much is my worth as I lead my life?"<br><br>This soul-searching question is answered in John 3:16, where we are taught that "God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son" so we could have eternal life. We know that we are spirit children of an exalted, glorified being who is our Father in Heaven. The Lord counts us all in life as well as in death--as He does the victims of the tsunami--and because we know who we are, we know why we are here: to strive to return one day to dwell in His presence. And this is what He desires for us too.<br><br>The Lord loves each one of us. We are His own. Moses was told by the Lord that He created our world and its inhabitants and that all are His (see Moses 1:35). How blessed we are to have such knowledge. Listen to the words of a beautiful woman who gained this awareness as she struggled with her own self-worth and understanding of who she was:<br><br><i>As a convert, the hymn "God Loved Us, So He Sent His Son" was sung at the very first sacrament meeting I attended as a brand-new member of the Church. For the first 18 years of my life I struggled with my worth and with who I was and what my importance was to anyone. I had been told I was the ugliest girl in my school, and I carried that label with me for many years. As I took the missionary discussions, I learned enough of the gospel plan to know it was true and right. At my first sacrament meeting when the third verse of that hymn was sung, I knew in that moment for the first time who I really was and what my importance was. That moment changed everything for me. Nothing on the outside changed, but everything on the inside did. I was part of His plan, His offering. And I hold a place within His Heart.</i> [Personal communication]<br><br>The world in which we live today tells us that our sense of worth is based upon what is seen or accomplished. We are measured by possessions and wealth, physical appearance and dress styles, social status and achievements. Too many of us strive to gain acceptance using these standards, trying to enhance the perception of our worth by those who are part of our lives as well as those who view us from afar. If we are not careful, we can let others determine and establish our standards and feelings of self-worth. We can become someone else's image of success rather than our own.<br><br>President Harold B. Lee often quoted Harry Emerson Fosdick's description of a prayer of an old Edinburgh weaver: "O God, help me to hold a high opinion of myself" (Harry Emerson Fosdick, <i>Twelve Tests of Character</i> [New York: Association Press, 1941], 35; see Harold B. Lee, "Understanding Who We Are Brings Self-Respect," <i>Ensign,</i> January 1974, 4). In other words, the weaver prayed that he would value himself for what he was rather than for the opinions held by others. William Shakespeare also said:<br><br><i>This above all: to thine own self be true,</i><br><br><i>And it must follow, as the night the day,</i><br><br><i>Thou canst not then be false to any man.</i><br><br>[<i>Hamlet,</i> act 1, scene 3, lines 78–80]<br><br>As university students you are dealing with the worldly requirements for success every day. Therefore, if you do not constantly remind yourselves of what is of true value and worth, you can lose perspective and insight as you forge ahead into the future. Sister Patricia Holland, speaking in a Brigham Young University devotional, stated:<br><br><i>We are becoming so concerned about having perfect figures, or straight A's, or professional status . . . that we are being torn from our true selves. We often worry so much about pleasing and performing for others that we lose our own uniqueness, that full and relaxed acceptance of ourselves as a person of worth and individuality.</i> [Patricia T. Holland, "The Soul's Center" (13 January 1987), <i>BYU 1986–87 Devotional and Fireside Speeches</i> (Provo: BYU, 1987), 84]<br><br>My dear friends, I worry that we often forget that each one of us is inherently of great worth because we are children of God. It is easy to forget if we listen to the voices of the world's values that surround us. Elder Neal A. Maxwell put it best: "Some among us mistakenly see the size and response of their audiences as the sole verification of their worth" (Neal A. Maxwell, "Irony: The Crust on the Bread of Adversity," <i>Ensign,</i> May 1989, 63).<br><br>Often these audiences would lead us to have a false sense of worth. This is evident today in the media messages as well as in the examples of many around us who live in and seek notoriety. The values of virtue, chastity, modesty, integrity, faith, love, and respect, among many others, are not perceived as worthwhile by so many today. The world would judge us to be of more worth by what we have than by what is in our hearts. It would have us reject these God-given values in favor of others that could lead us away from righteousness and positive feelings of self-worth.<br><br>The Lord has warned us in the scriptures that we are seeking the things of the world rather than seeking Him when we place the greatest value on riches and the praises of men. We are told that many are not chosen by the Lord "because their hearts are set so much upon the things of this world, and [they] aspire to the honors of men" (D&amp;amp;C 121:35).<br><br>It is invaluable to each one of us that we always know and never forget that the measure of our worth is in our divine heritage. The gospel teaches us that our true worth is based upon its teachings and principles. We do not need the world to tell us whether we are successful and worthwhile or not.<br><br>The Lord does desire for us to be successful in our righteous endeavors--whether temporal or spiritual. There are many things of the world that are pleasing in His sight--such as gaining knowledge and wisdom as you study here--but one must never forget that the source of all these things is the Lord, and thus we should show Him gratitude. Showing gratitude to the Lord helps us better see our worth in His sight.<br><br>We strengthen our sense of worth by being dignified in the lives we lead and by following the teachings of our Lord, Jesus Christ. As we rely upon our Savior for guidance and His deep love for us in all we do, our feelings of personal worth will be expressed in the lives we lead, and we then bless others by our example and service.<br><br>Our eternal worth is given to us by God. We do not have to let it be determined by others--only by God and ourselves. We can lose sight of our self-worth if we do not keep the commandments and consequently disregard the divinity within us. The focus of the work of our Savior, Jesus Christ, is each one of us, as expressed in the book of Moses: "For behold, this is my work and my glory--to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man" (Moses 1:39).<br><br>In conclusion, let me recite to you from the third verse of "God Loved Us, So He Sent His Son" that reminded my friend of her true self-worth--as it should remind all of us:<br><br><i>Oh, love effulgent, love divine!</i><br><br><i>What debt of gratitude is mine,</i><br><br><i>That in his off'ring I have part</i><br><br><i>And hold a place within his heart.</i><br><br>[<i>Hymns,</i> 1985, no. 187]<br><br>It is my prayer that each of us may know of our worth to those who truly love us, especially our Heavenly Father, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Sharon G.

<h1>ency - D. Todd Christofferson - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I offer you a warm greeting on this cold January day. Two years ago, in January, President Gordon B. Hinckley spoke to the leaders of the Church around the world, both men and women. Commenting on current conditions, he said:<br><br><i>No one need tell you that we are living in a very difficult season in the history of the world. ...</i><br><br><i>... I do not know that things were worse in the times of Sodom and Gomorrah. At that season, Abraham bargained with the Lord to save these cities for the sake of the righteous. Notwithstanding his pleas, things were so bad that Jehovah decreed their destruction. They and their wicked inhabitants were annihilated. We see similar conditions today. They prevail all across the world. I think our Father must weep as He looks down upon His wayward sons and daughters.</i><br><br><i>In the Church we are working very hard to stem the tide of this evil. But it is an uphill battle, and we sometimes wonder whether we are making any headway. But we are succeeding in a substantial way. We see so many of our youth who are faithful and true and who look to us for encouragement and direction.</i><sup>1</sup><br><br>It was you President Hinckley thought of when he looked for signs that we might be succeeding as a Church in stemming the tide of evil. If, as he said, you look to us for encouragement and direction, I want to offer you some of each. I would like to talk to you about moral agency and offer some counsel about how you use your agency.<br><br>In years past, we generally used the term <i>free agency.</i> That is not incorrect, but more recently we have taken note that <i>free agency</i> does not appear as an expression in the scriptures. They talk of our being "free to choose" and "free to act" for ourselves<sup>2</sup> and of our obligation to do many things of our own "free will."<sup>3</sup> But the word <i>agency</i> appears either by itself or, in Doctrine and Covenants, section 101, verse 78, with the modifier <i>moral:</i> "That every man may act in doctrine and principle ... according to the <i>moral agency</i> which I have given unto him, that every man may be accountable for his own sins in the day of judgment" (emphasis added). When we use the term <i>moral agency,</i> then, we are appropriately emphasizing the accountability that is an essential part of the divine gift of agency. We are moral beings and agents unto ourselves, free to choose but also responsible for our choices.<br><h2><b>The Elements of Moral Agency</b></h2><br>What, then, are the elements of moral agency? To me there are three.<br><br><b>First,</b> there must be alternatives to choose among. Lehi described it as opposites, or "opposition."<sup>4</sup> He spoke of righteousness and its opposite, wickedness; holiness versus misery; good versus bad.<sup>5</sup> Without opposites, Lehi said, "All things must needs be a compound in one; ... no life neither death, nor corruption nor incorruption, happiness nor misery, neither sense nor insensibility."<sup>6</sup><br><br>He further explained that for these opposites or alternatives to exist, there must be law. Law provides us the options. It is by the operation of laws that things happen. By using or obeying a law, one can bring about a particular result--and by disobedience, the opposite result. Without law there could be no God, for He would be powerless to cause anything to happen.<sup>7</sup> Neither He nor we would be able to predict or choose a particular outcome by a given action. Our existence and the creation around us are convincing evidence that God, the Creator, exists and that our mortal world consists of "both things to act and things to be acted upon,"<sup>8</sup>--or, in other words, choices.<br><br><b>Second,</b> for us to have agency, we must not only have alternatives but we must also know that they exist and what they are. If we are unaware of the choices available, the existence of those choices is meaningless to us. Lehi called this being "enticed by the one or the other."<sup>9</sup> He recalled the situation of Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden presented with a choice, "even the forbidden fruit in opposition to the tree of life; the one being sweet and the other bitter."<sup>10</sup> Adam and Eve's choice, of course, brought about the Fall, which brought with it a knowledge of good and evil, opening to their understanding a multitude of new choices. Had they remained in Eden, "they would have remained in a state of innocence, having no joy, for they knew no misery; doing no good, for they knew no sin."<sup>11</sup> But with the Fall, both they and we gain sufficient knowledge and understanding to be enticed by good and evil--we attain a state of accountability and can recognize the alternatives before us.<br><br>The beauty of the gospel of Jesus Christ is that it pours knowledge into our souls and shows things in their true light. With that enhanced perspective, we can discern more clearly the choices before us and their consequences. We can, therefore, make more intelligent use of our agency. Too many fall into unanticipated traps and unhappiness because they either lack or ignore the gospel light. They are unaware of their options or are confused about the outcomes of their choices. Ignorance effectively limits their agency.<br><br><b>Third,</b> after the existence of choices and a knowledge of choices, is the next element of agency: the freedom to make choices.<sup>12</sup> This freedom to act for ourselves in choosing among the alternatives that the law establishes is often referred to in the scriptures as agency itself. For this freedom we are indebted to God. It is His gift to us.<sup>13</sup><br><br><i>The Lord said unto Enoch: Behold these thy brethren; they are the workmanship of mine own hands, and I gave unto them their knowledge, in the day I created them; and in the Garden of Eden, gave I unto man his agency.</i><sup>14</sup><br><br>King Benjamin reminded us that in addition to giving us the freedom to choose, God makes it possible for us to use the gift because He "is preserving you from day to day, by lending you breath, that ye may live and move and do according to your own will, and even supporting you from one moment to another."<sup>15</sup><br><br>Let us pause and note that freedom of choice is the freedom to obey or disobey existing laws--not the freedom to alter their consequences. Law, as mentioned earlier, exists as a foundational element of moral agency with fixed outcomes that do not vary according to our opinions or preferences. Elder Dallin H. Oaks observed in a devotional talk here that "we are responsible to use our agency in a world of choices. It will not do to pretend that our agency has been taken away when we are not free to exercise it without unwelcome consequences."<sup>16</sup><br><h2><b>Satan's Attack on Agency</b></h2><br>We recognize the gift of agency as a central aspect of the plan of salvation proposed by the Father in the great premortal council, and that "there was war in heaven"<sup>17</sup> to defend and preserve it. The Lord revealed this to Moses:<br><br><i>Wherefore, because that Satan rebelled against me, and sought to destroy the agency of man, which I, the Lord God, had given him, and also, that I should give unto him mine own power; by the power of mine Only Begotten, I caused that he should be cast down;</i><br><br><i>And he became Satan, yea, even the devil, the father of all lies, to deceive and to blind men, and to lead them captive at his will, even as many as would not hearken unto my voice.</i><sup>18</sup><br><br>Satan has not ceased his effort "to destroy the agency of man." He promotes conduct and choices that limit a person's freedom to choose by replacing the influence of the Holy Spirit with his own domination.<sup>19</sup> Yielding to his temptations leads to a narrower and narrower range of choices until none remain and to addictions that leave one powerless to resist. While Satan cannot actually destroy law and truth, he accomplishes the same result in the lives of those who heed him by convincing them that whatever they think is right <i>is</i> right and that there is no ultimate truth--every man is his own god, and there is no sin.<br><br>Of course Satan's ongoing opposition is a useful and even necessary part of moral agency. The scripture states:<br><br><i>It must needs be that the devil should tempt the children of men, or they could not be agents unto themselves; for if they never should have bitter they could not know the sweet.</i><sup>20</sup><br><br>Remember, though, that we retain the right and power of independent action.<sup>21</sup> God does not intend that we yield to temptation. Like Jesus, we can gain all we need in the way of a mortal experience without yielding.<br><h2><b>The Central Role of Jesus Christ</b></h2><br>We have reviewed the elements of moral agency and its divine origins, but we must always remember that agency would have no meaning without the vital contribution of Jesus Christ. His central role began with His support of the Father's plan and His willingness to become the essential Savior under that plan. The plan required a setting for its implementation, and Jesus was instrumental in the creation of this planet for that purpose. Most important, while the Fall of Adam was a critical element of the plan, the Fall would also have frustrated the plan if certain of its consequences were not mitigated by the Atonement and Resurrection of Jesus Christ.<br><br>It was necessary in God's plan for our future happiness and glory that we become morally free and responsible. For that to happen, we needed an experience apart from Him where our own choices would determine our destiny. The Fall of Adam provided the spiritual death needed to separate us from God and place us in this mortal condition as well as the physical death needed to provide an end to the mortal experience. As Alma put it:<br><br><i>And now, ye see by this that our first parents were cut off both temporally and spiritually from the presence of the Lord; and thus we see they became subjects to follow after their own will.</i><sup>22</sup><br><br>Without more, however, these deaths would have defeated the plan after having made it possible. Death had to be permitted, but it also had to be overcome or we could not return to the presence of God. Jacob, the brother of Nephi, explained it this way:<br><br><i>For as death hath passed upon all men, to fulfill the merciful plan of the great Creator, there must needs be a power of resurrection. ...</i><br><br><i>... For behold, if the flesh should rise no more our spirits must become subject to that angel who fell from before the presence of the Eternal God, and became the devil, to rise no more.</i><br><br><i>And our spirits must have become like unto him, and we become devils, angels to a devil, to be shut out from the presence of our God, and to remain with the father of lies, in misery, like unto himself. ...</i><br><br><i>O how great the goodness of our God, who prepareth a way for our escape from the grasp of this awful monster; yea, that monster, death and hell, which I call the death of the body, and also the death of the spirit.</i><sup>23</sup><br><br>Thus, if our separation from God and our physical death were permanent, moral agency would mean nothing. Yes, we would be free to make choices, but what would be the point? The end result would always be the same no matter what our actions: death with no hope of resurrection and no hope of heaven. Good or bad as we might choose to be, we would all end up, in Jacob's words, "devils, angels to a devil."<br><br>With resurrection through Jesus Christ, the Fall can achieve its essential purpose without becoming a permanent death sentence. "The grave must deliver up its captive bodies," "hell must deliver up its captive spirits," and "the paradise of God must deliver up the spirits of the righteous" so that "the spirit and the body is restored to itself again, and all men become incorruptible, and immortal, and they are living souls, having a perfect knowledge like unto us in the flesh, save it be that our knowledge shall be perfect."<sup>24</sup><br><br>But there was one more thing that Christ needed to accomplish so that moral agency could have a positive potential. Just as death would doom us and render our agency meaningless but for the redemption of Christ, even so, without His grace, our bad choices or sins would leave us forever lost. There would be no way of fully recovering from our mistakes, and, being unclean, we could never live again in the presence of the "Man of Holiness."<sup>25</sup><br><br>We cannot look to the law to save us when we have broken the law.<sup>26</sup> We need a Savior, a Mediator who can overcome the effects of our sins and errors so that they are not necessarily fatal. It is because of the Atonement of Christ that we can recover from bad choices and be justified under the law as if we had not sinned.<br><br><i>Wherefore, redemption cometh in and through the Holy Messiah; for he is full of grace and truth.</i><br><br><i>Behold he offereth himself a sacrifice for sin, to answer the ends of the law, unto all those who have a broken heart and a contrite spirit.</i><sup>27</sup><br><br>Professor C. Terry Warner stated:<br><br><i>Human agency was purchased with the price of Christ's suffering. This means that to those who blame God for allowing human suffering, Latter-day Saints can respond that suffering is less important than the gift of agency, upon which everything else depends, and that none of us has paid a greater price for this gift than Christ.</i><sup>28</sup><br><h2><b>The Savior's Exemplary Use of Moral Agency</b></h2><br>The Savior's use of moral agency during His lifetime is an instructive example for us. At one point in His teaching He revealed the principle that guided His choices: "He that sent me is with me: the Father hath not left me alone; for I do always those things that please him."<sup>29</sup> I believe that much of the Lord's power is attributable to the fact that He never wavered in that determination. He had a clear, consistent direction. Whatever the Father desired, Jesus chose to do.<br><br>John reported the following response to Jesus' statement that He did always those things that please the Father:<br><br><i>As he spake these words, many believed on him.</i><br><br><i>Then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him, If ye continue in my word, then are ye my disciples indeed;</i><br><br><i>And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.</i><sup>30</sup><br><br>So, being Jesus' obedient disciple--just as He is the Father's obedient disciple--leads to truth and freedom. Then He added, "If the Son therefore shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed."<sup>31</sup><br><br>To the secular world it seems a paradox that greater submission to God yields greater freedom. They look at things through Korihor's lens, which is that obedience to God's laws and ordinances is "bondage."<sup>32</sup> So how do obedience and truth make us free? You can easily think of some practical ways in which truth gives us the ability to do things we otherwise could not do or to avoid disasters we might otherwise suffer.<br><br>I was interested to read recently of a young British girl who learned in school about the characteristics of water along a shoreline that signal the approach of a tsunami. Two weeks later, on vacation with her family in Thailand, she observed those phenomena and insistently warned her parents and the people around her. They escaped to higher ground just in time when the December 26, 2004, tsunami hit south Asia. More than a hundred people owe their lives to that girl's knowledge of certain truths of the natural world.<sup>33</sup><br><br>But the Lord's statement that the truth will make us free has broader significance. "Truth," He tells us, "is knowledge of things as they are, and as they were, and as they are to come."<sup>34</sup> Possession of this knowledge of things past, present, and future is a critical element of God's glory: "The glory of God is intelligence, or, in other words, light and truth."<sup>35</sup> Does anyone doubt that, as a consequence of possessing all light and truth, God possesses ultimate freedom to be and to do?<br><br>Likewise, as our understanding of gospel doctrine and principles grows, our agency expands. First, we have more choices and can achieve more and receive greater blessings because we have more laws that we can obey. Think of a ladder--each new law or commandment we learn is like one more step on the ladder that enables us to climb higher. Second, with added understanding we can make more intelligent choices because we see more clearly not only the alternatives but their potential outcomes. As Professor Daniel H. Ludlow once expressed it, the extent of our agency "is in direct proportion to the number and kind of laws we know and keep."<sup>36</sup><br><br>The Lord promises that if, in the exercise of our agency, we follow His example and do always those things that please Him and the Father, then we will come to know and understand all things:<br><br><i>And if your eye be single to my glory, your whole bodies shall be filled with light, and there shall be no darkness in you; and that body which is filled with light comprehendeth all things.</i><sup>37</sup><br><br><i>That which is of God is light; and he that receiveth light, and continueth in God, receiveth more light; and that light groweth brighter and brighter until the perfect day.</i><sup>38</sup><br><br><i>He that keepeth</i> [God's] <i>commandments receiveth truth and light, until he is glorified in truth and knoweth all things.</i><sup>39</sup><br><br><i>And the Spirit giveth light to every man that cometh into the world; and the Spirit enlighteneth every man through the world, that</i> hearkeneth <i>to the voice of the Spirit.</i><br><br><i>And every one that</i> hearkeneth <i>to the voice of the Spirit cometh unto God, even the Father.</i><sup>40</sup><br><br>These are magnificent promises: to be filled with light and truth, to comprehend all things, to be glorified in truth and know all things, and to come even unto the Father. I have no doubt regarding the literal fulfillment of these promises in those who exercise their agency to choose obedience, but, along with you, I recognize that they are not realized in a day. There is much of keeping commandments--much of practice, if you will--much of experience required before we will enjoy a fulness. We should, however, be encouraged by what John said of the Savior:<br><br><i>And I, John, saw that he received not of the fulness at the first, but received grace for grace;</i><br><br><i>And he received not of the fulness at first, but continued from grace to grace, until he received a fulness.</i><sup>41</sup><br><br>So we might presume to follow in His footsteps and receive grace for grace and truth for truth until we also receive a fulness.<br><h2><b>Testing as Part of the Essential Experience</b></h2><br>A consistent effort will educate and refine our desires so that in time, just as with Jesus, our desires will become aligned with the Father's. But we should expect to be tested. The gift of agency is intended to give us experience. We "taste the bitter, that [we] may know to prize the good."<sup>42</sup> And Jesus, "though he were a Son, yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered."<sup>43</sup><br><br>We learn how to hold on the right way through adversity. Joseph Smith was told to expect some severe opposition despite making good choices. Said the Lord, "Know thou, my son, that all these things shall give thee experience, and shall be for thy good."<sup>44</sup> We are in a mortal experience because we cannot become as God without that experience. We must prove to Him and to ourselves that we can consistently make the right choices and then stick to those choices, come what may.<br><br>Some think that they should be spared from any adversity if they keep God's commandments, but it is "in the furnace of affliction"<sup>45</sup> that we are chosen.This is the battle we expected when we "shouted for joy"<sup>46</sup> at the prospect of this time on earth. I believe the challenge of learning to make and hold onto correct choices in the face of opposition appealed to us when God presented His plan, and we should approach that challenge now without fear, knowing that we can do it and that He will sustain us. Certainly the alternative would not appeal to us. As Elder James E. Talmage observed:<br><br><i>But for the opportunity thus given, the spirits of God's offspring would have remained forever in a state of innocent childhood, sinless through no effort of their own; negatively saved, not from sin, but from the opportunity of meeting sin; incapable of winning the honors of victory because prevented from taking part in the conflict.</i><sup>47</sup><br><br>The Lord's promise is not to spare us the conflict but to preserve and console us in our afflictions and to consecrate them for our gain.<sup>48</sup><br><br>Elder Donald L. Hallstrom of the Seventy offered a present-day example in an article in the January 2006 <i>Ensign,</i> where he recounted the experiences of Brother Toshio Kawada and his wife Miyuki:<br><br><i>Like all of us, Toshio Kawada of the Obihiro Ward, Sapporo Japan Stake, has had to make crucial choices when faced with life's difficulties. He joined the Church in 1972, and he and his wife, Miyuki, were sealed in the Laie Hawaii Temple in 1978. They have two sons. ...</i><br><br><i>More than 20 years ago, when his family was still very young, Brother Kawada was working for his father as a dairy farmer. Tragically, one day the large barn where they kept their milk cows and all their equipment burned down. Financially devastated, his father went to the farmers' union for a loan but was turned down. Subsequently, his father and older brother filed for bankruptcy. Although not legally responsible, Brother Kawada felt obligated to help pay back all the debts.</i><br><br><i>As Brother Kawada was pondering a solution to his problem, he decided to plant carrots. He had grown potatoes, but he did not know how to grow carrots. He planted the seeds and prayed earnestly for his carrots to grow.</i><br><br><i>All this time, Brother Kawada faithfully served in the Church, kept the Sabbath day holy, and paid his tithing. When he and his family dressed in their best clothes and went to their Sunday meetings, many neighbors scoffed at them. It was difficult to lose one day a week in their fields, especially at harvesttime. It was not always easy for them to pay their tithing, but they offered it to the Lord obediently and cheerfully.</i><br><br><i>Fall came and Brother Kawada's carrots turned out to be unusually sweet and large, with an exceptionally rich color. He had an abundant harvest and went to the farmers' union for help, but they refused to sell his carrots through their distribution system. He fasted and prayed and felt inspired to try to find a produce distributor in Tokyo--something that is very difficult to do without introductions or connections.</i><br><br><i>Brother Kawada was blessed to find a large distributor in Tokyo. Since then he has been very successful and has repaid all his father's debts. He currently has a large agricultural operation with many employees, and he is teaching young farmers how to effectively organize their businesses.</i><br><br><i>Even in exceptionally trying circumstances, Brother Kawada chose to be true to the promises he made in his baptismal, priesthood, and temple covenants.</i><sup>49</sup><br><br>Let me read you some of Brother Kawada's own words from his testimony:<br><br><i>Sometimes we worked until midnight on Saturday to keep from breaking the Sabbath. We went to church the next day, often without much sleep. Once we came home from church, and a cow had gotten caught in the pasture fence and died. There were times when we had millions of yen worth of damage to our cut hay because it had lain in the rain on the Sabbath. We knew accidents didn't happen because it was Sunday. If you worry about that kind of thing, you would never be able to keep the Sabbath. Accidents can happen anytime. ...</i><br><br><i>We planted carrots with great success. Finally we were getting some kind of order in our lives. With carrots, it didn't matter if it rained or we took every Sunday off. We could make our own decisions. We could serve more easily in any calling we were called to.</i><br><br><i>In our business, we use a lot of part-time help. When we are really busy, our employees suggest that we work Sundays. I tell them that we just don't work on Sundays. When our workers know that, they work hard and rarely take days off. On Sundays the younger workers spend the day with their children, and the older workers visit with their grandchildren.</i><sup>50</sup><br><br>I like that.<br><br>Exercising agency in a setting that sometimes includes opposition and hardship is what makes life more than a simple multiple-choice test. God is interested in what you are becoming as a result of your choices. He is not satisfied if your exercise of moral agency is simply a robotic effort at keeping some rules. Your Savior wants you to become something, not just do some things.<sup>51</sup> He is endeavoring to make you independently strong--more able to act for yourself than perhaps those of any prior generation. You must be able to be righteous, even when He withdraws His Spirit, or, as Brigham Young said, even "in the dark."<sup>52</sup><br><br>Using your agency to choose His will, and not slackening even when the going gets hard, will not make you God's puppet; it will make you like Him. God gave you agency and Jesus showed you how to use it so that eventually you could learn what They know, do what They do, and be what They are.<br><br>Remember that with His gift to you of moral agency, your Heavenly Father has graciously provided help in exercising that agency in a way that will yield precious, positive fruit in your life here and hereafter. Among other resources, you have the scriptures that contain the fulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ, mentors and parents who love you, the voice of prophets and apostles living among you, the covenants and ordinances of the priesthood and the temple, the gift of the Holy Ghost, prayer, and The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Draw upon these resources constantly to guide your choices, to do always those things that please God.<br><br>With President Hinckley, I express my confidence in you. I thank God for you. I thank God for the gift of moral agency. I thank Him for the gift of His Son, whose life and sacrifice animate that moral agency. I testify that Jesus Christ has redeemed us from the Fall, that He lives, and that through Him we "are free to choose liberty and eternal life."<sup>53</sup> In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>D.

<h1>thstanding Every Temptation of the Devil&quot; - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
You have assembled here on the Brigham Young University campus and at many other locations around the world in anticipation of hearing from Elder M. Russell Ballard of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. I am sorry to disappoint you. Elder Ballard is unable to be with you, and I am honored to have been asked to substitute for him. He wishes he were here, and I can assure you that I wish he were here as well. Again, I am honored to have been asked to substitute for him.<br><br>Exactly 50 years ago this very night, I was aboard an enormous and beautiful ocean liner approaching the docks of Southampton, England. I was about to commence my service as a missionary in the British Mission. At that time missionaries traveled to their foreign fields of labor by sea rather than by air. I do believe that Orville and Wilbur Wright had made their first flight by then, but it was still a long time ago.<br><br>I want you to know that I loved my mission. It meant so very much to me then and has continued through the years to be the symbol of so many things that are good in this life. The solidifying of my testimony was one of the greatest blessings of my mission. I had what I considered to be a strong testimony before I was called to serve, but teaching and testifying of divine truth caused that testimony to swell within my heart and soul in a way as to sustain me through any trial or challenging situation. I don't know what I would do without the gospel. I will be forever grateful for my mission, for my testimony, and for the shield of protection I have felt through my faith in the Savior. That shield of faith has been my spiritual and moral protection through the years.<br><h2><b>Faith in Jesus Christ, Our Best Defense Against Temptation</b></h2><br>That thought leads me to the central idea that I would like to leave with you tonight. In the Book of Mormon we read of Alma's counsel and instruction to his son Helaman. Among other things, he admonished Helaman to "teach [the people] an everlasting hatred against sin and iniquity." He urged him to "preach unto them repentance, and faith on the Lord Jesus Christ." And now listen to these words. Alma said, "Teach them to withstand every temptation of the devil, with their faith on the Lord Jesus Christ" (Alma 37:32–33). Do you see and sense the meaning and the power in that for you--indeed, for all of us?<br><br>Alma continued his instruction to Helaman, saying:<br><br><i>Teach them to never be weary of good works, but to be meek and lowly in heart; for such shall find rest to their souls.</i><br><br><i>O, remember, my son, and learn wisdom in thy youth; yea, learn in thy youth to keep the commandments of God. . . .</i><br><br><i>Counsel with the Lord in all thy doings, and he will direct thee for good.</i> [Alma 37:34–35, 37]<br><br>This is marvelous and appropriate counsel for all of us, young or old.<br><br>The very best and most certain defense we have against the temptations of the devil is our faith in Christ, our faith in His great atoning sacrifice, our faith in and testimony of the gospel of Jesus Christ. With faith and testimony firmly and consciously in place, the fiery darts of the wicked one will not and cannot pierce our souls. I emphasize having faith and testimony not just firmly in place but consciously in place. If you are consciously thinking of the Savior, you will not allow temptations to overpower you. More important, if you have the Savior and your faith in Him firmly and consciously in your mind and your heart, you will not allow yourselves even to get into tempting situations. Said another way, let your faith in Christ keep you out of the devil's territory.<br><br>Should it be needed, let your faith in Christ prompt a "Joseph experience" in your life. You remember Joseph, he who was sold into Egypt and became the favored servant for Potiphar, the captain of Pharaoh's guard. Potiphar's wife had unholy intentions toward Joseph. But Joseph immediately and flatly refused and rejected her advances, saying, "How then can I do this great wickedness, and sin against God?" (Genesis 39:9). She pressed her intentions, and the scriptures tell us that Joseph fled, that he "got him[self] out" of that tempting situation (verse 12). He withstood the temptations of the devil, even with his faith on the Lord Jesus Christ. (See Genesis 39:7–12.)<br><br>Children in elementary and primary schools around the world are taught the basic and essential elements of learning: reading, writing, and arithmetic. These are often referred to as "the three R's." Though the English letter <i>r</i> may not apply in all languages, we have all learned how to read, how to write, and how to solve basic mathematical problems. As I think about the basic and essential doctrines that underpin my faith, I again find three R's: resurrection, revelation, and restoration. In these we learn much of what the Lord would have us carry to the world. In these we learn of the Savior Jesus Christ and His Atonement. In these we learn of how God communicates through His chosen servants. In these we learn of the Prophet Joseph Smith and of the Restoration of the gospel. Though these three are not inclusive of all the wonderful and illuminating doctrines of the gospel, in these we can find the basis of a faith that can strengthen us in withstanding every temptation of the devil. Books have been written about the Resurrection, revelation, and the Restoration. Obviously I can only touch lightly on each of them here tonight. Think with me and visualize having these doctrinal truths so firmly and consciously in your minds and hearts as to provide that sure defense against evil.<br><h2><b>The Resurrection</b></h2><br>The doctrine of the Resurrection is as old as the foundations of the world. It was and is an essential part of our Heavenly Father's plan of happiness. The Lord taught Moses about His plan, including the Creation, the Fall of Adam, and the Atonement. Among many other things, He said, "For behold, this is my work and my glory--to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man" (Moses 1:39). It was in the plan that man would be redeemed from the Fall by and through the atoning sacrifice of the Savior Jesus Christ. Through the Fall of Adam came physical and spiritual death, not just to Adam and Eve but to all mankind. Through the Atonement of Jesus Christ came the glorious promise of resurrection from the dead for all who have lived or will yet live upon the earth. Paul the Apostle wrote:<br><br><i>But now is Christ risen from the dead, and become the firstfruits of them that slept.</i><br><br><i>For since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection of the dead.</i><br><br><i>For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive.</i> [1 Corinthians 15:20–22]<br><br>Physical death, as we all know, is the separation of the spirit from the body. Spiritual death is a separation of our spirits from the presence of God by sin. The Savior's gift of the Resurrection removes the lasting effects of the physical death. All will be resurrected. Thus the immortality of man is provided as a free and unconditional gift through the grace of Christ. Immortality is life everlasting, whereas eternal life is life everlasting in the presence of God. To gain eternal life and overcome the effects of the spiritual death is also a gift from Christ, but this gift is conditional, requiring faithfulness and obedience on our part. Elder Neal A. Maxwell said:<br><br><i>Jesus' glorious Atonement is the central act in all of human history! It provides the universal Resurrection; it makes our personal repentance and forgiveness possible. . . .</i><br><br><i>Christ gave us freely an enormous and unconditional gift: the universal Resurrection. However, Christ's proffer of the further gift of eternal life is conditional. . . . He sets the terms for receiving this great gift.</i> ["Testifying of the Great and Glorious Atonement," <i>Ensign,</i> October 2001, 10–12]<br><br>President Joseph Fielding Smith said:<br><br><i>The atonement of Jesus Christ is of a twofold nature. Because of it, all men are redeemed from mortal death and the grave, and will rise in the resurrection to immortality of the soul. Then again, by obedience to the laws and ordinances of the gospel, man will receive remission of individual sins, through the blood of Christ, and will inherit exaltation in the kingdom of God, which is eternal life.</i> [<i>Doctrines of Salvation,</i> comp. Bruce R. McConkie, 3 vols. (Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1954–56), 1:123]<br><br>Those who have suffered crippling injuries or who have been born with incapacitating handicaps are comforted by the marvelous promises of the Resurrection. Listen to these consoling words from the Book of Mormon:<br><br><i>Now, there is a death which is called a temporal death; and the death of Christ shall loose the bands of this temporal death, that all shall be raised from this temporal death.</i><br><br><i>The spirit and the body shall be reunited again in its perfect form; both limb and joint shall be restored to its proper frame.</i> [Alma 11:42–43]<br><br><i>Yea, and every limb and joint shall be restored to its body; yea, even a hair of the head shall not be lost; but all things shall be restored to their proper and perfect frame.</i> [Alma 40:23]<br><br>Even some of us with lesser handicaps are delighted with that verse of scripture.<br><br><i>The atonement bringeth to pass the resurrection of the dead; and the resurrection of the dead bringeth back men into the presence of God; and thus they are restored into his presence. . . .</i><br><br><i>And thus God bringeth about his great and eternal purposes, which were prepared from the foundation of the world. And thus cometh about the salvation and the redemption of men.</i> [Alma 42:23, 26]<br><br>In describing the blessings received through the Resurrection, President Joseph Fielding Smith said that resurrection saves man from the devil:<br><br><i>Immortality of the soul is the gift of God through the death and resurrection of his Son Jesus Christ. If the Savior had not died for the world, man would have remained in his sins. There could have been no resurrection from the dead and the physical body would have gone down into the grave without redemption, while the spirit would have become subject to the devil and his angels eternally.</i> [<i>Doctrines of Salvation,</i> 2:283]<br><br>The Resurrection not only saves us from the devil in the eternities, but our firm and conscious faith in the Savior and His atoning sacrifice can save us from the devil in our daily lives. I ask you if this helps you to understand the connection between the doctrine of the Resurrection and the scriptural counsel that we "withstand every temptation of the devil, with [our] faith on the Lord Jesus Christ."<br><br>Several years ago a fine young woman came to me as her stake president. She was troubled over some challenges she was facing at the time.<br><br>She said, "President Kerr, it's so hard to be a Latter-day Saint."<br><br>We discussed her reasons for feeling that way. Our conversation led quite naturally to a discussion of the Savior and of His suffering for each of us. We spoke of His Resurrection and of its implications for our lives now and in the eternities. We then spoke of the Savior's explanation to some of His followers of what was expected of them as disciples. We read from the scriptures where some felt the demands of their discipleship were too hard, and they turned their backs on the Savior and walked no more with Him (see John 6:66).<br><br>The young sister sat quietly for a few thoughtful moments, and, then, with tears in her eyes, she said, "Oh, I couldn't do that."<br><br>When I suggested that there is more than one way to turn our backs on the Savior, the light seemed to turn on in her mind and heart.<br><br>She said, "Now I can see that if I truly love my Savior and keep Him in my mind and heart, I cannot violate His trust."<br><br>Then she said, "I want to change what I said when we first began this conversation. I now know that it would be hard <i>not</i> to be a Latter-day Saint."<br><h2><b>Continuing Revelation</b></h2><br>Now, let us turn to the doctrine of divine and continuing revelation. The Lord said, "And again, I will give unto you a pattern in all things, that ye may not be deceived; for Satan is abroad in the land, and he goeth forth deceiving the nations" (D&amp;amp;C 52:14). An essential element in the Lord's "pattern in all things" is the assurance we have of living prophets, seers, and revelators receiving divine revelation for the guidance and direction of the Church today. Personal revelation and inspiration are available to each of us through the Holy Spirit. But I am not speaking of that form of revelation. I am speaking of revelation through living prophets to and for the Church.<br><br>While serving in the British Mission, I was blessed to teach many people who loved the Bible and relied heavily on its divine message. As we taught the doctrine of continuing revelation, many responded with joy and wonderment--joy with the thought that God may be speaking again to chosen prophets but wonderment as to why they had not heard this divine principle taught in their own churches. They learned that continuing revelation was not only the source of divine truth but also the primary source of scripture. The recording and acceptance of newly revealed truths as scripture troubled those who believed the Bible to be the sole repository of all of God's word. Yet the honest in heart embraced the doctrine of continuing revelation and new scripture as consistent with biblical patterns they believed but had not fully understood.<br><br>Elder Mark E. Petersen, who served for many years as a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, described the significance of revelation to and for the Church when he said:<br><br><i>It is an infallible sign of the true church that it has in it divinely chosen, living prophets to guide it, men who receive current revelation from God and whose recorded works become new scripture.</i><br><br><i>It is an infallible sign of the true church also that it will produce new and additional scripture arising out of the ministrations of those prophets. This unfailing pattern of God is clearly made manifest through his dealings with his people from the beginning.</i> [<i>CR,</i> April 1978, 95–96; or "Evidence of Things Not Seen," <i>Ensign,</i> May 1978, 62]<br><br>I feel that Elder Petersen captured in a profound way the message of continuing revelation.<br><br>The Lord reveals His will to His chosen prophets, seers, and revelators. As the Lord puts it into their hearts to teach that which they have received, the people are blessed with divine knowledge communicated through those revelations. Revealed truth is recorded, and in the Lord's time and infinite wisdom, some of those revelations may be formally added to the canon of scripture.<br><br>The doctrine of continuing revelation, with its resulting new scripture, is a distinctive feature of the Restoration. It is descriptive of the very process by which the Restoration occurred. Amos in the Old Testament said, "Surely the Lord God will do nothing, but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets" (Amos 3:7).<br><br>The Restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ was the result of many heaven-sent revelations. These revelations were given primarily to a latter-day prophet chosen, prepared, and ordained for that divine purpose. Our message to all the world is that Joseph Smith was that chosen prophet. It is our witness that God has again spoken and is still speaking, revealing His secret unto His servants the living prophets.<br><br>A testimony of this truth is of enormous comfort and gives us unending confidence in the prophetic voice we are blessed to hear and read on a regular basis.<br><br>One of the highlights of my mission was my own personal experience with the doctrine of revelation. As I searched the scriptures daily in my effort to prepare myself to teach the people, I was taken by the wonder of the unfolding revelations of the Lord, both ancient and modern. I am not a doubter by nature, but I enjoy the search for scriptural and logical evidences of the beliefs that have come to me by study and by faith. For a time my scriptural search was dominated by a logical premise that I had formulated in my mind. I had thought, "If the claims of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints regarding continuing revelation are sound, the means by which revelations were received by the Prophet Joseph Smith must be consistent with the means by which revelations were received by Old and New Testament prophets and apostles." Now, do you understand the premise? I needed to know that there was that consistency between how modern-day revelations were received and how revelations were received in ancient times.<br><br>Time this evening does not allow me to describe all that I found in that search, but let me say to you that the Lord's pattern became very clear. Revelations to prophets have come by very consistent means. These means can be described and defined with different terminology and may be divided or grouped differently, but the distinct pattern is there. I identified five very specific means by which revelations have been given to God's prophets. I found multiple examples of each of those throughout the scriptures. This pattern is consistently found in all the scriptures, ancient and modern. Maybe on another occasion I can talk about the five means of revelation and show you that consistent pattern of those scriptures, ancient and modern.<br><br>The knowledge of this glorious truth strengthened my faith then and continues even today to strengthen my faith now. To know that we have a living prophet who receives revelations from God--just as Abraham and Moses and Isaiah and Peter and Paul and others did--is of enormous comfort and reassurance.<br><br>Each of you must come to your own knowledge and testimony of this divine principle. But you can have every confidence in the testimony that I am sharing with you tonight. Even now you can keep firmly and consciously in your minds an awareness and conviction that God is speaking to His chosen and living prophets today just as He did anciently. A testimony of the doctrine of continuing revelation will bolster your faith in the Lord Jesus Christ and thus strengthen you in your resolve to withstand every temptation of the devil.<br><br>If you should face a moment of serious temptation, force yourself to think of President Gordon B. Hinckley. Think of him as a prophet, seer, and revelator who receives direct revelation from the Lord for the Church. Think of the revelation he received regarding the construction of small temples all around the world, making the sacred blessings of the temple available to an ever greater number of the members of the Church. Allow the conscious thought of a living prophet receiving current revelation regarding sacred temples to turn you away from that tempting moment and preserve your worthiness to receive those sacred temple blessings. We do indeed "believe all that God has revealed, all that He does now reveal, and we believe that He will yet reveal many great and important things pertaining to the Kingdom of God" (Articles of Faith 1:9).<br><h2><b>Restoration of the Gospel</b></h2><br>We have talked, and I hope you have thought deeply, about the Resurrection and about revelation. Let us now talk about the Restoration. We are here because of the Restoration. While a basic knowledge of the Resurrection and of revelation can be had from ancient scripture, most of what we know about these important doctrines has come as a result of the Restoration of the gospel through the Prophet Joseph Smith. The message of the Restoration is that God lives, Jesus is the living Christ, the gospel has been restored to the earth in its fulness, Joseph Smith truly was and is a modern-day prophet of God, Gordon B. Hinckley is a living prophet today, and the Book of Mormon is the word of God, standing now and forever with the Bible as one in the hands of the Lord.<br><br>There would have been no need for a restoration had there not first been a loss of truth, which occurred not many years following the Savior's earthly ministry. That loss of truth, known as the Great Apostasy, was seen and foretold by Old and New Testament prophets. The Lord established His Church in all its purity, and He bestowed the holy priesthood upon His disciples. Now is not the time for detailing the causes of the Apostasy and loss of the priesthood, but even the most casual look at religious history will affirm its reality. The Old Testament prophet Amos prophesied of this loss of truth. He said:<br><br><i>Behold, the days come, saith the Lord God, that I will send a famine in the land, not a famine of bread, nor a thirst for water, but of hearing the words of the Lord:</i><br><br><i>And they shall wander from sea to sea, and from the north even to the east, they shall run to and fro to seek the word of the Lord, and shall not find it.</i> [Amos 8:11–12]<br><br>Not long after the Savior's Ascension into heaven, Peter foresaw the Restoration. He said:<br><br><i>Repent ye therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out, when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord;</i><br><br><i>And he shall send Jesus Christ, which before was preached unto you:</i><br><br><i>Whom the heaven must receive until the times of restitution of all things, which God hath spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets since the world began.</i> [Acts 3:19–21]<br><br>Speaking of the Second Coming of the Savior, the Apostle Paul wrote, "Let no man deceive you by any means: for that day shall not come, except there come a falling away first" (2 Thessalonians 2:3). It was known that there would be both a falling away and a restoration before the Second Coming.<br><br>These prophecies and many others not mentioned have truly been fulfilled, and we are the beneficiaries of the great blessings flowing from the Lord's hand in our lives. President Gordon B. Hinckley said:<br><br><i>These are the days of restitution. These are the days of restoration spoken of in the Holy Bible plainly and forcefully by Peter the Apostle and by Paul. I repeat, you and I are a part of prophecy fulfilled, a part of the divine plan of the God of heaven, that there should be a falling away and that there must be a restoration.</i> ["Inspirational Thoughts," <i>Ensign,</i> June 2004, 4]<br><br>The restoration of all things as foretold by ancient prophets of God did indeed occur through the ministry and heavenly manifestations of God the Father; His Son, Jesus Christ; Peter, James, and John; John the Baptist; Moses; Elijah; Moroni; and others of the Lord's prophets in ancient times. Joseph Smith was foreordained to his sacred role as the instrument through whom God would bring to pass the Restoration of the gospel in this, the dispensation of the fulness of times. Even the Savior Himself bore witness of this truth. He said:<br><br><i>Wherefore, I the Lord, knowing the calamity which should come upon the inhabitants of the earth, called upon my servant Joseph Smith, Jun., and spake unto him from heaven, and gave him commandments; . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . that it might be fulfilled, which was written by the prophets . . .</i><br><br><i>That faith also might increase in the earth;</i><br><br><i>That mine everlasting covenant might be established;</i><br><br><i>That the fulness of my gospel might be proclaimed by the weak and the simple unto the ends of the world, and before kings and rulers.</i> [D&amp;amp;C 1:17–18, 21–23]<br><br>What more can be said? This is the Savior's own testimony of the Prophet Joseph Smith! He spoke to him from heaven and gave him commandments. Did you also notice that one line? "That faith also might increase in the earth." The Restoration of the gospel stands as a bulwark to our faith in our defense against the designs of the evil one. It is my prayer that you will keep these truths firmly and consciously in your minds and in your hearts. I plead with you, even as King Benjamin pled with his people when he said:<br><br><i>Therefore, I would that ye should be steadfast and immovable, always abounding in good works, that Christ, the Lord God Omnipotent, may seal you his, that you may be brought to heaven, that ye may have everlasting salvation and eternal life, through the wisdom, and power, and justice, and mercy of him who created all things.</i> [Mosiah 5:15]<br><h2><b>Conclusion</b></h2><br>Let me conclude with a summarizing quote from President Gordon B. Hinckley:<br><br><i>This is God's holy work. It is divine in its origin and in its doctrine. Jesus Christ</i> [the resurrected Lord and Savior] <i>stands as its head. He is our immortal Savior and Redeemer. His revelation is the source of our doctrine, our faith, our teaching, in fact the underlying pattern of our lives. Joseph Smith was an instrument in the hands of the Almighty in bringing to pass this Restoration. And that basic element of revelation is with the Church today as it was in Joseph's day.</i><br><br><i>Our individual testimonies of these truths are the basis of our faith. We must nurture them. We must cultivate them. We can never forsake them. We can never lay them aside. Without them we have nothing. With them we have everything.</i> [<i>CR,</i> April 2001, 111–12; or "Good-Bye for Another Season," <i>Ensign,</i> May 2001, 85]<br><br>I leave with you my witness of the divinity of the Savior. He lives! I testify that the reality of the Resurrection, the relevance of revelation, and the reliability of the Restoration will increase your faith in the Lord Jesus Christ and help you withstand every temptation of the devil. I leave with you my testimony, my love, and my blessing to that end, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>W.

<h1>;s Love - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
What an amazing sight you are this morning! What a vibrant spirit you exude--so full of life and energy and hope for the future. I am so glad to be here with you today.<br><br>In case some of you may not have noticed, today is Valentine's Day. And of course, that being the case, our thoughts turn to love.<br><br>Love is such a wonderful thing. And there are many types of love. Love, as it is defined by the world, can be misguided, frivolous, and selfish. For instance, we may love chocolate, love shoes, or love a good joke. While appropriately enjoying and benefiting from the things of the world is part of God's plan for us, we must be sure that we keep our desire and "love" for these things in balance with life's more important blessings. The love for material things can sidetrack us from seeking those things that bring eternal happiness.<br><br>Worldly "love" between people is ofttimes nothing more than lust. This kind of love brings dissatisfaction, misery, and sorrow.<br><br>On the other hand, God's love is pure. True love as described by the prophets is deep devotion, affection, adoration, mercy, forgiveness, service, grace, gratitude, and kindness. Real love motivates us to be the best we can be. It is the most powerful force on the earth and can bring great joy and happiness. Pure love is a gift from God and is at the very foundation of His gospel. While God's love for us is perfect, our love for Him is constantly being redefined as we learn, grow, and experience.<br><br>Today I would like to share a few thoughts about this kind of love--God's love.<br><h2><b>Two Great Commandments</b></h2><br>The Savior has directed our understanding. In the book of Matthew, Jesus was asked:<br><br><i>Master, which is the great commandment in the law?</i><br><br><i>Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind.</i><br><br><i>This is the first and great commandment.</i><br><br><i>And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.</i> [Matthew 22:36–39]<br><br>In order to understand how to keep these two great commandments, we have to first understand our relationship with our Heavenly Father and we have to understand His love for us.<br><br>We are our Heavenly Father's children. It is as we learn in the favorite Primary song: "I am a child of God, And he has sent me here" (<i>Songbook,</i> 2). He loves us because we <i>are.</i> He loves us with a perfect love that we cannot earn or destroy. Now, to be sure, we can disappoint Him and we can cause Him great sorrow. We can forfeit many of His promised blessings if we fail to be obedient. But He will never stop loving us. He loves us with a love that we cannot fully comprehend. He loves us even when we don't deserve it.<br><br>The greatest example of God's love for His children is found in the infinite Atonement of Jesus Christ. In John 3:16 we read: "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life."<br><br>This means that when we do disappoint Him and make mistakes, there is a way that He has provided whereby we can be forgiven and make our way back to Him.<br><br>I am sure that if I were to ask the question "Do you believe in Jesus Christ?" that probably all of you would say yes. But let me ask you this: Do you believe Him when He says He gave His life for you so that you might be forgiven of your sins and live with Him and Father in Heaven again? Do you really understand that the Atonement was made for you? Do you believe that you are worth it or worthy of it? Do you believe that anyone could possibly love you that much? I want to assure you today that you are worth it! You are loved more than you will ever know, and as we turn to our Heavenly Father in our times of need, we most assuredly can feel of His love.<br><br>Do you remember the story in John 8 of the woman who had been caught in adultery? Surely she must have felt very unworthy of Jesus' forgiveness, and yet that is exactly what He gave her after all her accusers had departed. "And Jesus said unto her, Neither do I condemn thee: go, and sin no more" (John 8:11).<br><br>Not only did Christ not condemn her, but He gave her the opportunity to repent as He directed her to "go, and sin no more." The love of Christ is a wonderful thing.<br><br>Again referring to the two great commandments found in Matthew, we are to love God, to love others, and to love ourselves. Let's begin by looking at how we can love ourselves. It begins by opening our hearts and accepting God's love, because then and only then can we know who we are and that we are of great worth. Only then will we be able to love ourselves.<br><br>What does it mean to love ourselves? Are we talking about being selfish or self-centered? Are we talking about being self-absorbed? No, we are talking about knowing who we are, where we came from, what we are to do, and where we are going. We are talking about appreciating who we are and the blessings and opportunities we have been given. We are talking about a love that gives us the confidence to serve God and our fellowmen.<br><br>Do you really understand the difference between loving yourself in a righteous manner and, on the other hand, being selfish and turned inward? Does your life reflect this understanding? If you do understand it, how well do you love yourself? How do you demonstrate that love? Let's explore four ways we can show love for ourselves. As we do so, we will turn to the scriptures, for we are taught in 2 Nephi 32:3 that we are to "feast upon the words of Christ; for behold, the words of Christ will tell you all things what ye should do."<br><h2><b>Respect Our Bodies</b></h2><br>One important way to show love for ourselves is to respect our bodies. What has the Lord said about this? In the Doctrine and Covenants, section 89, we find the Word of Wisdom. In verse 2 it is proclaimed to be "the order and will of God in the temporal salvation of all saints in the last days." In this Word of Wisdom we are not only told what not to take into our bodies, we are taught what is good for our health and well-being. Now I am sure that none of you are drinking or smoking, but do you eat the right kinds of food at the right times in order to maintain good health? Are you avoiding fad diets and other foolish practices in order to become and stay thin? Our objective regarding these things should be optimum health rather than weight loss. We are given a great promise if we will keep this Word of Wisdom:<br><br><i>And all saints who remember to keep and do these sayings, walking in obedience to the commandments, shall receive health in their navel and marrow to their bones;</i><br><br><i>And shall find wisdom and great treasures of knowledge, even hidden treasures;</i><br><br><i>And shall run and not be weary, and shall walk and not faint.</i><br><br><i>And I, the Lord, give unto them a promise, that the destroying angel shall pass by them, as the children of Israel, and not slay them.</i> [D&amp;amp;C 89:18–21]<br><br>If you really love yourself, you will want all of these promised blessings.<br><br>Another principle of good health is exercise. This not only adds to our health but also invigorates the mind. It is a great way to learn discipline.<br><br>About now you may be thinking, "Wow, she sounds just like my mom!" Well, I am just like your mom. And let me tell you something: When moms tell us what to do, it is never just because they can--it is because they care and they want the very best for you.<br><br>That being the case, I am going to tell you one more thing that is important to do to respect your body, to love yourself. Actually, I am not telling you, the Lord is telling you.<br><br>In the Doctrine and Covenants we are taught:<br><br><i>Cease to be idle; cease to be unclean; cease to find fault one with another; cease to sleep longer than is needful; retire to thy bed early, that ye may not be weary; arise early, that your bodies and your minds may be invigorated.</i> [D&amp;amp;C 88:124]<br><br>Listen again to the blessings associated with this commandment: to not be weary but to have invigorated minds and bodies. These are blessings that I surely need. How about you?<br><br>Do you love yourself enough to claim the blessings that are promised if we use wisdom in eating, exercising, sleeping, and practicing general good health habits?<br><h2><b>Keep Ourselves Pure and Clean</b></h2><br>The second way to show love to ourselves is to keep ourselves pure and clean. In 1 Corinthians 3:16–17 we read:<br><br><i>Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?</i><br><br><i>If any man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, which temple ye are.</i><br><br>If we really love and respect ourselves, we will do everything to protect ourselves from the influences of the world that would have us defile this temple called our body. Sister Susan Tanner, Young Women general president, taught the following in her October 2005 general conference talk:<br><br><i>Satan . . . tries to do everything he can to get us to abuse or misuse this precious gift</i> [our body]. <i>He has filled the world with lies and deceptions about the body. He tempts many to defile this great gift of the body through unchastity, immodesty, self-indulgence, and addictions. He seduces some to despise their bodies; others he tempts to worship their bodies.</i> [Susan W. Tanner, "The Sanctity of the Body," <i>Ensign,</i> November 2005, 13]<br><br>Knowing that we are children of God should enable us to make worthy choices when it comes to chastity, modesty, music, activities, and companions. Loving ourselves should enable us to stay clear of those things that, while acceptable and even desired by the world, would undermine our self-worth. All of us have been taught since our youth what it means to keep ourselves morally clean, and God's rules have not changed. But do we ever find ourselves standing on the very edge of those rules?<br><br>Two of my children love to rock climb. They take pictures of their adventures and bring them home to scare me to death. Even though they are roped in and use all the safety measures prescribed, to me they still look like they are in terrible danger. They look like they are barely holding on.<br><br>I have thought as I have seen those pictures that I am so glad that they do not make eternal choices in the same manner that they climb rocks. When it comes to keeping the commandments, their choices keep them firmly planted on a solid foundation, well away from the edge of disaster. In John 14:15 we are told, "If ye love me, keep my commandments."<br><br>Today we might add, "If you love yourself, keep His commandments."<br><h2><b>Appreciate Who We Are</b></h2><br>The third thing we can do to develop love for ourselves is to appreciate who we are. Give yourself credit for all of the great things you do and have done. It's an interesting exercise to write down on a piece of paper all of your good qualities and then just sit back and look at all you have done. Actually, what we are looking at is what the Lord has done. We owe all that we are to our Heavenly Father.<br><br>When we love ourselves, we recognize that our Heavenly Father has given us special gifts. We are each unique. In Doctrine and Covenants 6:10 it says, "Behold thou hast a gift, and blessed art thou because of thy gift. Remember it is sacred and cometh from above."<br><br>It is so important that we do not compare ourselves to others but rather work to appreciate and develop who we are. It is never too late to be what you might have been (see Dinah Maria Mulock Craik, <i>John Halifax, Gentleman</i> [1857], chapter 36). Don't ever become discouraged. Set goals, work hard, be patient, and believe that you can do it. My dad always taught me that I could do anything and be anything I wanted to be if I was just willing to work hard enough. We have to work with a purpose. And when you do, and when you understand your potential, you will have the confidence that this knowledge brings. You will be willing to try new things and discover new talents. You will then be free to become all that you can be.<br><br>Loving yourself is demonstrated through a life of discipline. You don't have to become disciplined all at once. Remember the principle taught in 2 Nephi 28:30: "line upon line, precept upon precept." Do your best one day at a time--sometimes just one hour at a time. It's okay to start small--but <i>start!</i> You are in a wonderful place in your life. You have so many opportunities before you. Take advantage of your years here at school. "Seek ye out of the best books words of wisdom; seek learning, even by study and also by faith" (D&amp;amp;C 88:118).<br><br>Now, don't misunderstand, you are young and you should enjoy your life and have fun--but never at the expense of your eternal welfare. Anything that is worth having is going to take some effort. Hard work is the only way to learn and grow, but it is important to balance that with good, wholesome fun.<br><h2><b>Forgive Ourselves</b></h2><br>The fourth way to love ourselves is to forgive ourselves. If we truly love ourselves, we will recognize that when we make mistakes, we can turn to our Father in Heaven and partake of the Atonement of Jesus Christ. He will help us to turn our lives around and have the strength to get back on the right path. He loves us and will forgive us if we sincerely repent and change our lives. He will help us forgive ourselves and regain our self-respect and selfworth.<br><br>As we love ourselves the way the Lord would have us do, we are prepared to truly love others. Self-love and a love of God should become the foundation upon which a life of love and service to others is based. We have to learn to love ourselves, but then we have to forget ourselves. In Matthew 16:25 we learn, "For whosoever will save his life shall lose it: and whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it."<br><br>Loving oneself and yet forgetting oneself may seem contradictory, but it is not. It is a demonstration of the kind of love offered us by the Savior. It is also a demonstration of the kind of love the Savior expects from us to Him and the Father.<br><h2><b>A Life of Love and Service</b></h2><br>Now, in your busy daily lives, how can you really serve others? There are the obvious ways: accepting calls in your wards, helping someone who is in need, doing service projects, paying fast offerings. But what is it that the Lord really has in mind here?<br><br>It occurs to me that many times our service is just a matter of going through the motions. We may do it because we have a sense of duty. We may do it because there is no one else there to do it. We may do it so we can check it off our list. We may do it so we won't feel guilty now. None of these motivations are bad, but is it true service? Is it the kind of service the Lord has in mind? Is it the service that is founded in the pure love of Christ?<br><br>This leads us to questions like these: Is my service really based on a love I feel deep in my heart for other people? Who is my neighbor? How can I really love him?<br><br>When we serve others just because we are supposed to, we are still serving, and it is true that we grow to love those whom we serve. But drawing close to our Father in Heaven and living worthy of the Holy Ghost in our lives can qualify us with a love that fills our heart and spills out to all those we meet.<br><br>Everyone in our lives is our neighbor. Our family is our neighbor. Our roommates are our neighbors. Our friends, our enemies, our acquaintances, and those we have never met--all of these are our neighbors. We demonstrate our love for them by nurturing feelings of tolerance, patience, kindness, helpfulness, and compassion in our hearts as well as in our actions. We overcome critical, angry feelings toward others. We look to understand rather than condemn. We accept differences as strengths and we learn from one another.<br><br>I experienced this kind of love when I traveled to Africa to do work for the Primary. I had been asked by President Hinckley, when he called me to serve as the Primary general president, to take care of the children of the world. As I prepared for this trip, I felt apprehensive about what I would see there. Would I be able to stand the conditions in which I would see the children? But what I experienced was something totally unexpected. I saw children living in terrible conditions, it is true. I realized that I could do nothing to change that. But, at the same time, I was filled with an overwhelming feeling of love for them and a realization of the love that our Heavenly Father feels for them. That love comforted my heart.<br><br>Our service may be doing things that really change others' lives for the better, or our service can be as simple as a smile that lifts a heavy heart. It can be something that may involve some sacrifice. We may have to forgo something we want in order to serve, protect, or strengthen another. When we do this, our service is sanctified, and we begin to feel the pure love of Christ.<br><br>If our life is all about "me," we are missing the point. We are here to love and to serve one another. The motto here at BYU reflects this: "Enter to learn; go forth to serve."<br><br>We read in Matthew 25:40: "Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me."<br><br>And the same principle is taught in Mosiah 2:17: "When ye are in the service of your fellow beings ye are only in the service of your God."<br><br>As these scriptures tell us, when we love and serve our neighbor, we are showing our love for our Father in Heaven. Our love for Him will never be judged by our words alone. Our actions must follow, and those actions must come from the inside out. They must spring naturally from love. Love for our God, for ourselves, and for others must become the very center of our being. It must become our motivation and our foundation. We can pray for that love. We can work for that love.<br><br>Mormon said:<br><br><i>Wherefore, my beloved brethren, pray unto the Father with all the energy of heart, that ye may be filled with this love, which he hath bestowed upon all who are true followers of his Son, Jesus Christ; that ye may become the sons of God; that when he shall appear we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is; that we may have this hope; that we may be purified even as he is pure. Amen.</i> [Moroni 7:48]<br><br>We began today by reading in Matthew 22. In conclusion, let us turn there again. After the Lord gives us the first two commandments, which are both based on love, He says in verse 40, "On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets."<br><br>If we can understand the law of love--for God, for others, and for ourselves--we will be able to follow all of the rest of the commandments and teachings in the scriptures and from latter-day prophets. If we can understand pure love that is charity, we will be blessed indeed: "But charity is the pure love of Christ, and it endureth forever; and whoso is found possessed of it at the last day, it shall be well with him" (Moroni 7:47).<br><br>I bear my witness of the truths found in the scriptures. The scriptures are the word of the Lord. I am so grateful for our prophet, President Gordon B. Hinckley, who directs us to read them and to make them a part of our lives. I know that God lives and Jesus is the Christ. I know that They love us and that the gospel of Jesus Christ is true. I know that as we follow His words, there is a sweet promise, for He has said, "Be faithful and diligent in keeping the commandments of God, and I will encircle thee in the arms of my love" (D&amp;amp;C 6:20).<br><br>May we all feel His love and love Him, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Cheryl C.

<br>
<br>
Brothers and sisters, it is a wonderful treat to be back in the Marriott Center to see so many of you here with us tonight. But, more than that, it is wonderful to realize that across the earth there are tens of thousands who are gathered in various facilities--maybe even hundreds of thousands. Sister Bateman and I were in Argentina and Uruguay last week, and we know that they will be watching the delayed broadcast this next Sunday evening. People are gathered everywhere, which exhibits the faith they have.<br><br>In August 2005 President Gordon B. Hinckley challenged "members of the Church throughout the world and . . . friends everywhere to read or reread the Book of Mormon." He concluded the challenge with a promise:<br><br><i>There will come into your lives and into your homes an added measure of the Spirit of the Lord, a strengthened resolution to walk in obedience to His commandments, and a stronger testimony of the living reality of the Son of God.</i><sup>1</sup><br><br>The response to the prophetic call was immediate and far-reaching. People everywhere began reading the book--in homes, on airplanes, at lunch, upon arising in the morning, before going to bed at night. It is likely that more people read the Book of Mormon during the second half of 2005 than at any other time in history. A few months ago a friend of mine was on a flight between New York and Salt Lake City. As he walked down the aisle, many people were reading the book. About midplane he noticed two individuals across the aisle from each other, both reading the Book of Mormon, and he stopped to see where they were. He chuckled when he saw that they were on the same page.<br><br>Elder Richard G. Scott and I were on assignment in Africa during November. At a Sunday evening devotional with more than 2,000 members in attendance at the Accra Ghana Stake Center, Elder Scott asked how many were reading the Book of Mormon. Almost every hand went up. Ten days later in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, I met with 200 Saints and friends in a devotional. I asked the same question. About two-thirds of the hands were raised. I learned after the meeting that the remaining one-third were mostly investigators.<br><br>Now, by a show of hands, how many of you read the Book of Mormon during 2005? As I look through the audience, almost every hand is raised, and I suspect the same is true in Los Angeles, New York, Frankfurt, Tokyo, Sã Paulo, Mexico City, and the many other places in which you are gathered this evening. What an extraordinary response to the prophet's challenge.<br><br>I accepted his challenge and read the book as well. I experienced the fulfillment of the promises made by President Hinckley. I felt an added measure of the Spirit, a stronger testimony, and a strengthened resolution to walk in the Lord's way. May I share with you for a moment tonight an insight from the Book of Mormon that came while I was reading last year.<br><h2><b>A Strengthened Testimony of the Book of Mormon</b></h2><br>For some time I have known that chapters 5 and 32 in Alma deal with the same subject--faith. Until my reading last year, however, I had failed to notice how carefully the two sermons were tailored to their respective audiences. Alma's listeners in chapter 5 were Church members in Zarahemla (see Alma 5:2). This city was the headquarters of the Church, and one may assume that the members knew the doctrine. In contrast, the listeners in chapter 32 were the poverty-stricken Zoramites who had been forced out of the synagogues by the rich. The people in this part of the land had drifted far from the truth (see Alma 31:12–17). Although the poor were humble and wanted to learn, they were investigators needing to be taught gospel fundamentals.<br><br>Alma's sermon in chapter 5 to the members in Zarahemla was deep and complex. The series of questions he posed assumed familiarity with the doctrine and experience with the Holy Ghost. Otherwise, the questions would have had little meaning and been difficult to answer. The purpose of the questions was to prompt those members in Zarahemla to review and renew their faith in the Lord and His redemptive powers. Listen to the questions (see Alma 5:14–15):<br><br>• Have you spiritually been born of God?<br><br>• Have you received His image in your countenances?<br><br>• Have you experienced this mighty change in your hearts?<br><br>• Do you exercise faith in the redemption of Him who created you?<br><br>• Do you look forward with an eye of faith and view this mortal body raised in immortality to stand before God to be judged according to the deeds that have been done in the mortal body?<br><br>To appreciate and answer these questions, one must know about and believe in the atoning sacrifice of the Lord Jesus Christ, have experienced a cleansing by water and by fire, have tasted the fruits of the Holy Spirit, and believe in the literal resurrection of the physical body. This was not a sermon for initiates but for well-grounded members of the Church.<br><br>In contrast, Alma taught the Zoramite investigators the rudiments of faith--how faith in Christ begins and then grows. The sermon in chapter 32 is so clear concerning the faith-building process that missionaries use it today to teach investigators how they may develop a testimony. The process begins with a "desire to believe." An individual must then plant the seed--which is the word of God--in his or her heart by searching the scriptures, listening to the words of the prophets, praying and asking for a confirmation of gospel truths, going to church, and obeying the commandments. The result, Alma said, will be a swelling in one's bosom, an enlightenment of the mind, and warm feelings in the heart (see Alma 32:28). These are the beginning of a testimony--and the seed is good. Anyone with a sincere desire to know can obtain a testimony by following Alma's teachings in chapter 32.<br><br>After explaining the initial faith-building process, Alma continued with a question in chapter 32: "After ye have tasted this light is your knowledge perfect?" (Alma 32:35). No--the process has just begun (see Alma 32:36). The seed has grown but is still only a seedling. Alma explained that if one continued faithful, the seedling would grow into a tree. What tree? The tree of life! (see Alma 32:41). This tree is a symbol of God's love for His children expressed through the condescension and atoning sacrifice of His Son (see 1 Nephi 11:9–33; John 3:16).<br><br>Alma taught the Zoramites that when the tree was deep within their souls, they would feast upon its fruit and not hunger or thirst (see Alma 32:42–43). In other words, they would have experienced spiritual rebirth--the mighty change of heart--and the tree deep within their soul would produce God's image in their countenances. It is interesting to note that Alma taught the Zoramites in chapter 32 what they must do to answer the questions posed to the Zarahemla members in chapter 5.<br><br>How remarkable! Can you imagine Joseph Smith at age 24, with little formal schooling, dictating a manuscript that outlined fundamental doctrines over hundreds of pages with consistency in every detail <i>and</i> tailored the presentations of the doctrine to meet the needs of the audience? And, even more than that, Alma's sermons tied directly to and built upon the visions of earlier prophets: Lehi's and Nephi's dreams of the tree of life in 1 Nephi. Of even more importance is the fact that the sermons were not only relevant for the Nephites and Zoramites but are for readers hundreds and thousands of years later as well.<br><br>Brothers and sisters, the Book of Mormon is the word of God. It is true. Joseph Smith was not the author of the book but the Lord's translator. The book was written by ancient prophets centuries ago.<br><br>I am grateful to have read the Book of Mormon one more time. Each time I have learned new things that bear witness to my soul that Joseph Smith was and is the Lord's prophet of the Restoration. Although there are many things that I do not know, one thing is certain: the Book of Mormon and the Restoration of the Church are part of the "restitution of all things" foretold by the Apostle Peter 2,000 years ago (Acts 3:21).<br><h2><b>Looking Forward in the Lord's Plan</b></h2><br>Tonight I wish to borrow from Alma's sermon in Zarahemla. I ask you, the young adults of the Church in 2006, do you "look forward with an eye of faith"? Do you abide by the gospel teachings so that you may receive and retain His image in your countenances? Do you recognize the critical point in life at which you have arrived and the long-term implications of key decisions you will make during the next few years?<br><br>I believe the age span from 18 to 30 is one of the riskiest and most challenging times of life. It is also one of the most rewarding times. Major decisions will be made in the next few years that will have an impact on you through mortality and into eternity. Choices regarding education, employment, marriage, children, and faithfulness in God's kingdom are upon you. Your choices now, active or passive, will affect you forever.<br><br>A knowledge of the Lord's plan, especially as it pertains to this life, will help you make wise decisions. For the remainder of my time this evening, I wish to examine the purposes of mortality in the Lord's plan and how these purposes relate to the important choices that lie ahead for many of you.<br><h2><b>"Added Upon"</b></h2><br>When the Father called His spirit children together in the Council in Heaven, He indicated that it was time to create an earth and that those "who keep their first estate shall be added upon; . . . and they who keep their second estate shall have glory added upon their heads for ever and ever" (Abraham 3:26). We know the first estate to be the spirit world and the second estate to be this life. In what ways were we to be "added upon" as we kept our first estate and entered mortality?<br><br>There are at least three ways in which we are enhanced by coming to earth. First, we receive a <i>physical body.</i> Second, mortal experiences allow us to prove ourselves, and in so doing we grow in <i>intelligence,</i> or light and truth (see D&amp;amp;C 93:36, 130:18–19). Finally, we have the opportunity to begin an <i>eternal family,</i> wherein we forge special relationships that bring added glory. Let us examine each purpose.<br><h2><b>The Physical Body</b></h2><br>The physical body is one of the great gifts of mortality. The scriptures teach that the body is not only important for this life but also for eternity. During mortality the body can be a temple of God in that it may house the Holy Spirit (see 1 Corinthians 6:19–20). Listening to the guidance of the Holy Spirit leads one to the celestial kingdom. The body is so important in the eternities that Christ gave His life to overcome physical as well as spiritual death. In so doing, He made possible a resurrection for everyone.<br><br>Joseph Smith said: "We came to this earth that we might have a body and present it pure before God in the celestial kingdom. The great principle of happiness consists in having a body."<sup>2</sup><br><br>Why is the physical body so important? How does it relate to your happiness here and hereafter? What are its divine purposes? There are at least three.<br><br><i>1. Sacred power of creation.</i> The first divine purpose has to do with the sacred power of creation. The body contains the seeds of creation, which allow us to have children and begin an eternal family. In mortality this power is given for a limited period of time. If we are faithful and abide by the commandments pertaining to its use, that power of creation is restored in the Resurrection. The scriptures indicate that "a fulness of joy" comes when the body and spirit are inseparably connected (D&amp;amp;C 93:33). However, a "fulness of joy" requires more than the Resurrection. In the Doctrine and Covenants we are taught that those who enter into "the new and everlasting covenant of marriage" and are faithful enter into the highest degree of the celestial kingdom and there receive a "fulness" of glory and "a continuation of the seeds forever" (D&amp;amp;C 131:2; 132:19). It is the eternal marriage relationship and the power to create life that produce happiness in mortality and a "fulness of joy" in the life to come.<br><br><i>2. An instrument of the mind.</i> Second, the physical body is an instrument of the mind. President Boyd K. Packer taught this concept in a CES satellite broadcast three years ago.<sup>3</sup> Many acts of love, kindness, and service require the physical body. These physical acts not only bless others but also oneself. A personage of spirit is able to do many things, but the physical body increases the range of activities that can be performed. In fact, President Joseph F. Smith, in his vision of the spirit world, learned that "the dead . . . looked upon the long absence of their spirits from their bodies as a bondage" (D&amp;amp;C 138:50). In other words, there will be actions we cannot take after death before the Resurrection, and we will look and yearn for the return of that physical body and the freedom that it brings.<br><br><i>3. A receptacle for light.</i> Third, the physical body is a receptacle for light. Physicists indicate that every physical object can hold light. The brother of Jared must have known this when he exclaimed, "Touch these stones, O Lord, with thy finger, and prepare them . . . that we may have light while we shall cross the sea" (Ether 3:4). The Lord, speaking to the Prophet Joseph Smith, stated, "If your eye be single to my glory, your whole bodies shall be filled with light" (D&amp;amp;C 88:67).<br><br>Have you noticed the light in the countenances of those who live the gospel? Four months ago I was in the Accra Ghana Temple. The ordinance workers, dressed in white, were all Ghanaian. The light emanating from their faces was quite visible. As you live the gospel, light is added to your being with the body as the receptacle.<br><br>Finally, the Lord tells us that if we live according to celestial law, in the Resurrection our bodies will receive "that glory by which your bodies are quickened. Ye who are quickened by a portion of the celestial glory shall then receive of the same, even a fulness" (D&amp;amp;C 88:28–29). What does that mean? If we strive to live the gospel, our bodies will be quickened by a portion of celestial light in this life and then will receive a fulness of celestial glory in the Resurrection.<br><br>Brothers and sisters, as the Prophet Joseph Smith said, "The great principle of happiness consists in having a body." It contains the sacred powers of life, it is an instrument of the mind, and, as a temple of God, it increases one's capacity for light and truth. It is important that we respect the body through modest dress, by refraining from immoral acts, and by keeping it clean and unmarred.<br><br>There is one more aspect of the physical body that should be mentioned. It is the strength of the body over a lifetime. Have you ever thought about the strength pattern as you live life? This life pattern of physical strength and its relationship to spiritual growth provides a perspective for the choices you make.<br><h2><b><i>Physical Strength During Mortality</i></b></h2><br>Data from physiological studies illustrate the muscular strength of the human body from birth to old age. A horizontal axis marks off ages from birth until we die, and a vertical axis measures the muscular strength of the body. At birth a graph line begins near the bottom of the chart, showing how a baby's strength is small relative to that of an adult. Strength then increases rapidly as the human body develops from childhood to adulthood. The strength of the physical body peaks near 30 years of age. It is well documented that muscular strength in both males and females begins a long descent after 30 as the body slowly deteriorates until death occurs.<sup>4</sup><br><br>Where are you on the graph? You are all near or approaching the peak. Since most in the audience tonight are under 30, note that you have only experienced increasing physical strength. For the most part, you only know what it is like to become stronger and stronger. But just wait. It will not be many years before all of you will be over the hill and on a downward course. What will it be like then?<br><br>Is it any wonder that many of life's key decisions are made during the period from age 18 to age 30? You are nearing peak strength. You feel indestructible! Death is some distant event that may never occur. From a physical point of view, the twenties are a particularly important time to marry and begin a family because you are in good health and will have the energy required to raise a family in the decades that follow.<br><br>As one looks at the chart, one might ask: Why the long, slow decline? Are there lessons to be learned? The answer is yes! The mind and spirit are taught many lessons. One of the first, as you start down the hill, is that you learn that you are mortal! When I was your age, death was not an option. Like you, it was so far off that I hardly thought about it. Today I am much further out on the curve and experience the aches and pains that come with the body's steady deterioration. Now death is right before me.<br><br>I have learned that life is short regardless of how long one lives. Also, I understand more fully the need for a Savior. There is no way I can overcome spiritual and physical death without His grace. I also realize that many of the blessings received in later life stem from decisions made between 18 and 30. My greatest blessings in life stem from the decisions to (1) marry Sister Bateman shortly after a mission, (2) to finish our educational pursuits together even though resources were limited, and (3) to listen to the whisperings of the Holy Spirit in laying a foundation for our future life.<br><br>As one experiences the downhill portion of later life, the inevitable aches and pains serve an important purpose. They help one put off King Benjamin's "natural man [or woman]" as we learn to yield to the "enticings of the Holy Spirit" (Mosiah 3:19). The aches and pains of later life teach humility, the meaning of long-suffering, the importance of patience, and an appreciation for the qualities of kindness and love, and they help one learn moderation in all things. It's interesting. These are the divine attributes. For the faithful, the slow deterioration of the body serves as a refining instrument for the spirit.<br><br>Taking care of your body in your early years increases the chances of living a long life. That is important because many of the important lessons of life are learned in the later part. One pack of cigarettes per day shortens life by 10 to 13 years. It also diminishes our strength as we age. Drugs shorten life even more. No wonder the Lord provided a health law in every dispensation.<br><br>My young friends, the Lord's Atonement and Resurrection affirm the importance of the physical body. May we understand and respect the important roles that it plays in mortality and in eternity.<br><h2><b>Intelligence, or Light and Truth</b></h2><br>The second grand purpose in mortality is the acquisition of intelligence, or light and truth (see D&amp;amp;C 93:36). The dictionary defines <i>intelligence</i> as "the capacity to acquire and apply knowledge."<sup>5</sup> The Lord's definition, though, is a little bit different. He defines <i>intelligence</i> with an additional element. It is not only "the capacity to acquire and apply knowledge" but the wisdom to use it righteously. In the Lord's words, "Light and truth forsake that evil one" (D&amp;amp;C 93:37).<br><br>Light is an attribute of Deity. The Apostle John stated that "God is light, and in him is no darkness at all" (1 John 1:5). Jesus stated that He was "the light of the world" (John 8:12). The gospel is a message of light (see D&amp;amp;C 45:9). A key mortal objective for all of God's children is the acquisition of light--to become more like Him. We are to prove ourselves in mortality through obedience to His commandments. And then the reward is added glory or light (see Abraham 3:25–26). The Doctrine and Covenants records, "That which is of God is light; and he that receiveth light, and continueth in God, receiveth more light; and that light groweth brighter and brighter until the perfect day" (D&amp;amp;C 50:24).<br><br>The Lord has provided two sources of spiritual light. The first is the Light of Christ. This light is given to every person so that he or she "may know good from evil" (Moroni 7:15–16; see also John 1:9; D&amp;amp;C 84:46). The second source is the gift of the Holy Ghost, which is bestowed on members of the Church. The Holy Ghost has many gifts that enlighten and strengthen us, especially in our testimony of Jesus Christ, but also in other ways.<br><h2><b><i>Three Spiritual Paths</i></b></h2><br>There are three different spiritual paths that one may take through life. The upper path leads to the celestial kingdom. As noted earlier, those on this path receive more and more light throughout life. This is because they "are wise and have received the truth, and have taken the Holy Spirit for their guide" (D&amp;amp;C 45:57).<br><br><i>They are they who received the testimony of Jesus, and believed on his name and were baptized . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . and receive the Holy Spirit by the laying on of . . . hands. . . .</i><br><br><i>They are they . . . who have received of his fulness, and of his glory.</i> [D&amp;amp;C 76:51–52, 56]<br><br>These individuals learn from both the Holy Ghost and the Light of Christ. The celestial curve rises rapidly for young members of the Church because baptism and the promptings of the Holy Ghost over a period of years bring significant light to an individual.<br><br>The second path leads to the terrestrial kingdom. There is spiritual growth along this path as well, but the trajectory falls short of what might have been. Along this middle path, men and women accept and learn from the Light of Christ but not from the Holy Ghost. They<br><br><i>are honorable men of the earth, who were blinded by the craftiness of men.</i><br><br><i>These are they who receive of his glory, but not of his fulness.</i> [D&amp;amp;C 76:75–76]<br><br>The third, or bottom, path leads to the telestial kingdom. The travelers on this road reject even the Light of Christ as well as the Holy Ghost. They cheat, steal, commit adultery, and love to make a lie (see D&amp;amp;C 76:103). Although they will receive telestial glory in the Resurrection, these individuals lose light during mortality. In Paul's words, they have "their conscience seared with a hot iron" (1 Timothy 4:2) and do not respond to the promptings of the Light of Christ.<br><h2><b><i>The Effects of Sin</i></b></h2><br>Now let us examine the effects of sin. Suppose one is traveling on the celestial path and commits a sin. The effect is a loss of light.<sup>6</sup> Embracing evil lowers the trajectory of one's path as the Holy Spirit withdraws. Is it possible to return to the upper road? Yes, one may return through the process of faith in the Lord Jesus Christ and repentance. Suppose someone steals another person's wallet. What must be done to reverse the course and climb to the higher road? A recognition of the sin, a feeling of remorse, asking for the person's and the Lord's forgiveness, expressing regret, returning the wallet, and refraining from further sin will start one's return to the upper path. It will take time to prove oneself, but it is possible to remove the effects of the sin through faith in the Lord's Atonement.<br><br>Now, consider another circumstance much more serious. Suppose through fornication a young man and a young woman rob each other of their virtue. The loss of light is greater here than in the case of the wallet's theft. Can these young people return to the celestial path? Yes, it is possible, but how is it done? How do they become clean again? The young man cannot return virtue to the young woman, nor can the woman return virtue to the man. The only person who can renew their virtue is the Lord. He is the only one with the capacity to restore virtue and cleanse the young people.<br><br>What are the conditions? Obviously it is not enough for the young people to forgive each other and refrain in the future. They must build a relationship with the Lord, beginning with a confession to the bishop. They must seek the Lord's forgiveness and earn His trust! It will take time and faith and effort on their part to be whole again. Thankfully the Holy Spirit will return and lead them back to the higher road as they partake of the fruits of the Atonement through their faith and diligence in keeping the commandments.<br><br>Brothers and sisters, it is important to stay on the celestial path. Respect your bodies and refrain from sin, and the added light you receive through mortality will stay with you and will be yours in the world to come (see D&amp;amp;C 130:18–19).<br><h2><b>The Family</b></h2><br>The third great purpose of mortality is to marry and initiate one's own eternal family. President Hinckley has stated that there is nothing more precious than one's family.<sup>7</sup> In the recent worldwide satellite broadcast on the family, Elder L. Tom Perry quoted from a booklet known as the <i>Family Guidebook.</i> It states: "The family is the basic unit of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and the most important social unit in time and eternity."<sup>8</sup><br><br>Joseph Smith taught:<br><br><i>Except a man and his wife enter into an everlasting covenant and be married for eternity, while in this probation, by the power and authority of the Holy Priesthood, they will cease to increase when they die; that is, they will not have any children after the resurrection.</i><sup>9</sup><br><br>The family proclamation states that "marriage between a man and a woman is ordained of God and . . . the family is central to the Creator's plan for the eternal destiny of His children."<sup>10</sup><br><br>Why are marriage and family so important? Elder David A. Bednar in the recent worldwide satellite broadcast gave two doctrinal reasons. The first is: "The natures of male and female spirits complete and perfect each other, and therefore men and women are intended to progress together toward exaltation."<sup>11</sup> That's why Peter said the man and the woman are heirs together of eternal life (see 1 Peter 3:7). And Paul said that "neither is the man without the woman, neither the woman without the man, in the Lord" (1 Corinthians 11:11). "By divine design, both a man and a woman are needed to bring children into mortality and to provide the best setting for the rearing and nurturing of children."<sup>12</sup><br><br>Men and women complement each other physically, spiritually, emotionally, and mentally. We have different strengths, and a righteous marriage is a partnership in which spiritual growth is enhanced because of the differences between the man and the woman.<br><br>The family is the ideal setting for teaching children. Father and mother are important role models. Children's self-respect and identity are shaped by the love their father and mother have for each other and for them. The home and family are where children experience the bonds of love, where they learn virtue, honesty, and good citizenship. The home is where children learn respect for other people. In other words, the family is the ideal organization for the spiritual growth of both parents and children.<br><br>The world's view of marriage and family is different from ours. Generally those of the world see marriage as a temporal association, a short-term relationship. For some the purpose is mostly individual pleasure and satisfaction. When difficult times occur, the incentives to maintain the association diminish, and the relationship is often terminated. More and more adults are choosing not even to marry but to live together without a formal relationship. Needless to say, their associations are the shortest of all.<br><h3><b><i>Three Kinds of Relationships</i></b></h3><br>There are differences between (1) no marriage, (2) a civil marriage, and (3) a marriage for time and eternity. The first is the association between a man and a woman when there is no contract. The two individuals live together but stand apart. The promises shared are limited, and there is no formal connection between them. Nothing but personal satisfaction seems to be their goal. Because a contract does not exist, children born in this circumstance have little security. The relationship is fragile, and duration is almost always short.<br><br>Second is a civil marriage. Promises are made between the man and the woman as a result of the marriage contract. They promise to care for each other until death parts them. The contract is recognized by civil authority. The children have some security because of the intent of the parents and the promises made. Unfortunately, more and more civil marriages are falling by the wayside as people break those promises. In many circumstances, broken promises leave men, women, and children destitute.<br><br>Third is a marriage for time and eternity. This relationship is established by a sacred covenant between the man, the woman, and the Lord. The woman covenants with the man and the man covenants with the woman, and the two together covenant with the Lord. In these covenant promises the man promises the woman that he will honor and care for her and that no one will come between them. "No one" includes father, mother, friends, and certainly another woman. He also promises the Lord that he will live the gospel and treat the woman with the respect she deserves. Similar promises are made by the woman to the man and then to the Lord. Finally, the Lord extends marvelous promises to the man and woman and their posterity based on their faithfulness.<br><br>This triangular relationship is much more stable. When understood, these potentially infinite relationships increase confidence, deepen commitments, and give greater strength to the marriage. Notice that the closer the man and the woman come to the Lord, the closer they come to each other. The secret in marriage is to live the gospel and turn the triangle into an eternal circle.<br><br>The eternal family is one of three great gifts of mortality. Your stage in life, both physically and spiritually, is designed for you to initiate it. You have the Holy Ghost to guide you in these important decisions. But you must make the choice. The Holy Ghost will not make it for you. That is not His responsibility, nor will He rob you of your agency. The Holy Ghost will, however, bring peace to your soul when you make a good decision.<br><br>Brothers and sisters, remember the great gifts of mortality: the physical body, additional light, and the eternal family. These gifts are sacred. May the Lord bless you during this wonderful phase of life that is yours to live so that you may receive all three of these great promises in their fulness. It is my prayer that the Lord will bless you to this end, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Merrill J.

<h1> Hath Made with [Us] an Everlasting Covenant, Ordered in All Things, and Sure&quot; - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Brothers and sisters, I am humbled at the opportunity to be with you today. I express thanks for the music we have heard and hope my words will complement the spirit of worship it has brought to this setting.<br><br>Ever since I was a young man, music has played a central role in my life. As a composer I have spent countless hours in front of blank manuscript paper attempting to arrange collections of notes into musical expressions. Finding the right sequences of notes and chords does not come easily for me, as a quick glance through my sketchbooks will reveal. Lines, arrows, and numbers show how one chord is connected with another in order to create a phrase that projects the music forward, resulting in a sense of progression and, eventually, arrival. Many possibilities are explored until the music feels not only acceptable but also correct and complete. In the end, the music is right because the notes and rhythms are in the right <i>order.</i><br><br>It is of order I wish to speak today. Order is "a state in which everything is in its correct or appropriate place" and "in which the laws and rules regulating ... behavior ... are observed and authority is obeyed."<sup>1</sup> It can be seen in mathematical logic, games, grammatical structures, and architectural forms--to name only a few examples. It is evident in the fixed courses of "the earth and all the planets," said the Lord, and in the law given "unto all things, by which they move in their times and their seasons."<sup>2</sup> As order is evident in the creation of all things the Lord has made and in all He does, seeking greater order in our lives will help us understand His divine nature and become more like Him.<br><br>Poets, playwrights, and prophets have all commented on the nature of order. The great English poet Alexander Pope wrote, "Order is Heav'n's first law."<sup>3</sup> In <i>Twelfth Night,</i> Shakespeare's character Maria tells Sir Toby, "You must confine yourself within the modest limits of order."<sup>4</sup> Paul counseled the Corinthians, "Let all things be done decently and in order."<sup>5</sup> Perhaps it is King Benjamin's address that best teaches us about the relationship between order and balance:<br><br><i>And see that all these things are done in wisdom and order; for it is not requisite that a man should run faster than he has strength. And again, it is expedient that he should be diligent, that thereby he might win the prize; therefore, all things must be done in order.</i><sup>6</sup><br><br>Having this kind of balance and order in our own lives is a requirement for effective service in our homes and in public service and Church callings. For example, the Lord has plainly tutored priesthood holders about the relationship between order in their personal lives and power in the priesthood. "Amen," said the Lord, "to the priesthood or the authority of that man"<sup>7</sup> whose life and proclamations are not backed by actions aligned with righteous principles. All of us, not only priesthood holders, must carefully guard against situations in which our behavior is not aligned with our beliefs; for where hypocrisy is present, its negative power becomes greater than that of any position or any righteous intent on our part. Thus, in 1833, the Lord counseled the newly organized First Presidency of the Church to "set in order" both their own houses as well as "to preside in council, and set in order all the affairs of this church and kingdom."<sup>8</sup> Not two months later the entire First Presidency, along with Bishop Newel K. Whitney, were again given firm reminders to set in order their families.<sup>9</sup> The counsel the Lord gave them to be "more diligent and concerned at home"<sup>10</sup> teaches us volumes about the consistency we need in ordering and regulating all of the dimensions of our lives.<br><h2><b>Order, Offerings, and Priesthood Ordinances</b></h2><br>Another important dimension of order in the priesthood is seen in the Old Testament, in which many of the references to the word <i>order</i> are directly related to temple and sacrificial offerings. In Exodus 40 we read about the rearing of the tabernacle. Here the Lord gave detailed instructions about the ark of the covenant, the altars, and the table on which Moses is to "set in order the things that are to be set in order upon it," including the bread. Aaron is then to bring his sons and prepare them to "minister unto me in the priest's office: for their anointing shall surely be an everlasting priesthood throughout their generations."<sup>11</sup><br><br>Again relating to order and offerings, the Lord instructed Joseph Smith in this dispensation:<br><br><i>Behold, mine house is a house of order, saith the Lord God, and not a house of confusion.</i><br><br><i>Will I accept of an offering, saith the Lord, that is not made in my name?</i><br><br><i>Or will I receive ... that which I have not appointed?</i><br><br><i>And will I appoint unto you, saith the Lord, except it be by law, even as I and my Father ordained unto you, before the world was?</i><sup>12</sup><br><br>Clearly, from before time we were taught of the order in the priesthood and its ordinances, and this knowledge can bless us now as we work to make acceptable our offerings to the Lord.<br><br>That the principle of order is linked with the priesthood is not surprising, given that the true name of the Melchizedek Priesthood is "the Holy Priesthood, after the Order of the Son of God."<sup>13</sup> Indeed, all order flows from God's authority established in the greater priesthood and its ordinances, by which "the power of godliness is manifest"<sup>14</sup> unto us.<br><br>Elder Boyd K. Packer has defined the relationship between order, ordain, and ordinance as follows:<br><br>"<i>Order--</i>To put in ranks or rows, in proper sequence or relationship.<br><br><i>Ordain--</i>The process of putting things in rows of proper relationship.<br><br><i>Ordinance--</i>The ceremony by which things are put in proper order."<sup>15</sup><br><br>Regular participation in saving priesthood ordinances helps us order our lives. Elder Neal A. Maxwell wrote that "ordinances are intended to cast our minds forward to specific promises and to our developmental possibilities."<sup>16</sup><br><br>Alma confirmed this when he stated:<br><br><i>These ordinances were given ... that thereby the people might look forward on the Son of God, it being a type of his order, or it being his order, and this that they might look forward to him for a remission of their sins, that they might enter into the rest of the Lord.</i><sup>17</sup><br><br>Ordinances point us to Christ and to His saving power. As an example, think of the order that arises from something as short as the sacrament prayer. In remarkable yet dignified simplicity, this single-sentence ordinance affects the lives of millions of Latter-day Saints across the world each week. Acting in concert with our baptismal covenant, it calls upon our wills, asking that we take upon us the name of Christ. It calls upon our minds, asking us to always remember Him. It calls upon our hearts, asking us to keep His commandments.<sup>18</sup> And it calls upon our strength, asking us to renew this covenant "often"<sup>19</sup> and to be obedient until the end of our lives.<sup>20</sup> In return, we are promised the constant and guiding presence of a member of the Godhead in our personal lives who witnesses of the Father and the Son and directs us down the "strait and narrow path which leads to eternal life."<sup>21</sup><br><br>What mercy and power there is in this exchange of promises between God and us! And the depth of the promises only becomes greater as we progress along the path of ordinances and covenants. These sacred ceremonies bind us to God and to each other with the promise that all of the blessings He possesses will be ours to share with our families across generations through our obedience and faithfulness.<sup>22</sup><br><br>These great promises awaken a fixed desire in our hearts to order and align our lives with God. Participation in the ordinances is not merely a transaction or tutorial; when approached worthily, it is in reality a direct and personal interaction with God through the authority of His appointed servants. Thus, as Elder Robert D. Hales noted, they have a transforming effect on our sense of loyalty: "When we understand our baptismal covenant and the gift of the Holy Ghost, it will change our lives and will establish our <i>total allegiance</i> to the kingdom of God."<sup>23</sup><br><br>Ordinances and covenants act as a compass to the soul, guiding and correcting our present course and helping us navigate toward future possibilities. Elder Packer has compared them to<br><br><i>a sextant in our minds infinitely more refined and precise than that of any mariner. It functions on the principle of light from celestial sources. ... If we will set that sextant in our minds to the words</i> ordinance <i>and</i> covenant, <i>and then look up, light will come through. Then you will know how to fix your position and plot your course.</i><sup>24</sup><br><br>Fixing our position on ordinances and covenants is the only sure way we can achieve exaltation, because they define the requirements upon which our promises rest.<sup>25</sup> Again, quoting Elder Packer, "Ordinances and covenants become our credentials for admission into His presence. To worthily receive them is the quest of a lifetime; to keep them thereafter is the challenge of mortality."<sup>26</sup><br><h2><b>Discerning Order</b></h2><br>Thankfully, through the Light of Christ and the Holy Ghost, we are able to tell when our lives are not in alignment with our covenants. As my favorite <i>Star Wars</i> character, Yoda, might say, "Notice we do, when out of order things are." Yoda's syntax is understandable but never correct--at least not on this planet! Unlike your performance in English class, apparently, Yoda's mastery of the Force and his leadership of the Jedi are not dependent upon good grammar. The grammar and syntax of our lives, however, must become correctly ordered, for our words and works are entered into the book of life, out of which we will be judged.<sup>27</sup><br><br>Being ready for that final exam requires exercising judgment and creating order in our lives each and every day. Moroni taught, "It is given unto [us] to judge, that [we] may know good from evil; and the way to judge is ... plain." He assured us that we can know of these things "with a perfect knowledge," being able to judge good from evil "as the daylight is from the dark night."<sup>28</sup><br><br>Alma taught us that spiritual knowledge is "real ... because it is light; and whatsoever is light, is good, because it is discernible."<sup>29</sup> Truth always brings clarity. Conversely, actions or ideas that cause "a stupor of thought"<sup>30</sup> or lack confirmation and clarity are incorrect and take us down paths we should not go.<br><br>Disorder is not a condition we should leave unattended when we can exercise our agency to correct it. It leads to dysfunction and, eventually, to spiritual death. Satan and his forces of destruction are doing all they can to disrupt the order of families, communities, nations, political and educational institutions, and the minds of men and women throughout the world. We must guard in every way against the pernicious threats he makes to stable and happy lives and to truth itself. The ultimate disorder he seeks to perpetuate is to have us confuse good and evil--a work he began in the Garden of Eden and continues today.<sup>31</sup><br><br>Brothers and sisters, in God's house there is no confusion about right and wrong! There is no dysfunction or disruption. There is order, which is life affirming and light giving. Order leads us, and by cultivating it we reap attendant virtues that are powerful in helping us keep covenants--including restraint, judgment, discipline, and submission.<br><h2><b>Fostering Order in Our Lives</b></h2><br>How can we increase order in our lives? As mentioned earlier, we can obey. Firm obedience<sup>32</sup> keeps our minds clear and strong, our thoughts and spirits clean. We are then entitled to know and do the will of the Lord.<br><br>We can ask the right questions of the Lord and listen carefully to His answers. As we come to hear His voice speak to our minds, we learn that He is an instructor who is focused, purposeful, undeviating, clear in His communication, and powerful in His ability to direct. These experiences in prayer tune our thoughts and actions so that they will be in harmony with His will.<br><br>We can study the word of the Lord, which will "divide asunder all the cunning and the snares ... of the devil, and lead [us] in a strait and narrow course ... and land [our] immortal souls ... in the kingdom of heaven."<sup>33</sup><br><br>We can exercise patience, knowing that ultimate order will come only after we "have endured the crosses of the world, and despised the shame of it."<sup>34</sup> In the words of one of today's hymns, "Leave to thy God to order and provide; / In ev'ry change he faithful will remain."<sup>35</sup><br><br>Lastly, we can seek intelligence and make our eye single to the glory of God. We know intelligence is light and truth.<sup>36</sup> Light casts out darkness, and we eventually are left with the blazing clarity of truth, seeing things exactly as they are and will be.<sup>37</sup> This knowledge, unadorned in its pure and holy nature, will literally order our souls, causing us to become sanctified and comprehend all things.<sup>38</sup><br><h2><b>Order, Covenants, and Brigham Young University</b></h2><br>Effective learning and teaching at BYU--indeed, all that we do here--is dependent upon the strength of order and the promises associated with our covenants. The process of learning involves ordering and sequencing information; separating, examining, and testing ideas; and then adding them together so they become whole in our minds and in our hearts.<br><br>The Lord told the Kirtland Saints: "Organize yourselves; prepare every needful thing; and establish a house, even a house of prayer, a house of fasting, a house of faith, a house of <i>learning,</i> a house of glory, a house of <i>order,</i> a house of God."<sup>39</sup><br><br>At BYU we act under the charge to be a unique university, to build a house of learning not only through study but also through the exercise of lively faith. Why? So that we, in the words of Joseph's prayer of dedication of the Kirtland Temple, "may be found worthy ... to secure a fulfilment of the promises ... made unto us ... in the revelations."<sup>40</sup> Those revelations promise "a time to come in the which nothing shall be withheld," in which the Almighty will pour "down knowledge from heaven upon the heads of the Latter-day Saints."<sup>41</sup><br><br>That sounds to me like a promise any university would revel in! Realizing those blessings will require us to keep our covenants. Robert Millet, former dean of Religious Education, wrote:<br><br><i>Brigham Young University must become a covenant community if we are to enjoy those divine powers that are channeled through covenant. Covenants provide direction. Covenants establish parameters and limits. Covenants bestow and extend vision.</i><sup>42</sup><br><br>Those parameters and limits include our special Honor Code, to which I believe we can and should give greater attention. Kim Clark, president of BYU--Idaho, recently counseled students there on this important topic, from which I quote one sentence that is a key for us individually and as a community: "Obedience to the <i>small</i> things creates a spirit of obedience in <i>all</i> things."<sup>43</sup><br><br>That this BYU community would establish and achieve its prophetic vision is something for which many of us hope and pray and for which all of us are responsible. President Kimball reminded us:<br><br><i>We must do more than pray for these outcomes at BYU, though we must surely pray. We must take thought. We must make effort. We must be patient. We must be professional. We must be spiritual. Then, in the process of time, this will become the fully anointed university of the Lord about which so much has been spoken in the past.</i><sup>44</sup><br><br>I believe "fully anointed" to be the description of a Zion university, a united order of learning.<br><h2><b>Order Through the Atonement</b></h2><br>In our attempts to order our lives, we will undoubtedly fall short. Any of my closest associates and family members know I fail to order all within my stewardship. How thankful we are for forgiving friends and for time to improve--both made possible through the perfect Atonement, which provides us the transforming power sufficient to order and align us completely with the light and truth that is in our Savior, Jesus Christ. It is the agent of the Atonement that enables us the opportunity and possibility to finally order and undeviatingly regulate our souls. Until that day of fullness comes, it is the Atonement that makes up the difference between our inabilities and our responsibilities.<br><br>As commanded by the Lord, Abraham took Isaac, his only son, "to the place which God had told him of; and Abraham built an altar there, and laid the wood in order, and bound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar upon the wood."<sup>45</sup> In fulfillment of this "shadow of good things to come,"<sup>46</sup> Christ's offering for us was made by One whose life was in perfect order, which He faithfully reported to the Father:<br><br><i>I have glorified thee on the earth: I have finished the work which thou gavest me to do....</i><br><br><i>And now come I to thee.</i><sup>47</sup><br><br>Mercifully, brothers and sisters, He does not want to come alone: "Father," prayed Jesus, "I will that they also, whom thou hast given me, be with me where I am."<sup>48</sup><br><br>Surely, returning to our loving Father is the final purpose of our attempts to order our lives, that in full and complete wholeness, sanctified through the blood of the Lamb, we might "dwell in the presence of God and his Christ"<sup>49</sup> and belong to the order of those who have overcome, "they into whose hands the Father has given all things."<sup>50</sup><br><br>Joseph Smith taught, "This is a station to which no man ever arrived in a moment: he must have been instructed in the government and laws of that kingdom by proper degrees."<sup>51</sup> Thankfully, the Lord of order will lead us "line upon line, precept upon precept," consoling us and "confirming our hope" along the way.<sup>52</sup><br><br>Elder Neal A. Maxwell said, "Never has anyone offered so much to so many in so few words as when Jesus said, 'Here am I, send me' (Abr. 3:27)."<sup>53</sup> He has kept His covenant with us. Let us now, like Abraham, lay the wood in order on the altar and be found "willing to observe [our] covenants by sacrifice--yea, every sacrifice which ... the Lord shall command."<sup>54</sup> We will then be accepted of Him, and from our sincere yet incomplete efforts His mercy will flow to us until we become wells "of living water, springing up unto everlasting life."<sup>55</sup><br><br>I bear witness of God, our Father, and of His Son, Jesus Christ, in whom "he hath made with [us] an everlasting covenant, ordered in all things, and sure."<sup>56</sup> I express thanks for the special place in His restored kingdom this great university occupies. May we order our lives through the divine pattern of ordinances and covenants, I pray in His holy name, even Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Stephen M.

<h1>e Very Root of Christian Doctrine&quot; - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
President and Sister Samuelson, my former colleagues at BYU, and friends, I am honored to speak to you today. Speakers at this podium have changed my life. I feel the burden of responsibility. I am thankful for the prayer and the inspirational music.<br><br>You should know that today is significant in the life of our family, not simply because I am speaking here but because it is also the 25th birthday of my son, Robert. Now you may think, "What a parochial thing to bring into a setting like this," but historians will recognize that 25 years ago today something else very significant happened in the history of BYU. It was 25 years ago today that BYU beat UCLA in the NCAA men's basketball tournament and Danny Ainge outscored the entire UCLA team in the first half. With hopes that this anniversary is a sign for good things to come for all BYU student athletes, I proceed.<br><br>One of the many enjoyable facets of my experience working at BYU was regular interaction with Elder Henry B. Eyring of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, whose responsibilities then included serving as commissioner of the Church Educational System. I remember him saying that he has learned from President Hinckley that we must do better at getting the gospel down into our own hearts and the hearts of those we love and serve. That is a challenge from the prophet. We must constantly ask ourselves how to meet that challenge. Today I offer a suggestion born of my recent experience as president of a BYU stake.<br><br>Years ago Elder Boyd K. Packer gave a general conference address titled "The Mediator." In that address Elder Packer said:<br><br>[The Atonement of Christ] <i>is the very root of Christian doctrine. You may know much about the gospel as it branches out from there, but if you only know the branches and those branches do not touch that root, if they have been cut free from that truth, there will be no life nor substance nor redemption in them.</i> [Boyd K. Packer, "The Mediator," <i>Ensign,</i> May 1977, 56]<br><br>I will confess to you that I have participated in--indeed, I have taught--many lessons that, although interesting and motivational, according to Elder Packer's guide had "no life nor substance nor redemption in them" because they weren't directly linked to the Atonement of Christ. That's a serious criticism of much of what we do, and I believe it's on the mark. I believe that one way--the best way, and possibly the only way--to meet President Hinckley's challenge to do better at getting the gospel down into our hearts and the hearts of those we love and serve is to focus <i>all</i> we do on the Atonement of Christ. And so, as a newly called stake presidency, we tried to do just that.<br><br>We laid down a rule that every sacrament meeting talk and every lesson in Sunday School, Relief Society, and priesthood meetings must be related to the Atonement of Christ in a direct and express way. Our goal was to have all of our meetings filled with "life [and] substance [and] redemption" by having them connected to "the very root of Christian doctrine": the Atonement of Christ. We told the bishops that if they wanted a sacrament meeting about the principles of emergency preparedness--important principles, to be sure--that meeting would be about "Emergency Preparedness and the Atonement of Christ." If you cannot figure out the link between the topic you are to teach and the Atonement of Christ, you have either not thought about it enough or you shouldn't be talking about it at church. Your topic may be fine for the city council, your neighborhood organization, or the commercial break during <i>SportsCenter,</i> but in our limited time in church, we must be talking about the Atonement of Christ.<br><br>This is what they did in the church in Alma's day, the first church described in detail in the scriptures. They were given a mission similar to ours: prepare a people for the coming of the Risen Lord. Their experiences have special meaning to us as we try to fulfill our latter-day responsibilities. Note how the Book of Mormon describes their teaching:<br><br><i>And he commanded them that they should teach nothing save it were the things which he had taught, and which had been spoken by the mouth of the holy prophets.</i><br><br><i>Yea, even he commanded them that they should preach nothing save it were repentance and faith on the Lord, who had redeemed his people.</i> [Mosiah 18:19–20]<br><br>They taught only from the scriptures and the words of the prophets, and they taught only two principles that are inextricably intertwined: "repentance," that we have the constant need to improve; and "faith on the Lord, who had redeemed his people." This was not faith in general--and not even faith in Christ as Friend, Good Shepherd, Prince of Peace, or any one of a number of important roles He plays--but faith in a very particular aspect of Christ's mission: faith in His ability to redeem us, to improve us. He did that through His atoning sacrifice.<br><br>We thought we'd try what Alma's church did. We tried to link every principle taught in our meetings to the Atonement in a direct and express way. Now that isn't hard to do in sacrament meeting, because the bishopric can pick the topics. And it isn't hard to do when the study guide lesson is on the Atonement or repentance. But what do you do when the study guide lesson is on tithing or visiting teaching or the value of education? That's a little tougher.<br><br>We made it clear that we expected the teachers to teach the approved curriculum. There is strength that comes from teaching materials approved by priesthood leaders. But it isn't always obvious how the assigned material relates to the Atonement. To address that challenge, we had two suggestions.<br><br>First, we urged teachers to find examples of the principles being taught from the life of Christ. When we are talking about His life and using the words He said, we are remembering Him, and a power comes into our teaching that is otherwise not present.<br><br>Second, we encouraged teachers to see how the principle taught was either part of Heavenly Father's effort to draw us closer to Him through Christ (the vertical pull of the Atonement) or a principle that could draw us closer to our fellow humans through Christ (the horizontal pull of the Atonement).<br><br>So, how did it work? Pretty well. People got excited about this approach. We didn't think there was any way that we could--or even should--try to measure its value, but it seemed right, so we pressed forward.<br><br>Why did it feel right? Why did it taste so good to--using the words of Nephi--"talk of Christ, ... rejoice in Christ, [and] preach of Christ" (2 Nephi 25:26) in all of our meetings? Because when we are speaking of what the Savior has done for us, we are at the core of the meaning of life, we are connected to "the very root of Christian doctrine," and we are doing what Christ and His prophets have asked us to do.<br><br>Joseph Smith said:<br><br><i>The fundamental principles of our religion are the testimony of the Apostles and Prophets, concerning Jesus Christ, that He died, was buried, and rose again the third day, and ascended into heaven; and all other things which pertain to our religion are only appendages to it.</i> [<i>Teachings,</i> 121]<br><br>In the temple recommend interview, we are asked, "Do you have a testimony of the Atonement of Christ and of His role as Savior and Redeemer?" In my experience as a bishop and a stake president, I can happily report that I have never had anyone answer that question other than yes; yet I have long had a concern that we don't fully appreciate that question. I think it significant that of the many roles of Christ, we are asked about only two: His role as Savior and His role as Redeemer. There must be something about these roles that is particularly important to the temple--a place where He binds us to Himself through covenants.<br><br>Like all stake presidents, I worried about the members of the stake. I worried about the things one might expect a priesthood leader of single adults to worry about, but I also worried about whether the members of the stake had "a testimony of the Atonement of Christ and of His role as Savior and Redeemer." I had the sense that most of them loved Christ--no small thing--but I worried that not enough of them knew Him as their Savior (one who had saved them) or their Redeemer (one who had bought them). While thinking about this one day, I was reading my favorite chapter in the Book of Mormon--3 Nephi 11--and I noticed some things I never had before.<br><br>Many have commented that the visit of the Risen Lord Jesus Christ to the Book of Mormon people was a foreshadowing of His Second Coming. As we pay careful attention to what the Book of Mormon tells us about that experience, we can learn valuable lessons as we prepare for Christ's return. These people were the righteous remnant, those who had heeded the warnings of the prophets. They were prepared to meet the Lord. The story of that encounter is dramatic and moving and has profound implications for each of us.<br><br><i>And it came to pass</i> [that] <i>they cast their eyes up again towards heaven; and behold, they saw a Man descending out of heaven; and he was clothed in a white robe; and he came down and stood in the midst of them; and the eyes of the whole multitude were turned upon him, and they durst not open their mouths, even one to another, and wist not what it meant, for they thought it was an angel that had appeared unto them.</i> [3 Nephi 11:8]<br><br>They were in awe and a little confused. The Savior's first act of communication was "stretch[ing] forth his hand," showing the symbol and evidence of His sacrifice. Then He "spake unto the people, saying: Behold, I am Jesus Christ, whom the prophets testified shall come into the world" (3 Nephi 11:9–10). Those who were nearby couldn't help but notice the wound in His hand. He was not timid about that wound. He wanted it to be seen.<br><br>Next he said, "I am the light and the life of the world" (3 Nephi 11:11). He wanted them to understand that He is the Creator of this universe and that by Him the world is sustained today. Do you remember the next thing He wanted them to know about Him? His Atonement:<br><br><i>I have drunk out of that bitter cup which the Father hath given me, and have glorified the Father in taking upon me the sins of the world, in the which I have suffered the will of the Father in all things from the beginning.</i> [3 Nephi 11:11]<br><br>That was His message. He is the Anointed One of whom the prophets had testified. He is the Creator. He suffered for us.<br><br>Notice the response:<br><br><i>And it came to pass that when Jesus had spoken these words the whole multitude fell to the earth; for they remembered that it had been prophesied among them that Christ should show himself unto them after his ascension into heaven.</i> [3 Nephi 11:12]<br><br>What followed is, to me, the most sacred part of this experience. Jesus commanded them to come forward one by one and do something difficult:<br><br><i>Arise and come forth unto me, that ye may thrust your hands into my side, and also that ye may feel the prints of the nails in my hands and in my feet, that ye may know that I am the God of Israel, and the God of the whole earth, and have been slain for the sins of the world.</i> [3 Nephi 11:14]<br><br>There is a gruesome quality to this command. In our culture we hide scars, we don't display them, and we certainly don't ask others to feel them. But Christ wanted these people to have physical contact with these emblems of His suffering.<br><br><i>And it came to pass that the multitude went forth, and thrust their hands into his side, and did feel the prints of the nails in his hands and in his feet; and this they did do, going forth one by one until they had all gone forth</i> [all 2,500 of them]. [3 Nephi 11:15]<br><br>Some have suggested that this sacred experience took several hours.<br><br>Now please note carefully what happened next:<br><br><i>And when they had all gone forth and had witnessed for themselves, they did cry out with one accord, saying:</i><br><br><i>Hosanna! Blessed be the name of the Most High God! And they did fall down at the feet of Jesus, and did worship him.</i> [3 Nephi 11:16–17]<br><br>Notice what just happened. The second time these people fell at Jesus' feet, they "did worship him." That didn't happen the first time. The first time they may have fallen to the ground for any number of reasons: fear, awe, peer pressure. I don't know. But the second time they fell to worship Him. Why the different reaction from the first time? The second time they cried out in unison, "Hosanna!" which means, "Save us, now!" Why were these people, the righteous remnant, crying out to Christ for salvation now?<br><br>Let me suggest a possible answer. Although they had been obedient, perhaps they had not yet come to know Him as their Savior because they had not yet felt the need to be saved. They had led lives filled with good works. They knew Jesus as God, as Exemplar, maybe even as Friend. But maybe they didn't yet know Him as Savior. Their prayer wasn't, "Thank you for having saved us in the past and reminding us of that by your presence today." No, the prayer was a current plea: "Hosanna!" or "Save us, now!" That suggests to me that they were just then coming to know Him as Savior.<br><br>What had done that? What had turned them from good, obedient people to good, obedient people who now knew Jesus Christ as Savior? What had caused them to fall down at His feet to worship Him? It was physical contact with the emblems of His suffering.<br><br>That was what our stake needed so they could come to know Christ as their Savior and Redeemer: physical contact with the emblems of His suffering. But how do we make that happen? Then it occurred to me: We have that experience every Sunday when we partake of the sacrament of the Lord's Supper. We eat the broken bread, a token of His slain body. We drink the water, a symbol of His spilt blood. These are striking symbols intended to shock us, to evoke in us a deep sense of gratitude. Every Sunday you and I have physical contact with the emblems of Christ's suffering.<br><br>Remember the transforming effect that experience had on the people in the Book of Mormon? They were now prepared to be organized anew into a church community, to hear and put into practice the teachings of the Sermon on the Mount, to learn how to serve those who were powerless: the sick, the disabled, the children. This group transformed their society from one that had been divided by race and class and opportunity into a society in which<br><br><i>they had all things common among them; ... there were not rich and poor, bond and free, but they were all made free, and partakers of the heavenly gift ...</i><br><br><i>... because of the love of God which did dwell in the hearts of the people.</i> [4 Nephi 1:3, 15]<br><br>It began with a group of people who came to know Christ as their Savior because of the transforming experience of having physical contact with the emblems of His suffering. And we do that <i>every week!</i> I believe that our meaningful participation in the sacrament of the Lord's Supper will elicit the same response in us. We will cry out to Christ in our hearts, "Save us, now!" and we will fall down at His feet to worship Him.<br><br>As Elder Jeffrey R. Holland has taught:<br><br><i>It is the</i> wounded <i>Christ who is the captain of our soul--he who yet bears the scars of sacrifice, the lesions of love and humility and forgiveness.</i><br><br><i>Those wounds are what he invites young and old, then and now, to step forward and see and feel. ... Then we remember with Isaiah that it was for each of us that our Master was "despised and rejected ... ; a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief" (Isa. 53:3). All this we could remember when we are invited by a kneeling young priest to remember Christ always.</i> [Jeffrey R. Holland, "This Do in Remembrance of Me," <i>Ensign,</i> November 1995, 69; emphasis in original]<br><br>Brothers and sisters, we must come to know in great detail and with insight and feeling the events that make up the Atonement of Christ. We find in the Restoration of the gospel much help. In the Book of Mormon and the revelations given to the Prophet Joseph Smith, we have knowledge about the Atonement of Christ that should be our gift to the world. For example, the prophet Alma provided a remarkable insight that helps us better understand why the Savior persevered in Gethsemane and on Calvary. We know from the New Testament account that an important element of His motivation in those excruciating hours was His love for Heavenly Father. From Alma, however, we learn that He was also driven by His desire to help you and me:<br><br><i>And he will take upon him death, that he may loose the bands of death which bind his people; and he will take upon him their infirmities, that his bowels may be filled with mercy, according to the flesh, that he may know according to the flesh how to succor his people according to their infirmities.</i> [Alma 7:12]<br><br>In the last revelation Joseph Smith received before he was permitted to organize Christ's Church on the earth--in what was the capstone of Joseph Smith's preparation to be an Apostle of the Lord Jesus Christ--the Lord gave the only first-person detailed account of the suffering He endured so that we would not need to suffer the full effects of our disobedience:<br><br><i>For behold, I, God, have suffered these things for all, that they might not suffer if they would repent; ...</i><br><br><i>Which suffering caused myself, even God, the greatest of all, to tremble because of pain, and to bleed at every pore, and to suffer both body and spirit--and would that I might not drink the bitter cup, and shrink--</i> [D&amp;amp;C 19:16, 18]<br><br>There is something curious about this narrative. Verse 18 ends with a dash. The Savior did not complete His thought. Why? I don't know, but I am persuaded by the explanation that the Savior might have cut short His description of what He suffered because it was too painful for Him--some 1,800 years after the event--to complete the description (see Eugene England, <i>The Quality of Mercy</i> [Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1992], 52). Now what kind of a God do we worship? An awesome God who wants us to know that His love for us is infinite and eternal. A God who wants us to know that His love for us gave Him the strength to suffer for us. Knowing this ought to be enough to move us to submit our lives to Him in obedience and gratitude.<br><br>Some time ago I overheard a spirited discussion between two good people about a work of art that contained a realistic and disturbing portrayal of Christ's suffering. One of them objected to the work and said, "You know, I don't want to have to think about how much Christ has suffered." I thought that was an odd thing to say, because I don't believe that any of us has the license to avoid thinking about what Christ suffered. In fact, as I read the scriptures, that is among the things we are commanded to think about constantly.<br><br>As he was closing his account in the Book of Mormon, Moroni, anxious to give his readers motivation to "come unto Christ" (Moroni 10:30, 32), shared with us a personal letter from his father. It must have had a great impact on him, and now he hoped that it would have a great impact on us.<br><br><i>My son, be faithful in Christ; and may not the things which I have written grieve thee, to weigh thee down unto death; but may Christ lift thee up, and may his sufferings and death, and the showing his body unto our fathers, and his mercy and long-suffering, and the hope of his glory and of eternal life, rest in your mind forever.</i> [Moroni 9:25]<br><br>Among the things that are to "rest in [our] mind forever" are the "sufferings and death" of Christ. We should not avoid thinking about the price He paid to win our souls. Our hymns remind us of this truth. You'll recognize these lines:<br><br><i>I think of his hands pierced and bleeding to pay the debt!</i><br><br><i>Such mercy, such love, and devotion can I forget?</i><br><br>["I Stand All Amazed," <i>Hymns,</i> 1985, no. 193]<br><br><i>Let me not forget, O Savior,</i><br><br><i>Thou didst bleed and die for me.</i><br><br>["In Humility, Our Savior," <i>Hymns,</i> 1985, no. 172]<br><br><i>Think of me, thou ransomed one;</i><br><br><i>Think what I for thee have done.</i><br><br><i>With my blood that dripped like rain,</i><br><br><i>Sweat in agony of pain,</i><br><br><i>With my body on the tree</i><br><br><i>I have ransomed even thee.</i><br><br>["Reverently and Meekly Now," <i>Hymns,</i> 1985, no. 185]<br><br><i>Come, Saints, and drop a tear or two</i><br><br><i>For him who groaned beneath your load;</i><br><br><i>He shed a thousand drops for you,</i><br><br><i>A thousand drops of precious blood.</i><br><br>["He Died! The Great Redeemer Died," <i>Hymns,</i> 1985, no. 192]<br><br>In a recent sacrament meeting I followed along as the speaker read a familiar passage of scripture. You know it: "Remember the worth of souls is great in the sight of God" (D&amp;amp;C 18:10). I cannot recall where the speaker then went with his remarks. Wherever it was, I did not follow, because my mind seized hold on an idea in the next verse that I had never noticed before. To prove the great worth of our souls, the Lord told us:<br><br><i>For, behold, the Lord your Redeemer suffered death in the flesh; wherefore he suffered the pain of all men,</i> that all men might repent and come unto him. [D&amp;amp;C 18:11; emphasis added]<br><br>His suffering proves His love, but it does more. It is the means He uses to get us to "repent and come unto him." When we come to have some sense of what Christ has done for us--and, in particular, what He has suffered for us--our natural reaction as children of God is to want to show our gratitude and love by giving our lives to Him, by obeying Him. This verse is, in my opinion, the most succinct and profound description--from the Lord Himself--of how to get the gospel down into the hearts of you and me and those we serve.<br><br>We should not use appeals to pride or even to a rational calculation of what is in one's best interest: heaven or hell. The best way--the only way--to persuade people to repent and come unto Christ is to get them--to get us--to think about what He has done for us and especially about what He has suffered for us. That is how Christ does it. This is an insight from the Restoration that we can and must use in our homes, our meetings, and all of our teachings.<br><br>Several years ago I heard Elder Gerald N. Lund of the Quorum of the Seventy describe a magazine article about a school that taught people how to rock climb. The article discussed the concept of belaying--the fail-safe system that protects climbers. One climber gets into a safe position, fastens the rope securely in a fixed position, then calls to his companion, "You're on belay"--meaning, "I've got you." The director of the school, Alan Czenkusch, described his experience with belaying to the author of the article:<br><br><i>Belaying has brought Czenkusch his best and worst moments in climbing. Czenkusch once fell from a high precipice, yanking out three mechanical supports and pulling his belayer off a ledge. He was stopped, upside down, 10 feet from the ground when his spread-eagled belayer arrested the fall with the strength of his outstretched arms.</i><br><br><i>"Don saved my life," says Czenkusch. "How do you respond to a guy like that? Give him a used climbing rope for a Christmas present? No, you remember him. You always remember him."</i> [In Eric G. Anderson, "The Vertical Wilderness," <i>Private Practice,</i> November 1979, 21]<br><br>The Lord's current prophet, Gordon B. Hinckley, recently told us:<br><br><i>No member of this Church must ever forget the terrible price paid by our Redeemer, who gave His life that all men might live--the agony of Gethsemane, the bitter mockery of His trial, the vicious crown of thorns tearing at His flesh, the blood cry of the mob before Pilate, the lonely burden of His heavy walk along the way to Calvary, the terrifying pain as great nails pierced His hands and feet. ...</i><br><br><i>We cannot forget that. We must never forget it, for here our Savior, our Redeemer, the Son of God, gave Himself, a vicarious sacrifice for each of us.</i> [Gordon B. Hinckley, "The Symbol of Our Faith," <i>Ensign,</i> April 2005, 4]<br><br>To those words of a prophet of God and an Apostle of Jesus Christ, I add my witness. This is "the very root of Christian doctrine." May we always remember Him and the price He paid to win our souls is my prayer in the name of our Savior and Redeemer, the Lord Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Thomas B. Griffith was judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit when this devotional address was given on 14 March 2006.</i><br><br><i>© Thomas B. Griffith.</i>

<br>
<br>
The first thing I want to say today is that I want to testify I know Jesus Christ is our Savior and our Redeemer. I know by the power of the Holy Ghost that He stands at the head of this Church, guiding it through a living prophet, Gordon B. Hinckley. I am so thankful for that testimony.<br><br>It is a sweet experience for Sister Oaks and me to be here on the BYU campus this morning. This is not our first BYU devotional. We started attending them in September 1951 when we were sophomores at BY High School on the old BYU lower campus, where the Provo City Library is now located.<br><br>A great deal has changed on this campus since 1951, but one thing that has remained constant is the sweet spirit you bring to the devotional setting.<br><br>I know why Gloria and I are here today. The First Presidency sent me a letter assigning me to talk on March 21st at the BYU--Provo devotional, so here we are.<br><br>A more interesting question is, "Why are <i>you</i> here at BYU this morning?" A university education anywhere takes a lot of time, effort, and money. And there can be a lot of frustration found on the campus.<br><br>--Maybe someone pointed out to you that university graduates get better jobs and make more money.<br><br>--Or a friend may have convinced you that you can have a lot of fun in college.<br><br>--Or maybe you came hoping to find a spouse.<br><br>--Certainly you can become a more interesting person through your education.<br><br>--And you should be able to learn to see life through a richer set of lenses.<br><br>Hopefully these and all of your other aspirations and expectations will be realized.<br><br>But I would like to discuss another purpose for higher education--especially at BYU. This school experience should provide you with the opportunity to determine your true identity--to find out who you really are.<br><br>During our assignment in the Africa Southeast Area Presidency, Elder Russell M. Nelson of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles came down to conduct an area training session. During that session Elder Nelson made a statement that resonated in my heart then and continues to do so today. He said, "Understand who you are in God's plan." This is a powerful concept that should be a major objective of our life here in mortality: to understand who we are in God's plan.<br><br>What a sweet blessing it is to come to know--to gain a testimony by the power of the Holy Ghost--that there is a God and that He has a plan with an exalted purpose for each of His children. It is also a very powerful, personal driving factor to be able to accept that we each can have a particular role to play in this plan.<br><br>This brings us to your unique BYU opportunity. While you are here, you owe it to yourself to make an extra effort to discover, in every detail possible, who you really are--to discover your true potential and your eternal potential in God's plan.<br><br>The vast majority of you came to BYU with a foundation in the basic doctrines of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Consequently you should have a solid understanding of your eternal potential. You know you are a child of God, a son or a daughter of a loving Father who has structured a glorious plan for the salvation and happiness of each of His children.<br><br>You understand that we were in the presence of our Father in Heaven in premortal councils, where His plan was presented to all of His children. We accepted His plan. Jesus Christ was there, and He became the leading advocate for the plan--the objective of which is to provide all of God's children the opportunity to come to earth, obtain a body, and, during our period of mortal probation, prove ourselves in faith, repentance, obedience, and enduring to the end. We accepted that we would one day stand before the Lord Jesus Christ and be judged on our performance during our period of mortal probation. Those found worthy would be exalted and would dwell eternally in the presence of the Father and the Son, with eternal family relationships prevailing. All others would be assigned to kingdoms of lesser glory.<br><br>You also know that in order to give life and vitality to His plan--and because of His perfect love for each of His children--this loving Father offered up His Only Begotten Son, Jesus Christ, that through His atoning sacrifice in Gethsemane and on the cross at Calvary He would become the Savior of all mankind, the eternal hope of the world. Through His sacrifice He would ensure resurrection from the grave for all, as well as provide the opportunity for forgiveness for every repentant soul.<br><br>You know that without a Savior there is no plan of salvation and happiness, because without the Savior there can be no expectation for resurrection nor for forgiveness, and thus no hope for perfection and celestial worthiness, no hope of dwelling eternally in the presence of God as a celestial being, no hope of enjoying the promised "fulness of joy" that is an integral part of celestial existence.<br><br>What a blessing it is to have this solid, revealed-from-on-high doctrine as a foundation upon which to build our lives and as a foundation for our trust and hope in eternal happiness. It is the foundation for our faith and hope that our Father in Heaven has made such happiness available to His sons and daughters.<br><br>But are these glorious, majestic understandings enough? They are certainly critical underpinnings for our eternal progression, but to reach our divine, eternal potential, I think they are only the beginning. We are each individuals with singular talents, strengths, opportunities, and challenges. We are as individual as are our fingerprints or our DNA. Unfortunately we cannot discover our individuality as easily as we can identify ourselves with our fingerprints or our DNA.<br><br>We believe we are foreordained to come to earth at a particular time into particular circumstances and that our particular set of gifts, attitudes, and talents--if properly developed and employed--will enable us to fulfill our foreordained purpose.<br><br>Elder Henry B. Eyring of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles tells a tender personal story that makes this point in a penetrating way. When he was a teenager his family moved from a very comfortable environment for young Elder Eyring to a location that was not to his liking. He sulked for a bit until the Spirit spoke directly to him about who he was in God's plan and how he ought to proceed. One day the Spirit instructed, "When you find who you are, you will be sorry you didn't try harder." I suspect this spiritual admonition for more diligent effort is probably appropriate for most of us. The Lord will lead us in our particular role if we will seek and follow His guidance.<br><br>Christ Himself during His ministry is the greatest example of one who understood who He was and the full magnitude of His mortal and eternal potential. His success during His mortal probation is, in part, a reflection of this understanding. As a 12-year-old boy who had been left behind in the temple, He reproved His worrying parents, "How is it that ye sought me? wist ye not that I must be about my Father's business?" (Luke 2:49).<br><br>Christ's ministry is filled with statements highlighting His complete understanding of His mortal and His eternal destiny.<br><br>In John 18:37 we read the interchange between Pilate and Christ:<br><br><i>Pilate . . . said unto him, Art thou a king then? Jesus answered, Thou sayest that I am a king. To this end was I born, and for this cause came I into the world, that I should bear witness unto the truth.</i><br><br>Christ demonstrated this same remarkable degree of self-awareness when He stated:<br><br><i>Behold, the hour cometh, yea, is now come, that ye shall be scattered, every man to his own, and shall leave me alone: and yet I am not alone, because the Father is with me.</i><br><br><i>These things I have spoken unto you, that in me ye might have peace. In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world.</i> [John 16:32–33]<br><br>In fact, everything we know about Christ suggests that He understood exactly who He was and exactly what He was expected to do in His life--thanks be to God.<br><br>For us to move in the desired direction for our own life, we must come to know ourselves. We must study, stretch, and test ourselves and ponder the results of our stretching and our testing and other observations. We need to become familiar with our own particular set of gifts and talents. And there is no better place on earth--nor any better time to carry on this get-acquainted-with-yourself process--than here as a student at BYU.<br><br>Why is this getting-to-know-yourself process so important? Because it will enable you to do more with your life. It will permit you to come closer to realizing your full potential. It will let you build on and use your strengths, your gifts, and your talents to carry out your purpose in God's plan. It will help you overcome your weaknesses and avoid your vulnerabilities. We pray to God, "Suffer us not to be led into temptation" (JST, Matthew 6:14). Shouldn't we do our best to know our weaknesses so that we can help God "lead us not into our own personal set of temptations?"<br><br>When considering one's gifts and talents, it is important to first acknowledge that everyone has gifts. I believe this is a truth with both temporal gifts and with spiritual gifts. Regarding spiritual gifts, the scriptures are very clear on the subject. Section 46 of the Doctrine and Covenants highlights for us that everyone is given a spiritual gift and then enumerates these gifts:<br><br><i>Seek ye earnestly the best gifts, always remembering for what they are given; . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . they are given for the benefit of those who love me and keep all my commandments, and him that seeketh so to do. . . .</i><br><br><i>For all have not every gift given unto them; for there are many gifts, and to every man is given a gift by the Spirit of God.</i><br><br><i>To some is given one, and to some is given another, that all may be profited thereby. . . .</i><br><br>[Then, after listing many of these gifts, the scripture concludes:] <i>And all these gifts come from God, for the benefit of the children of God.</i> [D&amp;amp;C 46:8–9, 11–12, 26]<br><br>Ponder for a moment the beautiful gospel principle disclosed in this scripture. In a world so filled with despairing souls lacking a sense of personal worth, it is most uplifting to know that each one of us is endowed, from on high, with at least one spiritual gift.<br><br>We ought to be striving to discover our spiritual gifts. When we know them, we can polish them, hone them, and use them to bless the lives of those about us.<br><br>The parable of the talents as recorded in Matthew 25:14–30 clearly makes the doctrinal point that the Lord expects us to use whatever gifts and talents with which He has blessed us.<br><br>You will recall the story: A wealthy man, planning to travel, gave one servant five talents, which the servant promptly doubled through wise management.<br><br>To the second servant the wealthy man gave two talents, which this servant also doubled through his prudence.<br><br>To the third servant he gave only one talent, which he promptly buried to ensure its security.<br><br>Upon his return the wealthy man praised the two wise managers for their prudent use of their assigned portions, and he rewarded them bountifully.<br><br>On the other hand, the servant who had failed to magnify his calling and hid his portion in the ground was relieved of his talent, left with none, and "cast . . . into outer darkness [midst] weeping and gnashing of teeth" (Matthew 25:30).<br><br>The Lord expects us to take what He has given us and build upon it, expand it, use it, and share it. He expects us to bless the lives of others through our gifts and, in so doing, bless our own lives.<br><br>One of the purposes of patriarchal blessings is to help us identify our special gifts and talents. Through these blessings the Lord can help focus our attention and awareness on particular fields or interests in which we are especially adept. These blessings can serve a very important role in helping us to understand who we are in God's plan. We should read them carefully, reread them, and then endeavor to live our lives in such a way that the Lord can bless us with all of the blessings He has promised us.<br><br>I believe that temporal gifts are much the same story as spiritual gifts. We each have temporal gifts--we just have to uncover and polish them so we may experience joy and satisfaction in using them throughout our lives. Some of these gifts are special aptitudes for music, for teaching, for learning, for athletics, for administration, etc., etc., etc.<br><br>University years are a time to find and cultivate these gifts. This is why we take aptitude and other interest tests: to discover what is possible, given our native abilities and inclinations. This is a main reason why we have general education courses: to broaden our perspective and to expose us to a variety of disciplines to see if they might be attractive and interesting to us. These tests and introductory courses are an important part of your getting-to-know-yourself portion of your university experience. Then, in our majors and minors, we polish particularly interesting gifts that we might want to use throughout our life--not just in our work but also in our Church, our community, and our family service endeavors.<br><br>The social experience on campus is also an important part of the getting-to-know-yourself portion of your collegiate life. It is much more than one big "spouse search." It is an opportunity to buff off a few personality burrs that may have slipped through your high school days. It is a time to gain better insights to such personal personality traits as toleration for stress, capacity for work, need for privacy, and innumerable other characteristics of your individuality. This self-awareness lets you make wiser choices regarding dates and mates, vocations and locations.<br><br>I repeat: This is a good time to find and polish your gifts and your talents. It ought to be a conscious objective that you find out and obtain the most out of your undergraduate years. It can be a very important part of your quest to "understand who you are in God's plan."<br><br>In part, our particular role in God's plan is a reflection of these talents and gifts. The parable of the talents was not given to us for our entertainment but rather for our spiritual instruction. It is indicative of an eternal principle that is often summed up with "where much is given, much is expected." Our gifts and our talents are important elements of our true and complete identity. They are important factors in determining our role in God's plan.<br><br>Let me give you a couple of examples from the life that I know best: my own. In high school I thought I was a pretty good athlete, and I wanted to play college ball. I went out for football here at BYU and promptly got cut. Then I went out for basketball and promptly got cut. I didn't bother with baseball and tennis.<br><br>But I wasn't convinced of my limitations, even though everyone else seemed to be fully aware of them. I went to the Air Force Academy, and one strong motivation was that I wanted another go at collegiate athletics. With only 300 cadets on campus at that time, the odds were much better. So I played football, basketball, and baseball my first year in Colorado. But my maturing capacity for introspection as well as knee surgery made me realize that I was quite mediocre even on my better days. Based on that realization I made some adjustments to my life goals. I have enjoyed a lifetime of participating in sports, but I was able to measure success and happiness in terms of participation rather than in excellence of performance.<br><br>This is a time to discover talents and interests that will be of satisfaction to you for the rest of your lives. When I was a freshman here at BYU, Janie Thompson--a BYU legend in finding and developing talent--asked me if I would participate in a song and dance number she was producing for some sort of conference. I agreed. But after a few practices, Janie said, "Bob, I like your enthusiasm, but you are not much of a singer." Since then I have not sought opportunities to stand in front of audiences and sing. But I have found numerous rewards for enthusiasm.<br><br>Through all of this, I did learn that I could work as hard as almost anyone. That was not a native skill; my dad taught me how to work, and all of my life I have been able to keep up with the hardest of workers. This became one of the most important lessons from my college life. Your successes highlight your gifts; your disappointments help you learn your limitations. And these are very important lessons that affect directly who you are in God's plan. These lessons play a major role in helping you determine your true identity.<br><br>One of the great blessings of understanding our true eternal identity as a child of God is that our personal sense of self-worth can only be high. There are no born losers in God's frame of reference. He loves each one of His children. We are each His son or daughter with the potential to become like Him. In the gospel plan based on moral agency, we fail only if we make choices that lead to failure. But in that same light, we can make choices that will lead to our marvelous success. One of the great beauties of the gospel is that critical decisions are ours for the making.<br><br>We have talked in some detail about the importance of understanding who we are and the magnitude of our divine potential. Now let us briefly discuss a significant threat to our achieving this potential. Today we receive many warnings about identity theft. Some of you may have already experienced the trauma resulting from this fraud.<br><br>In our cybernetic world of trust and of rapid transmission of personal data--medical, financial, and all other types of data--we are very vulnerable to theft and exploitation of our identifying details. Consequently, billions of dollars are spent each year on identity security systems, and they are not always successful. We can be defrauded of significant amounts of money by identity thieves.<br><br>Several years ago Sister Oaks and I were traveling during an assignment in Europe. At the end of one month we received a $20,000 credit card bill after we had spent only about $35 in a particular city. Crooks had our numbers, and they threw them around with reckless abandon. That was our introduction to identity theft. The credit card company stood behind the debt, but it was frightening to see how helpless we were to prevent our identity from being stolen.<br><br>Theft of our numerical mortal identity can be costly and cause us a great deal of misery. But the theft of our eternal identity has much longer effects and more dire consequences. I am not talking about addresses, credit card security, or any other identifying numbers. I am talking about something much more basic and more important than who the world thinks you are. I am talking about who <i>you</i> think you are.<br><br>Let's discuss briefly the possibility of you losing your eternal identity. We know we are sons and daughters of God with the potential to become like Him, as described in His plan of happiness. We know this potential is achieved through our faith in the Lord Jesus Christ and through obedience to the eternal laws and principles embedded in His gospel. We also know that Satan is totally dedicated to thwarting and derailing all of this marvelous plan-of-happiness knowledge and process. We know that one of his primary tools is to entice us to forget who we really are--to fail to realize or to forget our divine potential. This is the cruelest form of identity theft.<br><br>How does Satan do it? He is quite straightforward and predictable. First, he attempts to prompt doubts in our minds about our divine potential. He even cultivates doctrine in the world implying we are much less than we really are. He undermines our faith--and thus our self-confidence in our ability to achieve our potential. Even if we do understand and accept it, he still cultivates this doubt. He strives to bring us to a mind-set in which we believe that we, individually, are not good enough to ever achieve our celestial goals.<br><br>In this same vein Satan seeks to convince us that we are so bad that even the atoning sacrifice of Jesus Christ is not sufficient to reach down to our lowly depths and draw us up unto our Savior. He tempts us into paths that seem to verify his cynicism about our grand and glorious potential.<br><br>He then hedges his bets by surrounding us with the gaudy, glitzy filth of pornography and other forms of immorality and thus precludes our being led in saintly paths by the Holy Spirit. He is a clever fellow with many clever tricks to make us forget who we really are: sons and daughters of God with divine potential.<br><br>Let's summarize Satan's basic method of operation: he strives to make us forget who we are. By cheap, temporary imitations of true and lasting joy he dims our memory and fogs our testimony. Through the false gods of expensive toys, unbridled passions, honors and praises of the world, and fleeting pleasures he leads us away from the divine promises of eternal, lasting fulness of joy.<br><br>We do not understand, we cannot comprehend completely the promised fulness of joy. We have to accept its wonder and its beauty on faith. The term is quite descriptive. <i>Fulness</i> implies that there is no room for more joy. The scriptural promises are breathtaking. Doctrine and Covenants 93:33 and 76:92, 94, and 95 are as explicit as I think we can expect:<br><br><i>For man is spirit. The elements are eternal, and spirit and element, inseparably connected, receive a fulness of joy.</i> [D&amp;amp;C 93:33]<br><br><i>And thus we saw the glory of the celestial, which excels in all things--where God, even the Father, reigns upon his throne forever and ever. . . .</i><br><br><i>They who dwell in his presence are the church of the Firstborn; and they see as they are seen, and know as they are known, having received of his fulness and of his grace;</i><br><br><i>And he makes them equal in power, and in might, and in dominion.</i> [D&amp;amp;C 76:92, 94–95]<br><br>Satan does not want us to understand and focus on these marvelous descriptions and promises of our divine potential, but the Lord certainly does. He wants us to focus on them and to ponder their meaning in our lives. They are clearly worth some pondering time. If we will salt our pondering with scriptures such as we have just read, we can refresh our commitment to move forward and upward on our plan-of-happiness track.<br><br>Let's take a moment and review what we have considered this morning. Our Eternal Father in Heaven has a plan of salvation and happiness for us. Jesus Christ, the Only Begotten Son of God in the flesh, is at the center of this plan by virtue of His atoning sacrifice. We have a central role in this plan of happiness by virtue of our divine parentage.<br><br>To fulfill our role in this plan it is important for us to come to understand ourselves, our strengths, our weaknesses, our gifts, and our talents and to learn to use them in building up the kingdom of God.<br><br>Satan will certainly try to derail us from this simple, straightforward, and supremely important course. He will attempt to make us forget who we are and what our divine potential is. And he will strive to this end until he is bound during Christ's millennial reign.<br><br>The Lord has provided us with countless scriptures and prophetic promptings to help us counter and resist these satanic pulls. One of the most powerful of these promptings is found in the fifth chapter of Helaman. Here Helaman, under the Lord's direction, counseled his sons, Nephi and Lehi, and he repeatedly admonished them to remember who they were and from whence their marvelous spiritual heritage came:<br><br><i>And now, my sons, remember, remember that it is upon the rock of our Redeemer, who is Christ, the Son of God, that ye must build your foundation; that when the devil shall send forth his mighty winds, yea, his shafts in the whirlwind, yea, when all his hail and his mighty storm shall beat upon you, it shall have no power over you to drag you down to the gulf of misery and endless wo, because of the rock upon which ye are built, which is a sure foundation, a foundation whereon if men build they cannot fall.</i> [Helaman 5:12]<br><br>This remembering is a very important principle to help us keep in mind our true identity. This is why we partake of the sacrament each week: to renew our covenants we have made with the Lord in the waters of baptism; to remember Him and to keep His commandments; to refresh in our minds who we are and what our role is in God's plan.<br><br>This is why we go back to the temple: to renew our covenants that we have made in those sacred halls and to remind ourselves of these covenants and obligations.<br><br>When we thus remember these sacred obligations, Satan's storms and attacks will not turn us from our quest--from pursuing our divine potential. I pray that we may ever remember who we are: sons and daughters of a loving Father who have the potential to return to His side and dwell with Him as celestial beings.<br><br>I testify that these things are true. I testify that Jesus Christ is our Savior and our Redeemer and that He stands at the head of this Church, guiding it through a living prophet, even Gordon B. Hinckley. I offer this testimony in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Robert C.

<h1>n Holiness Before the Lord - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
A number of years ago I taught evening classes for the University of Utah at the old Stoker School in Bountiful. One winter night I walked outside after class and found myself in the middle of a heavy snowfall. As I trudged to my black Subaru station wagon, arms full of class materials, I discovered the lock on my door was frozen. After numerous failed attempts, I moved to the passenger door, only to experience the same result. The best idea I could muster under the circumstances was to heat the locks--hence my professional pursuit of health and not engineering. I walked to the nearby house of some friends and borrowed a candle and some matches. To my dismay, this effort failed as well. Though I could insert the key, I could not coax it sideways.<br><br>By now the night was growing late, and I was becoming increasingly cold and tired. Most of the other cars were gone, and I found myself nearly alone in the parking lot. As I stood there, something interesting caught my eye. A few rows over from the car I was so ingeniously trying to enter was <i>my</i> black Subaru station wagon. After seeing my car, I was relieved on three counts: I could now drive home, there was no damage done to the other Subaru, and the owner hadn't shown up while I was attempting to torch his lock.<br><br>This experience has long served as a personal reminder that in this life we can be drawn to things that squander our time, energy, and light without moving us toward a meaningful end. Still, the way home is straight and narrow, and it is vital to know the difference between something that helps us return and something that deflects or restrains our progress. Elder Neal A. Maxwell said:<br><br><i>Someday, when we look back on mortality, we will see that so many of the things that seemed to matter so much at the moment will be seen not to have mattered at all. And the eternal things will be seen to have mattered even more than the most faithful of the Saints imagined.</i> [Neal A. Maxwell, <i>Even As I Am</i> (Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1982), 104]<br><br>Over the last few years I have become increasingly interested in a verse of scripture I believe may be one of the eternal things referred to by Elder Maxwell. It has helped define my path and purpose and direction home. In the Doctrine and Covenants the Lord declared:<br><br><i>And thus ye shall become instructed in the law of my church, and be sanctified by that which ye have received, and ye shall bind yourselves to act in all holiness before me.</i> [D&amp;amp;C 43:9]<br><br>Our personal holiness appears to be important to the Lord. In sections 20 and 21 of the Doctrine and Covenants we are also commanded to walk in holiness (see D&amp;amp;C 20:69 and 21:4). In section 87 we are commanded to stand in holy places (see verse 8).<br><br>As we receive saving gospel ordinances and make and keep covenants, our hope in the Savior is that someday we will be sanctified, or made holy. Elder M. Russell Ballard taught:<br><br><i>We seek to have our lives sanctified, purified, and cleansed to the point where we can be found worthy to walk into the presence of our heavenly parents and Jesus Christ, our Savior and our Redeemer.</i> [M. Russell Ballard, <i>When Thou Art Converted: Continuing Our Search for Happiness</i> (Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 2001), 27]<br><br>Though sanctification requires our diligence, it is made possible only through the Atonement of Jesus Christ. This may seem daunting or distant, but acting in holiness now will help lead us to our eventual sanctification.<br><br>In a recent general conference, President James E. Faust explained that holiness, in part, "is achieved by conforming to God's will" ("Standing in Holy Places," <i>Ensign,</i> May 2005, 62). To conform is to be in agreement or harmony and to be obedient or compliant. This suggests that to act in holiness, or to conform as expected, a person turns his or her heart and life over to the Lord and is willing to do whatever is asked regardless of the circumstances. Fittingly, Elder Quentin L. Cook taught that holiness "is exemplified by consecration and sacrifice" (Quentin L. Cook, "Are You a Saint?" <i>Ensign,</i> November 2003, 96). Finally, in his <i>Doctrine and Covenants Encyclopedia,</i> Hoyt Brewster stated, "One who walks in holiness walks in concert with Christ and has the companionship of the Spirit. One who walks in holiness eschews anything that is sordid and sinful" (Hoyt W. Brewster, Jr., <i>Doctrine and Covenants Encyclopedia</i> [Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1988], s.v. "holiness," 246).<br><br>So it appears to me that to act in holiness is to conform ourselves to the Lord's will as directed by the Holy Ghost. This implies we have turned away from the world and have become pure to the extent we are worthy to be led by the Spirit. This process seems to be reflected in D&amp;amp;C 46:7: "And that which the Spirit testifies unto you even so I would that ye should do in all holiness of heart, walking uprightly before me, considering the end of your salvation."<br><br>The challenge in addressing a topic like holiness is to avoid communicating a holier-than-thou attitude or giving the impression I am further along the path than is really the case. When Albert Einstein arrived at Princeton in 1935, he was asked what supplies he would need for his work. He replied, "A desk, some pads and a pencil, and a large wastebasket--to hold all of my mistakes."<br><br>My family, friends, colleagues, and acquaintances know too well that I have much work ahead in my personal quest for holiness. To them I express gratitude for patience, kindness, and forgiveness. But despite our unique challenges, our struggles with sin, and real or imagined inadequacies, our opportunity to act in holiness before the Lord is His invitation to separate ourselves from the world, to be worthy of the Spirit, and to consecrate ourselves to His will and to His cause.<br><br>During my service as a bishop I had the opportunity of conducting tithing settlement. It was always a highlight to visit with the members of the ward during the Christmas season. With permission, I share one such experience.<br><br>One Sunday afternoon a faithful family came to the office to make their declarations. A sidenote to this story is that the father, an honorable and well-educated man, had lost his employment months earlier due to no fault of his own. Severance pay and savings eventually wore thin, and the family was doing its best to make ends meet. Earlier in the day my counselors had invited both the Relief Society sisters and priesthood brethren to consider contributing to a Christmas fund we had established to help some of our ward members. After returning home from church, the good mother, undoubtedly influenced by the Spirit, told her children about our request and encouraged them to contribute.<br><br>The parents had a few dollars remaining in their modest budget and decided to donate them to the fund. The oldest daughter--a devout and sensitive 17-year-old who had previously helped make a monthly payment for her brother's mission--brought what money she had available from her part-time job. The youngest daughter, a sweet and conscientious 13-year-old, brought her babysitting money. With emotion in his eyes and obvious love and appreciation for his family, the father handed over their collective contribution. Then all family members declared themselves fulltithe payers.<br><br>In retrospect, I was witness to an act of holiness. This family is an example of what it means to be sensitive to--and then to comply with--the promptings of the Holy Ghost. The spirit I felt in that office was nearly overwhelming. Is there anything more desirable than the spirit we feel at those moments in life when we act in accordance with the Lord's will? For this reason alone we should be in perpetual motion toward holiness.<br><br>The blessings associated with acting in holiness cannot be overstated. Acting in holiness allows us to simultaneously worship our Father in Heaven while developing the divine attributes of the Savior. In turn we enjoy the companionship of the Holy Ghost and feel a measure of joy that cannot be found in any worldly pursuit. Acting in holiness is a conduit for joy. Indeed, the path of holiness is the path of happiness. To act in holiness ultimately fulfills the measure of our creation in leading us to the Savior and to our justification and sanctification.<br><br>Embracing the prospect of holiness is important for all of us. After all, the celestial kingdom will be filled with holy people. People who act in holiness radiate light and are an example to those around them. We are drawn to these people because of the inspiration and strength they provide. In the words of C. S. Lewis: "How little people know who think that holiness is dull. When one meets the real thing . . . it is irresistible" (C. S. Lewis, <i>Letters to an American Lady,</i> ed. Clyde S. Kilby [Grand Rapids, Michigan: W. B. Eerdmans Publishing Company, 1967], 19).<br><br>With a desire to elevate our commitment to act in holiness and feel the sustaining spirit and strength of such actions, I respectfully offer three suggestions for our individual and collective pursuits.<br><br><b>First,</b> consider the possibility of consciously elevating holiness as a daily priority. In the College of Health and Human Performance we have been reading and discussing the book <i>Good to Great</i> by Jim Collins. Collins attributes the success of companies that have gone from good to great, in part, to what he calls adherence to the hedgehog concept.<br><br>Citing Isaiah Berlin, Collins states:<br><br><i>"The fox knows many things, but the hedgehog knows one big thing"</i> [Isaiah Berlin, <i>The Hedgehog and the Fox</i> (Chicago: Elephant Paperbacks, 1993), 1; quoting the Greek poet Archilocus]. . . . <i>Day in and day out, the fox circles around the hedgehog's den, waiting for the perfect moment to pounce. Fast, sleek, beautiful, fleet of foot, and crafty--the fox looks like the sure winner. The hedgehog, on the other hand, is a dowdier creature, looking like a genetic mix-up between a porcupine and a small armadillo. . . .</i><br><br><i>The fox waits in cunning silence at the juncture in the trail. The hedgehog, minding his own business, wanders right into the path of the fox. . . . </i>[The fox] <i>leaps out, bounding across the ground, lightning fast. . . . Rolling up into a perfect little ball, the hedgehog becomes a sphere of sharp spikes, pointing outward in all directions. The fox, bounding toward his prey, sees the hedgehog defense and calls off the attack. . . . Each day, some version of this battle between the hedgehog and the fox takes place, and despite the greater cunning of the fox, the hedgehog always wins.</i><br><br><i>. . . Foxes pursue many ends at the same time and see the world in all its complexity . . . , never integrating their thinking into one overall concept or unifying vision. Hedgehogs, on the other hand, simplify a complex world into a single organizing idea, a basic principle or concept that unifies and guides everything. . . . For a hedgehog, anything that does not somehow relate to the hedgehog idea holds no relevance.</i> [Jim Collins, <i>Good to Great: Why Some Companies Make the Leap . . . and Others Don't</i> (New York: HarperCollins, 2001), 90–91]<br><br>If we are to act in holiness in a way that is consistent enough for the Lord's service and our own good, we will likely need to apply a hedgehog-type mentality to our daily routine. To the extent possible, acting in holiness needs to become a deliberate daily focus that guides our thinking and behavior. I am not suggesting that we attempt to will ourselves to holiness independent of the Lord. As stated in a visiting teaching message years ago:<br><br>[Holiness] <i>requires continuing, consecrated effort and is achieved one thought and one act at a time. It requires a faith in Christ so pervasive that our lives begin to reflect his.</i> ["The Visiting Teacher: 'More Blessed and Holy,'" <i>Ensign,</i> December 1995, 65]<br><br>If I am serious about acting in holiness, I will rely upon the enabling power of the Atonement to strive for purity, then be wise enough and strong enough to choose the right and resist anything that is inconsistent with the Lord's will. When I fall short, holiness dictates that I rely on the redeeming power of the Atonement and repent responsively and appropriately.<br><br>Acting in holiness requires vigilance, so as not to be distracted by the cares of the world. According to Elder M. Russell Ballard:<br><br><i>Our main goal should be to seek "immortality and eternal life" (Moses 1:39). With this as our goal, why not eliminate from our lives the things that clamor for and consume our thoughts, feelings, and energies without contributing to our reaching that goal?</i> [M. Russell Ballard, "Keeping Life's Demands in Balance," <i>Ensign,</i> May 1987, 16]<br><br><b>Second,</b> something that may help us act in holiness is found in Doctrine and Covenants 38:24, where the Lord stated: "And let every man esteem his brother as himself, and practi[c]e virtue and holiness before me." I believe the word <i>practice</i> as used in this verse describes the Lord's expectation that we perform or carry out holiness. However, the idea of practicing holiness as we would practice playing the piano or practice a golf swing is intriguing to me.<br><br>You've probably heard about the tourist in New York City who approached a native on the street and asked, "Can you tell me how to get to Carnegie Hall?"<br><br>The New Yorker replied, "Practice, man. Practice, practice, practice."<br><br>I recently read an article by Alan Medinger, who addressed this idea of practicing holiness (see Alan Medinger, "Practicing Holiness," <i>Regeneration News,</i> January 2004). My thoughts are influenced by his work. The idea of practice--or doing something positive rather than avoiding something negative--is a liberating concept. For example, if you have a problem criticizing others, don't wait until you're enticed to criticize. Rather, look for opportunities to practice holiness by being more fair and open-minded with people. Practice defending the integrity of people in a genuine way. If dishonesty is a challenge for you, don't wait until you're tempted to be deceitful. Practice acting in holiness by telling the truth in all circumstances.<br><br>To practice implies we are active in a process of improving something of personal value. It is a bit like the inoculation theory in my discipline of health education. We train people to practice positive life choices in safe settings so that when they are confronted with challenges in difficult real-life settings, they are more confident in their ability. Acting from a position of strength rather than from a position of weakness allows us to emulate the Savior instead of waiting tentatively for the next bout of temptation and struggle with sin. In this sense we are proactive in turning away from the world and establishing our personal purity.<br><br>At the age of 95, cellist Pablo Casals was asked why he was still practicing six hours a day. His response was, "Because I think I'm still improving."<br><br>Michael Jordan said it this way:<br><br><i>I approached practices the same way I approached games. You can't turn it on and off like a faucet. I couldn't dog it during practice and then, when I needed that extra push late in the game, expect it to be there. But that's how a lot of people approach things. And that's why a lot of people fail. They sound like they're committed to being the best they can be. They say all the right things, make all the proper appearances. But when it comes right down to it, they're looking for reasons instead of answers.</i> [In <i>A 3rd Serving of Chicken Soup for the Soul,</i> comp. Jack Canfield and Mark Victor Hansen (Deerfield Beach, Florida: Health Communications, 1996), 246]<br><br>To practice holiness implies we are moving in the right direction. Still, it will probably be a work in progress for most of us. There will be starts and stops--and maybe even some skid marks.<br><br>For example, a few weeks ago I slipped away from my office to find something for lunch. As I approached the entrance of a local restaurant, I noticed what appeared to be a mother and her three children entering just ahead of me. One of the little girls stayed behind. Here was this cute little three- or four-year-old in pigtails using all of her strength to keep the door open for me. I was impressed with this act of kindness and self-sacrifice and thanked her appropriately. I quickly ordered my food and sat down at a table that happened to be next to this family. The mother brought a large drink to the table and returned to the counter to wait for her food. The same little girl who held the door open for me was seated at the table with her younger brother, who was in a booster seat. The little brother was becoming increasingly upset because he could not reach the drink. His big sister, however, had no trouble reaching the drink and took a long sip that seemed to aggravate the brother even more. His displeasure lasted until the mother finally returned with his food. I found it interesting that, within minutes, this endearing little girl acted so kindly to me but was completely oblivious to the needs of her little brother.<br><br>So it is with us. We may act in holiness one moment and struggle with it the next. However, displaying flashes of holiness means we are capable of so much more. Where there is a flicker of light there can be steady radiance. Heber J. Grant often used a quote attributed to Ralph Waldo Emerson: "That which we persist in doing becomes easier for us to do; not that the nature of the thing is changed, but that our power to do is increased" (see Grant, <i>GS,</i> 355).<br><br>We can practice acting in holiness in so many ways--whether we are by ourselves or in the service of others. Reading the scriptures more thoughtfully or offering prayers that are more heartfelt or fasting in a way that is more acceptable to the Lord all represent movements toward holiness. To the person who may be involved with sin or immobilized by guilt, repenting and moving to the light is an act toward holiness. How we treat others and what we say to them or about them are great practice fields for holiness. Winston Churchill said, "By swallowing evil words unsaid, no one has ever harmed his stomach." Reaching out to people with more kindness, being respectful of those around us, and learning to love those we home teach and visit teach all represent practice opportunities.<br><br><b>Third,</b> closely related to the idea of practicing holiness, is becoming more mindful of opportunities in our lives to act in holiness. This reminds me of a conversation between Winnie the Pooh and Piglet.<br><br>Piglet says, "It would be better not to wait to the last minute, Pooh."<br><br>Pooh responds, "Yes, Piglet, but I never seem to know when the last minute is--there are so many minutes."<br><br>Elder Neal A. Maxwell said: "Moments are the molecules that make up eternity!" ("The Tugs and Pulls of the World," <i>Ensign,</i> November 2000, 37). Elder Maxwell then quoted President Hinckley, who counseled: "It is not so much the major events as the small day-to-day decisions that map the course of our living" (Gordon B. Hinckley, <i>Caesar, Circus, or Christ?</i> Brigham Young University Speeches of the Year [26 October 1965], 3).<br><br>Music, television, movies, and the Internet--or the collective media so pervasive in our lives--can greatly affect our personal purity. We must be especially careful here. We can live close to the Spirit and comply with the Lord's will in some things and, in a moment, offend the Spirit in other things because of our personal choices in media. We all have to be conscious of what we are doing throughout our daily lives and measure our activities against the Lord's standard of holiness, asking ourselves, "Is this activity inviting or offending the Spirit?" and "What would Jesus have us do in this setting and circumstance?"<br><br>We are blessed with moments and decisions every day that represent opportunities to act in holiness--to think and speak and act according to the Lord's will. President Brigham Young said:<br><br><i>Every moment of my life must be holiness to the Lord, resulting from equity, justice, mercy, and uprightness in all my actions, which is the only course by which I can preserve the Spirit of the Almighty to myself.</i> [<i>JD</i> 9:220]<br><br>A fairly recent e-mail from our missionary son reported on a series of incidents related to a family in Uruguay. The mother was not a member, and although the father was baptized at age 11, he had been less active for years. Two boys were in the family: a 14-year-old and a six-year-old. The 14-year-old had been baptized one year earlier. During that year he attended church every week by himself and did not miss a single day of seminary. He constantly looked for ways to share the gospel with his friends. Every Sunday he stayed after church to fulfill his duties as a teacher in the Aaronic Priesthood, cleaning the sacrament table and trays. As a result of his faithfulness, his mother felt prompted to listen to the message of the missionaries--one of whom was my son. As her testimony of the gospel grew, her husband began to feel the tugs of the Spirit and decided to accompany his wife and children to church. Within weeks the mother was baptized, and the father began asking what would be required to take his family to the temple in Montevideo.<br><br>One Sunday before the mother was baptized, my son and his companion were sitting with this family at church. My son looked at the 14-year-old and saw that he had a smile on his face from ear to ear. I wonder if my son couldn't keep from thinking that this was a young man who was acting in holiness before the Lord and reaping the associated blessings. President Cecil O. Samuelson has said:<br><br><i>We need to have the faith and capacity to move forward with the knowledge that when we are doing the right things in the right way, even when we face difficulties and challenges, we can expect and rely on blessings from heaven.</i> [Cecil O. Samuelson, "The BYU Way," BYU annual university conference address, 23 August 2005, 10]<br><br>This young man in Uruguay was in the right place at the right time doing the right things. He was making the most of every opportunity to act in holiness. I am grateful for examples like this 14-year-old who inspire me to go and do likewise.<br><br>Acting in holiness is not an easy proposition. As we leave the building today, we will eventually experience stress or anger or a variety of other emotions that threaten the delicate balance in our worthiness to be led by the Holy Ghost. It requires heart to act in holiness when we feel tired, hurt, or mistreated. Eliza R. Snow understood this when she said, "It is no trifling thing to be a Saint" (Eliza R. Snow, "Saturday Evening Thoughts," <i>Times and Seasons</i> 4, no. 4 [2 January 1843]: 64; reprinted in <i>Millennial Star</i> 4, no. 8 [July 1843]: 44). In certain circumstances we may be required to give much.<br><br>On the night of December 29, 1876, the Pacific Express, a two-engine, 11-car train, was heading west through Ohio during a heavy snowstorm. Among the passengers and crew on board were Philip Paul Bliss and his wife, Lucy. Philip Bliss was a Christian songwriter and gospel singer. He had married Lucy 17 years earlier after coming to love her for her Christian virtues. At approximately 7:30 p.m., while crossing a trestle bridge over the Ashtabula River, the bridge collapsed, sending the 11 railcars 75 feet to the river below. As water pressed up from the broken ice, the wooden cars, heated by kerosene stoves, ignited. According to an eyewitness, as reported in the <i>Chicago Tribune</i> the next day, when the train fell, Mr. Bliss freed himself and succeeded in crawling through a window. He turned around to pull his wife free but found she was pinned in the ironwork of the seats. Rather than escape, he devotedly stayed by her side in an attempt to free her before they were both engulfed and consumed in the flames. Ninety other people were killed or later died in the Ashtabula River railroad disaster, the worst such incident in American history to that point in time.<br><br>You may be interested to know that, although Philip Bliss was not a Latter-day Saint, three of his songs appear in our current hymnbook. We sang one of them together this morning: "More Holiness Give Me" (<i>Hymns,</i> 1985, no. 131). At undoubtedly the most stressful moment of his life, Mr. Bliss lived his lyrics.<br><br>Of course the Savior's Atonement in the Garden of Gethsemane and on the cross represents the supreme example of holiness under stress. This is all the more reason for us to act in holiness. Each time we do so, we express our loyalty and love to our Father in Heaven and demonstrate our faith and hope in and reverence, appreciation, and gratitude for His Holy Son.<br><br>Again, our commitment to holiness appears to be very important to the Lord. Of all the doctrines or exhortations that could have been used as a conclusion to the Book of Mormon, I find it interesting that Moroni described the process of holiness. Consider these words in that context:<br><br><i>Yea, come unto Christ, and be perfected in him, and deny yourselves of all ungodliness; and if ye shall deny yourselves of all ungodliness, and love God with all your might, mind and strength, then is his grace sufficient for you, that by his grace ye may be perfect in Christ; and if by the grace of God ye are perfect in Christ, ye can in nowise deny the power of God.</i><br><br><i>And again, if ye by the grace of God are perfect in Christ, and deny not his power, then are ye sanctified in Christ by the grace of God, through the shedding of the blood of Christ, which is in the covenant of the Father unto the remission of your sins, that ye become holy, without spot.</i> [Moroni 10:32–33]<br><br>I believe we are placed on this earth to be sanctified. The Lord has declared that His work and glory is "to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man" (Moses 1:39). May we focus more consciously on acting in holiness and make it a habit of practice while becoming more mindful of the moments and opportunities in our lives. Then we can rely on the enabling and redeeming power of the Atonement with the hope that the Savior will eventually sanctify us and make us pure and holy. In D&amp;amp;C 60:7, the Savior assured us by stating: "I am able to make you holy."<br><br>That we may move forward together in our best efforts to act in holiness before the Lord and then feel the joy reserved for those who honor Him and love Him is my prayer in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Brad L.

<h1>re and Character of God - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Several years ago, during a challenging and hectic period in my life, I read a statement by President Brigham Young that has meant a great deal to me ever since. He said:<br><br><i>When you . . . see our Father, you will see a being with whom you have long been acquainted, and He will receive you into His arms, and you will be ready to fall into His embrace and kiss Him. . . . You will be so glad and joyful. . . . When you are qualified and purified, . . . you can endure the glory of eternity.</i> [<i>JD</i> 4:54–55]<br><br>How blessed we are to know what President Young taught us about our Heavenly Father--what kind of a being He is, what He is really like. How many people over the space of thousands of years have not even known that there is a Father in Heaven? How many individuals' lives might have been different if they could only have known about our loving, merciful, and caring Heavenly Father? Indeed, how blessed we are to have such teachings that center on the nature of our Father in Heaven. It is about God, our Eternal Father, that I wish to speak today.<br><br>The first article or principle in our declaration of faith as Latter-day Saints states, "We believe in God, the Eternal Father" (Articles of Faith 1:1). I do not think it is accidental or coincidental that this statement comes first in our 13 Articles of Faith.<br><br>The Prophet Joseph Smith said: "It is the first principle of the Gospel to know for a certainty the Character of God" (<i>Teachings,</i> 345). In other words, one of the foundation stones of the restored gospel is a knowledge of what kind of being God actually is. But not only do we need to <i>understand</i> what kind of being God is, we must come to <i>know</i> God. In the same sermon from which we just quoted, the Prophet Joseph further stated, "If any man does not know God, . . . he will realize that he has not eternal life; for there can be eternal life on no other principle" (<i>Teachings,</i> 344). In His great high-priestly or Intercessory Prayer, the Savior confirmed that life eternal was to "know . . . the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom [the Father] hast sent" (John 17:3).<br><br>Thus everything of sacred significance connected with our future rests on both our coming to know <i>about</i> God the Eternal Father and, ultimately, our coming to <i>know</i> Him. "If men do not comprehend the character of God," said Joseph Smith, "they do not comprehend themselves" (<i>Teachings,</i> 343). God and men are of the same divine, eternal species, and if we do not comprehend the nature of God, we cannot appreciate our divine parentage nor the very real potential we possess to become like our heavenly parents.<br><h2><b>God Must Be Revealed</b></h2><br>Coming to know God is not for the spiritually lazy. He can only be known through revelation. And powerful personal revelation, as many of you know, is predicated upon righteous living and spiritual discipline. Elder Bruce R. McConkie of the Quorum of the Twelve provided this insight:<br><br><i>God is known only by revelation; he stands revealed or remains forever unknown. He cannot be discovered in the laboratory, or by viewing all immensity through giant telescopes, or by cataloging all the laws of nature that do or have existed. A knowledge of his powers and the laws of nature which he has ordained does not reveal his personality and attributes to men in the true gospel sense. Certainly a knowledge of these laws and powers enables man to learn truths which are faith promoting and which help him to understand more about Deity; but saving knowledge of God comes only by revelation from the Holy Ghost as a consequence of obedience to the laws and ordinances of the gospel.</i><br><br><i>Man's purpose in life is to learn the nature and kind of being that God is, and then, by conformity to his laws and ordinances, to progress to that high state of exaltation wherein man becomes perfect as the Father is perfect.</i> [<i>MD,</i> s.v. "God," 318]<br><br>It was Jesus Christ who commanded His disciples to be perfect even as our Father in Heaven is perfect. It was Jesus Christ who restored in His own day a knowledge of God the Father to the people of Israel--a people who for the previous 1,200 or 1,400 years had lost, to a greater or lesser degree, an understanding of the Supreme Parent of the universe.<br><br>It will be remembered that when Israel rebelled against God during the golden calf episode at Mount Sinai, God took the Melchizedek Priesthood out of their midst, as well as the higher law and the higher ordinances of His holy order. This was a devastating loss, for the Melchizedek Priesthood "holdeth . . . the key of the knowledge of God" (D&amp;amp;C 84:19). For the next 1,200 or 1,400 years, until the time of Christ, Israel lived without the higher law, and their knowledge of God the Father grew dim. They interacted with Jehovah, who was the premortal Jesus of Nazareth.<br><br>Of course all the prophets in ancient Israel held the Melchizedek Priesthood during this period (see <i>Teachings,</i> 181). But the people as a whole did not. In fact, among the people of Israel generally, only the tribe of Levi (one-twelfth of the male population) was privileged to hold any priesthood at all--and that was the lesser priesthood.<br><br>When Jesus inaugurated a new dispensation of the gospel through His earthly ministry, He began to restore knowledge, doctrines, ordinances, and powers long withheld from the children of men. He was the Elias who came to restore all things in His day--as John the Baptist testified and as is now recorded for us in the Joseph Smith Translation of John 1:24–28.<br><br>As the great Restorer, Jesus spoke much about His "Father in Heaven." Jesus wanted all men and women to come to <i>know</i> His true Father, who was also <i>their</i> Father. The phrase "Father in Heaven" is characteristic of Matthew's Gospel as a whole and is found throughout the Sermon on the Mount, the discourse in which Jesus commanded His disciples to be perfect as their Father in Heaven is perfect (see Matthew 5:48).<br><br>Jesus' desire to have His disciples understand and know God the Father is clearly demonstrated in such teachings as His exhortation to His disciples to live so righteously and present such fine examples that others would see their good works and glorify their Father in Heaven (see Matthew 5:16).<br><br>Practically speaking, I think the Savior is telling us here that each of us has the obligation <i>and</i> the opportunity to live in such a manner that our friends and family members can more fully understand what our Heavenly Father is actually like because they see something of His divine nature in us and the Holy Spirit is able to confirm that such examples are authentic.<br><br>I have had the great blessing in my life of coming to know, in part, what our Heavenly Father is like by observing some of His characteristics and personality traits in the lives of dear friends, colleagues, and students here at the university, file leaders, apostles and prophets, <i>and</i> members of my own family. Brothers and sisters, can we who are parents or potential parents not see that our behavior makes it easier or harder for others to come to know--or even desire to know--our Father in Heaven? There is a great compelling power about those who the Spirit tells us are like our Heavenly Father.<br><br>In another statement Jesus commanded His disciples to love their enemies, to bless those who hurled curses at them, and to pray for those who despitefully used them. The reason is given in Matthew 5:45: "That ye may be the children of your Father which is in heaven."<br><br>The original Greek wording of Matthew 5:45 connotes a rebirth, "so that ye may be born (<i>genē</i>) the sons [children] of your Father in heaven." This idea parallels the doctrine of being spiritually born of God and receiving His image in our countenances, as taught in Alma 5:14. Disciples must reflect in their lives--in their behaviors and in their countenances--the distinguishing traits of the Great Parent of the universe in order to truly become His children and His heirs in every way. As Jesus taught, patient love and tolerant restraint are great hallmarks of our Heavenly Father's character and personality. "He maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good" (Matthew 5:45), meaning that righteousness and wickedness are not--cannot be--immediately and constantly rewarded or punished. Such constant interference in the lives of men and women would thwart the plan of salvation and the purposes for which earth life was designed: to allow individuals to exercise patience, walk by faith, and be tested.<br><br>Thus one of the distinguishing features of Jesus' earthly ministry was His restoration of the knowledge of the nature and personality of His Father in Heaven--the Father of us all. But, alas, this restored knowledge was not to last. Soon after the death and resurrection of Jesus, another rebellion set in, and an even greater apostasy ensued than the one that existed from the time of Moses to the time of John the Baptist. This so-called Great Apostasy lasted for some 1,800 years. During this time a true and clear understanding of the nature and personality of God the Father was distorted and, at times, all but lost. Misunderstandings and distortions about the Godhead usually came as a result of debate without the confirming witness of the Holy Ghost. Pronouncements of theological councils defined the nature of God. Errors became entrenched.<br><h2><b>Another Restoration</b></h2><br>However, good news has again come to earth. In these latter days, beginning in 1820, our Heavenly Father, through His Son and His prophets, has rerevealed many divine truths about His nature and personality so that each of us can again come to know Him as the meridian disciples knew him and as we knew Him in our premortal existence.<br><br>Joseph Smith's First Vision in 1820 immediately clarified misunderstandings about the nature of the Godhead as well as the person of God the Father:<br><br>• God the Father is a distinct personage, separate from the Lord Jesus Christ.<br><br>• God the Father looks like a man, as does His Son--who is our Savior.<br><br>• God the Father can speak and move.<br><br>• God the Father knows individuals by name.<br><br>• God the Father hears and answers prayers.<br><br>• God the Father bears witness of His Son.<br><br>• Satan and his power are real, but God's power is greater.<br><br>It is easy to see why President Ezra Taft Benson said:<br><br><i>The appearance of God the Father and his Son Jesus Christ to the boy prophet</i> [Joseph Smith] <i>is the greatest event that has occurred in this world since the resurrection of the Master.</i> [Ezra Taft Benson, "Life Is Eternal," <i>Ensign,</i> June 1971, 34]<br><br>Other revelations about the nature and person of God the Father followed the First Vision, and Joseph Smith taught these truths to all who would listen. But these were radical doctrines indeed.<br><br>Though we take it for granted, section 130 of the Doctrine and Covenants teaches an incredibly profound truth:<br><br><i>The Father has a body of flesh and bones as tangible as man's; the Son also; but the Holy Ghost has not a body of flesh and bones, but is a personage of Spirit. Were it not so, the Holy Ghost could not dwell in us.</i> [D&amp;amp;C 130:22]<br><br>In the King Follett Sermon, a year after section 130 was recorded in 1843, Joseph astounded the theological world with this further instruction about the physical person of God:<br><br><i>God himself was once as we are now, and is an exalted man, and sits enthroned in yonder heavens! . . .</i><br><br><i>These are incomprehensible ideas to some, but they are simple. It is the first principle of the Gospel to know for a certainty the Character of God, and to know that we may converse with him as one man converses with another.</i> [<i>Teachings,</i> 345]<br><br>However, here a caution needs to be emphasized. We must always remember that God is exalted--we are not! He is perfect--we are not! He must never be treated casually. He possesses almighty power. His "brightness and glory defy all description" (JS--H 1:17).<br><br>In another way of explaining this, Joseph Smith further declared:<br><br><i>God Almighty Himself dwells in eternal fire; flesh and blood cannot go there, for all corruption is devoured by the fire. "Our God is a consuming fire." . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . Immortality dwells in everlasting burnings.</i> [<i>Teachings,</i> 367]<br><br>President Joseph Fielding Smith put it this way:<br><br><i>God is full of energy, and should we mortals stand in his presence, unless his spirit was upon us to protect us we would be consumed. That is how much energy there is in a celestial body.</i> [Joseph Fielding Smith, <i>Seek Ye Earnestly</i> (Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1970), 275]<br><br>It should come as no surprise that the Prophet Joseph and his associates described a god whose character and personality were made up of all characteristics possessed by His Divine Son. The traits of one are the traits of the other (see "Lecture Third" in <i>Lectures on Faith</i>):<br><br>• He "is no respecter of persons" (Acts 10:34).<br><br>• He is "merciful and gracious" (Exodus 34:6; see also Psalm 103:8; 2 Nephi 2:6).<br><br>• He is "slow to anger," "abundant in goodness," and will be so forever (Nehemiah 9:17; Exodus 34:6; see also Moroni 7:12).<br><br>• He is generous (see 2 Nephi 26:24).<br><br>• "He changes not, neither is there variableness with him; but that he is the same . . . yesterday, to-day, and for ever" (<i>Lectures on Faith</i> 3:15; see also Mormon 9:9; Moroni 8:18).<br><br>• He is just (see Mosiah 29:12).<br><br>• He is "a God of truth, and canst not lie" (Ether 3:12).<br><br>• He possesses independent faith. That is to say, He is the only being who has faith in Himself and is not dependent on any other being or any other power to accomplish His purposes and bring about His desires. If this were not so, we could not exercise faith in Him. We "would be as the heathen, not knowing but there might be a being greater and more powerful than [God], and thereby be prevented from fulfilling his promises" (<i>Lectures on Faith,</i> Q&amp;amp;A 3:19).<br><br>• God is the author of law. It originates with Him (see D&amp;amp;C 88:41–42).<br><br>• God possesses all power and all knowledge (see 1 Nephi 9:6; Mosiah 4:9; Isaiah 46:9–10).<br><br>• "God is love" (1 John 4:16). That is to say, this characteristic or attribute of love shapes, mediates, and influences all of God's other attributes. "With all the other excellencies" of our Heavenly Father's character, without love "to influence them, they could not have such powerful dominion over the minds of men" (<i>Lectures on Faith,</i> 3:24).<br><br>I am convinced that God's love is both corporate--"He doeth not anything save it be for the benefit of the world" (2 Nephi 26:24)--and individual. I am also convinced that His love is proactive. To me one of the greatest examples of this personal and searching love is the parable of the prodigal son. I believe this parable is nothing less than a thinly veiled reflection of our Heavenly Father's personality--a personality dominated by love for us--and that Jesus presented the parable because He wanted us to know what He knew: what Heavenly Father is really like.<br><br>Like the father in the story of the prodigal son, our Father in Heaven is anxious to come to <i>us,</i> to meet us "a great way off," as the parable says (Luke 15:20). He is desperate to get us back in His presence.<br><br>The parable of the prodigal son teaches that our Father in Heaven cares about the feelings of <i>all</i> of His children at the same time, even though it may appear that only certain ones are being blessed. For example, in the parable, the father's patient tutoring of the older son--the "righteous" son who was put out over his father's generous treatment of the profligate younger brother--is a reflection of our Heavenly Father's personality:<br><br><i>And he answering said to his father, Lo, these many years do I serve thee, neither transgressed I at any time thy commandment: and yet thou never gavest me a kid, that I might make merry with my friends:</i><br><br><i>But as soon as this thy son was come, which hath devoured thy living with harlots, thou hast killed for him the fatted calf.</i><br><br><i>And he said unto him, Son, thou art ever with me, and all that I have is thine.</i><br><br><i>It was meet that we should make merry, and be glad: for this thy brother was dead, and is alive again; and was lost, and is found.</i> [Luke 15:29–32]<br><br>Our Father in Heaven loves me, and He loves you. His love is not a zero-sum exercise. He does not love me less and you more because there is only so much love to go around. His love is infinite. He loves me when I think or act a little like the prodigal son, and He is patient with me when I think or act a little like the jealous older son. In truth, during our years of mortality, are we not all, even just a little bit, like both the prodigal son and the steady but jealous older brother? Does our Father in Heaven cease to be interested in our welfare when we are sinful and we need to come to ourselves? Does He turn off His care and concern for us when we are bad and turn it on again when we are good? I do not think so. The Father's love is as broad, deep, and lasting as eternity. It encompasses all.<br><br>Of course, God's love does not mean that all of us will receive the same blessings and opportunities. God cannot and will not do as much for the rebellious as He can and will do for the valiant. The disobedient cannot take full advantage of the Father's love, which love is manifested fully in the gift of His Son.<br><br>This, I think, is the meaning of Nephi's declaration: "Behold, the Lord esteemeth all flesh in one; [but] he that is righteous is favored of God" (1 Nephi 17:35).<br><br>I testify that our Father in Heaven cares about each of us, individually and personally. There are many examples of this doctrine that I could share, but my son Mark recently reminded me of one. Mark served a mission to Mongolia. He served with and developed a deep love for a senior missionary couple from Idaho. They used an interpreter their entire 18-month mission. Their interpreter--a Mongolian sister--had an important story to tell. She grew up in Mongolia. The missionaries found her and baptized her. When she joined the Church, she started saving money for a full-time mission. She received a call to one of the missions in the United States, but at that time she spoke almost no English. She got on a plane in Mongolia to come to the Missionary Training Center in Provo, Utah, knowing only three sentences in English:<br><br>"I am from Mongolia."<br><br>"I am a missionary."<br><br>"Please help me."<br><br>When she got on the plane, no one had explained to her that she needed to change planes to complete the flight to Utah. She landed in Chicago, but, naturally, there was no one there to meet her and she didn't know the language. She found a chair, sat down, and prayed to Heavenly Father to know what to do. She then got up to try to find help. As she was attempting to explain her predicament to a ticket agent (using her three English sentences), a man tapped her on the shoulder, pulled out his temple recommend, and showed it to her. She recognized the temple recommend because she had been given one before she left, so she knew this man at her side was a member of the Church. He motioned for her to wait. Ten minutes later he handed her his cell phone, and on the other end of the line was the missionary who had taught her the gospel in Mongolia. The missionary told her to follow the man to the plane to Salt Lake City and get on board. He told her there would be people to meet her in Salt Lake City--and there were!<br><br>Our Father in Heaven truly watches out for His children--very often through others. But that's not the end of the story. The man in the Chicago airport was a businessman who has flown all over the world. He was upset that day because it was the first time he had missed his connecting flight to Salt Lake City. But because he was there at the Chicago airport, he overheard this Mongolian sister trying to get help, and he knew he could help her.<br><br>I testify, as others have, that our Father in Heaven not only answers prayers but at times chooses to micromanage the details of His kingdom. This, too, is part of His divine nature. But herein lies an important lesson. It is our Heavenly Father who chooses; we do not dictate to Him time, place, or circumstance. Still, we may rest assured that our Father knows all things and He does <i>all</i> that He does out of love. And He does what is best for us from an eternal perspective. He asks of us our loyalty, our willingness to help others, and our repentance--for which He will reward us with the riches of eternity.<br><br>As we near the end of another semester and another school year, it seems good to come back full circle to beginnings, to foundations and first principles. Therefore I return to where I began this morning--with President Brigham Young's statement:<br><br><i>When you . . . see our Father, you will see a being with whom you have long been acquainted, and He will receive you into His arms, and you will be ready to fall into His embrace and kiss Him. . . . You will be so glad and joyful. . . . When you are qualified and purified, . . . you can endure the glory of eternity.</i> [<i>JD</i> 4:54–55]<br><br>May President Young's vision become reality for each of us, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Andrew C. Skinner was executive director of the Neal A. Maxwell Institute for Religious Scholarship and a professor of ancient scripture at Brigham Young University when this devotional address was given on 11 April 2006.</i><br><br><i>© Brigham Young University.

<h1> and Serve: Your Call to Service and Giving - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Beloved Brigham Young University graduates, this is a very important day--a commencement day. It is a beginning of a new chapter of your lives. Thank you, parents, family members, and companions who sacrificed to make this day possible. Thank you, teachers, staff members, devoted bishops, and fellow students who have provided support. And graduates, on behalf of all of us who love you and have prayed for your success, thank you for multiplying the gifts and talents your Heavenly Father has given you, for enduring to the end, and for finishing what you began.<br><br>Today you reap a reward that is much more than a diploma. You came to Brigham Young University to obtain an education in Zion--to learn "of things both in heaven and in the earth." In doing so, you have made preparations "in all things . . . to magnify the calling whereunto [the Lord has] called you, and the mission with which [He has] commissioned you" (D&amp;amp;C 88:79–80).<br><br>What is your mission? The details may be specific to you, but the purpose is universal. You entered this institution to learn. Today you go forth to serve. On this special day I would like to visit with you about that sacred mission: to go forth as the disciples of old and serve our Heavenly Father's children in all the world.<br><br>As always, missionary endeavors begin by breaking the "cycle of self." That is a prerequisite. President Hinckley's father said it well when he wrote, "Dear Gordon, . . . I have only one suggestion: forget yourself and go to work" (in Sheri L. Dew, <i>Go Forward with Faith: The Biography of Gordon B. Hinckley</i> [Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1996], 64). At school you have been primarily focused on your <i>own</i> learning, your <i>own</i> growth, your <i>own</i> development. Commencing today, you have the opportunity to lift your sights beyond yourself. Some philosophers will tell you this is impossible--that human beings can only be interested in themselves. But true disciples of the Savior know otherwise. He gave His life for all mankind, and we who follow Him have the opportunity to lose our lives in service to others.<br><br>To assist you in living lives of service, let me suggest three essential principles:<br><br><b>First,</b> help others succeed.<br><br><b>Second,</b> learn and develop your own talents and value the talents of others.<br><br><b>Third,</b> obtain a spirit of serving and giving.<br><br>In the coming days of transition, you will have many opportunities to practice these principles and establish a life even more meaningful and fulfilling than the one you created here at Brigham Young University.<br><h2><b>Help Others Succeed</b></h2><br>Up to this point you have used your intelligence to succeed as an individual. You have measured yourself against a standard set by the performance of your peers. Essentially you have been competing with them, and your grades reflect how well you have fared in that contest.<br><br>To help others succeed, you must achieve a different standard. In the world you will discover many people who seem to be average in their intelligence and yet are very, very successful. Why? Because they know that it is impossible to succeed alone. The only way to truly succeed is to help others succeed as well.<br><br>As you leave BYU, you will have opportunities to help others succeed. For some this will come naturally; for others it will require effort. If you are in the latter group, let me make this suggestion: Don't try to be at the top of your class. Does that sound strange? Let me explain.<br><br>Many capable students have a strong capacity to memorize what their professors have taught and repeat it back with amazing accuracy. This is impressive in the classroom and yields admirable scores.<br><br>However, the people who do this in the world are generally focused on themselves and their own success. They use what they know to look good and impress others. I've seen this with many MBA students who accept their first job thinking that what they know and say is more important than who they are and how they relate to others. They fail miserably in their jobs because it is obvious to nearly everyone that they are repeating what they've learned in order to be at the top of their class.<br><br>Beginning today, there is no more class to compete with, no reward for being the "smartest," no high score for being able to repeat all the facts. Starting now, you must use your education not to say something impressive but to do something that will lift others and help them be successful. In other words, you must use your education not to distinguish yourself from others but to devote yourself to them--to helping them grow and flourish, even if it seems at the expense of your own prominence and glory. This is the way of our Savior, who said:<br><br><i>Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone: but if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit.</i><br><br><i>He that loveth his life shall lose it; and he that hateth his life in this world shall keep it unto life eternal.</i> [John 12:24–25]<br><h2><b>Learn and Develop Your Own Gifts and Talents and Value the Talents of Others</b></h2><br>You may learn to lose yourself in the service of others by applying the second principle: Learn and develop your own gifts and talents and value the talents of others. At school it is natural and important to associate with students who share our interests and abilities. These associations make it possible for us to learn from one another and benefit from each other's experiences. Beginning today, you have the marvelous opportunity to let your circle grow.<br><br>After graduating from business school as a young man, I learned an essential lesson. A competitor company was taking away our loyal customers, and I was assigned the responsibility of developing a new product to safeguard our market share. This responsibility humbled me, to say the least. In preparing for this assignment, the chairman of the board said to me in a private conversation, "Bob, I have confidence in the abilities you have learned thus far. Now I want you to expand your vision and understanding. I want you to learn to think like a leader and see the whole picture!"<br><br>What was "the whole picture"? I soon realized it not only included my own gifts and talents but also the gifts and talents of others. I had come from a marketing background and had fallen into the myopic mentality that my area of expertise was very important. Although marketing is necessary, I began learning the importance of all the other elements in the process: research, development, testing, manufacturing, and so forth.<br><br>Which part of the process is most important? That is like asking which department at Brigham Young University is most important. Is it math? music? microbiology? Mandarin Chinese? The only right answer to that question is: None is most important because all are necessary. Or, to say it scripturally, "The eye cannot say unto the hand, I have no need of thee: nor again the head to the feet, I have no need of you" (1 Corinthians 12:21).<br><br>In developing our new product, we made a wheel diagram showing the essential but different role everyone would play and how we would interact. Through that model we all came to appreciate how essential everyone's gift really was. Needless to say, that learning experience changed my life. I understood more deeply the doctrine of the Lord: "To every[one] is given a gift. . . . And all these gifts come from God, for the benefit of the children of God" (D&amp;amp;C 46:11, 26).<br><h2><b>Obtain the Spirit of Service and Giving</b></h2><br>When we invite others to share their gifts, we prepare ourselves to apply the third principle: Obtain the spirit of service and giving. Consider, if you will, the spirit of service and giving demonstrated by the faculty and staff of this university. This is a teaching institution--or, in other words, a giving institution. Faculty and staff members at Brigham Young University devote their education and experience to giving you a wonderful gift: an educational foundation for the rest of your life. In other words, their mission is to prepare you for your mission.<br><br>Because they have obtained the spirit of service and giving, they have been able to focus their professional energy on you rather than on themselves. Because they have had your eternal welfare in mind, they have endorsed standards that support a spiritually centered education and have encouraged you to live those standards wholeheartedly. In your last few days on campus, I counsel you to take a moment and express your appreciation to those who have helped you, taught you, and touched your heart. As you move forward, let your model be the one, solitary leper who went back to thank the Savior for giving him a rich, new life.<br><br>Moving ahead, you have the opportunity to follow the example of your teachers. Whether or not you become teachers in the formal sense, you each have the opportunity to continue learning, continue living the highest gospel standards, and continue by precept and example to teach what you have learned here. In this way the cycle of giving continues, and the world truly becomes an extension of the Brigham Young University campus, for what has happened here will continue to happen everywhere--through you.<br><br>Wherever you go, the cycle of giving will have its greatest influence in your own homes. Here the eternal part of your mission will unfold, for here those who teach and those who are taught are joined in the most important education of all: the education for eternity. I pay special tribute to all who will serve in the sacred school of the family and especially to the many talented sisters who are receiving their degrees today. The world will try to convince you that the most important success is achieved in the workplace. I salute all who will focus their efforts on the family. I especially salute you sisters who will train up our Heavenly Father's children in the way they should go (see Proverbs 22:6).<br><br>On this commencement day, let me remind you that your capacity to obtain and act upon this spirit of service and giving may depend upon your obedience to temporal commandments. The living prophets have counseled us time and again to put our lives in order--to pay a full tithing and a generous fast offering, to store food and other essential items, and to become self-sufficient by eliminating debt.<br><br>Brothers and sisters, we live in a world being destroyed by debt. When we are in debt, we not only lose our agency to act, we also lose our opportunities to give both temporal and spiritual service. If you have had to go into debt to obtain your education, I encourage you to repay your debts as soon as possible. Then go forward with commitment not to finance on credit any item of any kind, except perhaps a house and vehicle that are well within your means.<br><br>For many, this may require what I call "plastic surgery," which you may perform yourselves this very day. All it requires is a pair of scissors and those credit cards that you cannot use responsibly by paying them off every month. If you need to perform such surgery, do it. Do it now. President Hinckley has been counseling the members of the Church to overcome debt for many years. Let us reap the blessings that will come from obedience to his counsel.<br><br>What are those blessings? In time, as you work hard and pay an honest tithe, you will be able to provide for your own needs and the needs of your family. Then you will have the privilege of acting upon the spirit of service and giving. There are endless ways you will be able to bless your community and support worthwhile public and private charities. You will be able to provide Church humanitarian assistance or contribute to the Perpetual Education Fund. Most important, you will be able to help support missionaries throughout the world, including your own children and yourselves.<br><br>You will also be in a position to give back to this university in a substantial way. All of us are aware that your tuition pays only a very small part of the cost of your education. What you have enjoyed here at Brigham Young University is possible because of others who have sacrificed and freely given of their means. Now it is your turn to follow the commandment of the prophet Jacob:<br><br><i>Think of your brethren like unto yourselves, and be familiar with all and free with your substance, that they may be rich like unto you.</i><br><br><i>But before ye seek for riches, seek ye for the kingdom of God.</i><br><br><i>And after ye have obtained a hope in Christ ye shall obtain riches, if ye seek them; and ye will seek them for the intent to do good--to clothe the naked, and to feed the hungry, and to liberate the captive, and administer relief to the sick and the afflicted.</i> [Jacob 2:17–19]<br><br>I thank our Heavenly Father that you entered Brigham Young University to learn and that you have diligently prepared to go forth and serve. There are no shortcuts to that service. There is no fast track. But day by day, by following principles of service, the purpose of your BYU education will be fulfilled. I pray that as we go forth today, as true Latter-day Saints who count their blessings and rejoice to see all that God has done, we will be determined to<br><br>• help others succeed<br><br>• earnestly learn and develop our own gifts and talents and value the talents of others<br><br>• obtain the spirit of service and giving<br><br>This is the key to lives of meaning and fulfillment. Said our beloved prophet, President Gordon B. Hinckley:<br><br><i>Do you want to be happy? Forget yourself and get lost in this great cause. Lend your efforts to helping people. . . . Look to the Lord and live and work to lift and serve His sons and daughters. You will come to know a happiness that you have never known before if you will do that. I do not care how old you are, how young you are. . . . You can lift people and help them. Heaven knows there are so very, very, very many people in this world who need help. . . .</i> [Let us] <i>stand a little taller and reach a little higher in the service of others.</i> [Liverpool England Fireside, 31 August 1995; in <i>TGBH,</i> 597]<br><br>I give you my testimony that our Savior Jesus Christ has set the example of service in behalf of all of God's family. Joseph Smith, the prophet of the Restoration, was His servant in bringing forth the Church of Jesus Christ in these latter days. Today we are led by a true servant of the Master, even His prophet President Gordon B. Hinckley. How grateful we are that he has done as the prophets and apostles of old and has gone forth throughout his life to serve in all the world.<br><br>May we earnestly do likewise is my humble prayer in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Robert D. Hales was a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when this<br>commencement address was delivered on 27 April 2006.</i><br><br><i>© Intellectual Reserve, Inc.

<h1>ive, Purpose, Peace - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I wish the lights were brighter. I wish we could see each other more clearly. Dressed as we are, in all our finery and formality, we look far too much the same. If we could peel away the layers of regalia, we would see graduates who hail from more than 50 countries and all 50 states, who speak many languages, and who have developed expertise in the sciences, arts, and letters. And if we could see yet deeper, we would witness even more: individuals of infinite worth and potential, each standing on the brink of an important new journey.<br><br>We are gathered today for a rite of passage, a celebration of all that we have learned. But we must take care lest our accomplishments convince us that we know more than we do or that we have, somehow, arrived. The value of our education will only be determined by the future; it will be demonstrated in our personal lives with our families, in our professional activities, and in our communities. Fortunately we control what we make of our education--and of ourselves. And so I offer us a three-pronged reminder: let us consider perspective, purpose, and peace in the context of our higher education.<br><br><b>First,</b> consider our perspective. Imagine for a moment that we could pop the lid off of the Marriott Center and immerse ourselves in a clear night sky filled to the brim with stars. Imagine also that we were equipped with perfect eyesight--or, better yet, Hubble-quality vision--and that we could drink in the details of galaxies and nebulae throughout the farthest reaches of space. Moses caught a glimpse of something like this and concluded "that man is nothing, which thing [he] never had supposed" (Moses 1:10). This was an important lesson. Wisely, King Benjamin counseled us: "Believe in God; believe that he is, and that he created all things, both in heaven and in earth; believe that he has all wisdom, and all power." King Benjamin continued by reminding us specifically to "believe that man doth not comprehend all the things which the Lord can comprehend" (Mosiah 4:9).<br><br>Because our understanding is finite, because we are nothing--and know next to nothing--we must act cautiously. If knowledge is power and if our power is increasing, then wisdom is restraint--particularly in this age of hyper-specialization when, as individuals, we know more and more about less and less. We must be conscientious of our influence. The simple fact that we know how to do something hardly justifies us in doing it. The fact that a scientist can build a nuclear weapon does not mean he or she ought to. The fact that a marketing executive knows that sex sells does not mean that he or she ought to sell by those means. Our knowledge is useful only to the extent that we wield it righteously. Convenience and expediency, political or otherwise, should not motivate us; we must live by loftier standards. Wendell Berry writes:<br><br><i>Do what we will, we are never going to be free of mortality, partiality, fallibility, and error. The extent of our knowledge will always be, at the same time, the measure of the extent of our ignorance.</i><br><br><i>Because ignorance is thus a part of our creaturely definition, we need an appropriate way: a way of ignorance, which is the way of neighborly love, kindness, caution, care, appropriate scale, thrift, good work, right livelihood. Creatures who have armed themselves with the power of limitless destruction should not be following any way laid out by their limited knowledge and their unseemly pride in it.</i> [Wendell Berry, <i>The Way of Ignorance</i> (Emeryville, California: Shoemaker and Hoard, 2005), preface, ix]<br><br>Our perspective is limited. Therefore, let us reverence what we do not know and act with care, appealing to Heavenly Father to teach us how to use our knowledge with wisdom and restraint.<br><br><b>Second,</b> consider our purpose. Each of us knows the motto: "Enter to learn; go forth to serve." I'm not one for ultimatums or drawing lines in the sand, but the time has come. By tomorrow the "going forth" will have officially and irrevocably begun. Time is all we've got in this life; a few ticks on a clock, a couple of breaths in and out, and we're done. So what will we do with our time? We can spend our days seeking wealth and other worldly trappings (to which moths and rust are particularly attracted). This is easy enough to do--especially given the siren song of modern consumerism--but we cannot afford to prostitute our education, to sell ourselves short by "labor[ing] for that which cannot satisfy" (2 Nephi 9:51). Our <i>souls</i> are at stake here!<br><br>Amulek didn't mince words when he exclaimed that "if ye turn away the needy, and the naked, and visit not the sick and afflicted, and impart of your substance, . . . ye are as hypocrites who do deny the faith" (Alma 34:28).<br><br>I have heard some students jokingly suggest that the purpose of a BYU education is to increase our earning potential so that we will eventually pay more tithing and make more sizeable charitable contributions. Nothing could be further from the truth. "For of him unto whom much is given much is required" (D&amp;amp;C 82:3). Much has been given to us. By attending BYU we have received something of a divine investiture. What is required of us now is to exhaust ourselves in service. And thanks to our BYU education, we are uniquely equipped to do so.<br><br>Let us become known for our compassion in whatever spheres best suit our life's unfolding: in boardrooms, in classrooms, in laboratories and conservatories, in factories and foundries, in government and military service, on Scout outings, and in family home evenings. Eric Hoffer noted, "Compassion alone stands apart from the continuous traffic between good and evil proceeding within us. Compassion is the antitoxin of the soul" (Eric Hoffer, <i>Reflections on the Human Condition</i> [New York: Harper and Row, 1973], 24). Yet compassion is a character trait in theory only if it is not realized in our interaction with others. Therefore we <i>must</i> serve. We know that it will profit us nothing to "gain the whole world" if we lose our souls (Matthew 16:26), but we can rest assured that the Lord will prosper us--and bring salvation to our souls--if we honor His investment in us by going forth to serve.<br><br><b>Third,</b> consider the need for peace in the world and our ability to establish peace. Two thousand years ago, Jesus taught, "Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called the children of God" (Matthew 5:9). I like to think of peace not as an absence of conflict but as a profound, perfect sense of identity. We know that the Lord's people and community are characterized by being "of one heart and one mind, and [dwelling] in righteousness [with] no poor among them" (Moses 7:18). Citizens of this kind of township--Zion--live in perfect security. Knowing that we are children of God and understanding His divine plan permits us to tap into this sense of belonging and security. Could there be anything more real, individual, or authentic than discovering our own true identity?<br><br>Peace, then, is a natural expression of our identity, and it can surround us and emanate from us in our homes, communities, and workplaces. We are peacemakers when we share this security and invite others to find their own perfect identity in the Light of Christ. As we depart from these proceedings, let us make peace and let us be known for our "peaceable walk with the children of men" (Moroni 7:4).<br><br>I wish the lights were brighter. I wish we could see each other more clearly. Dressed as we are, in all our finery and formality, we look far too much the same. So when we shed these layers of regalia, let us remember our individual potential and responsibility. Our perspective is limited, so we must act with restraint and compassion. Indeed, our purpose must be to serve. And we, perhaps more than any other group on the planet, are equipped and obligated to establish peace.<br><br>A star occupies a finite region of space, but the light it produces radiates across millions of light years in every direction. In a similar vein, when we honor our education, Brigham Young University will cease simply to be a location and an institution. Rather, it will become a source of power within us that will bless us and will become a means whereby we may bless others through our influence--today and every day that we are permitted to sojourn on God's footstool. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Andrew J. Maxfield spoke as the representative of his graduating class at BYU commencement on 27 April 2006.</i><br><br><i>© Brigham Young University.

<h1>ished BYU Graduates of 2006 - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Graduates, families, brothers, sisters, honored guests, and friends, as we offer our hearty congratulations and best wishes to those we honor in these exercises today, it is my most pleasant privilege to extend again our warm welcome and greeting to all of you. We are especially grateful for the presence of Elder Richard G. Scott of the Quorum of the Twelve and chairman of the board of trustees' executive committee and Elder Robert D. Hales of the Twelve and also a member of the executive committee of the board of trustees. Elder Hales is conducting these services, and we shall hear from him later. We also welcome Sister Bonnie D. Parkin, Relief Society general president, and Sister Susan W. Tanner, Young Women general president, who are also members of the board of trustees.<br><br>In addition, we recognize Elders Merrill J. Bateman and Neil L. Andersen of the Presidency of the Seventy, Elder W. Rolfe Kerr of the Seventy and commissioner of Church Education, Elder Paul V. Johnson of the Seventy, and President Kim B. Clark of BYU--Idaho. We appreciate the special and substantive support of them all.<br><br>Each graduating class at BYU is remarkable in many ways. Let me mention some of the aggregate characteristics that I find interesting. I will be highly selective due to time constraints.<br><br>As is typically the case, our 6,401 graduates come from all 50 states, three U.S. territories, and 70 other countries. Almost 29 percent are from Utah, and 13 percent are from California. Twenty-three percent of the graduates are from the College of Family, Home, and Social Sciences, and 11 percent each are from the Marriott School of Management and the College of Humanities.<br><br>Fifty-three percent of the individuals in the graduating class are already married, and several more of you seem to be making serious progress toward this important milestone. Almost half of the undergraduates have attended other institutions of higher learning prior to transferring to BYU.<br><br>While we do not yet have final data for this year's baccalaureate graduates, the most recent available information tells us that BYU ranks 10th among all U.S. baccalaureate-origin institutions for 1999–2003 doctorate recipients. This is a remarkable achievement when you think of the many prestigious institutions sending their students on to graduate programs. Similarly, BYU ranks very near the top of all universities that provide students for graduate professional schools in dentistry, law, and medicine.<br><br>More than three-fourths of the graduates have functional facility with a second language, and almost half of BYU students have lived outside of the United States for at least one year. Thus you see that we have not only a large group of graduates but a highly accomplished and diverse class as well.<br><br>I will forbear in reciting our statistics on campus fudge consumption that have been shared in the past, but it is reported that this group of distinguished students has done more than their fair share in making chocolate-covered cinnamon bears an increasingly popular staple in the campus diet. As a group they have also been loyal supporters of the long and varied list of campus activities that include concerts, lectures, devotionals, forums, and athletic events. You will be missed and will be welcomed back to continue to participate in the life of the Y as your circumstances permit.<br><br>This has been a full and rich academic year at BYU. Earlier this month a large and distinguished panel of reviewers from the Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities visited our campus for three days. Their purpose was to see firsthand our efforts and accomplishments toward the reaffirmation of our accreditation as a university. While the process will not be fully complete until summer, we are encouraged and felt that these reviewers left Provo with both appreciation and admiration for so very much that transpires at BYU.<br><br>In preparation for their visit, we have had tremendous and significant efforts taking place for more than two years that have involved many faculty, staff, and students. Under the guidance of Dr. Gerrit Gong and several senior university leaders, an impressive self-study document was prepared that focused on our efforts to meet or exceed all of the accreditation standards. It also identified our strengths and areas where new opportunities to improve exist in our goal to fulfill President Hinckley's challenge to become "the best that we can be." This process has been very helpful in giving us all a better insight into the remarkable institution that BYU has become and also into what we need to do to become even better and meet our prophetic destiny.<br><br>As we have thought about our university-wide accreditation process, it has occurred to me that today and tomorrow in our graduation ceremonies we are also accrediting all individuals listed in our program. The dictionary reminds us that to accredit is "to endorse or approve officially." In these graduation rites of passage, we signal our enthusiastic approval of you individually, and your diploma carries the official endorsement of the university. Again, I congratulate each of you.<br><br>As important as the continued accreditation of the university is, for us aligned with the mission and responsibilities of BYU, there are higher authorities who also should concern us. Of course, I mention your families, loved ones, and special friends who have supported and assisted in significant ways that have made your academic successes possible. I constantly think of the faithful tithe payers across the world--most living in much less favorable circumstances than we find ourselves--who have invested in BYU and in each of you through the thoughtful generosity of our Church leaders. I think of special donors and benefactors who share their treasure that BYU might accelerate its progress and that our students might be blessed with educational experiences otherwise unattainable. I never fail to be greatly impressed with the support and confidence expressed in our activities by those who preside over the Church.<br><br>And I think repeatedly about how heaven may view our efforts, attitudes, and accomplishments. The Apostle Paul in his counsel to the Romans talked about the importance of appropriate conduct, clear thinking, and proper priorities for those aspiring to be disciples of Jesus Christ. He said, "For he that in these things serveth Christ is acceptable to God, and approved of men" (Romans 14:18). I believe being acceptable to God and having the approval of the right kind of men and women are the ultimate accreditation that we should each personally seek. And the basic standard by which we will be measured is whether or not we serve Christ.<br><br>As you leave BYU--some for a season and some perhaps forever--it is our hope and prayer that you will leave part of your heart here, just as we hope you will take part of BYU with you. This happens in many ways. We hope that you will never be the same because of what you have learned and what you have gained while you were a BYU student. We hope that you will remember with great fondness your classmates, roommates, ward members, teachers, Church leaders, and your many friends and associates. We hope you will take with you the high standards of academic rigor and integrity you have honed and learned while here and will continue to represent BYU with distinction.<br><br>Another unique experience of this academic year was the announcement made, after the approval of the board of trustees, of the beginning of the fund-raising and planning for the new Gordon B. Hinckley Alumni and Visitors Center building here on campus. We have been greatly encouraged and touched by the many thousands of our students, alumni, faculty, and staff, together with many generous benefactors, who have decided to be part of this remarkable project that will honor our beloved prophet and also provide an important new gateway and introduction to this already wonderful and beautiful campus. We thank you for your thoughtful generosity and continue to encourage all who have yet to participate to consider doing so. This is an opportunity--very infrequent in most of our lives--to participate in something very special. It also gives evidence to our appreciation and understanding that in coming to BYU at this special time, we truly drink from wells we did not dig and harvest fruit that we did not plant. We have been blessed to be here at this season, and I hope we will continue to think during all the mortal days yet allotted to us what it is that we can do to bless the lives of those who will yet follow us to BYU.<br><br>As you now transition into the next exciting phase of your life--continuing with further education, a new job or career, perhaps a full-time mission and, hopefully, marriage for those who have not yet taken that significant step--I invoke heaven's blessings upon you and yours as you join the ranks of the distinguished graduates of Brigham Young University. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><em>Cecil O. Samuelson was president of Brigham Young University when this commencement address was given on 27 April 2006.</em><br><br>© Intellectual Reserve, Inc. All rights reserved.

<h1>ive: Seeing Through the Generations - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I feel very humbled to be with you today, realizing that each person who is here has chosen to be here. You have come with the attitude of learning by faith, and I pray that the Holy Ghost will be in abundance with us, that your faith will be rewarded, and that you can learn something that can be helpful to you.<br><br>I want to introduce my subject this morning by telling you of a very simple event that happened to me 32 years ago during the spring semester of my junior year here at BYU.<br><br>I was taking a class in a large amphitheater classroom. Entering the classroom on one of those first days of the semester, I sat in the very back, far from the professor. As he began writing on the blackboard, and as those around me began taking notes, I realized that I could not see what they could see on the chalkboard. Up until that very moment I had not imagined that I needed glasses. I had not anticipated glasses in my future.<br><br>But that experience led me to the optometrist and to a pair of glasses. Suddenly my world improved immensely. I could see many things that I had not been seeing for some time. The world became much more alive for me. I remember asking myself, "Why didn't I realize before that I needed glasses? How could I have not known that I was not seeing?"<br><br>While seeing can be a function of our eyes, we also use the word <i>see</i> to mean "understand" or "comprehend." Have you ever asked, "Don't you see what I mean?" And haven't you responded at some time, "Oh, now I see."<br><br>My objective today is to enlarge your vision in some small way that allows you to see or to understand what you have not totally seen or understood before.<br><br>As you live righteously, you will find that during your lifetime your perspective will enlarge many, many times. Usually this shift in perspective is not a dramatic one that you can see from one day to the next, but over time the advances are significant.<br><br>The most important perspective we want to gain was described beautifully by the Savior: "And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent" (John 17:3).<br><br>I will start with two rather academic examples and then move to a more spiritual principle.<br><br>First, a perspective on time.<br><h2><b>The Perspective of Time</b></h2><br>In the same year that I first put on a pair of glasses--1974--I attended a large fireside held in the Marriott Center, where the speaker was Elder Neal A. Maxwell, then a new member of the Quorum of the Seventy. I have never forgotten the talk he shared. It helped me to view my own mortality in a slightly different way. He read from the writing of Brother A. Lester Allen, a former dean and scientist of the Department of Biology and Agriculture on this campus. Let me read you this analogy and see if it expands, just a little, your view of time. Listen closely.<br><br><i>Suppose, for instance, that we imagine a "being" moving onto our earth whose entire life-span is only 1/100 of a second. Ten thousand "years" for him, generation after generation, would be only one second of our time. Suppose this imaginary being comes up to a quiet pond in the forest where you are seated. You have just tossed in a rock and are watching the ripples. A leaf is fluttering from the sky and a bird is swooping over the water. He would find everything absolutely motionless. Looking at you, he would say: "In all recorded history nothing has changed. My father and his father before him have seen that everything is absolutely still. This creature called man has never had a heartbeat and has never breathed. The water is standing in stationary waves as if someone had thrown a rock into it; it seems frozen. A leaf is suspended in air, and a bird has stopped right over the middle of the pond. There is no movement. Gravity is suspended." The concept of time in this imaginary being, so different from ours, would give him an entirely different perspective of what we call reality.</i><br><br><i>On the other hand, picture another imaginary creature for whom one "second" of his time is 10,000 years of our time. What would the pond be like to him? By the time he sat down beside it, taking 15,000 of our years to do so, the pond would have vanished. Individual human beings would be invisible, since our entire life-span would be only 1/100 of his "seconds." The surface of the earth would be undulating as mountains are built up and worn down. The forest would persist but a few minutes and then disappear. His concept of "reality" would be much different than our own.</i> [A. Lester Allen, quoted in Neal A. Maxwell, "But for a Small Moment," 1 September 1974, in <i>Speeches of the Year, 1974</i> (Provo: BYU, 1975), 454]<br><br>When I first heard this analogy--with time moving so very quickly or moving so very slowly--I thought of the words of Alma: "All is as one day with God, and time only is measured unto men" (Alma 40:8). I also thought of Nephi's words: "As well in these times as in times of old, and as well in times of old as in times to come; wherefore, the course of the Lord is one eternal round" (1 Nephi 10:19). Somehow I sensed that my "reality" as an individual walking through earthly time could be very limited without some perspective greater than my own.<br><br>Now I switch perspectives--to a perspective of space.<br><h2><b>The Perspective of Space</b></h2><br>To help illustrate this perspective, let's examine a leaf on a plant that sits in the V part of the Y on Y Mountain. If we move far, far away from the plant--10 million light years away--can you see the leaf? To help you understand this distance, one light year is approximately 6 trillion miles. After traveling for 27 years, the Voyager I space probe had only covered a distance of 13 light hours. So 10 million light years is a very, very long way. If we look at the leaf 10 times closer--from 1 million light years away--we see the spiral of the Milky Way galaxy. Then 10 times closer than that is only 100,000 light years away. As we come again 1,000 times closer, we still see nothing but stars. At 1 trillion kilometers--1,000 times closer still--we can begin to identify our sun. Another 1,000 times closer--at 10 billion kilometers--we can see our solar system. This is 10 billion times closer to the leaf than where we started at 10 million light years away. As we continue to move even closer--at 1 million kilometers--we see the earth and the orbit of the moon. At 100 times closer than that--at 10,000 kilometers--we see the Western Hemisphere of the earth. And, finally, from 10 kilometers we can see Y Mountain with Provo below. From 10 meters away we can easily see the Y and the plant in front of us, and, then, at 10 centimeters, we see the leaf we have been following from so far away.<br><br>But now that we are here, there is still much more to see. Moving into the leaf we get quite another view. At 1 millimeter we see the leaf magnified 100 times. Looking 1,000 times closer, at 1 micrometer, the nucleus of the leaf cell is visible. At 100 nanometers--10 times closer than that--the chromatin of the leaf cell nucleus is visible. From 10 nanometers we can see or we can imagine the individual DNA strands. Still 100 times closer, at 100 picometers, the outer electron cloud of a carbon atom is visible. This is 1 billion times closer than when we were seeing the leaf from 10 centimeters. Going 100 times closer still, we see the empty space between the inner shell and the nucleus of the atom. As we magnify 100 times more at 10 femtometers, we can see the nucleus of the carbon atom. Finally, magnified 100 times more at 100 attometers, we are looking at quarks within the single proton. (The idea of this demonstration was taken from a Florida State University Web site at micro.magnet.fsu.edu/primer/java/scienceopticsu/powersof10.)<br><br>This is quite a journey to view a simple leaf on Y Mountain. When I see the immensity of space and the intricacies and complexity of objects on earth, I think of the words of Moses:<br><br><i>And were it possible that man could number the particles of the earth, yea, millions of earths like this, it would not be a beginning to the number of thy creations</i>. [Moses 7:30]<br><br>Remember also the words of the Psalmist:<br><br><i>When I consider thy heavens, and the work of thy fingers, the moon and the stars, which thou hast ordained;</i><br><br><i>What is man, that thou art mindful of him?</i> [Psalm 8:3–4]<br><br>And in that glorious hymn we sing, "There is no end to matter; There is no end to space" ("If You Could Hie to Kolob," <i>Hymns,</i> 1985, no. 284).<br><br>In the powerful words of the prophet Alma to the deceiver Korihor, we read:<br><br><i>All things denote there is a God; yea, even the earth, and all things that are upon the face of it, yea, and its motion, yea, and also all the planets which move in their regular form do witness that there is a Supreme Creator.</i> [Alma 30:44]<br><br>I bear witness that He lives, that this Supreme Creator is He who we call our Heavenly Father and His Son Jesus Christ. A developed perspective of space helps us to see the greatness of our Heavenly Father and also that we would be wise to learn of Him and to conform our lives to His eternal plan.<br><br>Let us now look more closely at His plan for us--a plan He has called "the great plan of happiness" (Alma 42:8). For this we must speak of His words to both ancient and modern prophets.<br><br>You have been who you are for a very, very long time. We are sons and daughters of heavenly parents who love us and who have sent us on a course to become more like Them. We lived in the premortal existence prior to our coming to earth. We were taught of our Heavenly Father's plan. We would receive a physical body; we would learn to choose good over evil. The Only Begotten Son of the Father offered Himself as the Savior of the world, allowing us a way to return to our heavenly home. We rejoiced in the plan, and we "fought for it. Many of us also made covenants with the Father concerning what we would do in mortality. In ways that have not been revealed, our actions in the spirit world influence us in mortality" (Dallin H. Oaks, "The Great Plan of Happiness," <i>Ensign,</i> November 1993, 72).<br><br>We do not have all the answers, but it is very clear that our life is not a coincidence--and that it is not by chance that we find ourselves here at this time in human history.<br><br>The Restoration scriptures explain a beautiful linking of the generations that, once understood, opens our view, and we see our lives in a more complete way.<br><br>Three thousand years ago the Lord covenanted with a righteous man named Abraham, promising him that "in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed" (Genesis 22:18). There was a covenant made, a people established, and a promise that through this people many great things would come to pass in the latter days.<br><br>When the Savior visited the Nephites following His Resurrection, He said to them:<br><br><i>Ye are the children of the prophets; and ye are of the house of Israel; and ye are of the covenant which the Father made with your fathers, saying unto Abraham: And in thy seed shall all the kindreds of the earth be blessed.</i><br><br><i>. . . Ye are the children of the covenant.</i> [3 Nephi 20:25–26]<br><br>You and I are "children of the covenant." The Savior has declared it, and I confirm it to you. As we come to understand what it means, we see more clearly. Mortality comes more into focus. Just like putting on glasses and seeing the blackboard of our mortality, our understanding grows.<br><br>The Apostle Peter described members of the Church as "a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people" (1 Peter 2:9).<br><br>I repeat: It is not by chance that we find ourselves within this holy lineage, the blood of Israel, with a promise and a destiny that through our lives and the lives of our posterity all the peoples of the earth will be blessed (see 1 Nephi 15:18; 3 Nephi 16:5–7; D&amp;amp;C 39:11).<br><br>When we see ourselves in the perspective of this holy family, those who came before us and those who come after us become very important to us. I have heard President Gordon B. Hinckley say on more than one occasion, "I have been thinking a lot about my grandfather and grandmother. I have been thinking a lot about my father and my mother. I have been thinking just a little about myself and my dear wife. And I have been thinking a lot about my children, about my grandchildren, and about my great-grandchildren." And then he has concluded with this phrase: "And I have been thinking a lot about this wonderful link that binds us all together" (President Hinckley speaking at Vernal, Utah, and Campinas, Brazil, temple dedications).<br><br>Now you might say, "But my parents and grandparents were not like President Hinckley's; they were not members of the Church." Or, "They were not faithful in the Church." Or, as a man in Argentina who I called to be a stake president said to me: "I don't even know who my father is." He had been given the family name of his mother. He had not heard the name of the Church until he was 18 years old. How could he be part of this royal family?<br><br>Through miraculous circumstances--that we will one day appreciate more than we can now explain--each of us has been brought into this covenant family and we have become children of the covenant. It is not necessary that we be able to explain every detail. Here is where we reverse "seeing is believing" to "believing is the beginning of seeing." I confirm to you that it is not by chance that we are here and that we are who we are.<br><br>Notice in President Hinckley's words that he looked both <i>back</i> through his generations--his parents, grandparents, great-grandparents--and <i>forward</i> through his generations--his children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren.<br><br>This is the major point I want to make to you today: As we see through our generations, both backward and forward, we see who we are, and we see more clearly what we must become. Let me give you an example.<br><br>Let me show you the engagement picture of our son, Derek Andersen, with his fiancé, Erica Wible. They met here at BYU and fell in love. Three weeks ago, in their caps and gowns, they graduated together. Three days ago, kneeling at the altar in the San Diego Temple, they were sealed by the holy priesthood for time and for all eternity. They look to the future with great hope and anticipation.<br><br>Their lives will be like all of our lives: filled with challenges, tests, happiness, and satisfactions--and moments where they must exhibit the character and strength that is in them. If they look back and look forward and see their role in the generations, it will strengthen and fortify them.<br><br>Now let me show you two people in their lives from the past. Daniel Henry Arline was born in 1841 in northern Florida. He is Derek's great-great-grandfather. One day in 1898 he heard the missionaries speak in the town square. He felt something inside. Although there was great persecution against the Church and against the missionaries as well, he took the missionaries to his home, fed them, and watched over them. He was then 57 years old, but he told his wife, "For the first time in my life I have heard the truth." He and all his family were baptized. Though it was not easy to be a pioneer and a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints at the turn of the century in the southern United States, Daniel Arline remained true to the gospel and to his covenants. Part of who Derek is comes because of the goodness and righteousness of this man whom Derek has never met.<br><br>Marva Olson Prior is the great-grandmother of Erica. Her life did not take every turn as she expected. She reared her four children righteously in the Church without her husband being a member. She once said: "If we keep His commandments, we will be blessed and find peace of mind and true joy, but not without trials, for we learn so much from our challenges." Her husband joined the Church after they had been married 46 years. Part of who Erica Wible is comes because of the noble life of this great-grandmother. I have a picture of Erica with her great-grandmother when Erica was younger. Sister Prior passed away four years ago.<br><br>In the world in which we live there is a great focus on "me," "I," "my world," "my style," "my satisfactions," and "my things." In the popular recent book <i>Generation Me,</i> author Jean M. Twenge leads with these words on the cover: "Why Today's Young Americans Are More Confident, Assertive, Entitled--and More Miserable Than Ever Before."<br><br>Here is a paragraph from the book describing some of those in your generation:<br><br><i>Born after self-focus entered the cultural mainstream, this generation has never known a world that put duty before self. Linda's youngest child, Jessica, was born in 1985. When Jessica was a toddler, Whitney Houston's No. 1 hit song declared that "The Greatest Love of All" was loving yourself. Jessica's elementary school teachers believed that their most important job was helping Jessica feel good about herself. Jessica scribbled in a coloring book called</i> We Are All Special, <i>got a sticker on her work sheet just for filling it out, and did a sixth-grade project called "All About Me." When she wondered how to act on her first date, her mother told her, "Just be yourself." Eventually, Jessica got her lower lip pierced and obtained a large tattoo on her lower back because, she said, she wanted to express herself. She dreams of being a model or a singer. She does not expect to marry until she is in her late twenties, and neither she nor her older sisters have any children yet. "You have to love yourself before you can love someone else," she says. This is a generation unapologetically focused on the individual, a true Generation Me.</i> [Jean M. Twenge, <i>Generation Me: Why Today's Young Americans Are More Confident, Assertive, Entitled--and More Miserable Than Ever Before</i> (New York: Free Press, 2006), 1–2]<br><br>Now this does not describe you, but it describes a part of your generation.<br><br>If we can look back through the generations, we see those who helped us to get where we are now--those who forged the way before us, whether they were members of the Church or not. And in the restored gospel we realize even more deeply our responsibility to link them to us through the ordinances of the temple.<br><br>In a letter from the Prophet Joseph Smith to the members of the Church, we read:<br><br><i>These are principles in relation to the dead and the living that cannot be lightly passed over. . . . For their salvation is necessary and essential to our salvation, . . . they without us cannot be made perfect--neither can we without our dead be made perfect.</i> [D&amp;amp;C 128:15; see also verse 18]<br><br>Now let's see through our generations forward. Who will be your children and your grandchildren? Or, if by chance you do not marry, who will be those you influence in the generations ahead?<br><br>Looking ahead through the generations, what kind of care and example will Derek and Erica's great-grandchildren receive from their parents? Will Derek and Erica teach their children in such a way that their grandchildren will believe that they are "children of the covenant"? When we look at our own lives, we must be prepared to look forward into the generations that will follow us, for our footprints will be seen in homes and on paths where we will never walk.<br><br>As we are righteous, there is a power in the priesthood that passes through us into our posterity, shaping their eternity as it shapes ours.<br><br>Let me share with you the words of a blessing pronounced by the Prophet Joseph Smith upon Bishop Newel K. Whitney in Kirtland on October 7, 1835:<br><br><i>He shall be blessed with a fullness of the good things of this earth, and his seed after him from generation to generation. . . . Angels shall guard his house, and shall guard the lives of his posterity, and they shall become very great and very numerous on the earth.</i> [<i>HC</i> 2:288]<br><br>I close by giving you a promise. As you can learn to see through the generations--by looking back and by looking forward--you will see more clearly who you are and what you must become. You will better see that your place in this vast, beautiful plan of happiness is no small place. And you will come to love the Savior and depend on Him--as His great gift to us makes this all possible. Your influence will continue generation after generation throughout all eternity.<br><br>I bear witness of these things: Jesus is the Christ, the Only Begotten of the Father. He lives. He is resurrected. One day everyone from all nations, all generations, all times, and all places will kneel and confess Him to be who we claim and know Him to be: the Savior of the world. He restored the priesthood to the earth. That priesthood and that power is found in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. He guides His prophets. I bear witness that you are a child of the covenant and pray that you may through your generations see the power that is in you, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Neil L.

<h1> a Christian Perfectly - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I want to think with you today about what it means to be a Christian. And, since, ultimately, what it means to be a Christian is to "be perfect even as [Jesus], or [our] Father who is in heaven is perfect" (3 Nephi 12:48; see Matthew 5:48), I want to think with you about being a Christian perfectly, rather than doing Christianity perfectly. Perfection, we tell ourselves, is a process, but I want to take the Lord at His word, and His word when He issued this command is that we "be perfect" with no additional words of comforting qualification. The word <i>be</i> is an important word in this statement. To be perfect is to be complete, whole--though we mean to lose the self in the service of others so we can find it again. Our modern lives have a way of scattering us into the many sectors of our responsibilities, each with its own list of tasks to be performed, superiors to be satisfied, substances or situations to be avoided, and people to be loved. Something tells me that the wholeness the Lord is talking about is not the sum of the items on these lists, especially because the lists contain so many "to don'ts" as well as "to dos."<br><br>One of the striking things about sin is that it is not an opposite form of completing the self but rather a way of dividing and dislocating a bit of oneself from the whole. We often refer to this phenomenon as compartmentalizing our lives and ourselves. I think that what we might call "Internet sin" is particularly effective in exploiting this vulnerability in us as well as in the world that we usually try to distinguish ourselves from. Certainly pornography, plagiarism, and gambling on the Internet are the problems they are for us because the chance to indulge the powerful temptations that have always been with us is now just a few clicks away. And it doesn't help us that these temptations often find us, rather than our having to go out and look for them at a store, theater, or party.<br><br>But the basic challenge the Internet poses is that it's more than just an easily accessible storehouse of images and information. The Web, with its many entrances into labyrinths of virtual experience and relationships, makes it easy for a part of oneself to wander off and slip into another room unnoticed by others and barely noticed by the rest of oneself. The appeal of restaging one's life on another stage where it can enter in and exit from some contained adventure and stimulation is very strong, especially when one constitutes one's world as a place of denials, deferrals, and dangers, and when envy of others' worlds of popularity and possessions is inverted into configuring a good world as one that <i>deprives</i> its inhabitants of such things. Is that what we think righteousness is--a life of privation we endure on the promise that we'll get more and better versions of the stuff and the station we've always wanted? If so, is it any wonder that when technology gives us the chance to privately make our envious fantasies more real, we seize the opportunity to reinvent ourselves as someone more daring and sophisticated on a personal-space site?<br><br>I don't mean to preach a Luddite sermon on the evils of modern technology. In fact, if anything, this technology has revealed some problems and weaknesses in us that we need to address; it didn't exactly cause them. And, dear friends, it is urgent that we all address them now. Far, far too many of us of all ages are depositing small portions of our soul in scattered electronic closets. The answer is ultimately not to try to search out and lock the door to every closet. It is in affirmation--not merely in avoidance--in doing good, not just resisting evil, that one takes up Christianity as a way of being in the world. If mortal life for us is simply a time of doing without, then we're probably spending most of our time thinking about what we're doing without--like me on a diet, constantly thinking about the food I wish I could have. Being a Christian in this world means living in our own and others' inabilities, disabilities, and fallibilities. Our limitations don't keep us from who we really are; they are the conditions in which we are who we are.<br><br>I am so very grateful that the Lord Jesus Christ lived in this world as well as atoned for it. I don't know what limitations He actually had as part of His mortal way of being. Did He have bad days, perfect recall, and hormonal spikes? Were there foods He turned up His nose at? Was He neat and orderly? Could He have been both a computer and a poetry nerd or gone out for any sport He wanted to and been the best at everything? Consequently, I don't know what it means that the Lord Himself, in Paul's words, "suffered being tempted" (Hebrews 2:18). But I do know there is no temptation, no form of suffering, loneliness, or injustice we experience that the Lord through His life and Atonement did not Himself experience or comprehend. Whatever existential pluses and minuses were His mortal lot, the Redeemer implicitly chose in His thoughts, actions, and words to be for others and for His Father. Whether or not He felt like it, He did not withdraw--as we often do--into being for self through indulging the kind of longings and passions that spring from insecurity, impatience, and fear of failure.<br><br>To be like Jesus--and we must be like Him if we want to be with Him and the Father--we must strive for a deeper knowledge of who the Son of God is, since it is by Him we come to know the Father (see John 14:6ff.). To that end the Lord talked a great deal about what it means to be like Him. In fact, the way He talked about Himself during His mortal ministry constantly reminded His audience that the Jewish concept of God was about being.<br><br>You and I know that the Lord Jesus Christ, who walked and talked with the remnant of Israel left in Palestine, was also the great Jehovah, who had brought the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob out of Egypt and into the promised land with a mighty hand. To His disciples and His detractors, the Lord often declared who He was by referring to the meaning embedded in the name Jehovah, or "I am." You easily remember many of these that John, in particular, recorded: "I am the way, the truth, and the life" (John 14:6); "I am the good shepherd" (John 10:11); and "I am the true vine" (John 15:1). Now, I'll spare you the complexities associated with the meaning and usage of the word <i>Jehovah,</i> or <i>Yahweh,</i> except to acknowledge that many scholars think a better translation of this word is "I will be" or "I cause to be." But the concept expressed in the name of the Lord talking about Himself as, for instance, the "bread of life" (John 6:48) or "the light of the world" (John 8:12) was a direct way of reintroducing Himself to His people as their God and of teaching them and us that keeping the law meant taking upon us His name. As the Lord told the Nephites after His resurrection, "I am the law" (3 Nephi 15:9).<br><br>One of the most powerful of the Lord's "I am" self-declarations gives us a special insight into what it means to be a Christian. On a few rather ominous occasions--when the Lord first spoke to the Nephites embalmed in darkness after the great destruction that marked His death on this continent (see 3 Nephi 9:18); at the beginning and the end of the Revelation of St. John (see Revelation 1:8; 22:13); and twice in Joseph Smith's initial revelations to Martin Harris (see D&amp;amp;C 19:1) and Sidney Rigdon (see D&amp;amp;C 35:1)--the Lord declared: "I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end" (3 Nephi 9:18; Revelation 22:13). There is a world of meaning in this name. It declares that the Lord is the Lord absolutely. Whatever it means to be a joint heir with Christ of all the Father hath--a startling and, at first glance, an even brash idea--this name indicates that, in an eternity that is without beginning or end, He is nevertheless for us the beginning and the end of our immortality and eternal life.<br><br>I don't know what our relationship to the Son of God will be in the eternities. But the fact that the Son still bears in His resurrected body--"restored to [its] proper and perfect frame" (Alma 40:23)--the scars of the Atonement suggests to me that He will always be our Redeemer, that He didn't live a mortal life just to get it over with but rather to be able to live it with us over and over again. That's what it means, by the way, to be an eternal parent.<br><br>In any event, what is clear to me in this life is that as the Beginning and, especially, the End, the Lord is not a means to another end. With His Father and our Father He <i>is</i> the end, the target, the audience, the culmination of all we try to do and be individually and collectively, just as He is the source of all we are able to do or be. But don't you find yourself, as I find myself, treating the Lord and His gospel as a means to another end--that is, yourself as the end? Don't you, like I, slip in prayer into seeing God as the giver of gifts in which, truth be told, we have really invested our thoughts and hearts--good grades, jobs, marriage, protection--thus making the gifts rather than the Gift-giver the object of our desires?<br><br>Don't we spend most of our time working out <i>our</i> eternal salvation, <i>our</i> happiness, when Jesus Himself spends all of His time worrying about our eternal salvation and happiness? Is God an instrument and His gospel a program we use for our personal development? Are His commandments a set of strategies for us to avoid misfortune, bad health, and punishment?<br><br>Keeping commandments like paying tithing does yield tangible, substantial temporal blessings, but do we treat the idea of giving "our" material substance to the Being whose substance it really is in the first place as an investment for a bigger heavenly mansion? Do we give simply to get? Do we perform service to others as a way of obligating God to bless us and in the meantime to give us good, warm feelings about ourselves? Do we treat obedience like a kind of reality TV show, a race, a series of ordeals or obstacle courses, a form of public humiliation we're willing to endure in this life for the celestial fame and fortune it brings the winners in the next?<br><br>When we take the sacrament or confess something to the bishop, does the Atonement serve as a software application that scans and cleans our hard drives that we need to insert into ourselves once a week or so and then put back in its case to be used again next time?<br><br>The things we talk about doing, dear brothers and sisters, like prayer and repentance, should become our way of being and bearing ourselves in this world--not something we do just to get through the world. Scripture study and church service should be a chosen lifestyle, not just an accepted assignment. Faith, hope, and charity must become the thoughts we think and the language we speak. Mormon promised his son Moroni and us that if we are "filled with [charity]; . . . when [the Lord] shall appear we shall <i>be</i> like him, for we shall see him as he <i>is</i>" (Moroni 7:48; emphasis added). Look at the list Mormon gave just before he issued this promise: charity is long-suffering, not self-serving, not easily provoked, bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, and endures all things (see Moroni 7:45; 1 Corinthians 13:4–7).<br><br>None of these characteristics by itself represents charity. One must endure all things, but one also hopes and believes them as well. In fact, I wonder what the difference is between "bearing" all things and "enduring" all things. The words don't function like synonyms here, although they can in common usage. It sounds to me like bearing things means to take up the burden of living as an affirmative choice rather than weathering a storm, hunkered down for however long it rages. In any event, this particular list is not an itemized menu of techniques for success that can be taught in a class or at a convention but is instead an articulation of a fundamental orientation toward being in this world that will continue into the next.<br><br>Now, I'm not saying we don't need particular techniques or therapies, especially those revealed by prophets and apostles, as well as those discovered by good, smart people who have studied their fellow human beings to help them. It's just that when I hear the Lord giving instruction--especially in the full expression of the law and the gospel that the Lord delivered in that most elegant and profound Sermon on the Mount--I hear Him saying things in such a way as to make us think past technique in order to rethink our conception of both sin and righteousness. In this amazing document the Lord breathed life back into the laws He wrote on tables of stone with His own finger by offering to write the law in the "fleshy tables" of our hearts (see 2 Corinthians 3:3; Jeremiah 31:33; Hebrews 8:10, 10:16). Indeed, He reminded us throughout the Sermon on the Mount that the purpose of a law of ordinances and performances that directed the very motions of our bodies to enact the Atonement in practice and ritual was not just to train but to transform our hearts so that the Atonement would be the spark that ignites that heart's each and every beat. This is why Jesus could say in the sermon that He came to fulfill the law, not to destroy it, because He came to resuscitate, to restore, to resurrect the law.<br><br>Take, for example, the passages that lead up to the Lord's astonishing command to us to be perfect. As you remember, the actual statement the Lord made is: "Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect" (Matthew 5:48). The <i>therefore</i> seems to me to refer to what has just preceded this statement, and what immediately comes before it is a list of six revisions to the law of Moses, the six "Ye have heard it said . . . but I say unto you" statements. Look, for instance, at the famous "adultery" passage. After the Lord talked about anger and made us already nervous about, say, something as harmless as calling another driver on the road an idiot, He said this:<br><br><i>Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not commit adultery:</i><br><br><i>But I say unto you, That whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart.</i> [Matthew 5:27–28]<br><br>The Lord began by quoting the very statement He Himself gave in the Ten Commandments, then He rephrased and broadened it on His own authority to make adultery a sin not only as a committed act but also as a contemplated one. Did He revise Himself to show us that we all need to do this? This is where the Lord starts to pound the chisel into our hearts, because that is where the seat of sin really is. In fact, the <i>already</i> seems to suggest that the kind of looking He was talking about is a symptom, not a cause. But, thus far, we are still talking about what we should not do. So the Lord's next move was to tell us what we should do:<br><br><i>And if thy right eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast it from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell.</i><br><br><i>And if thy right hand offend thee, cut it off, and cast it from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell.</i> [Matthew 5:29–30]<br><br>Surely the crowd must have gasped at this point. I have this mental image of Peter hearing the Lord utter verse 29, looking confusedly over at John and whispering, "Did He just say . . . ?" while John holds a hand up, listens to verse 30, then turns to Peter, nodding his head slowly, his eyes wide with amazement and a touch of fear. It's a good thing Matthew or somebody else was taking notes that day, because I imagine that many in the crowd did what many of us do when we hear this same passage: we rush in and start interpreting what He "really" meant to say.<br><br>Interpretation is called for here, but it ought to stay connected to the way He said it. Why did He say it the way He did, and could He really have meant exactly what He said? Now, before you start writing yourself a note like "Having trouble with lust in swimming class; leave right eye in locker," let's think about a way of keeping our limbs but still taking up the Lord's amputate-to-repent program. (And you thought being stoned was bad.)<br><br>The Lord made a conditional if/then statement, and maybe the "if" part doesn't happen very much: for the most part, if my right hand does something bad, I bear at least some responsibility for what it does. So then what could the statement mean? Let's not leave the statement as it is worded just yet. The Lord says that if a part of my body--part of my physical wholeness (but something I could live without if I had to)--is giving me problems, I should cut it off. The Lord is telling us that if we wish to be perfect, complete, in our observance of the law of sexual morality, our bodies, our thoughts, and our lives should have no part that works against the good of the whole. If it were an eye that was the root of our sexual sin, we should be willing to give it up and take on that disability, even though we'd really like to keep it. It should be that important to us.<br><br>But since it doesn't seem like a good idea to jump into penitent self-mutilation just yet, how does this sound: Men, if you can't keep the eye away from, say, pornography on the Internet or cable TV, would you be willing to cut off the Internet or the cable service? If you've gotten into this stuff; have tried to change; talked to your bishop; broken off from it for a week, a month, six months, but keep coming back to it; at what point are you willing to cut it off?<br><br>I can hear some of you saying, "But the computer is my life. The Internet is central to my schoolwork and will be central to my career. Plus, it's great for genealogy." Fair enough. But if you're not winning the war, if you're not going to be able to have a healthy marriage now and a marriage at all in the eternities, if you can't, as Moroni said, "come unto Christ, and be perfected in him" (Moroni 10:32), do you really think your career ought to be your chief consideration, the end of your existence?<br><br>I don't want to pick on just the guys. Women, are you willing to pull the plug on your service if you find yourselves getting and looking for a buzz from having titillating chats with often-anonymous virtual "friends"? Both genders: Are you willing to sever yourself from a TV show or a DVD that doesn't necessarily show forbidden skin or actions but simply assumes and builds its skin-deep plot around the notion that people try out their crushes and infatuations in the bedroom before they commit themselves to another? If silently rooting for a couple to have premarital or extramarital sex with each other on the screen--no matter what you actually see or don't see--is not looking at another person to lust after him or her, I don't know what is.<br><br>But this isn't the place to stop our thinking, because we can't remove all of the TVs and computers in all of the places we might be in this world. You will be alone in a hotel room on a business trip, and you'll have to make the choice not to even turn to the wrong channel rather than playing the self-deceiving game we play of just flipping through all the channels to see what's on, hoping in willed ignorance to be flashed.<br><br>The Lord asks us in this particular section of the Sermon on the Mount to think honestly about what we're looking for. While we're being honest with ourselves about this, it is also an occasion to think about what it means to look at another human being in any context. Do we look to detach some part of another's being to use or consume it--not just in the sexual context we've been talking about but, for example, with a server at a restaurant? Despite that person's complexity, humanity, and, thus, potential divinity, do we turn them into an extension of our own will for power or pleasure? The Lord might be suggesting that doing so is a form of maiming someone. Is that why the Lord tells us to give up a part of ourselves--that a severed arm would be just recompense for looking at anyone to <i>do</i> anything with them?<br><br>If we are to do something, it ought to be <i>for</i> the other, not with or to them. This imperative to do and to be for others is why the Lord finished His discussion of the law in Matthew 5 with two breathtaking revisions of the law. Because it's about time to conclude, we don't have time to consider fully what the Lord is saying in these passages. For that matter, a talk of any length is inadequate to this task. Let me just say this in closing: When the Lord tells us to "turn the other cheek," He's not just asking us to take responsibility for our own actions and responses and to accept our responsibility to the other who stands before us, be they impoverished or threatening. He's also inviting us to acknowledge the other's humanity and capacity to be responsible for what he or she does.<br><br>There are lots of problems with answering aggression with aggression, not the least of which is that we imitate the aggressor in such a response. We allow the aggressor to set the terms in which our interaction with them takes place and, indeed, let the act, not the actor, govern the interaction. Offering our cloak when our coat is required is a way of imputing a reasonable motive to another's action, allowing the action to define itself as a statement of need or fear that we might actually be able to do something about. Moreover, in asking us to give what they would take from us, He is asking us to extend to them the right to rethink what they wanted and why they wanted it; to acknowledge their right and capacity to change without being compelled to do so, just as we would prefer not to be compelled to do or give something--the Golden Rule, in other words.<br><br>The Lord isn't trying to cover every possible aggressive or passive-aggressive situation here. Surely He isn't asking us to respond to a child abuser or someone who has just shot someone else by cheerfully offering the person another victim. But when the Lord tells us to love, bless, and pray for those who do us wrong or are fundamentally set against us--an enemy--He is offering Himself to us, isn't He, to do for them what we would do for them if we could? Isn't that why the Lord got so excited over Nephi, son of Helaman, because he arrived at the point that he wouldn't ask for anything for himself or others that the Lord, in His perfection, wouldn't Himself want to do (see Helaman 10:4–10)?<br><br>The Lord wants us to be instruments in His hands, agents for His work, but it sounds to me that if we became much like Him in this life, He wouldn't mind too much if we asked Him--nicely, like Nephi did--to be a means for us to conduct His work and His glory: the immortality and eternal life of our fellow humans. That we be more like Him in doing His work is my prayer in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Joseph D.

<h1> Strong and of Good Courage&quot; - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Thank you, President Samuelson. BYU is blessed to have you serve as its president. It is an honor to be here today with this outstanding assembly of students. President Gordon B. Hinckley has spoken about how "you represent a great generation in the history of the world and in the history of this Church." He has described you as "part of the greatest generation we have ever had" ("True to the Faith,"<i>Ensign,</i>June 1996, 2).<br><br>As students here at BYU you represent one of the great centers of strength in the Church. Along with the future leadership you will provide to the Church, many of you will make significant contributions to our communities across the nation and the world. You have so much to give and so much to do in the years that lie ahead. The challenge of your professors and leaders is to help you be prepared both spiritually and temporally for the world of opportunities and challenges that awaits you. I trust you are preparing now to make the most of those future opportunities.<br><br>Interestingly, it was 50 years ago about this very week that we graduated from the University of Illinois with my PhD degree. I say "we" because Sister Staheli earned her share of that degree as she worked to help pay the rent and food bills during our three years of graduate school.<br><br>Over the ensuing 40 years we lived in the suburban areas of Chicago and New York City, where we worked and raised our family. We were blessed with a rewarding career as we traveled the world of business. We were blessed with opportunities for service in the Church, as well as in organizations in various areas of the world. For the past nine-plus years I have served as a member of the Quorum of the Seventy. That, too, has been a special experience and blessing.<br><br>The Lord's hand has truly been in our lives. But with these blessings have come tests and challenges--just as most of you periodically experience and will continue to experience in the years ahead.<br><br>This is a special time in your life when choices are made and patterns and habits are formed that will have a major impact on who you will become.<br><br>Your enrollment here at BYU is a significant step in preparing for your future. In addition to your educational pursuits, your future happiness, personal righteousness, and relationship with the Lord will depend in large part on the habits you embrace and the choices and commitments you make over these next few years.<br><br>As you think about your preparation for the next steps in your life, ponder with me for a moment how the Lord transferred responsibility from Moses to Joshua. He gave Joshua an extraordinary promise, followed by some strong counsel. Listen to a few excerpts of what the Lord said:<br><br><i>As I was with Moses, so I will be with thee: I will not fail thee, nor forsake thee.</i><br><br><i>Be strong and of a good courage. . . .</i><br><br><i>Only be thou strong and very courageous, that thou mayest observe to do according to all the law . . . : turn not from it to the right hand or to the left, that thou mayest prosper whithersoever thou goest.</i>[Joshua 1:5–7]<br><br>After reminding Joshua of the importance of obedience, the Lord promised: "For then thou shalt make thy way prosperous, and then thou shalt have good success" (verse 8). This is a great promise.<br><br>And then, for the third time, the Lord repeated in verse 9: "Have not I commanded thee? Be strong and of a good courage; be not afraid, neither be thou dismayed: for the Lord thy God is with thee whithersoever thou goest."<br><br>The Lord's message to Joshua--"I will not fail thee, nor forsake thee"--has been repeated through the ages in the scriptures and through the prophets of the Restoration. It applies to each of us today--conditioned, of course, upon our obedience to His commandments and the covenants we make in the temples.<br><br>Some of you know exactly what you want to do with your life. Others are still pondering and discovering opportunities for the future. In either case, it is essential to your future success and happiness that you keep your minds and your hearts open to the promptings of the Spirit. As you live to be worthy of those spiritual promptings, the Lord has promised that He will be with you.<br><br>Joshua later made his own choice clear to his people when he said, "Choose you this day whom ye will serve . . . : but as for me and my house, we will serve the Lord" (Joshua 24:15).<br><br>A philosopher once gave good counsel regarding choices:<br><br><i>Choose well; your choice is</i><br><i>Brief, and yet endless.</i><br>[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, "Symbolum" or "Mason Lodge," trans. Thomas Carlyle]<br><br>As you acknowledge that the Lord "will not fail thee," as long as you are obedient to His teachings, then I would ask, Are you happy with the present conduct of your life? What changes or course corrections should you make in order to take full advantage of your daily opportunities for learning and personal spiritual growth?<br><br>Now is the time to set the course for what you want to be--five or 10 years or even 50 years from now.<br><br>During our few minutes together today, it would be my prayer that something might be said or felt that will help you crystallize your thoughts as to who you are and what you have the potential to become.<br><br>It has been said that one of the greatest tragedies of our time is that so many people live so far below their potential.<br><br>President Spencer W. Kimball frequently encouraged us to "lengthen our stride" and to "enlarge our vision" ("When the World Will Be Converted,"<i>Ensign,</i>October 1974, 5).<br><br>President Gordon B. Hinckley continually counsels, "Do your best." And then he has added: "But I want to emphasize that it be the very best. We are too prone to be satisfied with mediocre performance. We are capable of doing so much better" ("Standing Strong and Immovable," World Leadership Training Meeting, 10 January 2004 [Salt Lake City: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 2004], 21).<br><br>The late Elder Neal A. Maxwell said it another way: "The Lord loves each of us too much to merely let us go on being what we now are, for he knows what we have the possibility to become!" ("In Him All Things Hold Together,"<i>BYU 1990–91 Devotional and Fireside Speeches</i>[Provo: BYU, 1991], 107).<br><br>Implicit in the statements from each of these distinguished leaders is the message that each of us can and should do more to meet the Lord's expectations of us.<br><br>Let's talk about a few principles that are essential for success and happiness as you develop your careers, families, and service to the Lord. As you further refine your plans for the future, you will not only find success in a temporal sense but you will be moving toward achieving a relationship with your Father in Heaven and Savior that prepares you for an eternal relationship in the celestial kingdom.<br><br>First and foremost in your pursuit is the development and nurturing of a strong personal testimony. I assume that each of you has a basic testimony of the gospel. Some periodically struggle. Many are strong as you have returned from missions or have focused on prayer and study that have brought you to an undeniable testimony of the truth. Presumably that was a major factor in motivating you to come to BYU.<br><br>Hopefully you feel that your testimony is vibrant and growing stronger each day. Yet, even though you are in a special environment here at BYU, I would suspect that many of you are being challenged by the "things of the world" with which you periodically deal. I am referring to the daily bombardment of worldly messages and enticements from the media of TV, movies, and the Internet that tend to tempt or distract you from keeping your testimony strong and staying completely true to gospel principles and covenants. Certain kinds of peer pressures can also be challenging.<br><br>Let me tell you about a young friend I met while serving as president of a stake that included West Point Academy in the state of New York. He was a bright 4.0 student at the academy. He had been given a leave of absence from West Point to serve a mission and was readmitted on completion of his mission--not a common occurrence. On one of my visits to the West Point Branch he requested some time to talk.<br><br>As we talked he told me of how he had deepened his conversion to the gospel as he served his mission. He remembered the feelings and strength of his testimony when he returned to West Point following his mission. Then he said: "In the two years since my mission I have gradually felt the Spirit slipping away from me. Every day I am associating with other cadets with different values. Their whole focus in life is successfully graduating from the academy. Periodically the honor code is compromised. Nearly every weekend is party time--alcohol and young women. I am hazed and ridiculed when I refuse to join with them.<br><br>"President Staheli, I need help. I feel like I am being tossed to and fro on the seas of life, and I have lost my mooring. My gospel anchor of the past seems to be giving way to the life of fun and pleasures enjoyed by my colleagues at the academy."<br><br>As we talked it became clear that the magnet of the adversary was gradually but surely drawing him into Satan's grasp. My young friend had lost his mooring--not because Satan had become stronger but because my friend had not been nurturing and tending to his testimony. He was in the process of losing what he had previously so deeply cherished.<br><br>I realize you are in a very different environment here at BYU, yet I relate this experience because even here at BYU you are not immune to the adversary's many wiles that look attractive on the surface and may appear harmless only because you feel you can resist.<br><br>Just claiming to know the gospel is true is not always enough. My young friend at West Point knew. He had developed a testimony, but it had slipped away from him because he failed to nourish it. As he had begun to respond to and engage in the activities of his peers, he gradually lost the promptings of the Spirit.<br><br>I cannot think of a greater loss to anyone than the loss of the promptings of the Spirit.<br><br>Our testimonies grow through faith, prayer, scripture study, and obedience to the commandments. The daily exercise and nurturing of these principles is key to a strong and resilient testimony and commitment to gospel principles. Let me comment on each of these principles.<br><br>President Gordon B. Hinckley speaks often about our need for faith. I had the privilege of returning with President Hinckley from Nauvoo on the plane following the cornerstone ceremony at the Nauvoo Temple. As we flew over the rich farmland of Iowa, I was commenting on the unbelievable faith and commitment of those early Saints. I was musing that I was not sure I would have had sufficient faith to keep company with those faithful Saints.<br><br>In his usual optimistic response, President Hinckley said, "Sure you would, Don." And then he made his real point with me as he reminded me that some of the most faithful Saints faltered, lost faith, and fell by the wayside. His response strongly suggests that our testimonies are vulnerable if we do not stay on course in keeping God's commandments.<br><br>President Gordon B. Hinckley frequently encourages us to have "the kind of faith that moves one to get on his knees and plead with the Lord and then get on his feet and go to work" ("God Shall Give unto You Knowledge by His Holy Spirit,"<i>Speeches of the Year, 1973</i>[Provo: BYU, 1974], 109; see also<i>TGBH,</i>186).<br><br>That is sound advice for every one of us. As we follow his counsel, our testimonies and our commitments to make right choices will grow.<br><br>When I reflect on my youth and the initial development of my testimony, I realize nothing had a greater impact on its development than the faith of my mother and father and their daily application of that faith in their prayers. The Lord responded to their faith and prayers, and as children we witnessed the hand of the Lord in our family. We came to know the meaning of what Moroni meant when he said: "I would show unto the world that faith is things which are hoped for and not seen; wherefore, dispute not because ye see not, for ye receive no witness until after the trial of your faith" (Ether 12:6).<br><br>The faith of our family was tried time and again. And, periodically, special spiritual experiences too tender to tell followed. I bear testimony that the Lord does hear and answer prayers--prayers from the hearts of His faithful children.<br><br>When your lives become crowded with other activities, it is easy to periodically skip a prayer or to use an abbreviated version of your prayers.<i>Don't shortchange the Lord on your prayers.</i>Nothing you will do during any day of your life will be more important to your temporal success or your eternal progress than consistent, humble, sincere prayers offered at least morning and night of every day.<br><br>As I visited with my young friend from West Point, it became clear that his faith had wavered and the consistency and sincerity of his prayers had waned. The joshing of his peers and the seeming attractiveness of Satan's alternatives had begun to overshadow his commitment to exercise his faith and prayers.<br><br>Equally important in our pursuit of happiness and a secure testimony is the daily habit of reading and pondering the scriptures. The reading and study habits you are forming in your religion classes will have a lasting impact on your personal commitment to the scriptures. The busier life becomes, the more difficult it is to stay connected to this important part of our spiritual growth. Yet making the scriptures a part of your daily life is another foundation stone of your testimony.<br><br>King Benjamin sternly admonished his people, "If you believe all these things see that ye do them" (Mosiah 4:10).<br><br>Living to be worthy of the Spirit and then responding to its promptings is an essential ingredient to a strong and vibrant testimony.<br><br>To be worthy of the Spirit embodies the bottom line of obedient living. To truly accomplish this is the quest of a lifetime.<br><br>Nephi's early example of obedience has been taught to us from our youth. Likewise, we know how Laman and Lemuel developed into the "murmurers" of the family. They played the role of the "natural man" that King Benjamin described.<br><br>Conversely, Nephi made his commitment to the Lord early on when he said, "I will go and do the things which the Lord hath commanded" (1 Nephi 3:7). And then he did, with unwavering faith.<br><br>The important point is that Nephi had made the decision as to how he was going to respond to the Lord's commandments. From that point forward he was steadfast. I suspect Satan worked on him, just as he does each of us today, yet the scriptures indicate that Satan was totally unsuccessful in affecting Nephi's decision to do the Lord's will.<br><br>The prototype of Lehi's family has played out through the centuries. The world is replete with the Lamans and Lemuels. They are some of Satan's best students. Great blessings come to those who follow Nephi's example.<br><br>Understanding and responding to the principle of obedience has singular importance in preparing us for success and eternal happiness. As the Lord promised Joshua, He "will not fail thee, nor forsake thee" as long as you are striving daily to obey His commandments.<br><br>As you progress through your education here at BYU, you have some electives or choices in what you pursue in your education. You also have some "required" subjects.<br><br>The same is true of the gospel of Jesus Christ. It gives us agency and ample freedom of choices, but the ultimate success of those choices depends on our diligence in keeping the commandments and covenants we have made with the Lord.<br><br>As you pursue your educational goals, it is essential that you keep focused on your spiritual commitments. The challenge with most of us is the tendency to become casual or to lose focus on those non-negotiable or non-compromising commandments from which promised blessings flow. Let me give you an example.<br><br>When Sister Staheli and I left Utah, en route to the University of Illinois with everything we owned contained in our little car, we were excited about embarking upon a new adventure. We had tried to be diligent in keeping the covenants we had made in the temple as a part of our marriage of about one year.<br><br>As we became fully engaged in our new life as a happily married but financially struggling couple, we lost focus on one important--in fact, essential--commandment of the gospel. As we approached the end of the year and tithing settlement, we had not only slipped on paying our tithing but were literally without food money for the last week of the year.<br><br>As we sheepishly and humbly approached our branch president at tithing settlement, he taught us an important lesson in financial management. More important, he gave us a phenomenal promise.<br><br>He promised that if we would make up the tithing owed to the Lord and then faithfully pay it each month before we addressed our other needs and wants, the Lord would bless us as promised. In fact, he promised us that as future faithful tithe payers we would have an increase in income each year thereafter. That came true--and stayed so, until my call as a Seventy. The Lord truly did open the windows of heaven and pour out blessings to us.<br><br>My wife and I had been raised by faithful tithe-paying parents. We had been full-tithe payers throughout our youthful years. Yet this came as a poignant lesson of how becoming casual on important principles can cause one to lose focus on what is really essential to the Lord.<br><br>Satan works constantly on this principle of blurring our focus relating to gospel principles. He seductively encourages our casualness by helping us feel secure that "this won't matter" or "that won't taint my mind." This is especially true as he casually leads young people down the slippery slope of immorality.<br><br>I believe Satan has a dominant influence on the media--television, movies, and the Internet. Each becomes seductive in its own way. As young adults you may feel you can handle the sexually explicit programs on television without affecting your spiritual well-being.<br><br>Even more pernicious are the R-rated movies that carry you into the even more explicit. It is clear that frequent exposure tends to legitimize that which we see and hear. It dulls our sense of conscience between the acceptable and unacceptable. It is Satan's way of leading you down the slippery slope toward immoral thoughts and actions.<br><br>And those parts of the Internet that move you into pornography serve as the devil's trump card. It only takes a few viewings of pornography and he has you hooked. Then he begins to work his evil power, because what you have seen and heard becomes paramount in your thought processes. And the more you see, the more addicted you become.<br><br>You young people, especially you young men, have become Satan's target audience. It is his way of leading you into the abyss of immorality. Let me hasten to add that neither are you married students immune to Satan's attractions. Pornography can become one of the most destructive elements of your marriage.<br><br>We plead with any of you who are in any way involved in pornography to see your bishop so that he can help you find your way out of the cesspool of filth that is designed to destroy you.<br><br>Be careful that you don't let Satan use his influence to control your thoughts and actions, and ultimately your future.<br><br>When you are able to recognize and overcome any personal irritants you may have toward certain principles of obedience, you will feel God endowing you with the power of the Spirit to resist the inappropriate things of the world that Satan would have you enjoy.<br><br>When we are able to declare as the people did to King Benjamin that there has been "a mighty change in us, or in our hearts, that we have no more disposition to do evil, but to do good continually" (Mosiah 5:2), then we will be well on the road to success and eternal happiness.<br><br>The companionship of the Spirit and the strength of your testimonies will depend on daily nurturing of your faith, praying, studying the scriptures, and obeying the commandments. As you do so, you will be moving toward achieving the spiritual and temporal blessings the Lord has in store for you.<br><br>You will realize the blessing promised to Joshua: "For then thou shalt make thy way prosperous, and then thou shalt have good success" (Joshua 1:8).<br><br>The Lord wants each of you to find joy and happiness and success in your professional and vocational pursuits. But He wants you to do it in a way that your ambitions for success do not supersede your priority for living gospel principles.<br><br>President Thomas S. Monson painted the picture as follows: "We have been provided divine attributes to guide our journey. We enter mortality not to float with the moving currents of life, but with the power to think, to reason, and to achieve" ("Invitation to Exaltation,"<i>Ensign,</i>June 1993, 5).<br><br>These are the years when you must take responsibility for who you now are and what you want to become.<br><br>Think carefully about where you are. Remember, education is the key to the door of opportunity.<br><br>The Savior's parable of the talents is so applicable to you at this stage in your lives. Jesus knows there are differences between you--intellectually, emotionally, and physically. Therefore He only expects you to magnify and develop whatever talents and abilities you have.<br><br>But He expects you to be accountable for your actions in so doing. He will not measure your progress against others. He does not grade on the curve! Rather He blesses you for what you are doing to magnify whatever gifts and talents you have been given.<br><br>At all costs do not allow yourself to "float with the moving currents of life," as President Monson has counseled. Take control of your actions and prepare to succeed at whatever you are capable of doing.<br><br>Remember President Hinckley's counsel: "Just do the best you can, but be sure it is your very best" ("A Challenging Time--A Wonderful Time," An Evening with President Gordon B. Hinckley, seminary and institute broadcast, 7 February 2003, 5).<br><br>This is also a time in your life when counsel from others can help you decide what you should be doing that will move you toward achieving your full potential.<br><br>It is the wise counsel and mentoring of a few special teachers, priesthood leaders, parents, and a loving wife that helped me make some course corrections in preparation for what has turned out to be a wonderfully challenging and happy pursuit of life.<br><br>As you recall, the Lord counseled Joshua to "be strong and of a good courage" as he took on his new responsibilities. That same counsel applies to you as you prepare to pursue careers that will take you to different parts of the world.<br><br>Periodically you will be placed in situations that will require you to "be strong and of a good courage" in order to stay true and faithful to gospel principles. As President David O. McKay has said, paraphrasing William George Jordan, "There is one responsibility which no man can evade, and that responsibility is personal influence" ("The Mission of Brigham Young University," address given at BYU, 27 April 1948, 3; also<i>CR,</i>October 1969, 87; see William George Jordan, "The Power of Personal Influence," chapter 3 of<i>The Majesty of Calmness</i>[New York: Fleming H. Revell Company, 1900], 19).<br><br>Worldly standards will always be in a state of flux. The only true and unchanging standards are those set by the Savior and His teachings and principles of the restored gospel.<br><br>My wife and I have lived all our married life in the mission field. We have traveled the world as part of our business career. In the earlier years of our career, to live by LDS standards was an oddity--and not a generally accepted one either. Yet, with a few exceptions, once people understood our principles and standards and our desire to stay true to them, they respected us for them.<br><br>As you have the courage to be true to your beliefs, your exemplary conduct will not go unnoticed. While you will be tried and tested, your faithful adherence to the Lord's standards will be seen as a beacon in the night to those around you.<br><br>I could recite dozens of examples of my personal experiences on this subject, but let me conclude with a reference to President Hinckley.<br><br>President Hinckley is an impeccable example of courageous leadership. He is steadfast and true to principle and courageously forthright in his convictions. Yet with unwavering courage he has the ability to express his commitments to gospel principles in clear but acceptable terms to those not of our faith.<br><br>Hopefully his example will help you to "be strong and of a good courage" when pushed to compromise your standards. You will be respected for your integrity. And if occasionally you are not, you need not worry, because that is not the kind of association you will want or need in your future.<br><br>"As the finest generation in the history of the Church," much is expected of you (Gordon B. Hinckley,<i>CR,</i>April 1992, 96; or "A Chosen Generation,"<i>Ensign,</i>May 1992, 69). And we have confidence you will live up to those expectations.<br><br>I bear testimony, brothers and sisters, of the divinity of Heavenly Father's plan for each of you. Jesus is truly our Savior, and He very much loves and cares for you. As you keep His commandments and follow the counsel of the prophets and your leaders, He will be there to guide you through the challenges that lie ahead. He "will not fail thee, nor forsake thee."<br><br>May His choicest blessings be with each of you, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Donald L.

<h1> from Our Conflicts - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Some months ago, when I was invited to speak today, I asked what I should talk about. After a long pause the voice said, "Well, people usually talk about things they're good at." So my topic today is conflict.<br><br>I used to think other people had conflicts but that I was immune. Then I came upon two incidents in the life of the Prophet Joseph Smith that completely changed my understanding of conflicts and forced me to admit I probably have as many as anybody else.<br><br>What is a conflict? For our purposes today, a conflict is any situation in which both sides feel the other is in the wrong.<br><br>I'll begin with seven propositions about conflicts.<br><br>1. It is strange, but unless we had a conflict in the last few hours, most of us don't remember our conflicts. This may be good, because it saves us pain, but it creates a problem. If we don't remember our conflicts, we can't learn anything from them.<br><br>2. We probably experience conflicts differently--depending on our personalities, our prior experiences (such as the way conflicts were handled in the home where we grew up), and perhaps other factors such as gender and culture.<br><br>3. In Mormon culture most people are conflict avoiders. However, some of us are neutral about conflict, and some of us actually enjoy a good conflict.<br><br>4. If we are in relationships with others, there will be conflicts. They may be small or they may be large, but there will surely be conflicts. Can you think of any conflicts in your life right now? Perhaps a few hints will help. If you do think of a conflict or two, I hope you will jot them down.<br><br>a. Conflicts with family, such as father, mother, siblings, spouse, children, or in-laws.<br><br>b. Conflicts with people you see often who are <i>not</i> family: neighbors, landlords, merchants, even people at church. President Brigham Young summed it up in rhyme:<br><br><i>To live with Saints in Heaven is bliss and glory</i><br><br><i>To live with Saints on Earth is another story.</i><sup>1</sup><br><br>5. It takes two sides to create a conflict. More important, there is almost always fault on <i>both</i> sides. As someone said, "It's a mighty thin pancake that only has one side."<br><br>6. During a conflict we are usually blind to our own fault and we blame the other side.<br><br>7. A final proposition introduces my theme. When we remember our conflicts and reflect on them, they are like mirrors that can teach us things about ourselves that are otherwise difficult to discover. If we permit them, our conflicts will show us where we are weak, defensive, prideful, or otherwise in need of repair.<br><h2><b>First Example</b></h2><br>I'll illustrate the value of conflicts with three examples. Two are from the life of the Prophet Joseph Smith. These both involve Oliver Cowdery, who, at the time, was Joseph's most trusted associate. These conflicts occurred very close to each other in the summer of 1830, just after the Church was organized. Joseph was 24 years old, and Oliver was 23.<br><br>Joseph was busy copying and arranging revelations for publication. Oliver was staying with the Whitmer family in Fayette, 80 miles to the north. Out of the blue, Joseph received a letter from Oliver.<br><br>Joseph recorded:<br><br>[Oliver] <i>wrote to inform me that he had discovered an error in one of the commandments--Book of Doctrine and Covenants: "And truly manifest by their works that they have received of the Spirit of Christ unto a remission of their sins"</i> [D&amp;amp;C 20:37].<br><br><i>The above quotation,</i> [Oliver] <i>said, was erroneous, and added: "I command you in the name of God to erase those words, that no priestcraft be amongst us!"</i><br><br>The Prophet continued:<br><br><i>I immediately wrote to him in reply, in which I asked him by what authority he took upon him to command me to alter or erase, to add to or diminish from, a revelation or commandment from Almighty God.</i><sup>2</sup><br><br>Doctrinally, Oliver was wrong and Joseph was right. But knowing that doesn't solve the problem. These two trusted friends were now in a conflict--both felt the other was in the wrong. The doctrinal issue could be solved, but what about the bad feelings that had arisen between them?<br><br>Realizing his letter had not really answered the doctrinal question and had made the interpersonal problem worse, Joseph traveled 80 miles to the Whitmer home to meet with Oliver and the Whitmers.<br><br>Joseph reported:<br><br><i>I found the</i> [Whitmer] <i>family in general of</i> [Oliver's] <i>opinion concerning the words above quoted, and it was not without both labor and perseverance that I could prevail with any of them to reason calmly on the subject. . . . Finally, with</i> [Christian Whitmer's] <i>assistance, I succeeded in bringing, not only the Whitmer family, but also Oliver Cowdery to acknowledge that they had been in error, and that the sentence in dispute was in accordance with the rest of the commandment.</i><br><br>Joseph then reflected on what he learned from this experience. His conclusions are the centerpiece of my message today:<br><br><i>And thus was this error rooted out, which having its rise in presumption and rash judgment, was . . . particularly calculated (when once fairly understood) to teach each and all of us the necessity of humility and meekness before the Lord, that He might teach us of His ways.</i><sup>3</sup><br><br>Judging from his emphasis on humility and meekness, Joseph was commenting not only on Oliver's doctrinal error but also on the interpersonal conflict between them and, I think, on the nature of conflicts in general. With prophetic insight he taught two important lessons. His first point was that conflicts arise "in presumption and rash judgment." <i>Presumptuous</i> means overconfident or even offensive. <i>Rash</i> means hasty or impetuous. With these definitions in mind, let us look again at Oliver's message to Joseph. He said: "I command you in the name of God to erase those words, that no priestcraft be amongst us!"<sup>4</sup><br><br>Do you see any ways in which Oliver's statement might be considered rash or presumptuous? Certainly commanding another person risks being offensive, especially if it is your ecclesiastical leader. Commanding "in the name of God" would raise offensiveness a degree or two. Accusing your leader of priestcraft would undoubtedly qualify.<br><br>I move to the next statement with trepidation, but Joseph invited us to consider the effect of his reply as well. Joseph "immediately wrote to [Oliver]," asking: "By what authority he took upon him to command me to alter or erase, to add to or diminish from, a revelation or commandment from Almighty God."<br><br>Are there ways in which Joseph's words might have lacked "humility and meekness"? At a minimum he might have responded with a comment and a question such as, "Oliver, I love you and I value your opinion. Would you help me understand your objection to this passage?"<br><br>Joseph's second point added power to the first. He concluded that "[conflicts are] particularly calculated (when once fairly understood) to teach each and all of us."<br><br>Three ideas stand out in this statement. First, conflicts are particularly calculated to teach us something. Second, we can't learn from them until they are fairly understood, until we can see both sides--meaning we need to cool off before we can learn from them. Third, in a marvelous illustration of his own humility, Joseph included himself as one who learned something important from this conflict.<br><br>If our conflicts are particularly calculated to teach us something, what are we supposed to learn? Joseph's answer goes deep: Conflicts are particularly calculated to teach us "the necessity of humility and meekness before the Lord, that He might teach us of His ways."<br><br>Why did Joseph say humility "before the Lord"? Why didn't he say "before the person on the other side"? To learn from our conflicts we must be willing to see our own faults, and we need the Lord's help to do that. Only then can He begin to "teach us of <i>His</i> ways" (emphasis added).<br><br>We come to the ultimate question: What <i>are</i> the Lord's ways for dealing with conflict? They are illustrated in a second conflict between Joseph and Oliver.<br><h2><b>Second Example</b></h2><br>Just a month after the first conflict, to escape persecution, Joseph and Emma moved 80 miles north to the Whitmer home in Fayette--the home Joseph had so recently visited to resolve the first conflict. Arriving at the Whitmer home, Joseph was grieved to learn that Hiram Page, one of the eight witnesses to the Book of Mormon, had been receiving revelations through a "seer stone" that purported to give instructions on how the Church should operate. Newel Knight was with Joseph, and he described the seriousness of the problem:<br><br>[Hiram Page] <i>had managed to get up some dissension of feeling among the brethren by giving revelations concerning the government of the Church . . . , which he claimed to have received through the medium of a stone he possessed. . . . Even Oliver Cowdery and the Whitmer family had given heed to them.</i><sup>5</sup><br><br>What could have been more painful and frustrating to Joseph than this? If Joseph had followed his earlier pattern, he would have demanded of Hiram Page by what authority he presumed to receive revelations for the Church, and he would have demanded of Oliver what on earth he was thinking to believe in such things. But Joseph was more aware that a hasty and intemperate response would not solve the problem. Joseph knew what <i>not</i> to do, but he wasn't sure what he <i>ought</i> to do.<br><br>Newel Knight wrote:<br><br><i>Joseph was perplexed and scarcely knew how to meet this new exigency. That night I occupied the same room that he did and the greater part of the night was spent in prayer and supplication.</i><sup>6</sup><br><br>Rather than react defensively, Joseph patiently sought counsel from the Lord. He was soon granted an answer in the form of a revelation, which is now section 28 of the Doctrine and Covenants.<br><h2><b>Doctrine and Covenants, Section 28</b></h2><br>Section 28 is well known for answering the question of who <i>can--</i>and who <i>cannot--</i>receive revelation for the Church. It is also a model of the Lord's willingness to see wrongdoers in the larger context of their lives and to show divine confidence in them while reproving or correcting them.<br><br>The Lord spoke in the first person directly to Oliver: "Behold, I say unto thee, Oliver, that it shall be given unto thee that thou shalt be heard by the church in all things whatsoever thou shalt teach them . . ." The Lord's first words were an affirmation of Oliver's good standing in the Lord's eyes. Then He added this stipulation: ". . . by the Comforter, concerning the revelations and commandments which I have given."<sup>7</sup><br><br>After clarifying that only the prophet can receive revelation for the Church, the Lord reaffirmed His divine confidence in Oliver: "And if thou art led at any time by the Comforter to <i>speak</i> . . . by the way of commandment unto the church, thou mayest do it."<sup>8</sup> And then, again, He outlined the limits on Oliver's authority: "But thou shalt not <i>write</i> by way of commandment, but by wisdom; And thou shalt not command him who is at thy head, and at the head of the church."<sup>9</sup><br><br>The Lord then turned to the source of the problem: Hiram Page. I am struck that He spoke with the same concern for Hiram's feelings as He had shown for Oliver's. This exemplifies the Lord's way, and it makes it much easier for Hiram to accept correction: "Take thy brother, Hiram Page, between him and thee alone, and tell him that those things which he hath written from that stone are not of me."<sup>10</sup><br><br>Instructed and corrected in this loving and reaffirming way, both Oliver Cowdery and Hiram Page recognized their error and continued in full fellowship in the Church for a long while.<br><h2><b>Third Example</b></h2><br>These two events in the life of the Prophet Joseph prepare us for one other scriptural example--the painful misunderstanding between Moroni and Pahoran in Alma 59 through 62. I wonder if this is where the Prophet Joseph gained his own understanding that conflicts are meaningful and we must learn from them.<br><br>Moroni is one of the great military leaders in all of scripture. At the early age of 25 he was made captain over all the Nephite armies. As you will recall, when the prophet Mormon abridged the records of Moroni's military leadership, he called him "a man of a perfect understanding"<sup>11</sup> and honored him with this remarkable endorsement:<br><br><i>If all men had been, and were, and ever would be, like unto Moroni, behold, the very powers of hell would have been shaken forever; yea, the devil would never have power over the hearts of the children of men.</i><br><br><i>Behold, he was a man like unto Ammon . . . , and even the other sons of Mosiah, yea, and also Alma and his sons, for they were all men of God.</i><sup>12</sup><br><br>It has always astonished me that this same Mormon included, as part of his abridged record, a vivid account of Moroni's conflict with Pahoran, the chief judge and governor of the Nephites.<br><br>As we learn in Alma 59, Moroni's army was caught in a dangerous situation. Lamanite armies were rapidly gaining ground against them. As chief military leader, Moroni wrote Pahoran for reinforcements. Receiving none, the scripture reports, "Moroni was angry with the government, because of their indifference concerning the freedom of their country."<sup>13</sup><br><br>When no help came from the government, Moroni wrote Pahoran again. He began with the facts: the suffering of his men, the slaughter of thousands of the Nephite people, and other atrocities of war. But Moroni didn't realize that Pahoran had been driven from his throne by the king-men and forced to take refuge in Gideon, and Moroni wrongly accused Pahoran of being a traitor to his own country. Moroni concluded with these challenging words: "Behold, the Lord saith unto me: If those whom ye have appointed your governors do not repent of their sins and iniquities, ye shall go up to battle against them."<sup>14</sup><br><br>We are treading sacred ground here. Is there any question whether the Lord had inspired Moroni to know there were problems at the government level that called for military help? Not at all. However, in his abridgment, Mormon made it clear that Moroni mistakenly assumed Pahoran was part of the problem and threatened to remove him as head of the government.<br><br>I have puzzled many years why Mormon would include a detailed account of this uncharacteristic error by the great Captain Moroni. I expect it was for at least two reasons.<br><br>One would be to show us that none of us, not even the great Captain Moroni, is immune from presumption and rash judgment. What a comfort it is to me, and I hope to you, that we are in the best of company when we make errors of this kind. This is not to excuse them but to give us permission to admit our mistakes and to learn from them.<br><br>The second reason is to show us one of the best examples in all of scripture of how to respond to an unjust accusation. We know very little about Pahoran except that he was an upright ruler committed to standing "fast in that liberty in . . . which God . . . made us free."<sup>15</sup> In chapter 61, Mormon, as editor, gave us Pahoran's entire response to Captain Moroni. I will quote only two of the 20 verses included in his answer:<br><br><i>I, Pahoran, who am the chief governor of this land, do send these words. . . . Behold, I say unto you, Moroni, that I do not joy in your great afflictions, yea, it grieves my soul. . . .</i><br><br><i>And now, in your epistle you have censured me, but it mattereth not; I am not angry, but </i>do rejoice in the greatness of your heart.<sup>16</sup><br><br>How did Pahoran do it? How could he respond in such humility and meekness before the Lord? He probably sat right down and wrote an angry reply, venting his injured feelings against Moroni. If so, when he was finished, he did what we all must do--he tore it up and threw it away. Then he must have spent long hours in supplication to the Lord to find the strength to overlook the unjust accusations and to reply with such compassion and love.<br><br>In Proverbs we read that "grievous words stir up anger" and "a soft answer turneth away wrath."<sup>17</sup> Pahoran's soft answer is a beautiful example of what the Prophet Joseph said about "the necessity of humility and meekness before the Lord, that He might teach us of <i>His</i> ways."<sup>18</sup><br><br>Even in this misjudgment Moroni is also our model. When he learned of his error, he was not prideful. He immediately marched to the aid of Pahoran, and with their combined forces they overthrew the king-men and the Lamanites, and peace was restored in the land.<br><br>As you reflect on these examples, do they call to mind any other gospel principles? I'm thinking in particular of that favorite scripture, Ether 12:27:<br><br><i>And if men come unto me I will show unto them their weakness. I give unto men weakness that they may be humble; and my grace is sufficient for all men that humble themselves before me; for if they humble themselves before me, and have faith in me, then will I make weak things become strong unto them.</i><br><br>President Kimball taught this gospel principle in terms of mirrors. He said, "Our vision is completely obscured when we have no mirror to [show us] our own faults and [we] look only for the foibles of others."<sup>19</sup><br><br>Edward Edinger, a wise psychologist, wrote this about mirrors:<br><br>[A mirror] <i>shows us what we otherwise cannot see for ourselves because we are too close to it. Without a mirror, for instance, we would never even know what our face looks like; since we are inside looking out, there can be no self-knowledge, even the elementary self-knowledge of what we look like, unless there is some device that can turn the light back on us.</i><sup>20</sup><br><h2><b>Final Observations</b></h2><br>I conclude with a few final observations about conflicts. Again, more could be said, but you will understand.<br><br>1. Conflicts are easy to get into but difficult to get out of. If we have the courage to face them early, they are easier to resolve and to learn from.<br><br>2. Conflicts can be dangerous, because they easily fly out of control. They need good containers--such as good friendships and solid marriages--to hold them in. Early detection helps.<br><br>3. There are plenty of conflicts. They are also cyclical. If we don't learn from one, that's okay; wait a while, and, sure enough, the conflict will come around again and again until it either destroys a relationship or we learn from it. (If we learn from it, we move on to the next level of conflict, higher up on the plane of progression.)<br><br>4. Things often get worse before they get better. But it is generally better to face the problem now than to wait for the next time around.<br><br>5. It's cruel that it should be this way, but the thing we're supposed to learn about ourselves is usually obvious to the person we're in conflict with.<br><br>6. Even when we are right, we may be wrong. Even when we are right--or <i>especially</i> when we are right--if we are presumptuous and rash, we will give offense and become a stumbling block to others.<br><br>7. We learn by experience; but experience is not a very good teacher <i>unless </i>we remember our conflicts. It is a mark of greatness to remember and to learn from our conflicts.<br><h2><b>Conclusion</b></h2><br>We should think of our conflicts as mirrors that reflect back upon us things about ourselves we would rather not know. As we learn in Ether 12:27, it is a gift from heaven to be shown our weakness. If we will reflect upon <i>our</i> weakness, as the Prophet Joseph did upon his, the Lord will make us strong where we are weak.<br><br>I pray we may learn from our conflicts, that the Lord may teach us of <i>His</i> ways. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Gerald R. Williams was a professor of law at the BYU J.

<h1>r of One: Selfless Service - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Mavis sat in her comfortable rocking chair as she listened to the evening news. Toward the end of the news she heard the reporter mention that in South America many newborns were being sent home wrapped in newspaper.<br><br>"Wrapped in newspaper?" said Mavis out loud. "That's terrible!"<br><br>So Mavis went to her sewing room and went to work. Over the next few weeks she made more than 200 quilts and receiving blankets. As she finished each blanket, she gave it an affectionate hug before placing it in one of the boxes to be taken to the Church's Humanitarian Services Center.<br><br>There's something you should know about Mavis: she was 91 years old and legally blind. But Mavis was an amazing individual. She said, "There is something I can do," and she wanted to exert herself to make a difference to the newborns around the world.<br><br>Elder H. Burke Peterson stated:<br><br><i>In the day-to-day process of living, with all of its trials, challenges, and discouragements, we often underestimate our own God-given attributes and abilities which make it possible for each of us to pattern his or her life after that of the Savior and, in fact, do some of the things he did as he lived here among men. We may never personally experience the miracle of raising the dead, or be one to turn water into wine. We may not be one of thousands who may be fed from a few loaves and fishes, or be a part of the miraculous experience of walking on a stormy sea. But, for each one of us, there are a number of Christlike patterns of living we can be a part of in our mortal sojourn.</i> [H. Burke Peterson, "Selflessness: A Pattern for Happiness," <i>Ensign,</i> May 1985, 66]<br><br>So what is it to be a selfless person? As Elder Peterson described:<br><br><i>A selfless person is one who is more concerned about the happiness and well-being of another than about his or her own convenience or comfort, one who is willing to serve another when it is neither sought for nor appreciated, or one who is willing to serve even those whom he or she dislikes. A selfless person displays a willingness to sacrifice, a willingness to</i> [put aside]<i> personal wants, and needs, and feelings.</i> [Peterson, "Selflessness," 66]<br><br>A few years ago my son served in the Ukraine Donetsk Mission. About a year and a half into his mission, I received a letter from two sister missionaries serving in that same area. While attending fast and testimony meeting one Sunday, they had heard a touching story shared by a recent convert that involved my son and his companion. The sister missionaries were sure my son would never share this incident, so they took it upon themselves to write and tell me the story. This is the story they shared in their letter:<br><br><i>A brother who was a recent convert in a small branch in eastern Ukraine was a hardworking father who made very little income from his job but tried diligently to provide for his family. All of his income went to buy food and to pay rent, utilities, and tithing. There was nothing left over for extras. But the one thing this dear brother wanted most of all was a tie to wear to church when he could bless the sacrament.</i><br><br><i>During the preceding couple of months he had saved a few pennies from each of his paychecks and put the money in a small leather coin purse with the hope that one day he would finally be able to purchase a tie to wear to church. By the week before fast and testimony meeting he had gathered sufficient funds to purchase his tie. He was so excited! Then, in the middle of the week, a family member became ill, and the saved tie funds were needed to purchase medicine. This dear brother was quite disappointed that another Sunday would go by without a tie. The days preceding church he silently prayed that somehow he could acquire a tie--not an expensive tie, just a simple, plain tie--so he could respectfully administer the sacrament of the Lord.</i><br><br><i>Late Saturday afternoon there was a knock at his apartment door, and when he opened the door there stood Elder Abegglen and his companion. As he gazed down at Elder Abegglen's hands, his eyes locked on a tie the missionary was holding.</i><br><br><i>"I understand you can use this tie," said Elder Abegglen.</i><br><br><i>With tears in his eyes, this good brother said, "I am here today to tell you God knows the simple desires of our hearts, and He sends forth His servants to answer our prayers."</i><br><br>In his address to his people in the Book of Mormon, King Benjamin said, "I tell you these things . . . that ye may learn that when ye are in the service of your fellow beings ye are only in the service of your God" (Mosiah 2:17). Whether it's a tie, a baby blanket, a smile, or a thoughtful note, there is something each of us can do to improve another's life.<br><br>Over the last two years I have had a wonderful opportunity to accompany nursing students to Ghana for a global health and diversity course. While in Ghana the students engage in wonderful opportunities to provide service. Ghana is inhabited by amazing, loving, poor people. Their village homes are simple--many made of mud with tin or thatched roofs. Furnishings consist of a few mats on the floor and wooden benches to sit on.<br><br>The nightly news pays little attention to the fact that in this day and age in the world there are 10 million children under the age of five that die from preventable causes every year. Out of those 10 million that die, four million are under the age of one. And of these four million children, one million die in the first few days of life (see Joy E Lawn, Simon Cousens, and Jelka Zupan, "4 Million Neonatal Deaths: When? Where? Why?" [Neonatal Survival 1], <i>The Lancet</i> 365, no. 9462 [March 5–11, 2005]: 891–900). Poverty, malnutrition, unskilled birth attendants, infection, and unclean water all contribute to this sad death statistic. But despite their poverty and lack of many material things, the Ghanaian people are happy; they are cheerful people, and they go forth every day with bright smiles.<br><br>Osu Children's Home in Accra is a wonderful, emotionally exhausting place for students to provide service. It is a simple place that needs painting, but it is a place that many abandoned children call home. Infants are housed in one area, toddlers in another, and primary-school-age children in another. Each year as we prepare to depart for Ghana, it is amazing how our students and their families get involved in gathering toys, new and used clothing, books, and sums of money to be given to struggling individuals and families. Because of our own experience with our children and our grandchildren, you would think that little children in Ghana would be so excited by toys, new clothes, socks, and shoes. But at the Osu Children's Home, we found that the children would bypass the toys and the pretty clothing. What the children wanted most from our students was to be held. They just wanted to experience a human touch, to snuggle in someone's arms, to hear a heartbeat.<br><br>How much time does it take to hold a hand, to offer a comforting word, to snuggle a child? In Proverbs 31:20 we read, "She stretcheth out her hand to the poor; yea, she reacheth forth her hands to the needy." I'd like you to remember that love is never wasted.<br><br>Sister Acquah is the president of the Cape Coast Relief Society. We were very busy this spring e-mailing back and forth to plan a health fair for the Relief Society sisters to be held on the first Saturday after we arrived in Ghana. As part of the health fair, this warm, caring person wanted the sisters in her stake to assemble hygiene kits and donate them to the children at a local school for the deaf and blind. She told me that for the last few years the Ghanaian Saints have been on the receiving end of many humanitarian efforts. It was time for the sisters to reach beyond themselves and give to someone else in need. What a moment of growth when people who have little learn to give to others. Selfless caring has a giving and a receiving component. We give that we might receive, and we receive that we might give again.<br><br>At the end of the health fair, the plan was that a small group of sisters would take the hygiene kits to the designated school. As the sisters were slowly leaving the health fair, Sister Acquah came over to me with a big smile and gave me a hug. Her statement to me in the blunt style of the Ghanaian people was that the health fair had turned out better than she had thought it would. I was not sure if she lacked confidence in our ability to present classes or if she was surprised that 262 sisters were willing to walk from distant villages, come by car, come by tro-tro, or come any way they could to the health fair that day.<br><br>As we sat and rested from the warm summer heat and the busy morning activities, Sister Acquah asked, "Of course you and your students are coming with us to deliver the hygiene kits to the school for the deaf and blind?<br><br>"Oh," I said, "you should really take the sisters who prepared the hygiene kits. They should experience the reward of their service project."<br><br>"Some will come," Sister Acquah said, "but I really want you and your students to come."<br><br>So we did. What a heart-changing experience followed for us that afternoon.<br><br>We all grumbled a little as we got on the bus to ride from the stake center to the school for the deaf and blind on the outskirts of Cape Coast, Ghana. I was thinking, it's a four-hour ride back to Accra, and it's late in the afternoon. There were giant rain clouds gathering on the horizon, and dirt roads and rain don't mix well. We turned off the main road and bounced our way down a dirt road toward the school. As we pulled into the school yard, the school seemed very deserted. I was thinking that somehow we had gotten the day or maybe the time of day wrong. But as the bus stopped and we started getting out, we saw smiling, squealing children appearing in the open windows of the assembly hall.<br><br>The Cape Coast sisters and the students helped arrange the hygiene kits on the table in the front of the assembly hall as restless children wiggled on their benches. They would wave and smile. The blind children's choir sang the opening song--"I Have God in My Heart." We were asked to respond, and in turn we sang to them "I Am a Child of God," and then the deaf and partially deaf children responded in sign language and voices singing a song called "Heavenly Father Loves Me." The Spirit was so tender in that bare room as these songs were exchanged. We knew why we had come. We had been fed by the Spirit in that room. Each one of our students helped to hand out the hygiene kits. These beautiful children greeted our students with hugs and squeals as they received their plastic bag containing soap, a toothbrush, a towel, toothpaste, and two combs. To them it was like Christmas. After hugs and many unexpected tears, we loaded up the bus and started on our trip home.<br><br>No one complained about how long it took to return to Accra or how scary the thunder and muddy roads were. They were so grateful to have been a part of delivering the hygiene kits to the school for the deaf and blind. In her reflective writing assignment related to her experience that day, one of the students shared the following quote: "She went to minister to them and found then ministering to her. She went to teach and was transformed by what she learned" (author unknown).<br><br>For 30 years I have had the opportunity to live in a wonderful neighborhood. I won't tell you where it is, because you'd probably like to move there. Every day I witness in this neighborhood selfless acts of service: friendly greetings, hot loaves of bread being exchanged, a widower being invited for Sunday dinner, a forgotten garbage can being pulled to the curb on garbage collection day, a thoughtful note left on the door, a ride to the hospital, and sack lunches prepared and delivered to the Food and Care Coalition. In times of sadness people gather to comfort. In times of celebration they are there to celebrate. We are never too young or too old to engage in selfless service.<br><br>In the BYU Museum of Art there is a large painting of the Savior healing a man by the pool of Bethesda. Historians believe the pool was most likely a natural spring rich in dissolved solids and gases. Today we would call it a mineral spring. These waters were reputed to possess curative powers, and many afflicted folks came there to bathe. The spring was a pulsating variety, where at intervals the water rose with bubbling and then receded to normal levels. It was believed that whoever was the first to enter the waters after the bubbling was made whole.<br><br>I love to sit in front of this picture. We are fortunate enough in the College of Nursing to have a smaller version of the painting. I sit on one side and see the perspective in the painting. Then sometimes I move to the other side to determine if there is something else I can see. Sometimes as I gaze at the picture I see myself as a spectator, someone who blends into the crowd and watches as others do. Sometimes I look at myself in this picture and try to think of myself as the Savior--patiently listening, focusing on the needs of the individual. The Savior always focused on individuals face-to-face, eye to eye, voice to ear, heart to heart, spirit to spirit, and hand to hand. His approach was and is loving, His voice soft and gentle. Sometimes as I look at this painting I picture myself as the suffering individual waiting by the pool to be healed, waiting for someone to help me into the pool of healing waters.<br><br>Quietly, with a soft voice, the Savior looked at the helpless man and said, "Wilt thou be made whole?" Of course the man wanted to be made whole. He was eagerly waiting for his moment in the pool.<br><br>"Sir," said the man to the Savior, "I have no man, when the water is troubled, to put me into the pool."<br><br>With tenderness in His eyes, the Savior replied, "Rise, take up thy bed, and walk."<br><br>The man obeyed. He took up his pallet and walked away. (See John 5:5–9.) Many present at the pool that day missed the whole marvelous interaction.<br><br>I often hear the Savior's words in my ear: "Wilt thou be made whole? Then serve thy brothers and sisters."<br><br>To be like the Savior is to be whole, which implies that we are engaged in acts of selfless service. Selfless service requires personal action, a desire to pick up our beds and walk. It is easy to give away excess money, used equipment, and used clothing. It is more difficult to give of our time, to give of our personal presence to help others. There is much beauty and goodness in the world today if we look for it. The evening news tells us that things are not very good and that there is a great deal of sadness. But there is a great deal of beauty in the world.<br><br>For those of you who this summer are at this university for the very first time, you need to know that there is a great tradition of service here. You have entered to learn and to serve. We want you to stretch and enlighten your minds and enrich your hearts while you are here. There are many wonderful faculty members who serve as examples of selfless service in the local community and in the extended global community. Find them. Work with them. Your loneliness from being away from home for the first time will be less if you use your power of one and engage in serving another person.<br><br>In the Gospel of Matthew the Savior conversed with the righteous people gathered around Him. They asked Him:<br><br><i>Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, and fed thee? or thirsty, and gave thee drink?</i><br><br><i>When saw we thee a stranger, and took thee in? or naked, and clothed thee?</i><br><br><i>Or when saw we thee sick, or in prison, and came unto thee?</i><br><br><i>And the King shall answer and say unto them, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me.</i> [Matthew 25:37–40]<br><br>We all need caring people in our lives, and we likewise need to care for others. May we humbly recognize our individual ability to have an impact on other lives for good and have the courage to do so, I humbly pray in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Jo Ann C. Abegglen was a BYU associate professor in the College of Nursing when this devotional address was given on 11 July 2006.</i><br><br><i>© Brigham Young University. All rights reserved.</i>

<h1> Doing, and Being - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I am grateful to be joined by my wife, Jeannie, and a number of our children and grandchildren today. In two months Jeannie and I will celebrate our 40th wedding anniversary. She has been a wonderful companion. She and my family are the source of my greatest joys. They are also the source of some of my greatest humor.<br><br>A few years ago, in a joint family home evening, my daughter Julie gave a lesson, and then I started making a few concluding comments, as grandpas often do. My little grandson, Ethan, then aged three, had had enough, and he shouted out, "Just say amen, Grandpa!" Even though he was quite young, he had learned that there is a direct correlation between when speakers say amen and when they stop talking. Ethan is here with us this morning, and I hope he will show a little restraint with his comments as I speak.<br><br>During the years I have taught at BYU, I have enjoyed hearing from a wide range of speakers on a great variety of topics. One story shared by Elder Oaks when he was president of BYU has stuck with me. Given from this very pulpit, the story went something like this:<br><br>Many years ago the federal government placed county agents throughout the country to help farmers learn to be more productive. One county agent in the South went to visit an old farmer in his area, but he found that convincing the farmer to change proved rather difficult.<br><br>He asked the farmer, "Wouldn't you like to know how to get your cows to give more milk?"<br><br>"Nope," the farmer replied.<br><br>"Well, wouldn't you like your pigs to have larger litters of baby pigs?"<br><br>Again the farmer answered, "Nope."<br><br>"Well, wouldn't you like to learn how to get more corn per acre?"<br><br>The same answer was given as before: "Nope."<br><br>Exasperated, the county agent asked, "Well, why not?"<br><br>The farmer replied simply, "I already knows more than I does."<br><br>In other words, his knowledge was greater than his application of that knowledge, so why make matters worse by obtaining even more knowledge!<br><br>This story highlights two great challenges of mortality: first, the need to constantly increase our knowledge and, second, the need to continually improve our behavior to keep up with that greater knowledge. But there's also a third challenge the county agent might have uncovered if he had asked a second "why" question: "Why don't you do as much as you know?" This question gets closer to the core of the problem--the farmer's level of love for his work, or what he was in his heart. In addition to increasing what we know and improving how we apply that knowledge, we must refine who we are deep down in our heart.<br><br>In a general conference address a few years ago, Elder Dallin H. Oaks stated, "In contrast to the institutions of the world, which teach us to <i>know</i> something, the gospel of Jesus Christ challenges us to <i>become</i> something" ("The Challenge to Become," <i>Ensign,</i> November 2000, 32; emphasis in original).<br><br>As we move along the path of life, each of us, as members of the Church, must address these three areas of knowing, doing, and being.<br><h2><b>Increasing Our Knowing</b></h2><br>First, we must increase our level of knowledge, or what we know. In our search for truth, however, we have to be selective, because we have an overwhelming amount of information available to us. It seems to me that information can be classified into four categories.<br><br>The first consists of that which is harmful and destructive. Much of today's media falls into this category. Pornography is especially dangerous, for it will drive away the Spirit and destroy us.<br><br>The second category includes information that isn't necessarily destructive but is not of much use. Pursuing it is largely a waste of time.<br><br>The third category includes information that is good and useful and offers much practical benefit. Most of our university learning falls into this category.<br><br>The fourth category includes vital information--specifically gospel knowledge. The truthfulness and value of the information in this fourth category will be confirmed to us by the Holy Spirit.<br><br>How important it is for us to shun the harmful, avoid wasting time on the useless, and, instead, focus on the useful and vital--that which gives eternal perspective, helps develop wisdom, and teaches us the mind and nature of God. The 13th article of faith says that we, as Latter-day Saints, seek after things that are "virtuous, lovely, or of good report or praiseworthy" (Articles of Faith 1:13). That's a good standard for us to keep in mind as we choose what to read, what to listen to, and what to view.<br><br>Where do we find the vital information for our lives? Three major sources, I believe, are the temple, Church magazines, and the scriptures. In the temple we come into the Lord's house, dedicated as "a house of learning" (D&amp;amp;C 109:8), where we are taught eternal truths through verbal, visual, and symbolic instruction and where we may seek inspiration for specific personal concerns. President Gordon B. Hinckley has said:<br><br><i>Every temple, large or small, has its beautiful celestial room. . . . It is our privilege, unique and exclusive, while dressed in white, to sit at the conclusion of our ordinance work in the beautiful celestial room and ponder, meditate, and silently pray.</i> ["Closing Remarks," <i>Ensign,</i> November 2004, 105]<br><br>We all need to make the temple an important and frequent part of our learning.<br><br>We also need the <i>Ensign</i> and its messages of wisdom and inspiration to come into our homes and into our lives each month. Just as the early Saints looked to their prophet Brigham Young to guide them along a literal path from the Midwest to the Rocky Mountains, so must we look to our prophets to guide us along a spiritual path. I hope each student apartment receives the <i>Ensign</i> each month and is blessed by its influence.<br><br>In addition to learning from the temple and from the <i>Ensign,</i> we need daily scripture study. Just as helium slowly escapes from an inflated balloon, allowing it to shrink and fall after a few days, so do we slowly lose the power and memory of the scriptures without daily reading. President Gordon B. Hinckley has said:<br><br><i>I hope that for you</i> [studying the scriptures] <i>will become something far more enjoyable than a duty; that, rather, it will become a love affair with the word of God. I promise you that as you read, your minds will be enlightened and your spirits will be lifted.</i> ["The Light Within You," <i>Ensign,</i> May 1995, 99]<br><br>In August 2005 President Gordon B. Hinckley asked all of us to reread the Book of Mormon by the end of that year. He promised us "an added measure of the Spirit of the Lord, a strengthened resolution to walk in obedience to His commandments, and a stronger testimony of the living reality of the Son of God" ("A Testimony Vibrant and True," <i>Ensign,</i> August 2005, 6). Faithful Saints from all over the world responded to the call.<br><br>Regarding this challenge, a member of my BYU stake shared the following special experience with me. To the best of my recollection, he said:<br><br><i>I was flying back from a trip to the Far East. It was the middle of the night, and most of the passengers were asleep. I, however, had my reading light on and was reading the Book of Mormon so I could finish by the end of the year as the prophet had asked.</i><br><br><i>Suddenly I was interrupted by a flight attendant who was walking down the aisle. She whispered, "Where are you?"</i><br><br><i>I responded, "I'm in Helaman."</i><br><br><i>She replied, "I'm in Ether." Then she said, "Turn around and look." I turned and looked toward the back of the plane and saw several other reading lights on. She whispered, "All reading the Book of Mormon."</i><br><br>Although our lives are filled with countless demands and distractions, I think we all learned from our prophet that we can find the time to study the scriptures if we are determined enough, each in our own way and place and time. He has told us the <i>what;</i> individually we work out the <i>how.</i><br><br>In addition to giving spiritual strength, the scriptures contain counsel to help address life's practical challenges. Some years ago I served as a branch president at the Missionary Training Center. I often told the missionaries that the scriptures could help them solve all their missionary challenges.<br><br>One Sunday, in priesthood meeting, we listed on the chalkboard several typical missionary challenges. Then I assigned small groups of elders to look up scriptures to address each of the challenges. After a few minutes I asked them to report their findings. One group had tackled the problem of dealing with girlfriends back home. The verse they found to solve the problem came from John 2:4: "Jesus saith unto her, Woman, what have I to do with thee? mine hour is not yet come."<br><h2><b>Improving Our Doing</b></h2><br>Building on the first area--increasing our knowing--we move on to the second area: improving our doing. Although increased knowledge is vital, it is not enough. The Apostle James stated that we must "be . . . doers of the word, and not hearers only" (James 1:22). Just as reading and pondering the words of God are accompanied by the Spirit, so will the doing aspect of the gospel be accompanied by the Spirit. The Savior said, "If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I speak of myself" (John 7:17).<br><br>The Lord expects each step upward in knowledge to be followed by a step upward in performance. The Apostle James added, "To him that knoweth to do good, and doeth it not, to him it is sin" (James 4:17). In other words, sin is the difference between our knowing and our doing. The greater the gap between the two, the greater the sin, and, as section 82 of the Doctrine and Covenants instructs, "For of him unto whom much is given much is required; and he who sins against the greater light shall receive the greater condemnation" (D&amp;amp;C 82:3).<br><br>Elder Neal A. Maxwell highlighted the tight linkage between knowing and doing as follows:<br><br><i>So it is that discipleship requires all of us to translate doctrines, covenants, ordinances, and teachings into improved personal behavior. Otherwise we may be doctrinally rich but end up developmentally poor.</i> ["Becoming a Disciple," <i>Ensign,</i> June 1996, 14]<br><br>Why does our doing so often lag behind our knowing, whether with home teaching, family home evening, or a wide range of other areas? I suppose that busy schedules, distractions, wrong priorities, lack of commitment, and just poor time management contribute to the problem. In statements regarding attendance at the temple, President Heber J. Grant addressed the typical excuses we make:<br><br><i>We can generally do that which we wish to do. A young man can find an immense amount of time to spend with his sweetheart. . . . We can arrange our affairs to get exercise in the shape of golf and otherwise. We can arrange our affairs to have amusements. And if we make up our minds to do so we can arrange our affairs to do temple work, judging from my own experience.</i> [<i>GS,</i> 33–34; see <i>CR,</i> April 1928, 8–9]<br><br><i>I do not know of any one that is any busier than I am, and if I can do it they can, if they will only get the spirit in their hearts and souls of wanting to do it.</i> [<i>Power from on High: A Lesson Book for Fourth Year Junior Genealogical Classes</i> (Salt Lake City: Genealogical Society of Utah, 1937), 26]<br><br>There is the key: get the spirit in our hearts so we want to do it.<br><br>Improvement in the doing arena takes great dedication. New habits can be hard to establish, and old habits can be hard to break. As my son Steve concluded his mission in England, my wife and a daughter and I joined him to travel and to visit some of the people he had baptized or helped to activate. One faithful sister talked of her growth in the Church since her baptism. She spoke of the dedicated effort required to stay on the path and then said, "It is so easy to backslide."<br><br>It is indeed easy to backslide, but we can avoid it or overcome it with enough determination. One of the people I baptized on my mission in Canada showed incredible determination to break a cigarette habit. He and his family lived on a small farm northwest of Calgary, Alberta, and a few months after they were baptized, he was out in the barn moving some bales of hay. Under one of the bales he discovered a partially smoked cigarette. Without thinking he picked it up and ran toward the house to get a match so he could smoke it. But halfway there he stopped, looked at the cigarette, and asked himself, "Am I going to be in charge of my life or is this cigarette going to rule over me?" After a crucial moment of intense internal battle, he dropped the cigarette to the ground and walked slowly back to the barn.<br><br><i>For he will give unto the faithful line upon line, precept upon precept; and I will try you and prove you herewith. . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . I will prove you in all things, whether you will abide in my covenant, even unto death.</i> [D&amp;amp;C 98:12, 14]<br><br>Let me share two additional doing examples that highlight the importance of establishing and maintaining good spiritual habits. First, a member of my BYU stake recently told me that at one time in her life she had been mistreated at Church, so she stayed away for a few weeks. Even after just a few weeks of absence this wonderful returned missionary found it difficult to come back. "Looking back on it now," she said, "I realize how important it is to stick with good spiritual habits."<br><br>The second example comes from my own family. Our daughter Amy married into a family that has had daily scripture study for more than 20 years without a single miss. And Amy and her family have carried on that pattern for the seven years they have been married. Even when she is in the hospital with a new baby, their daily scripture study is carried on by telephone. How gratifying it is for Jeannie and me as parents to visit the homes of our other children as well and see a similar pattern of faithfulness--including our family's habit of weekly family home evenings, which now spans nearly 40 years.<br><br>Just as our gaining of knowledge should expand from basic principles to deeper doctrine, so should our doing go beyond minimal compliance with specific "thou shalt" and "thou shalt not" commandments. The Lord said:<br><br><i>It is not meet that I should command in all things. . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . Men should be anxiously engaged in a good cause, and do many things of their own free will, and bring to pass much righteousness;</i><br><br><i>For the power is in them, wherein they are agents unto themselves.</i> [D&amp;amp;C 58:26–28]<br><br>Just as there are harmful and useless materials that can occupy our reading and learning, so are there harmful and useless activities that can occupy our time. We should avoid filling our days with these activities and instead spend our time doing that which is useful and essential. As someone once stated, that which matters most must never be at the mercy of that which matters least. Giving service--such as that which we give in the Church, in our communities, and especially in our families--is central to this useful and essential work. By losing ourselves in doing good for others, we come to understand what the Lord meant when He said: "He that findeth his life shall lose it: and he that loseth his life for my sake shall find it" (Matthew 10:39).<br><h2><b>Purifying Our Being</b></h2><br>Moving from increasing our knowing and improving our doing, we come to the third and most important part of our progress: purifying our being, or refining who and what we are deep down in our hearts.<br><br>Elder Henry B. Eyring clarified that although doing is important, it is not our ultimate goal. In our last general conference he said, "The things we do are the means, not the end we seek. What we <i>do</i> allows the Atonement of Jesus Christ to change us into what we must <i>be"</i> ("As a Child," <i>Ensign,</i> May 2006, 16; emphasis added). Elder David A. Bednar added, "People of integrity and honesty not only practice what they preach, they are what they preach" ("Be Honest," <i>New Era,</i> October 2005, 7).<br><br>Elder Dallin H. Oaks has taught:<br><br><i>The Final Judgment is not just an evaluation of a sum total of good and evil acts--what we have</i> done. <i>It is an acknowledgment of the final effect of our acts and thoughts--what we have </i>become. <i>It is not enough for anyone just to go through the motions. The commandments, ordinances, and covenants of the gospel are not a list of deposits required to be made in some heavenly account. The gospel of Jesus Christ is a plan that shows us how to become what our Heavenly Father desires us to become.</i> ["The Challenge to Become," 32; emphasis in original]<br><br>And what is it that we must become? The Savior answered very simply: "Even as I am" (3 Nephi 27:27). He is the mark we must always look to. He is our supreme example. He was chosen as our Savior not just because of His perfect obedience but because of His perfect love--love that encompasses perfect knowledge and that motivates perfect obedience.<br><br>The Savior also used the example of a child to teach us what we must become. Matthew recorded:<br><br><i>And Jesus called a little child unto him, and set him in the midst of them,</i><br><br><i>And said, Verily I say unto you, Except ye be converted, and become as little children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven.</i> [Matthew 18:2–3]<br><br>Numerous verses of scripture give additional detail as to the type of people we must become. For example:<br><br>"We believe in being honest, true, chaste, benevolent, virtuous" (Articles of Faith 1:13).<br><br>"Be humble, and be submissive and gentle; easy to be entreated; full of patience and long-suffering; being temperate in all things" (Alma 7:23).<br><br>"Becometh as a child, submissive, meek, humble, patient, full of love, willing to submit to all things [from] the Lord" (Mosiah 3:19).<br><br>"Faith, hope, charity and love, . . . virtue, knowledge, temperance, patience, brotherly kindness, godliness, charity, humility, diligence" (D&amp;amp;C 4:5–6).<br><br>And, finally: "Long-suffering, . . . gentleness and meekness, . . . love . . . ; [and] kindness" (D&amp;amp;C 121:41–42).<br><br>That, to me, is an exciting list. Imagine yourself when all those Christlike attributes are yours! Obviously, we are in for a lifetime of effort and then some. The Prophet Joseph Smith stated:<br><br><i>When you climb up a ladder, you must begin at the bottom, and ascend step by step, until you arrive at the top; and so it is with the principles of the gospel--you must begin with the first, and go on until you learn all the principles of exaltation. But it will be a great while after you have passed through the veil before you will have learned them. It is not all to be comprehended in this world; it will be a great work to learn our salvation and exaltation even beyond the grave.</i> [<i>HC</i> 6:306–7]<br><br>The family proclamation also highlighted the long-term process of becoming like Christ, saying that we are here in mortality to "obtain a physical body and gain earthly experience to progress <i>toward</i> perfection" ("The Family: A Proclamation to the World," <i>Ensign, </i>November 1995, 102; emphasis added).<br><br>Some of us become too self-critical in the process. We want patience, and we want it now! Sooner or later we have to learn that becoming patient includes learning patience with ourselves as well as with others. Things take time. Those who become perfectionistic and overzealous often find that the gospel isn't much fun anymore. It is more stressful than satisfying. We can fall off both sides of the path, and we must strive to stay in the middle where we are making <i>reasonable</i> progress, given our life's circumstances. The Lord told the Prophet Joseph Smith, "Do not run faster or labor more than you have strength and means" (D&amp;amp;C 10:4). That is good counsel. We all need to learn to do our very best and then to be at peace.<br><br>Two specific temple recommend interview questions set a nice standard for us. They don't ask if we are perfect but rather if we are "striving" to keep the commandments and if we consider ourselves to be "worthy." Without becoming anxious and obsessive overachievers, we can <i>strive</i> to keep the commandments and we can be <i>worthy.</i> Elder Neal A. Maxwell reminded us, "All of us are in the process of becoming--including prophets and General Authorities" (Neal A. Maxwell, <i>All These Things Shall Give Thee Experience</i> [Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1979], 105.<br><br>Because of differences in opportunity, talent, and circumstance, how we become Christlike varies somewhat from person to person. But common elements in our spiritual progress include gospel study, service and activity in the Church, and obedience to the commandments. But, above all, it is the cleansing effect of the Atonement and the Spirit that purify and change our hearts. As King Benjamin's people learned, it was "the Spirit of the Lord [that] wrought a mighty change in [them], that [they had] no more disposition to do evil, but to do good continually" (Mosiah 5:2).<br><br>The many trials and challenges of life also help us become more Christlike. For some people, life's trials seem to be relatively small. But even many little trials over a period of years can help us learn patience, meekness, and love if we will be humble and teachable students. In our last general conference, President Gordon B. Hinckley, at age 96, said, "When a man grows old he develops a softer touch, a kindlier manner" ("The Need for Greater Kindness," <i>Ensign,</i> May 2006, 58). Someone once told me, "It's not your fault if you're not beautiful by age 18, but it is your fault if you're not beautiful by age 80."<br><br>One of the special older and beautiful people in my life was my mother. After my father died, at almost 99 years of age, my mother, also in her nineties, lived with my family from time to time. Through her sweet example she taught us always to look on the bright side of life and to see the good in others. One day Jeannie was telling her of one of our sons whose bedroom was a disaster, with clothes, schoolbooks, and other "stuff" strewn about on the bed and floor. My mother listened patiently and then said lovingly, "Well, just tell him he has a clean ceiling." This grandmother with her pure and loving heart was able to overlook the mess on the floor and look upward to the ceiling to find something to compliment.<br><br>For some people the trials of life can be much more challenging. A month ago my son Steve and his wife, Amy, were saddened to learn that their little five-month-old daughter, their first child, has a 17th-chromosome disorder that presents to her and to her parents a very uncertain future. Since then, the Primary Children's Medical Center in Salt Lake City has become their home as the medical staff monitors little Brooklyn's rare problems. Remembering that Robby Hammond, my teaching assistant from two years ago, has a daughter with an 18th-chromosome problem, I wrote to Robby and told him of Steve and Amy's situation. In his e-mail reply regarding my granddaughter, this young father revealed the tenderness of his heart as he talked of his own daughter Emily, now two years old:<br><br><i>It's always a difficult time when you learn something like this, but believe me when I tell you that there is so much joy that comes from situations like these. Camille and I have never been through anything as joyful, or as painful at times, as with Emily. But it's the painful times that make the joyful times so indescribable. For example, when Emily was born, we were told a fairly "doom and gloom" story about what Emily would be like as she grew up. If those doctors could only see Emily now . . .</i><br><br><i>Her most recent trick is rolling onto her stomach and getting up on her hands and knees and rocking back and forth. Because she is blind, she hasn't quite figured out that crawling can get her where she wants to go. I mention this because of how incredible I feel when I see her learn to do something as simple as get on her hands and knees and rock back and forth. It has almost brought me to tears of joy sometimes just watching her progress.</i><br><br><i>Please let your son know that while there are certainly difficulties, the joys are unimaginable. Emily brings a very strong spiritual presence to my life.</i> [Robby Hammond, e-mail to author, June 2006]<br><br>Trials were certainly no stranger to the Prophet Joseph Smith. While suffering in Liberty Jail, he was told by the Lord, "All these things shall give thee experience, and shall be for thy good" (D&amp;amp;C 122:7). At the end of his life, just before riding off to Carthage, where he would meet his death, Sister Mary Ellen Kimball overheard him say to her neighbor, "If I never see you again, or if I <i>never come back,</i> remember that I love you." Sister Kimball wrote that the Prophet's "enemies had ripened in wickedness and he in goodness." (In Mark L. McConkie, <i>Remembering Joseph: Personal Recollections of Those Who Knew the Prophet Joseph Smith </i>[Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 2003], 75, 76; emphasis in original.)<br><br>That is also our challenge--to ripen in goodness even in the midst of a world ripening in wickedness, to develop a Christlike heart filled with love for God and all mankind. Without a heart filled with love for what we do and for those whom we serve, none of us will ever fully achieve what we could or should.<br><h2><b>Conclusion</b></h2><br>I pray that the Lord will bless us throughout our lives as we strive to progress in all three areas of knowing, doing, and being. I pray that we will be diligent and do our very best, but I also pray that we will be patient as we improve line upon line, learning upon learning, repentance upon repentance, onward and upward, with the Lord trying us and proving us as we go.<br><br>At times we will learn first and be tried later; at other times the Lord will try us first and then teach us from the trials. But in spite of the sequence, I pray that we will move forward with faith in and love for the Lord--even while not knowing beforehand what lies ahead. Later in life we'll be able to look back on the <i>what</i> of our lives and understand the <i>why.</i> If we have been true and faithful, these backward glances will reveal to us a clear path of progress toward perfection guided by an all-wise, patient, and loving Heavenly Father. I testify that He lives, that His Son Jesus Christ is our Savior and Redeemer, and that They know and love each one of us beyond our present capacity to comprehend. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>William H.

<h1>s in Our Discipleship - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I am grateful and humbled to be with you here this morning. During my time here at BYU I have had the opportunity to listen to numerous devotional addresses, and, frankly, I have never considered myself to be in the category of those who deliver these addresses. So I pray that I may be able to speak through the Spirit today and deliver a message that will be worthwhile to you.<br><br>Let me begin by talking for a minute about my professional work. My discipline of training is in the area of acoustics, and for much of my career I have been involved with research on what is referred to as active noise control. With this technology you can in essence cancel noise with noise. Sound waves are created in the air as molecules oscillate, thereby making the pressure in the air oscillate up and down.<br><br>We can represent this oscillating pressure graphically with peaks on the graph representing points in time when the pressure is high and dips representing points in time when the pressure is low. Our ears detect this oscillating pressure and perceive it as sound. Another important concept is that multiple waves can add together--much as numbers add together. So if one sound wave makes the pressure in the air go up and a second sound wave makes the pressure in the air go down by the same amount, the two waves will add like positive and negative numbers and cancel each other, thereby eliminating the sound.<br><br>On a graph, we could show three sounds where the upper line would schematically represent the oscillating pressure that exists before we decide we want to cancel it. The middle line on the graph would represent the pressure that we are going to create by turning our control on to try to cancel the original sound. With the control turned on, the middle line would represent a wave that is close to being the mirror opposite of the original sound wave, which should lead to significant cancellation. The bottom line would show the result of our effort, as the amplitude, or height, of the sound wave goes down noticeably--thus we would expect an audible difference.<br><br>In my first example we were not able to completely cancel the original sound. This is because we did not create a completely exact mirror image of the original sound. The middle line on the graph would have what we call a "phase error." This means that the peaks of one wave do not line up exactly in time with the dips in the other wave. This time relation of one point on a wave to another point on the wave is referred to as <i>phase.</i> As you follow the oscillation through a complete cycle from a peak through a dip and back to the next peak, that is represented by a change in phase of 360 degrees, analogous to going around a circle. The ideal phase of our cancelling wave for active control is 180 degrees, as that would exactly line up the peaks of the original wave with the dips of our control wave. In my first example we were off by 5 degrees of phase from the ideal of 180 degrees.<br><br>What if we are a little sloppier? My second example shows a similar result, but in this result we are even less careful and we have a phase error of 45 degrees. In this case the results do not appear to be nearly as impressive, though the 45-degree phase error still appears to produce a cancelling wave that is close to what we want. As you heard in my second example, this result was not very impressive, and you would be highly unlikely to invest significantly in this technology if this result was the best that could be obtained.<br><br>Let's look at one last example. In this case we have been careful and have reduced the phase error to half a degree, which is quite close to the perfect solution. As a result, in this example the sound is essentially completely cancelled. If you were in business, this represents a result you might be much more willing to invest in.<br><br>Well, at this point I suspect many of you are thinking, "I thought I was attending a devotional and not one of those dreaded physics classes." Let me assure you that you can relax--we are pretty much finished with the physics lecture. Just why have I taken the time to explain all this to you? In my mind there is a strong analogy that can be drawn from these active noise control results we have heard and our discipleship of the Savior. As we become exact in getting the right phase for implementing active noise control, the results become very impressive. Similarly, as we become more exact in our discipleship of the Savior, there is an impressive power that comes into our lives that aids us in our spiritual growth. As we look at people we may be acquainted with, as well as individuals in the scriptures, I am sure that we can identify numerous examples representing various levels of commitment in our discipleship.<br><br>Consider one of the earliest examples that we have record of. Adam and Eve had two sons: Cain and Abel. They were commanded to make offerings unto the Lord:<br><br><i>And in process of time it came to pass, that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto the Lord.</i><br><br><i>And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof. And the Lord had respect unto Abel and to his offering:</i><br><br><i>But unto Cain and to his offering he had not respect. And Cain was very wroth, and his countenance fell.</i> [Genesis 4:3–5]<br><br>You know the ending of this tragic story from there.<br><br>But what was it that led the Lord to accept Abel's offering and not accept Cain's offering? Didn't they both give offerings as they were commanded? We gain additional insight to this question from the Pearl of Great Price. When Adam and Eve were cast out of the Garden of Eden, they were commanded "that they should . . . offer the firstlings of their flocks, for an offering unto the Lord" (Moses 5:5). In this sense Cain was close to doing what he had been commanded, having brought of the fruit of the ground, but he wasn't exact in following the commandment given. Furthermore, we find that "Satan commanded [Cain], saying: Make an offering unto the Lord" (Moses 5:18), after which Cain made his offering. Thus Cain was sort of doing the right thing, but for all the wrong reasons, as he was really following Satan rather than the Savior.<br><br>Let's move forward to the New Testament. After the Resurrection of the Savior, we find the Saints striving to live the law of consecration, having implemented a form of the united order. In the book of Acts we read of Ananias and his wife, who sold one of their possessions. They then proceeded to almost live the law of consecration by bringing a portion of the money they received to the Apostles; however, they kept back a portion of it for themselves. We read of how Peter through the Spirit detected their dishonesty, first on the part of Ananias and then later with his wife. Both were stricken and died as a result of not being completely honest in their offering to the Lord (see Acts 5:1–10).<br><br>Examples are not restricted to the Old World. Let's move to the Book of Mormon record. We find Lehi and his family leaving Jerusalem, only to receive direction from the Lord that they should return to get the brass plates. You know how Laman and Lemuel grumbled. Sam and Nephi were much more willing to follow the commandments of the Lord. In spite of this, Laman and Lemuel sort of followed the commandment in that they did go up to Jerusalem with Nephi. As you recall, Laman first went in to Laban to request the plates. However, Laban became angry, thrust Laman out, and tried to kill him. Nephi was successful in persuading his brothers to return with him to try again. This time they essentially offered to buy the plates from Laban. Laban thrust them out again, and their riches fell into the hands of Laban. (See 1 Nephi 1–3.)<br><br>At this point Laman and Lemuel had had enough. I can almost hear them saying to Nephi, "Look, this was completely crazy to have us come back here to get these useless plates. The Lord can't really expect us to do this. It's time for us to clear out of here and at least save our lives." They even said to Nephi, "How is it possible that the Lord will deliver Laban into our hands?" (1 Nephi 3:31).<br><br>However, we read of the commitment of Nephi as he replied, "Let us be faithful in keeping the commandments of the Lord" (1 Nephi 4:1). As you know, Nephi went back to Jerusalem, where he "was led by the Spirit, not knowing beforehand the things which [he] should do" (1 Nephi 4:6). Laman and Lemuel sort of followed the commandments they had received, but not precisely, and as a result missed out on the blessings that came to Nephi because of his commitment to do all that the Lord commanded.<br><br>We have another example in the two thousand stripling warriors who Helaman led into battle. These young men were described as "men who were true at all times in whatsoever thing they were entrusted" (Alma 53:20). The Nephite army marveled that not a single one of these young men was killed. In explaining this miracle, Helaman observed:<br><br><i>Yea, and they did obey and observe to perform every word of command with exactness; yea, and even according to their faith it was done unto them; and I did remember the words which they said unto me that their mothers had taught them.</i> [Alma 57:21]<br><br>There is a principle we can learn from these examples in the scriptures. As we are obedient and try to follow the direction we receive from the Lord to the best of our ability, we are blessed and receive further spiritual insights and strength to live the gospel. The Lord put it this way:<br><br><i>For behold, thus saith the Lord God: I will give unto the children of men line upon line, precept upon precept, here a little and there a little; and blessed are those who hearken unto my precepts, and lend an ear unto my counsel, for they shall learn wisdom;</i> for unto him that receiveth I will give more; <i>and from them that shall say, We have enough, from them shall be taken away even that which they have.</i> [2 Nephi 28:30; emphasis added]<br><br>Or, put another way:<br><br><i>It is given unto many to know the mysteries of God; nevertheless they are laid under a strict command that they shall not impart only according to the portion of his word which he doth grant unto the children of men</i>, according to the heed and diligence which they give unto him. [Alma 12:9; emphasis added]<br><br>So how does this correspond to our everyday lives? Let me illustrate with a personal example. You may recall that one year ago we received some guidance from our living prophet, President Gordon B. Hinckley. In the August 2005 <i>Ensign,</i> as part of the First Presidency message, he said:<br><br><i>We studied the Book of Mormon in Sunday School this past year. Nonetheless I offer a challenge to members of the Church throughout the world and to our friends everywhere to read or reread the Book of Mormon. If you will read a bit more than one and one-half chapters a day, you will be able to finish the book before the end of this year. . . .</i><br><br><i>Without reservation I promise you that if each of you will observe this simple program, regardless of how many times you previously may have read the Book of Mormon, there will come into your lives and into your homes an added measure of the Spirit of the Lord, a strengthened resolution to walk in obedience to His commandments, and a stronger testimony of the living reality of the Son of God.</i> [Gordon B. Hinckley, "A Testimony Vibrant and True, <i>Ensign,</i> August 2005, 5–6]<br><br>I am sure you remember this challenge. How did you respond to it? Let me tell you of my experience. I remember that when the challenge came out, I was going strong with a personal study of the Doctrine and Covenants. I remember distinctly going through a thought process something like "I'm doing really well with my Doctrine and Covenants study right now. I've read the Book of Mormon many times, and, if I read it now before the end of the year, it will take enough time that I know it will mess up my current study. Maybe I can come back early next year and study the Book of Mormon." Do you see the fallacy of my reasoning? I was sort of being a disciple of Christ and more or less striving to live the gospel, but I wasn't following the counsel received through His prophet with exactness. I was rationalizing, saying I had read the Book of Mormon many times, when a prophet of God had said, "Regardless of how many times you previously may have read the Book of Mormon, there will come into your lives and into your homes an added measure of the Spirit of the Lord."<br><br>After a few days of fighting this challenge, it finally sunk into me that I had been asked by a prophet to do something, and it was time to stop moaning about my Doctrine and Covenants study and get with the program. So I did start studying the Book of Mormon, and some interesting things happened in our family. My wife, who is always ahead of me in spiritual things, had already embraced the challenge and was studying the Book of Mormon. As we went forward accepting this challenge, we noticed that each of our five children, without any urging from us, had also accepted the challenge, and each was regularly studying the Book of Mormon. One or two of our children had a nontraditional New Year's Eve last year as they finished up the last few chapters, but each member of our family was able to finish reading the Book of Mormon, including our youngest son, who finished a personal reading of the entire book for the first time. That in and of itself was enough blessing for me as a father, but I also observed, as President Hinckley had promised, that an added measure of the Spirit came into our home, and my testimony of Jesus Christ and His gospel was strengthened.<br><br>There is a difference in our spiritual strength that results when we are actively striving to live the gospel to the best of our ability. It is often seemingly small things that can make such a difference in our lives. I recall another experience I had while serving as a bishop. I had felt impressed that there were some things we needed to be aware of and to work on to help strengthen the youth in our ward. In a combined priesthood/Relief Society meeting I outlined some of my concerns and feelings regarding what I felt we needed to do as a ward. A discussion period followed, and I remember one brother in my ward who raised his hand and said, "Bishop, if this is what you feel we need to do as a ward, I want you to know that I support it and will do whatever I can." How gratifying that was to see this member committed to following the counsel he had received. That type of commitment to do whatever the Lord asks of us generates a spiritual strength and awareness that will bring us closer to the Savior and help us to continue to progress in our lives.<br><br>Contrast this with an experience an elders quorum president had. He told me he had felt inspired to challenge his elders quorum to do some specific things to prepare for general conference. He met with his quorum and outlined several things he wanted them to do before, during, and after conference and promised them that if they would follow his counsel, they would have a spiritually uplifting and enlightening experience. He presented his proposal to the quorum as a priesthood assignment and indicated he would ask for feedback after conference. He told me that after general conference he asked for a report from his quorum members. What was the result? Two people, one of whom was himself, had accepted the assignment, and both had a wonderful and rewarding experience while listening to conference. A number of others reported that they had gone home and simply thrown the assignment into the garbage. Think of the blessings that were forfeited by those who decided that it was not important to be exact in their discipleship of the Savior and to follow counsel and direction received through priesthood leaders.<br><br>I think I am safe in saying that all of us look to our living prophet as one who is fully committed to following the Savior. As we look at the life of President Hinckley, we see abundant evidence of him deciding at an early age that he would do all that was asked of him by the Lord. He tells the story about a time during his mission in England when three or four of the London papers carried some negative reviews of a reprint of an old book purporting to be a history of the Mormons.<br><br>His mission president said to then Elder Hinckley, "I want you to go down to the publisher and protest this."<br><br>Elder Hinckley was about to say, "Surely not me," but instead meekly said, "Yes, sir."<br><br>President Hinckley talked about the fear that he felt, but he offered a prayer and then, with stomach churning, went down to meet with the president of the publishing company. He presented his card to the receptionist, who took it into the inner office and then returned to indicate that the president was too busy to meet with him. Elder Hinckley replied that he had come five thousand miles and would wait. Over the next hour the receptionist went into the office several times and then finally invited Elder Hinckley in. As he entered, he noticed that the president was smoking a long cigar and had a look that seemed to say, "Don't bother me."<br><br>President Hinckley doesn't recall what he said, but another power seemed to speak through him. At first the company president was defensive and belligerent. Then he began to soften. By the end of their conversation he promised to do something, and he sent word out to every book dealer in England to return the books to the publisher. At great expense he printed in the front of each volume a statement to the effect that the book was not to be considered as history but only as fiction. President Hinckley concluded his telling of this story by saying, "I came to know that when we try in faith to walk in obedience to the requests of the priesthood, the Lord opens the way, even when there appears to be no way" (Gordon B. Hinckley, "If Ye Be Willing and Obedient," <i>Ensign</i>, July 1995, 5).<br><br>Many times, the difference between being fully committed to the gospel and being sort of committed to the gospel can be fairly small, just as the differences were small in our active noise control examples. Nonetheless, these differences can result in a huge contrast. With the Liahona, Lehi and his family had a visual indicator of how they were doing. Nephi observed:<br><br><i>The pointers . . . did work according to the faith and diligence and heed which</i> [they] <i>did give unto them.</i><br><br><i>And there was also written upon them a new writing . . . ; and it was written and changed from time to time, according to the faith and diligence which</i> [they] <i>gave unto it. And thus we see that by small means the Lord can bring about great things.</i> [1 Nephi 16:28–29]<br><br>We have various Liahonas in our lives today. Are we being diligent in giving heed to them? Are we faithfully studying the scriptures as we have been counseled to do? Do we earnestly strive to follow the guidance we receive from our living prophets, our stake president, bishop, elders quorum president, Relief Society president, and other Church leaders? Are we striving to be as exact as we can in our discipleship of the Savior? In doing this, we need to be aware that we are not perfect and we will not be perfect anytime soon. As King Benjamin counseled his people, "It is not requisite that a man should run faster than he has strength. And again, it is expedient that he should be diligent, that thereby he might win the prize" (Mosiah 4:27). We need to maintain a balance in our lives between being able to accept ourselves with our weaknesses and current limitations and being committed to progressing and becoming more exact disciples of the Savior. If you recall, the phase matching of the control wave in the last active noise control example was still not completely exact. Nonetheless, as the match becomes closer and closer, the results become more and more impressive. So it is with our spiritual lives.<br><br>There is one other concept that I would like to mention briefly. Going back to my active noise control analogy, if things get out of alignment with our control system, we can lose the control effect we are striving for. To deal with this problem, we generally use digital control systems that are adaptive in nature and can correct for those errors that may creep in over time. This is not unlike our spiritual lives. Due to our mortal natures, we do things in our lives that can degrade our spiritual strength. Uncorrected, this will lead to spiritual illness and eventually spiritual death. So how do we correct for these spiritual errors as we go through our lives? The answer, of course, is repentance, but I want to emphasize that we need repentance that is centered on the Savior. If we make mistakes in our lives, we can sometimes correct them on our own--but, generally, it is the hard way to do it. The Savior offered a much easier and more effective way when He said:<br><br><i>And if men come unto me I will show unto them their weakness. I give unto men weakness that they may be humble; and my grace is sufficient for all men that humble themselves before me; for if they humble themselves before me, and have faith in me,</i> then will I make weak things become strong unto them. [Ether 12:27; emphasis added]<br><br>Although it may be difficult for us to completely understand the inner workings of the Atonement of the Savior, we nonetheless know everything we need to know to be recipients of its power. The Atonement brings an enabling power into our lives--cleansing us, strengthening us, and buoying us up through the challenges of life that would derail us from the path we are striving to follow. The Atonement is not only important if we have committed a major transgression. It is also there to strengthen us in all aspects of our lives.<br><br>In speaking of the coming of Jesus Christ, Alma taught his people:<br><br><i>And</i> [Christ] <i>shall go forth, suffering pains and afflictions and temptations of every kind; and this that the word might be fulfilled which saith he will take upon him the pains and the sicknesses of his people.</i><br><br><i>And he will take upon him death, that he may loose the bands of death which bind his people; and he will take upon him their infirmities, that his bowels may be filled with mercy, according to the flesh, that he may know according to the flesh how to succor his people according to their infirmities.</i> [Alma 7:11–12]<br><br>The Savior understands you and He understands me. He knows the challenges we face and understands our feelings when we get down because life isn't going as well as we would like it to. These things can often be precursors to straying off from the path that we are striving to follow, but as we focus on the Savior and His Atonement, He can succor us, buoy us up, and give us strength and resolve to do what we should.<br><br>Nephi was one of the great prophets of the Book of Mormon. But it is apparent that life got him down on occasion as well. Shortly after the death of Lehi, Nephi was struggling some with life--Laman and Lemuel were yet again angry with him, and perhaps he was still feeling the loss of his father, Lehi. In this frame of mind, he wrote:<br><br><i>My heart sorroweth because of my flesh; my soul grieveth because of mine iniquities.</i><br><br><i>I am encompassed about, because of the temptations and the sins which do so easily beset me.</i><br><br><i>And when I desire to rejoice, my heart groaneth because of my sins; nevertheless, I know in whom I have trusted.</i> [2 Nephi 4:17–19]<br><br>Now, I don't know about you, but I have a difficult time believing that Nephi was talking about any sins here that we might categorize as being major. In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if the sins he was referring to were his frustration with his bullheaded brothers and perhaps feelings of wanting to beat them over the head with a two-by-four. Whatever the case, there is a great lesson that we can learn from Nephi as he dealt with these feelings in going to the Lord. As he prayed, he said:<br><br><i>O Lord, wilt thou redeem my soul? Wilt thou deliver me out of the hands of mine enemies? Wilt thou make me that I may shake at the appearance of sin? . . .</i><br><br><i>O Lord, wilt thou encircle me around in the robe of thy righteousness! . . . Wilt thou make my path straight before me! . . .</i><br><br><i>O Lord, I have trusted in thee, and I will trust in thee forever. I will not put my trust in the arm of flesh; for I know that cursed is he that putteth his trust in the arm of flesh.</i> [2 Nephi 4:31, 33–34]<br><br>Through his desire to be fully committed and exact in his discipleship, Nephi received strength to move forward and be the person our Father in Heaven wanted him to be. So can it be with us.<br><br>As Moroni finished the Book of Mormon, his last words of counsel for each of us were:<br><br><i>Yea, come unto Christ, and be perfected in him, and deny yourselves of all ungodliness; and if ye shall deny yourselves of all ungodliness, and love God with all your might, mind and strength, then is his grace sufficient for you, that by his grace ye may be perfect in Christ. . . .</i><br><br><i>And again, if ye by the grace of God are perfect in Christ, and deny not his power, then are ye sanctified in Christ by the grace of God, through the shedding of the blood of Christ, which is in the covenant of the Father unto the remission of your sins, that ye become holy, without spot.</i> [Moroni 10:32–33]<br><br>May each of us follow this counsel to come unto Christ, to be His disciples with all our might, mind, and strength and thereby enjoy the sanctifying power of the Atonement in our lives. I know through a personal witness of the Spirit that Jesus Christ is the Son of God, that He was resurrected, and that He lives today. Because of His love for us, He carried out the Atonement for me and for you, making it possible for each of us to return to our Father in Heaven as we become the disciples He would have us be. Of this I bear testimony in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Scott D.

<h1>esh Courage Take&quot; - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
My dear brothers and sisters, I express my gratitude for the privilege of sharing this devotional hour with you and pray that my words will help to invite the Spirit to touch our hearts and minds.<br><br>During my career here at the university, I have had numerous opportunities to witness the magnitude of struggles students can face. I admire and applaud those who pursue their academic goals while overcoming great difficulties and seemingly insurmountable challenges. The plight of a student overwhelmed by studies, financial burdens, health concerns, homesickness, and social relationships--just to name a few--is not uncommon. At best these may be difficult to bear; other times they seem impossible. I have often found that in the midst of these seemingly impossible circumstances, great relief and even joy can come as our understanding is deepened by spiritual encouragement and continued obedience to Heavenly Father's commandments.<br><br>On April 15, 1846, William Clayton was asked by President Brigham Young to compose the hymn "Come, Come, Ye Saints."<sup>1</sup> The purpose of this hymn was to give encouragement and support to the early pioneers as they would gather around their campfires at the end of the day. It was meant to help them forget the many difficulties and trials of their journey.<sup>2</sup> Even today the singing of this hymn lends comfort in our trials and inspires us to "gird up [our] loins" and "fresh courage take."<sup>3</sup><br><h2><b>"Though Hard to You This Journey May Appear"</b></h2><br>I wonder if we had such thoughts when we sat in the Grand Council in Heaven as spirit children of our heavenly parents before this earth was formed. In that great gathering we each had the privilege of hearing our Heavenly Father's plan for this mortal existence. We learned that through this earth-life experience we would have the opportunity to become like our exalted parents. The prophets have revealed that we all sang together and "shouted for joy"<sup>4</sup> at this glorious news.<br><br>We were taught that this life would be a time of probation in which we would be faced with trials and tests, but if we were found true and faithful and <i>thankful</i> in all things, we would inherit all that our Heavenly Father had prepared for us. I feel confident that in spite of the challenges we knew we would face, we were still eager to experience this mortal state.<br><br>As a result of the Fall of Adam and Eve, the Lord declared that the <i>ground</i> would be cursed for Adam's sake. It is important to note that the scriptures specify that "the ground"--not Adam--was cursed and that it would be for his "sake," meaning for his benefit as well as for that of all his posterity.<sup>5</sup> This would mean that Adam and his children would need to labor all their days, overcoming challenges and obstacles to obtain even the basic necessities of life.<br><br>Adam and Eve were later instructed by an angel of the Lord who taught them the gospel and explained the plan of redemption and exaltation. They were told:<br><br><i>It must needs be that the devil should tempt the children of men, or they could not be agents unto themselves; for if they never should have bitter they could not know the sweet.</i><sup>6</sup><br><br>They were also told that a Savior would come to redeem all mankind, so that all Adam's children would have an opportunity to return to our Heavenly Father.<br><br>Imagine Adam and Eve's joy as they received this eternal truth. Eve exclaimed:<br><br><i>Were it not for our transgression we never should have had seed, and never should have known good and evil, and the joy of our redemption, and the eternal life which God giveth unto all the obedient.</i><sup>7</sup><br><h2><b>"'Tis Better Far for Us to Strive"</b></h2><br>A primary reason for coming to this mortal life was to prove our ability to make choices in the face of opposition. Overcoming opposition in this mortal probation is essential to our eternal progress. The prophet Lehi said to his son Jacob:<br><br><i>For it must needs be, that there is an opposition in all things. If not so ... , righteousness could not be brought to pass, neither wickedness, neither holiness nor misery, neither good nor bad.</i><sup>8</sup><br><br>This life and its accompanying pain, temptation, sickness, and sorrow is part of the plan for our eternal progress. "Adam fell that men might be; and men are, that they might have joy."<sup>9</sup> This law of opposition makes it possible for us to recognize goodness, virtue, and joy, along with having an appreciation for well-being. This law makes freedom of choice possible, and if we humbly submit to the will of our Heavenly Father and follow His counsel to yield to His Spirit and resist temptation, God promises to "consecrate thine afflictions for thy gain."<sup>10</sup><br><br>When going through a difficult trial in our life, which one of us has not asked the Lord: "Why me?" As the trial continues or grows more intense, we may even wonder: "How long can I endure this before I am overcome?" It is in the midst of such questioning that we can be led to greater empathy for others who have endured life's trials and persecution.<br><br>In a small way we gain a greater appreciation for the suffering the Savior bore for our sake:<br><br><i>Which suffering caused</i> [Him], <i>even God, the greatest of all, to tremble because of pain, and to bleed at every pore, and to suffer both body and spirit--and would that</i> [He] <i>might not drink the bitter cup, and shrink.</i><sup>11</sup><br><br>In his moments of greatest struggle, the Prophet Joseph Smith pleaded with the Lord to respond to these questions in a way that would give him understanding. Out of the depths of his suffering and heartache, the Lord answered his cry as recorded in section 121 of the Doctrine and Covenants:<br><br><i>My son, peace be unto thy soul; thine adversity and thine afflictions shall be but a small moment;</i><br><br><i>And then, if thou endure it well, God shall exalt thee on high; thou shalt triumph over all thy foes.</i><sup>12</sup><br><br>The Prophet later stated: "I think I never could have felt as I now do, if I had not suffered the wrongs that I have suffered. All things shall work together for good to them that love God."<sup>13</sup><br><br>Elder Russell M. Nelson shared with us: "The precise challenge you regard now as 'impossible' may be the very refinement you need, in His eye."<sup>14</sup><br><h2><b>"And Should We Die Before Our Journey's Through"</b></h2><br>Physical suffering and death are part of the challenges we face in this mortal existence. They will visit all of us sometime.<br><br>In February 1837, Noah Rogers and his wife, Eda Hollister, joined the Church in New York. Noah gave up his practice as a physician, and with his wife and eight children, he set out to become part of the gathering Saints in Missouri. A ninth child was born to them the following year.<br><br>Noah and his family endured many hardships on their journey to Missouri, even being threatened by hostile mobs who demanded that they turn back or be killed. Undaunted in their desire to participate more fully in the blessings of the restored gospel, Noah and Eda continued onward until they were able to join a body of Saints in Commerce, Illinois, which later became know as Nauvoo the Beautiful.<br><br>While working in his field one day, Noah was kidnapped by a party of mobsters and taken across the state line into Missouri. In the hands of the mobsters he was dragged into the woods, bound, brutally beaten, and then confined in chains in a small shed for several months simply because he was a "Mormon." Noah eventually regained his strength and was able to escape back to his family.<br><br>In April conference of 1843, Noah Rogers was called on a mission to Vermont. Soon after this, a new mission call was extended to preach the gospel among the people of the islands of French Polynesia in the region known as the Society Islands. He was to be accompanied by Addison Pratt, Benjamin F. Grouard, and Knowlton Hanks. The small group of missionaries quickly prepared for their journey and bid farewell to their families, trusting that they would be taken care of amidst the ever-increasing storm of hatred and bigotry aimed at the early Saints. Their missionary journals and letters home describe the many trials and hardships they endured as they made their way to the islands over the next nine months.<br><br>Their missionary companion Elder Hanks had been sick before leaving Nauvoo and progressively got worse. He refused to turn back. He was fearful that he would not be able to fulfill his mission and kept hoping that the long sea voyage and priesthood administrations would restore his health. He insisted that if he must die, at least it would be as near his mission field as possible. Elder Hanks' condition continued to worsen until he died on November 3, 1843. It was a sad and mournful event as his companions watched his body be wrapped in "a bit of old sail"<sup>15</sup> and dropped into the sea.<br><br>The remaining three missionaries continued their journey, finally arriving in Tahiti to begin the work of preaching the restored gospel throughout the surrounding Polynesian islands. Not all their efforts were met with great success. Noah encountered major opposition from the established churches on the islands he visited. After many months and many miles traveling from island to island, he was given a release to return home.<br><br>His journey back to Nauvoo again proved to be extremely difficult. He returned via the Orient, becoming the first missionary to circumnavigate the globe. Letters and communication from his wife and family were essentially nonexistent for his entire absence of two and a half years. He had heard rumors of the Martyrdom of the Prophet Joseph Smith, but, beyond that, news was only hearsay, and he feared greatly for the safety of his loved ones.<br><br>Noah arrived back in Nauvoo on December 29, 1845, finding his family, along with the majority of the Saints, driven out of the city and living on the outskirts. Nevertheless, it was a joyful reunion, and shortly thereafter he and Eda were able to receive their endowments in the newly completed temple. They were among the last Saints to receive this sacred ordinance before being forced to flee across the frozen Mississippi River and eventually set up camp on the windswept prairie at Mount Pisgah, Iowa. There Noah became ill and passed away within a matter of days. A couple of his sons fashioned a coffin out of a wagon box and buried him in a small cemetery that was to become the resting place for hundreds of other Saints who likewise perished along the trail.<br><br>Eda Rogers had lost her beloved husband. Other family members soon followed him in death. Eda and her sister Amanda recorded:<br><br><i>Our afflictions seemingly were greater than we could bear, yet we trust in God and feel that He will support and comfort the widow and the fatherless.</i><br><br><i>... We feel not to complain nor murmur but to go ahead in the things of the Lord.</i><sup>16</sup><br><br>Many critics could say that Noah Rogers' life ended without his having accomplished much--that his sacrifice to answer the call to serve a mission resulted in little success and robbed him of precious time with his family. Of what worth were his struggles? His death and burial were unheralded events and were marked by a simple journal entry and a wooden grave marker. His grieving widow was left to move on with her children to the Salt Lake Valley. Yet who among us can question the designs of our Heavenly Father?<br><br>Noah and Eda Rogers' example of quietly submitting themselves to the will of the Lord set a sure foundation for their posterity. I am honored to be numbered in that lineage.<br><br>The records of our collective pioneer ancestry as well as scriptural documentation teach us that when resistance and opposition are greatest, we also have the greatest potential for growth in our faith, our commitment, and our advancement. As witnessed in the Book of Mormon, complacency and eventual loss of faith result when opposition is minimal. Alma lamented, "Thus we see how quick the children of men do forget the Lord their God, yea, how quick to do iniquity, and to be led away by the evil one."<sup>17</sup><br><br>As we look back on the past 176 years of Church history, we can testify that our progress today has been made possible because of the early Saints who were able to faithfully encounter and overcome opposition. I trust that future generations will likewise be able to look back on our generation and attribute their progress to our own faithfulness and courage.<br><h2><b>"Why Should We Think to Earn a Great Reward If We Now Shun the Fight?"</b></h2><br>How can we expect to receive the fullness of the blessings the Lord has prepared for us if we quit the battle because the fight is difficult and the odds seem against us? Truly, we cannot expect to gain the reward our Heavenly Father has prepared for us if we "shun the fight" or surrender partway through the battle.<br><br>In the Old Testament we find another exemplar of great faith and obedience. The prophet Gideon, of ancient Israel, found himself facing a seemingly impossible obstacle. The book of Judges relates, "All the Midianites and the Amalekites and the children of the east were gathered together,"<sup>18</sup> prepared to give battle to the Israelites under Gideon's command. Like many of us in overwhelming situations, Gideon seriously doubted the odds of winning such a conflict. He pleaded with the Lord to confirm that he was the right one to lead Israel into triumph and devised a couple of tests by which the Lord could do so.<br><br><i>And Gideon said unto God, If thou wilt save Israel by mine hand, as thou hast said,</i><br><br><i>Behold, I will put a fleece of wool in the floor; and if the dew be on the fleece only, and it be dry upon all the earth beside, then shall I know that thou wilt save Israel by mine hand, as thou hast said.</i><br><br><i>And it was so: for he rose up early on the morrow, and thrust the fleece together, and wringed the dew out of the fleece, a bowl full of water.</i><sup>19</sup><br><br>Gideon, wanting not to mistake the Lord's answer and continuing to doubt his own ability to conquer such a mighty foe, approached Him once again and prayed:<br><br><i>Let not thine anger be hot against me, and I will speak but this once: let me prove, I pray thee, but this once with the fleece; let it now be dry only upon the fleece, and upon all the ground let there be dew.</i><br><br><i>And God did so that night: for it was dry upon the fleece only, and there was dew on all the ground.</i><sup>20</sup><br><br>With this miraculous confirmation Gideon must have been feeling reassured, but it was now the Lord's turn to prove Gideon and to teach the host of Israel that they must always look to Him for salvation rather than rely upon their own strength. Gideon was commanded to dismiss any of the warriors who were fearful of going into battle. Twenty-two thousand departed, leaving only 10 thousand.<sup>21</sup><br><br>The Lord then informed Gideon that he still had too many soldiers, and another reduction was made, leaving only 300 men to deliver Israel from the Midianites, who were in numbers "like grasshoppers for multitude."<sup>22</sup> With this unlikely army the Lord proceeded to deliver a victory to the outnumbered Israelites.<br><br>We each have occasions in our lives when we feel overwhelmed and far outnumbered with life's battles. We can be put in the midst of trials that shake us to the very core and test our ability to hang on. President Gordon B. Hinckley encourages us to remain true even when the odds seem against us. He challenges us: "Be true to yourselves and the best you have within you"; likewise, "Be true to our Eternal Father and His Beloved Son."<sup>23</sup><br><br>I sincerely believe that if we are humble and obedient to the Lord, we will find His helping hand even in the worst of circumstances. I also testify that many of the choicest instructions the Lord would have us receive will come in the midst of our greatest trials.<br><h2><b>"Fresh Courage Take"</b></h2><br>Often our struggles and challenges are accompanied by feelings of isolation and loneliness. Our initial suffering can make us feel that we are alone and that no one can possibly understand the depth of our pain or comprehend the magnitude of our trial. We seek consolation from others who can share our burden--those who can care about us and understand the nature of our burden.<br><br>In a peaceful cemetery located south of the BYU campus, there is a section of graves specifically set apart for the burial of infants and small children. This particular place is surrounded by the graves of others of all ages who have been laid to rest by loving family and friends. My wife and I cannot visit this particular area in the cemetery without thinking of similar mothers and fathers who had such wonderful expectations and hopes for their child, only to have them laid to rest in an untimely season.<br><br>If you visit this particular section of the cemetery on certain days of the year, you will find a small flower or decoration placed on every infant's grave. No grave is forgotten. This small token represents the expression of love and understanding by another mother and father who faced a similar trial and who now reach out to console others.<br><br>Fresh courage is received when such selfless acts of service and compassion are freely given. Not only does our compassionate service help another, it provides the vehicle to lift us from our own sorrow and misery. We are commanded to bear one another's burdens, and, as Latter-day Saints, we truly understand the importance the Savior has put on selfless service to others. The Lord does not place any restrictions upon us in our participation in good works. As brothers and sisters in the gospel, helping one another, giving comfort and support, and sacrificing on behalf of those in need should be second nature to us. Our own trials and tribulations cannot justify withholding our love and service to others.<br><h2><b>"Our God Will Never Us Forsake"</b></h2><br>Elder Eldred G. Smith admonished us:<br><br><i>Remember that this world was created and all the development and the progress on this earth from Adam till now have been primarily for</i> you <i>as much as anyone else.</i><br><br><i>Christ came to atone for</i> you.<br><br><i>The gospel was restored for</i> you.<br><br><i>The Lord will answer</i> your <i>prayers.</i><br><br><i>God is mindful of</i> you, <i>for</i> you <i>are</i> [His child].<br><br><i>It is true--each has a different life to live and a different task to fill. Some tasks may be more important than others, but you--a son or daughter of God--are just as important to God as anyone else.</i><sup>24</sup><br><br>With faith in the Lord, you can even do hard things, for "with God all things are possible."<sup>25</sup> Power to overcome our trials, as well as protection from the adversary, will come as we obey the commandments and live according to the counsel we receive from the prophets. The Lord has promised:<br><br><i>For I will go before your face. I will be on your right hand and on your left, and my Spirit shall be in your hearts, and mine angels round about you, to bear you up.</i><sup>26</sup><br><h2><b>"With the Just We Shall Dwell!"</b></h2><br>I feel quite confident that if we look closely, with a sensitive heart, each of us can recognize someone who is an example of the teachings of the Savior--someone who "cleave[s] unto charity" while bearing all things and enduring all things.<br><br>We are taught in Moroni in the Book of Mormon:<br><br><i>And charity</i> suffereth long, <i>and is kind, and envieth not, and is not puffed up, seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked, thinketh no evil, and rejoiceth not in iniquity but rejoiceth in the truth,</i> beareth all things, <i>believeth all things, hopeth all things,</i> endureth all things.<br><br><i>... For charity never faileth. Wherefore, cleave unto charity, which is the greatest of all, for all things must fail--</i><br><br><i>But charity is the pure love of Christ.</i><sup>27</sup><br><br>One of the choicest examples in my personal life of "charity [that] never faileth" was manifest in the life of a close friend known to my family as Grandma Gardner. Muriel Gardner recently passed away after a courageous fight with cancer.<br><br>While this sweet lady was not directly related to us, her example of the pure love of Christ made me and my family feel that we were her own. We were prayed over, watched over, and blessed by her faith throughout the past 30 years of our lives. She always seemed to know when we were at a challenging crossroad and needed additional help or encouragement.<br><br>She would not be considered as anyone of great acclaim or importance. She did not change the world, nor was she instrumental in making any remarkable contribution to her community. Grandma Gardner was just an ordinary individual trying to live the best she knew how. It was through the latter refining months of her life that she exclaimed that she finally "got it"--meaning that she finally understood the purpose of the Atonement and Christ's love for each of us.<br><br>Her own life was filled with trials and challenges. She bore them with dignity and thankfulness to the Lord for allowing her to be an instrument in His hands. Always a vibrant and lively person, she refused to let cancer destroy her love of the Lord. Never did she blame the Lord for the afflictions she bore. She continued to express her testimony and faith in writing--even when the cancerous growth took away her ability to speak and bear testimony vocally. She hoped that by doing so, her family and friends would be led to say that they also got it. I am grateful that the Lord placed this dear sister along my life's path as an example to me.<br><h2><b>"But with Joy Wend Your Way"</b></h2><br>President Hinckley reminds us that even in the midst of opposition and turmoil, "life is to be enjoyed, not just endured."<sup>28</sup> In the gospel sense, enduring to the end is more than just physically abiding. The greatest victory comes to those who endure with joy and gratitude, with a deep abiding faith in the divine purpose of life's mortal existence. This was affirmed by the Lord when He stated to the early Saints through the Prophet Joseph Smith:<br><br><i>Verily, verily, I say unto you, ye are little children, and ye have not as yet understood how great blessings the Father hath in his own hands and prepared for you;</i><br><br><i>And ye cannot bear all things now; nevertheless, be of good cheer, for I will lead you along. The kingdom is yours and the blessings thereof are yours, and the riches of eternity are yours.</i><br><br><i>And he who receiveth all things with thankfulness shall be made glorious; and the things of this earth shall be added unto him, even an hundred fold, yea more.</i><sup>29</sup><br><br>I have shared with you some thoughts on the need for opposition in all things. I do not pretend to know all the reasons that the Lord has for giving us trials and obstacles, but let me review some of the reasons that I would like to leave with you today by way of the examples I have just given.<br><br>First, I believe the Lord provides opportunities for us to be tested because He wants to know on whom He can depend and trust. The Lord found that He could trust Noah and Eda Rogers to be faithful in whatever circumstances they were given. He knew He could trust Gideon because he was willing to follow His counsel even in the midst of incredible odds. The Lord uses trials to help us grow in faithfulness and obedience.<br><br>Second, the Lord tells us in section 122 of the Doctrine and Covenants that adversity came to the Prophet Joseph Smith to give him experience and to be for his good.<sup>30</sup> Opposition and adversity are necessary experiences in the course of our eternal progression. The great plan of happiness demands that we experience trial and sorrow as we strive to overcome, "for if they never should have bitter they could not know the sweet."<sup>31</sup> President James E. Faust stated: "The suffering of the Savior in Gethsemane was without question the greatest that has ever come to mankind, yet out of it came the greatest good in the promise of eternal life."<sup>32</sup><br><br>Third, our individual struggles and suffering teach us to relate to the Atonement of Christ in a deep and profound way that cannot be learned through any other experience. As exemplified by Sister Gardner, our capacity to show empathy and compassion for another is heightened by our own endurance and suffering. My personal witness is that only through such experiences can a person develop true charity--the pure love of Christ.<br><br>Please be assured that there is purpose in it all. The Lord has promised to give us His power and protection as we live righteous lives. I pray that we can each take fresh courage and truly find the refuge that God has prepared for us in our personal lives, where we will be blessed with those who overcome the trials of this life, where we too can exclaim: "All is well! All is well!" I humbly pray in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>David A.

<h1>g Up to the Mission - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
It is truly an honor and a privilege to be with you today. I am especially pleased to have the opportunity to address you graduates. You have my commendation and congratulations as you graduate from this very unique and choice university.<br><br>I did not have the privilege of attending Brigham Young University as a student, but I was privileged to serve here in the administration for a time. My wife and I were richly blessed by that experience and cherish the years we enjoyed so much here. We are pleased that several members of our family are graduates of BYU. In fact, a son-in-law is among you graduates today. He is receiving his PhD degree.<br><br>In President Samuelson's comments today, nearly all of us were recognized and applauded for whatever we have done and for whomever we represent, but there is one group that I feel deserves additional and particular recognition. Many of you graduates have been assisted, sustained, and supported by a devoted, persistent, and patient spouse. Without this encouragement and sacrifice, the graduation goal you are celebrating today most likely would not have been achieved. Could we ask the wives or husbands of the married graduates to stand and receive one more expression of appreciation?<br><br>I feel this rather keenly--being aware of my daughter's sacrifice in her husband's pursuit of his PhD degree--but I also remember well my own wife's sacrifice as I engaged in that same pursuit. Thanks to you all.<br><br>Several years ago President Gordon B. Hinckley was here in this building to address a large fireside gathering. He made reference to his own university graduation, saying:<br><br><i>It dawned on me the other day that I was part of a graduating class of a sister institution in 1932. This coming June it will be sixty years ago that we proudly and happily marched in a processional, listened to a commencement address of which I remember absolutely nothing, and went out to face the world.</i> ["This I Believe" (1 March 1992), <i>BYU 1991–92 Devotional and Fireside Speeches</i> (Provo: BYU, 1992), 75]<br><br>You have marched--we hope proudly and happily--in a processional and are about to listen to a commencement address of which you will remember absolutely nothing. And, just like President Hinckley and his fellow graduates, you are about to go out to face the world. How well prepared are you for the reality that awaits you? Have you equipped yourselves to succeed in every aspect of your lives--at home, in the Church, in the workplace, and in the communities where you will live?<br><br>I hope each of you has gained all that you expected from your BYU experience. I hope you have gained all that your parents and spouses expected. And I hope you have gained all that BYU has expected of you as students and graduates of this university. Your expectations should have been far greater than that which I overheard one graduate express. She said, "I got what I came for--a wonderful husband."<br><br>Now there is nothing wrong with that--and, indeed, much right--but I hope that her expectations also included receiving an education of the highest quality. Each of you should have come to BYU with the expectation that you would receive an education that would equip you with the sacred and secular learning to sustain you spiritually and temporally through the future opportunities and challenges of life.<br><br>President Brigham Young, for whom this institution is named, once offered a very insightful definition of educational outcomes. He said, "Education is the power to think clearly, the power to act well in the world's work, and the power to appreciate life" (quoted by George H. Brimhall in "The Brigham Young University," <i>Improvement Era</i> 23, no. 9 [July 1920]: 831). This is a wonderful description of what you should have acquired through your BYU experience. As you graduate today, I hope your BYU education has empowered you to think clearly, prepared you to obtain meaningful and productive employment in the world of work, and enhanced your ability to appreciate the opportunities and beauties of life. I hope that you have learned how to learn, that you love learning, and that you will continue to seek learning by study and also by faith the rest of your lives.<br><br>During this past school year BYU completed an accreditation review conducted by the Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities. Such a review typically occurs periodically to ensure the viability of every aspect of a college or university's operations. BYU produced a comprehensive self-study as part of this accreditation process. Among the purposes of such an accreditation review and the related self-study is the invitation to explore, to update if necessary, and to clearly state the mission of the university. It also provides an opportunity to make judgments as to whether or not the institution is successfully accomplishing its mission.<br><br>The mission statement of Brigham Young University declares that "students at BYU should be taught the truths of the gospel of Jesus Christ," "receive a broad university education," and "receive instruction in the special fields of their choice." "Scholarly research and creative endeavor among both faculty and students" are also affirmed as essential to the university's mission (<i>The Mission of Brigham Young University</i> and <i>The Aims of a BYU Education</i> [Provo: BYU, 1996], 1–2).<br><br>The mission of BYU is further explained in a statement of institutional objectives.<br><br>First, the university intends to "educate the minds and spirits of students within a learning environment that increases faith in God and the restored gospel, is intellectually enlarging, is character building, and leads to a life of learning and service."<br><br>Second, the university intends to "advance truth and knowledge to enhance the education of students, enrich the quality of life, and contribute to a resolution of world problems."<br><br>Third, the university intends to "extend the blessings of learning to members of the Church in all parts of the world."<br><br>Fourth, the university intends to "develop friends for the university and the Church." (In Merrill J. Bateman, "From Pioneer Roots to a World-Class, Worldwide Institution" [BYU Annual University Conference, 23 August 1999], 8–12, and "Gathered in the Tops of the Mountains" [7 September 1999], <i>BYU 1999–2000 Speeches</i> [Provo: BYU, 2000], 8–10; see also Brigham Young University Accreditation Self-Study 2006, 1.2.)<br><br>These statements of mission and institutional objectives are expressions of the university's expectations of itself. In a way, they are also expressions of the university's expectations of you as graduates, because, indeed, you become a major part of the fulfillment of the vision inspired leaders have for this university. In very significant ways the university must measure itself and its accomplishments through you.<br><br>From the results of the recent accreditation review and from all that I have come to know about Brigham Young University, I can state with confidence that as an institution BYU is measuring up to its mission. However, the key question for today is this: How well have you graduates measured up to the mission of BYU? Measuring up to the mission of this special university is a sacred obligation that you cannot ignore. You do not have the luxury of walking off this campus, driving out of Provo, and just simply turning your backs and leaving all this behind.<br><br>Speaking to students on this campus in 1996, President Gordon B. Hinckley said:<br><br><i>If this university meets the purpose for which it is maintained, then you must leave here not alone with secular knowledge but, even more important, with a spiritual and moral foundation that will find expression to improve the family, the community, the nation, even the world of which you will be a part.</i> ["Stand Up for Truth" (17 September 1996), <i>BYU 1996–97 Speeches</i> (Provo: BYU, 1997), 23]<br><br>Your education has been substantially subsidized by sacred funds made available through the tithes and offerings of faithful Latter-day Saints around the world. We hope that you have been true to this sacred trust as students, but we plead with you to be conscientiously true to this trust by measuring up to the mission of Brigham Young University as alumni throughout the balance of your lives.<br><br>This university was established under the influence of divine inspiration and revelation. Its board of trustees is made up of prophets, seers, and revelators and other General Authorities and general officers of the Church. As you know, President Samuelson is a marvelously able leader and administrator who also serves as a General Authority of the Church. He and an equally able administrative team and an exceptional faculty are deeply committed to the success of every student who enrolls at BYU. The members of the board of trustees, the administration, and the faculty feel a great sense of accountability for the results and outcomes of all that transpires here at BYU, but an equally great sense of accountability must be felt by every student. You are, and continue to be, responsible and accountable for the outcomes of your own education.<br><br>The Lord instructed the Prophet Joseph Smith on the principle of accountability:<br><br><i>For it is expedient that I, the Lord, should make every man accountable, as a steward over earthly blessings, which I have made and prepared for my creatures.</i> [D&amp;amp;C 104:13]<br><br>The Lord also said:<br><br><i>For it is required of the Lord, at the hand of every steward, to render an account of his stewardship, both in time and in eternity.</i><br><br><i>For he who is faithful and wise in time is accounted worthy to inherit the mansions prepared for him of my Father.</i> [D&amp;amp;C 72:3–4]<br><br>The university has rendered a current accounting of its stewardship "in time" through the recent accreditation process. The accounting of the university's stewardship "in eternity," however, will most likely be rendered through you, through your lives, through your achievements, and, most especially, through your faithfulness. BYU has received a renewal and extension of its accreditation status, and after several years there will be another opportunity to render an account of its stewardship "in time." Your university is being held accountable for the learning environment and learning outcomes expressed through the lives of its students. The university cannot force you to learn, but it must provide an environment conducive to the best possible student learning outcomes. However, the responsibility for the ultimate outcomes is yours.<br><br>The board of trustees has great confidence in the university's commitment and capacity to provide the most desirable learning environment possible. The trustees have a keen interest in the degree to which the university measures up to its prescribed mission. The trustees are also keenly interested in how well you as graduates measure up to the mission of BYU.<br><br>Have you become students of faith, intellect, and character? Have you acquired increased knowledge and deepened testimonies of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ? Have you acquired the knowledge and competence necessary to contribute to your chosen professions and to serve your families and the communities where you will live? Have both your mind and your spirit been educated? Are you prepared to make your contribution, no matter how great or small, to the resolution of world problems?<br><br>How well you measure up to this mission constitutes the bottom line of your stewardship accountability. How well you fare in daily life as followers of Christ; people of faith and character; contributing members of families, the Church, and society; and honest and productive workers in the world's occupations and professions will be the measure of your accountability and the measure of the university's ultimate accountability both "in time" and "in eternity."<br><br>When President Samuelson was inaugurated as president of BYU, President Hinckley challenged him and his associates in the faculty and administration to make BYU the best it can be (see Cecil O. Samuelson, "A More Excellent Way: A Changing BYU in a Changing World [BYU Annual University Conference, 24 August 2004], and "The BYU Way" [BYU Annual University Conference, 23 August 2005]). BYU has this stewardship to be the best it can be in providing you with the education, knowledge, values, and tools necessary to be successful and effective in life. You, as individual graduates of this institution, have the responsibility to be the best you can be, to be wise and faithful stewards over that which you have received. You have been given much. You have "entered to learn." You must now "go forth to serve." Go forth with honor, go forth with integrity, go forth with a great sense of personal responsibility.<br><br>You have now joined the ranks of BYU graduates around the world. You have worked hard, paid your dues, and paid your tuition. However, in October 1992 general conference, President Boyd K. Packer told us that there is a second tuition also due:<br><br><i>For those privileged to attend a Church school, there is a tuition other than money which we must require of you--a tuition of conduct and performance. Students who enroll in Church schools . . . must commit to a standard of conduct consistent with faithful Church membership.</i> ["To Be Learned Is Good If . . . ," <i>Ensign,</i> November 1992, 72]<br><br>I trust that this will be a lifelong commitment that will continue to bless your lives and strengthen those around you.<br><br>As graduates you may think you have completed your last final exams. I must remind you, however, that one final examination remains for us all. In ancient days, the Apostle John foresaw that final day of reckoning:<br><br><i>And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God; and the books were opened: and another book was opened, which is the book of life: and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books, according to their works.</i> [Revelations 20:12]<br><br>This will be a comprehensive final exam, and it will include an ultimate accounting of our personal stewardships--what we have learned, what we have done with what we have learned, and who and what we have become.<br><br>In President Hinckley's 1992 fireside address, to which I referred earlier, he said:<br><br><i>Every one of us is largely the product of his or her beliefs. Our behavior is governed by these. They become our standards of conduct.</i> ["This I Believe," 76]<br><br>This statement by President Hinckley is consistent with King Benjamin's admonition challenging his people to live according to that which they believed. After teaching them all these principles and having the assurance that the people believed them, he said: "And now, if you believe all these things see that ye do them" (Mosiah 4:10).<br><br>I have confidence that you will do that which you believe, and I have confidence that you will become that which you desire to be and that which this university foresees for you. I have confidence in Brigham Young University, and I have confidence in you graduates. I have confidence that you have indeed measured up to the mission of Brigham Young University and that you will continue to do so throughout your lives. I pray for heaven's blessings to be with you to this end, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>W. Rolfe Kerr was commissioner of the Church Educational System and a member of the First Quorum of the Seventy of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when this commencement address was given on 17 August 2006.</i><br><br><i>© Intellectual Reserve, Inc.

<br>
It is my great privilege and honor to represent the Brigham Young University Alumni Association. I take personal pleasure in seeing Rachel Wilcox on the stand with me today. Her family is from Denver, and I am delighted that she is here to represent us and our fair city. Her uncle, Kenn Thiess, preceded me in this assignment more than a decade ago. Her family has a long and loyal heritage of support for this fine institution.<br><br>It has been a very busy summer at the alumni association. On June 23rd, as President Samuelson mentioned, the university broke ground for the new Gordon B. Hinckley Alumni and Visitors Center. A year from now, when you come back to campus, you will find this new building waiting for you. I hope you will each feel very much at home in this new facility and I hope you will come back to visit often. It will be a gateway to the campus for our visitors as well as a home for all of you, our beloved alumni, and a tremendous tribute to our dear prophet.<br><br>The work of funding this project continues. No tithing monies will go into the construction of this building. Many of you have participated in this effort through the Choose to Give campaign and the Annual Fund. We are most grateful for your assistance and appreciate your sacrifice. We have made excellent progress, and the work of identifying funds goes forward. If you have not yet had the chance to assist in this fine effort, you can find that opportunity on BYU's Web site.<br><br>Over the years many foreign language missionaries have taken classes at BYU in their new tongue upon returning home to campus. I, along with many of my friends from German-speaking missions, took such classes.<br><br>At that time we studied on the fifth floor of the library, surrounded by stacks of books on German language and literature. We went there to study and to capture any drops of inspiration and knowledge that might be left oozing from the books around us. There were so many incredible authors. I'm sure some of you here today have utilized this process of "osmosis" as you've sat among the stacks in the Harold B. Lee Library.<br><br>While there late one evening, my friend Joel Bryan pointed out a short story by Franz Kafka, a German-born, Polish Jew who wrote during the 1920s. He had an unusual talent, but his prose was often hard to understand. The exciting thing about the story for me at the time was not the content but the fact that it was only one and one-half pages long. For a student still working through his organic chemistry, zoology, and physics homework at 10:45 p.m., such a short story was welcome indeed. I read the story in haste.<br><br>Surprisingly, Kafka's story has stayed with me much longer than the organic chemistry homework or the principles of physics that I studied that night--both very valuable subjects, I assure you.<br><br>The story is called "Before the Law." The tale opens as an unsophisticated country farmer visits the county seat to do some business. As he walks up the steps approaching the side door of the courthouse, he sees a guard there who blocks the open passageway and demands to know why the farmer wants to gain entrance.<br><br>The farmer explains very simply that he has business to accomplish, but the guard refuses to let him in. The farmer, not being well versed in matters of municipal government, sits on the steps of the courthouse and waits a while, trying to figure out his next move. He petitions the guard continually for days, weeks, and months without rest or going home--all to no avail.<br><br>At one point, a visibly annoyed guard tells the farmer that if he believes he is strong enough to get past him, he should know that beyond him at each interior door in the courthouse is a guard much larger and more terrible than he.<br><br>And so the bewildered farmer sits on the steps and waits. In his waiting he consumes all that he has in this life.<br><br>Finally, realizing that the end for him is near--his vision dimming, his body unwilling to move--he beckons the guard close to ask one final question before his death.<br><br>"How is it," he pleads, "that in all these years no one else has come to beg permission to enter the county courthouse by this door?"<br><br>"Ah," bellows the guard in disgust, "that is very simple. This door was meant for you alone to enter. And, because you have not done so, I'm now going to lock it" (see Franz Kafka, "Before the Law," The Trial [1925]).<br><br>In the course of our daily experiences we sometimes walk past--or around---opportunities because they may seem too difficult or daunting. I think of this story whenever a new opportunity, challenge, or problem arises. I hope that when you are at the end of your days you will not have walked past opportunities that you should have taken or challenges you should have accepted. I hope you will draw each day upon your secular and spiritual knowledge to find your way in faith.<br><br>You have been able to glean a sterling education while attending this great university. I trust that you have felt the Spirit of the Y while here--both in and outside the classroom. From this day forth you carry the pleasant burden of being keepers of the Spirit of the Y and assisting in this institution's ongoing success. Come back and see your alma mater frequently and speak positively of her to all you encounter. Reconnect with her as often as possible. Represent her well as you work to represent yourself, your good family name, and your church in similar fashion.<br><br>As president of your alumni association, I hereby confer on each of you lifetime membership in the Brigham Young University Alumni Association. Congratulations, and welcome into this great association of nearly 360,000.<br><br>That you may be successful in all your worthy attempts in this life is my prayer, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><em>J. Craig McIlroy was president of the BYU Alumni Association when this commencement address was given on 17 August 2006.</em><br><br>© Brigham Young University. All rights reserved.

<h1>roughout Your Lives - August 2006 Graduates - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Graduates, families, brothers, sisters, and friends, it is a wonderful privilege to be with you and witness the various expressions of excitement, elation, and anticipation for the future. I see in you relief that it is finally over and also mutual and reciprocal feelings of appreciation for each other and for special experiences that have been part of your BYU journey.<br><br>We are certainly pleased to honor specifically all those graduates whose names are found in the program today, and we also pay tribute to and thank the many who have made these accomplishments possible. In this we include spouses, parents, children, and other family members, professors, teachers, classmates, friends, Church leaders, faithful tithe payers, generous donors, and all whose various contributions make the miracle of BYU a reality.<br><br>We are especially pleased to recognize Elder W. Rolfe Kerr of the Seventy and commissioner of Church education who has been assigned by the First Presidency to address us today. We welcome Elder Neil L. Andersen of the Presidency of the Seventy; Sister Bonnie D. Parkin, Relief Society general president and a member of the board of trustees; Sister Susan W. Tanner, Young Women general president and also a member of the board of trustees; and Bishop Keith B. McMullin, second counselor in the Presiding Bishopric. We are also pleased to recognize Sister Vickie Matsumori of the Primary general presidency, who is with us in the audience. In addition, we welcome a number of special friends and supporters of both our graduates and the university.<br><br>Within each graduating class there are some significant commonalities with preceding graduates and also some unique characteristics of the current group. Today we will grant a total of 2,643 degrees that you will see described more fully in the program. Slightly more than half of our graduates are women, and 53 percent of the class is married. For most of you, these degrees have really been achieved by family committee, and we honor all who have contributed.<br><br>I think the age-span difference in our graduates from 19 years old to 85 years old--66 years--is the greatest I have experienced since coming to BYU. We would like especially to honor Betty West, graduating in general studies, whose tenacity demonstrates that it is never too late to learn and never too late to fulfill your educational aspirations. Congratulations, Sister West! Please stand and let us recognize you. While we are at it, we also thank all who have encouraged and assisted you in this marvelous quest over these last several years.<br><br>Sister West has a wonderful history and life story that has been publicized in the media recently and is well known to many friends and admirers. I should mention that a number of you graduating today and tomorrow have also overcome amazing and sometimes unique obstacles in achieving these significant recognitions. We pay tribute to you and celebrate with you.<br><br>This past academic year at BYU has been remarkable in many ways. Our students and faculty continue to be recognized nationally and internationally for scholarly achievements, remarkable successes in various competitions, and also in the individual accomplishments of our friends, alumni, and broad university community. In recent weeks we have had our university accreditation reaffirmed by the Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities. I want to thank so many of you publicly for your key and substantive contributions in this most significant and important process.<br><br>Last June 23rd we were privileged to have the First Presidency, several members of the board of trustees, loyal and generous donors, and alumni join with us on campus for the groundbreaking ceremony for the new Gordon B. Hinckley Alumni and Visitors Center. We also were pleased to have a birthday party for President Hinckley as he celebrated his 96th birthday with us. Undoubtedly, many of you have noticed the very big hole in the ground where the men and machines are already at work and on schedule with the construction of this special building. We hope you graduates will accept this invitation to make the new Hinckley building your BYU home and destination frequently in the years to come.<br><br>We are very grateful for our beautiful campus, our many remarkable buildings, and the tremendous resources that have been provided for us. We must remember, however, that the buildings, grounds, resources, technology, libraries, and other accouterments that make our lives both pleasant and productive are not really the core of BYU. That is found in the prophetically assigned mission of this institution and in the people involved: the students, faculty, staff, administration, alumni, donors, and other supporters. We are here because we have vital work to accomplish while we are in residence and particularly as we "go forth to serve."<br><br>It has been said that the real measure of the worth and the contribution of a university is in the graduates that it produces. I believe this is true, as long as we also acknowledge the contributions that have been made to the students prior to their arrival at their university. At BYU this dimension is particularly true because our select student body is made up of those who have qualified broadly and have prepared exceedingly well both academically and personally before their matriculation. Thus, as we congratulate you, our graduates, we also thank those who have helped you prepare so well long before you arrived on this campus. We include parents, spouses, other family members, Church leaders, teachers, and all who have had great and special influences on you in your early, formative years.<br><br>Our goal, and that of the board of trustees, is to have a university worthy of our student body. Think of these words of President Spencer W. Kimball in his campus address entitled "Education for Eternity":<br><br><i>In all the world, the Brigham Young University is the greatest institution of learning. This statement I have made numerous times. I believe it sincerely. There are many criteria by which a university can be judged and appraised and evaluated. The special qualities of Brigham Young University lie not in its bigness; there are a number of much larger universities.</i><br><br><i>It should not be judged by its affluence and the amount of money available for buildings, research and other facilities. It should not be judged by prestige, for there are more statusful institutions as the world measures status.</i><br><br><i>The uniqueness of Brigham Young University lies in its special role--education for eternity--which it must carry in addition to the usual tasks of a university. This means concern--curricular and behavioral--for not only the "whole man" but for the "eternal man"</i> [and woman]. <i>Where all universities seek to preserve the heritage of knowledge that history has washed to their feet, this faculty has a double heritage--the preserving of knowledge of men and the revealed truths sent from heaven.</i> [Spencer W. Kimball, "Education for Eternity," preschool address to faculty and staff, Brigham Young University, 12 September 1967, 1–2]<br><br>We hope and expect that you have grown in your understanding of the knowledge of the world and also in your convictions concerning the truthfulness of the revelations from heaven. Most important, we pray with confidence that the skills you have acquired and the talents you have magnified will allow and assist you to continue to learn throughout your lives "by study and also by faith" (D&amp;amp;C 88:118). As you do, you will, as the Apostle Paul said, "save thyself, and them that hear thee" (1 Timothy 4:16).<br><br>BYU has enriched you and you have enriched BYU. With all of this, we invoke the blessings of heaven upon you and yours as you "go forth to serve." In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Cecil O. Samuelson was president of Brigham Young University when this commencement address was given on 17 August 2006.</i><br><br><i>© Intellectual Reserve, Inc. All rights reserved.</i>

<h1> Our Light - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
A wonderful painting hangs in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. Entitled <i>Aristotle with a Bust of Homer,</i> it was commissioned during a time when its creator--the great Dutch painter Rembrandt--was facing personal financial difficulty, made even more grating by the artistic demands coming from his patrons. Art historian Sister Wendy Beckett observed that, for Rembrandt, immersed in this period of personal and creative struggle, the painting seemed "to have sparked off some deep inner response"<sup>1</sup> concerning creative integrity--what, and how, we choose to "create" with the gifts we are given.<br><br>The painting depicts the great, lavishly dressed philosopher Aristotle wearing a long, gold chain--a present from his most famous student, Alexander the Great. Aristotle's hand rests on a small statue of the immortal poet Homer, who had already passed out of this world and into legend. Also present in his thoughts, but invisible to the eye, is Aristotle's own great mentor, the famed philosopher Plato. Under Plato's tutelage Aristotle learned to seek after knowledge and to develop his remarkable intellectual gifts so that he too could achieve new understanding and pass those great skills of thought on to another generation.<br><br>In turn, Aristotle became the teacher and received Alexander as his student. No doubt he hoped that Alexander could embody his ideal of a philosopher-king: a ruler as good and wise as he was powerful. But although Aristotle used his gifts of intellect in the pursuit of knowledge and understanding, he could only stand by and watch as Alexander used his gifts not to further knowledge or establish peace among nations but to wage war and build an empire on the bodies of the conquered.<br><br>Compared to Aristotle and Alexander, we know very little about Homer, the poet who composed <i>The Iliad </i>and <i>The Odyssey</i> and whose likeness captured Aristotle's attention. In good Greek tradition Homer was supposed to have been blind--although most poets and prophets were depicted as being "blind," symbolizing not so much a physical defect as a moral strength: being blind to the falsity and compromises of mortality but seers of the realities beyond. Their writings therefore presented a different standard--a true standard--by which a man might measure himself.<br><br>In contrast, even in his lifetime Aristotle had a taste of the honor that would follow him for thousands of years after his death, but that recognition does not seem enough to quiet the great man's soul in the midst of solitary introspection. Where Plato had trained Aristotle, a great philosopher and friend of man, Aristotle had trained Alexander, a conqueror, a worldly king of kings who gained the whole world, then lost it all when he died at the age of 33.<br><br>Through Rembrandt we see Aristotle contemplating the worth of what he will leave behind--including his writings, which would serve as the foundation of Western scientific and philosophic thought for more than a thousand years. And yet he seems drawn to ponder whether he has actually been "successful": whether he has properly used his gifts of intellect and of teaching--whether he has done what he was truly capable of doing. We have caught him in a moment of private discourse with the blind, transcendent poet--as if wondering what significance the poet's blind eyes would attach to his golden chain, fashioned from the plunder of Alexander's victories. We must wonder, with him, whether a teacher is truly honored by such a gift if the giver is a student who failed to learn.<br><br>Consider Aristotle's dilemma. The question of true success--of feeling satisfied that we are rising to the promise and responsibility of the gifts we are given--can weigh heavily upon anyone, particularly a young graduate. That is why it can be helpful to keep in mind that the real difficulty is not usually in knowing what to do but rather in doing it. As William Shakespeare rather slyly observed, "If to do were as easy as to know what were good to do, chapels had been churches, and poor men's cottages princes' palaces" (<i>The Merchant of Venice,</i> act 1, scene 2, lines 13–15).<br><br>The American poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow translated Shakespeare's negative into a positive, with familiar sentiments for any college student:<br><br><i>The heights by great men reached and kept</i><br><br><i>Were not attained by sudden flight,</i><br><br><i>But they, while their companions slept,</i><br><br><i>Were toiling upward in the night.</i><br><br>[<i>The Ladder of St. Augustine</i> (1858), stanza 10]<br><br>Two millennia after Aristotle, the inventor genius Thomas Edison in turn echoed Longfellow as he wrote, "Many of life's failures are experienced by people who did not realize how close they were to success when they gave up." Edison also formulated the famous equation for achieving that success; namely, that "genius is 1 percent inspiration and 99 percent perspiration." It is unsettling to consider what might have happened if Edison had exerted only 95 percent of that necessary perspiration and the final 1 percent--that inspired spark--had never come.<br><br>Now, with Aristotle and Rembrandt and Edison in mind, consider great scientific achievements or works of art that have especially moved you, leaders who have affected you, and writers and teachers and thinkers who have inspired you. Then consider an image from Genesis:<br><br><i>The earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.</i><br><br><i>And God said, Let there be light.</i> [Genesis 1:2–3]<br><br>With great time and effort our abilities can be honed and polished and refined until they are capable of bringing forth great works. However, without that brooding, creative Spirit--without that spark of divine light--those gifts remain dormant, "without form, and void." But when that Spirit moves upon the waters--when it moves upon us--it can organize and enlighten those gifts that we have worked to develop and, through the sacrifice of our time and effort and abilities, bring forth remarkable creations out of those elements.<br><br>While still a BYU student himself, my father--like almost every graduate in this auditorium--was profoundly touched by the mentoring and friendship of remarkable professors at this university. He particularly recalls a conversation with Dr. Robert K. Thomas, who served as the university's provost.<br><br>"The problem," said Dr. Thomas, "is that so many of our students leave with the idea that they should seek material prosperity, worldly influence, and prestige--that this is what the Lord meant when He said, 'Let your light so shine before men.'"<br><br>Then, lifting his hand and tracing a rising arc, he said, "But all too often, by the time their star is up--the light is out."<br><br>Looking my father squarely in the eye, he said, "Don't let that happen to you."<br><br>Let us not allow our light to go out--either through neglect or misuse of our abilities or through the mistaken conviction that the light is our own. Think of Aristotle, brought to silent contemplation at the end of a long and successful life. Think of poor men's cottages that might have been princes' palaces. Think of Edison, who "while [his] companions slept, / [Was] toiling upward in the night." Then remember the divine Spirit brooding upon the waters. Yes, the Savior admonished us to "Let [our] light so shine before men, that they may see [our] good works" (Matthew 5:16), but He also taught, "I am the light which ye shall hold up" (3 Nephi 18:24).<br><br>And, if He is our light, our star will never go out. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Rachel Kimball Wilcox spoke as the representative of her graduating class at BYU commencement on 17 August 2006.</i><br><br><b>Note</b><br><br>1.

<h1>stored - Dieter F. Uchtdorf - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
My dear brothers and sisters, Brigham Young University has always been a very special place to our family. When our children were teenagers, they attended the different summer programs on the BYU campus. And my wife, Harriet, and I went to a course called Especially for Parents, aimed to improve parenting. We never dared ask our children whether this class really improved our parenting. I have to admit, however, that they turned out to be great kids anyhow. I account this to the goodness of their mother and the tender mercies of God.<br><br>In those younger years my wife and I enjoyed very much the opportunities to occasionally come all the way from Germany to attend BYU Campus Education Week. Back then we stayed at Helaman Halls, and for this short period of time we felt like real BYU students. We met great people and had a wonderful time. My wife was super-perfect in planning our days. Since we wanted to learn as much as possible, she scheduled each of us for different lectures. Then, during lunch breaks and in the evenings, we exchanged notes and shared our impressions. We still have many books filled with notes--unfortunately never again to be looked at after we had left the campus. But, make no mistake, it was a great experience, and we will always treasure these wonderful memories very close to our hearts.<br><br>Sister Uchtdorf and I are so happy to be with you today and feel of your wonderful spirit. We are grateful for your testimonies and for your dedication as members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. You are living witnesses of the truth restored. We thank you for your exemplary lives as mothers and fathers, single adults, single parents, and grandparents. We know that many of you have come from far away and at a significant sacrifice. I also would like to thank all who have organized this education week and all who will teach and are teaching.<br><br>I am especially grateful for this year's theme--Seek Learning--which is taken from the Lord's injunction to "seek learning, even by study and also by faith" (D&amp;amp;C 88:118).<br><br>The restored Church of Jesus Christ has always encouraged its members to pursue knowledge and education through study and also by faith--line upon line and precept upon precept.<br><br>For us, knowledge is understood to be an active, motivating force rather than simply a passive awareness of facts. Indeed, certain truths must be understood and applied because they are essential for salvation and eternal life (see John 17:3; 1 John 4:7–8). The Prophet Joseph Smith taught that "a man is saved no faster than he gets knowledge, for if he does not get knowledge, he will be brought into captivity" (<i>HC</i> 4:588). His words build on the Savior's commandment: "Ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free" (John 8:32).<br><br>It is knowledge of truth that makes us free to exercise our moral agency and freedom of choice (see Helaman 14:30–31). God Himself defines His glory in terms of light and truth. In modern-day revelation we read, "The glory of God is intelligence, or, in other words, light and truth" (D&amp;amp;C 93:36). Perhaps this is why "pure knowledge . . . shall greatly enlarge the soul" (D&amp;amp;C 121:42). The more knowledge of truth we have, the better we can progress spiritually.<br><br>The scriptures encourage us to seek deeply and broadly to gain knowledge of both heavenly and earthly things (see D&amp;amp;C 88:77–80).<br><br>What is this knowledge, this intelligence, this light and truth that our Heavenly Father would have us receive? Certainly it is found in the scriptures and in the words of the living prophets. But it also includes what we consider to be secular. Some of the early apostles had little secular learning, while others were highly educated in the eyes of the world. Regardless of their different backgrounds in secular education, all of the apostles knew the weightier matters of life; all of them knew the path to eternal life.<br><br>It is wise, therefore, to keep a balanced and eternal perspective when seeking and studying all knowledge--revealed and secular. If we proceed on this path, we will learn to master ourselves, which in turn enables us to master this beautiful earth and its vast opportunities. And it will help us to become a more effective tool in the hands of the Lord. It will help us to become peacemakers in a world of wars and rumors of war.<br><br>My dear brothers and sisters, let us remember that all truth, all pure knowledge, can be circumscribed by the restored gospel of Jesus Christ. Of all the treasures of knowledge, the most vital is the knowledge of God--of His existence, His powers, His love, and His promises.<br><br>This is why the Restoration of the gospel is such a tremendous blessing and of such great importance for each and every one of us. Every gift and power and grace of God that was available when Jesus Christ walked the earth has been restored in our time.<br><br>Through the knowledge of the Restoration we learn that God has a plan for us that will enable us to both enjoy the beauties of life and cope with its sorrows and disappointments. This divine plan was established before the foundation of the earth and can enable us to return to our Heavenly Father one day. The sacred knowledge of this plan brought us joy when we accepted it in our premortal life, and it gives us an eternal vision as we follow it in this life.<br><br>The Restoration of the gospel opens doors to glorious sources of knowledge and wisdom. Jesus taught, "The Spirit of truth . . . will guide you into all truth" (John 16:13). And the Book of Mormon, a tangible witness of this Restoration, speaks to us through the prophet Moroni, that "by the power of the Holy Ghost [we] may know the truth of all things" (Moroni 10:5).<br><br>Secular knowledge alone can never save a soul nor open the celestial kingdom to anyone. Life itself, the gospel, and God cannot be understood through research alone. For that understanding we must be taught from on high. Jacob reminded us: "To be learned is good if [we] hearken unto the counsels of God" (2 Nephi 9:29). The ancient word <i>hearken</i> means to listen and to pay attention to God's words given through the scriptures and by the living prophets. Faithful application of gospel principles is the key. Applying knowledge of divine truth leads to wisdom.<br><br>Our learning, even by study and also by faith, when directed toward the Restoration, will give us supernal knowledge and wisdom to cope with the challenges of daily life and prepare us to receive all the blessings of eternity.<br><br>Therefore, I would like to make this message my testimony of the "restitution of all things" (Acts 3:21)--meaning, of course, the restoration of all things. God lives, and He speaks today as He did anciently. This is the message and the testimony we as Church members need to have in our hearts and in our minds and carry into all the world.<br><br>As we share our testimony with others, I hope that we will have the same convincing power and enthusiasm the members had who brought the message to Brigham Young. He said:<br><br><i>The brethren who came to preach the Gospel to me, I could easily out-talk them . . . ; but their testimony was like fire in my bones; I understood the spirit of their preaching; I received that spirit; it was light, intelligence, power, and truth, and it bore witness to my spirit, and that was enough for me.</i> [Remarks by Brigham Young, 28 July 1861; <i>JD</i> 9:141; also reported in <i>Deseret News Weekly,</i> 2 October 1861, 177]<br><br>Please allow me at this point to give special thanks to my wife, Harriet, for her witness and testimony of the Restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ. And let me share with you the story of how my wife's family became converted to the gospel many years ago.<br><br>One Sunday when I was a teenager attending the Frankfurt Branch in Germany, the missionaries brought a young mother and her two beautiful daughters to our church meetings. At that age I had no real interest in girls; however, I still remember the impressions I had when I saw those two young girls walking into our chapel. The older daughter, especially, with her large brown eyes and beautiful black hair, immediately caught my attention. I thought, "These missionaries are doing a really great job!" Little did I know that this young lady would later bless my life forever.<br><br>But I'm getting ahead of the story. Let me go back and start with how this young family met the missionaries.<br><br>In the fall of 1954, two missionaries were ringing the doorbells inside of an apartment building in the city of Frankfurt. Beginning with the doors on the main level, they gradually worked their way up the floors without any success. No one invited them in or wanted to listen to their message. But these were dedicated and faithful missionaries, and they did not give up or try another, perhaps more fruitful, apartment building. Finally they rang the bell of the last door on the fourth floor. It was opened by young Harriet Reich, who immediately asked her mother to invite them in. Sister Carmen Reich initially hesitated, but after some additional pleading by Harriet, she finally invited Elder Gary Jenkins from California and his companion into their home.<br><br>These two missionaries were truly guided by the Spirit, not only in where to go but also in what to say. After briefly explaining who they were and what the message was they wanted to share, the missionaries left a Book of Mormon with the mother, asked her to read the marked scriptures, and departed with a prayer and a blessing. Two days later they returned. This time the missionaries received a friendly welcome and were invited in quickly. When they asked Sister Reich if she had read the marked scriptures in the Book of Mormon, she answered without hesitation, "I read the whole book, and I feel that it is true."<br><br>Sister Carmen Reich was only 36 at the time, a widow with two daughters. Only eight months before she had lost her husband, a renowned musician, to cancer. The family had always lived in good circumstances and had no need for financial help even after the loss of their husband and father. But after his unexpected death, they struggled with a number of unanswered questions: Is there a purpose in life? Is there anything after death? And, if so, what? Why are we born? Did we live before this life?<br><br>Representatives of a number of different religions approached them, trying to be of help. However, Sister Reich never felt a need for their assistance. The answers they offered were not new to her and not very helpful.<br><br>Let me make it clear that Sister Reich was a religious person. She loved to read, and the Bible was one of her favorite books. She was always seeking truth, even by study and faith. She believed firmly that Jesus is the Christ, and she taught her family to follow His teachings. They accepted Peter, Paul, Matthew, Mark, Luke, James, and John as apostles and regarded their teachings highly. This family had always been happy. They were good, honest people, and even the loss of their husband and father could not take away their strong feeling of family.<br><br>However, when Sister Carmen Reich read the Book of Mormon cover to cover in two days, she felt something she had never before experienced. By her own account, it was "the spirit of revelation." Her experience was consistent with Joseph Smith's description of personal revelation; she said she could "feel pure intelligence flowing" into her, giving her "sudden strokes of ideas" about the things of the Spirit of God (<i>HC</i> 3:381). These ideas related to her special circumstances. The Spirit was able to teach her, for she was open and receptive to truth and light. As the missionaries taught her the plan of salvation and the other doctrines of the Restoration, she continued to grow in the principle of personal revelation. All the good things she had learned in her Lutheran faith received a new and a deeper meaning, and all of a sudden life itself had a totally different and divine eternal perspective.<br><br>It was not that she felt any disdain for what she had believed for so many years. She still loved many of the hymns she had sung at church. One of her favorites was (and continues to be in our family) "A Mighty Fortress Is Our God," by Martin Luther (<i>Hymns,</i> 1985, no. 68). She was also glad that she had learned to quote and internalize many key scriptures of the New Testament. But when she heard the message of the Restoration, a door was opened into a world flooded with light and filled with love and hope. Looking back, she described her experience this way: It was as if something of great importance had been lifeless and inert but was now resurrected to life, beauty, and activity.<br><br>Sister Reich, my dear mother-in-law, represents in many ways the multitude of converts who are coming into the Church every day from other religions--both Christian and non-Christian, and even from no religion at all. One characteristic is true of all of them--they are willing and pure enough to believe when God speaks.<br><br>Sister Reich was baptized on November 7, 1954. In December, only a few weeks after her baptism, the missionary who baptized her asked if she would write down her testimony. Elder Jenkins wanted to use her testimony to help others feel the true spirit of conversion. Fortunately, he kept her handwritten original for more than 40 years and then returned it to my mother-in-law as a very special gift of love. Sister Carmen Reich passed away in 2000 at age 83.<br><br>Let me read to you parts of her written testimony. It shows what she saw, at this time of her life, as the key points of the Restoration. Please bear in mind that you are listening to a sister who was taught and had accepted the restored gospel only a few weeks earlier. Before the missionaries came, she had never heard anything about the Book of Mormon, and she knew nothing about Joseph Smith or Mormons in general. Also keep in mind that in 1954 there were no temples outside the United States except in Canada. And remember that Sister Reich had recently lost her husband. This is the English translation of her handwritten testimony:<br><br><i>Special characteristics of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints that are not present in other religious communities include, above all:</i><br><br><i>Modern revelation given through the Prophet Joseph Smith.</i><br><br><i>Sacred priesthood authority as in the time of Christ, with a living prophet today.</i><br><br><i>Next, the Book of Mormon in its clear and pure language, with all its instructions and promises for the Church of Jesus Christ--truly a second witness with the Bible that Jesus Christ lives.</i><br><br><i>Faith in a personal God--that is, God the Father; God the Son</i> [Jesus Christ]; <i>and the Holy Ghost, who facilitates prayer and guides us personally.</i><br><br><i>Belief in a premortal life, the premortal existence. Knowledge of the purpose of our earthly life and of our life after death. The plan of salvation is so clearly laid out in the restored gospel that our lives receive new meaning and direction.</i><br><br><i>The Word of Wisdom as a guide to help us to keep our body and spirit healthy and improve them. This is our goal because we know that we will take our body up again after death.</i><br><br><i>Temple work, with its many sacred ordinances enabling families to be together forever. This doctrine, totally new to me, was given through revelation to the Prophet Joseph Smith.</i><br><br>How grateful I am for Sister Reich. How grateful I am for the missionaries. How grateful I am for the families who had prepared these missionaries. How grateful I am for the Restoration.<br><br>The key messages of the Restoration have the power to bring divine feelings to the heart and mind of the earnest seeker of truth, irrespective of the person's cultural or religious background. There are no geographic or cultural boundaries for the Holy Ghost. The Holy Ghost is not restricted by space, neither is the Spirit restricted by time. We all have witnessed the power of the Spirit, and the scriptures testify of it: "[Jesus Christ] manifesteth himself unto all those who believe in him, by the power of the Holy Ghost; yea, unto every nation, kindred, tongue, and people" (2 Nephi 26:13).<br><br>My dear brothers and sisters, many of you have served as missionaries or have sent sons and daughters to lands and missions with names you might have never heard before and geographic locations you may have had a hard time finding on the world map. Thank you for this wonderful service of love. At the same time, may I invite you to take a good look into the future. Your children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren may be serving in countries and areas of the world with cultural and religious backgrounds totally different from your traditional mission fields. Your firm belief in and your willingness to testify of the Restoration today will prepare the ground for the successful service of future generations of missionaries. These future missionaries, prepared by you, will be a great blessing to individuals, to families, and to the peoples of the world.<br><br>As members of the Church of Jesus Christ, we have a responsibility to extend the message of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ, as guided by the Spirit, to every corner of the world. Sometimes this corner may be located in our own home--perhaps in our own family. And we have a special privilege and responsibility to prepare our youth for this service of love by building their personal testimonies. That responsibility should not overwhelm us. Let us be humbled by it, but not overwhelmed.<br><br>It may be helpful to recall the Savior's charge and the promises He gave to His disciples. They are still applicable to us today. Jesus said:<br><br><i>Go ye therefore, and teach</i> all nations, <i>baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost:</i><br><br><i>Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you alway, even unto</i> the end of the world. [Matthew 28:19–20; emphasis added]<br><br><i>Ye shall receive power, after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you: and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem . . . and unto</i> the uttermost part of the earth. [Acts 1:8; emphasis added]<br><br>You and I have the same responsibility and promise today. Members of the Church live in all parts of the world--sometimes in the uttermost parts of the earth. To one person Germany may be the uttermost part. To someone from New York City, the uttermost part of the earth--<i>the farthest away--</i>may be the town of Preston, Idaho. Or New York City may qualify as the uttermost part of the earth for those who have lived all their lives in Manti, Utah. Wherever we may be, we are expected to invite our neighbors, friends, and acquaintances to come, see, and experience what the restored gospel is all about. We can invite them to our homes and to our church meetings.<br><br>As members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, we invite people of all backgrounds--many of which are very different from our own--to come unto Christ. We should not hesitate to invite those of other religions. Many of these good people have been seeking for the truth, even by study and also by faith, for a long time. We need to reach out to them in a courageous way with a sweet boldness, with love, and with a pure desire to share the truth from which they have been kept "because they know not where to find it" (D&amp;amp;C 123:12).<br><br>President Gordon B. Hinckley said:<br><br><i>We do not stand out in opposition to other churches. We respect all men for all the good that they do, and we say to those of all churches, we honor the good that you do and we invite you to come and see what further good we can do for you.</i> [<i>TGBH,</i> 667]<br><br>The Prophet Joseph Smith explained:<br><br><i>We don't ask any people to throw away any good they have got; we only ask them to come and get more.</i> [<i>HC</i> 5:259]<br><br>President Howard W. Hunter quoted President George Albert Smith and then expanded on his words:<br><br><i>In our humble efforts to build brotherhood and to teach revealed truth, we say to the people of the world what President George Albert Smith so lovingly suggested:</i><br><br><i>"We have come not to take away from you the truth and virtue you possess. We have come not to find fault with you nor to criticize you. We have not come here to berate you because of things you have not done; but we have come here as your brethren . . . and to say to you: 'Keep all the good that you have, and let us bring to you more good, in order that you may be happier and in order that you may be prepared to enter into the presence of our Heavenly Father.'" (</i>Sharing the Gospel with Others, <i>comp. Preston Nibley [Salt Lake City: Deseret News Press, 1948], pp. 12–13). . . .</i><br><br><i>Ours is a perennial religion based on eternal, saving truth. Its message of love and brotherhood is lodged in scripture and in the revelations of the Lord to his living prophet. It embraces all truth. It circumscribes all wisdom--all that God has revealed to man, and all that he will yet reveal.</i> [Howard W. Hunter, "The Gospel--A Global Faith," <i>Ensign,</i> November 1991, 19]<br><br>The Restoration in its fulness completes and enhances the truths found in the religions of the world.<br><br>Latter-day Saints are occasionally accused of being narrow-minded or unwilling to consider the beliefs of others. Such accusations may be true of Latter-day Saints who do not understand their own religion, but those who know the position of the Church regarding the beliefs of other people willingly allow all to "worship how, where, or what they may" (Articles of Faith 1:11).<br><br>In a conference address in 1921, Elder Orson F. Whitney described many religious leaders as being inspired. He said:<br><br>[God] <i>is using not only his covenant people, but other peoples as well, to consummate a work, stupendous, magnificent, and altogether too arduous for this little handful of Saints to accomplish by and of themselves. . . .</i><br><br><i>All down the ages men bearing the authority of the Holy Priesthood--patriarchs, prophets, apostles and others, have officiated in the name of the Lord, doing the things that he required of them; and outside the</i> [limits] <i>of their activities other good and great men, not bearing the Priesthood, but possessing</i> [depth] <i>of thought, great wisdom, and a desire to uplift their fellows, have been sent by the Almighty into many nations, to give them, not the fulness of the Gospel, but that portion of truth that they were able to receive and wisely use.</i> [<i>CR,</i> April 1921, 32–33]<br><br>The First Presidency has clearly stated:<br><br><i>The great religious leaders of the world such as Mohammed, Confucius, and the Reformers, as well as philosophers including Socrates, Plato, and others, received a portion of God's light. Moral truths were given to them by God to enlighten whole nations and to bring a higher level of understanding to individuals.</i> [Statement of the First Presidency regarding God's Love for All Mankind, 15 February 1978; included in James E. Faust, "Communion with the Holy Spirit," <i>Ensign,</i> May 1980, 12]<br><br>The religion into which a person is born may be incomplete, but it can still serve as a foundation for the reception of the fulness of the gospel. We are wise when we show respect for the beliefs of others.<br><br>Just as we recognize and support the privilege of others to worship God Almighty according to their conscience, so we claim the right to declare our faith and our testimony of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ according to our beliefs:<br><br><i>We talk of Christ, we rejoice in Christ, we preach of Christ, we prophesy of Christ, and we write according to our prophecies, that our children may know to what source they may look for a remission of their sins.</i> [2 Nephi 25:26]<br><br>To share the message and the redemptive power of Christ and His Atonement with our friends and neighbors all over the world, we need to declare with courage and with clarity the events of 1820 and thereafter. These events, and the revelation that attended them, are what distinguish us from other religions and from any people with good intent.<br><br>The Restoration was foreseen by those with priesthood power and keys at the meridian of time. They understood why a restoration of truth and priesthood power would be necessary.<br><br>The Apostle Paul, writing from Corinth to the Saints in Thessalonica, prophesied:<br><br><i>Now we beseech you, brethren, by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, and by our gathering together unto him,</i><br><br><i>That ye be not soon shaken in mind, or be troubled, neither by spirit, nor by word, nor by letter as from us, as that the day of Christ is at hand.</i><br><br><i>Let no man deceive you by any means: for that day shall not come, except there come a falling away first.</i> [2 Thessalonians 2:1–3]<br><br>If Paul knew that there would be a falling away, surely Jesus knew. But while Jesus knew that the church He established during His mortal ministry would be lost, He still established a divine pattern because He also knew that future generations would be able to recognize the very same priesthood authority and structure when it was restored centuries later.<br><br>Eusebius, a historian of the Christian church in the fourth century, wrote about this divine pattern:<br><br><i>Our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, not very long after the commencement of his public ministry, elected the twelve, whom he called Apostles, by way of eminence over the rest of his disciples. He also appointed seventy others beside these, whom he sent, two and two, before him into every place and city whither he himself was about to go.</i> [Eusebius Pamphilus, <i>Ecclesiastical History,</i> trans. Christian Frederick Crusé (Grand Rapids, Michigan: Baker Book House, 1955), 40; book 1, chapter 10]<br><br>And Eusebius, quoting Hegesippus, also wrote about a falling away:<br><br><i>When the sacred choir of apostles became extinct, and the generation of those that had been privileged to hear their inspired wisdom had passed away, then also the combinations of </i>[immoral]<i> error arose by the fraud and delusions of false teachers. . . . As there was none of the apostles left, henceforth </i>[they]<i> attempted, without shame, to preach their false doctrine against the gospel of truth.</i> [Eusebius, <i>Ecclesiastical History,</i> 118; book 3, chapter 32]<br><br>Without the Prophet Joseph, we would still be in this same state of confusion and darkness. Some 1,500 years after Eusebius, Joseph found himself in the midst of a "war of words and tumult of opinions" about religion. He asked himself, "Who of all these parties are right?" "If any one of them be right, which is it, and how shall I know it?" (JS--H 1:10). Then he read James 1:5. And Joseph, this courageous 14-year-old, chose to "do as James directs, that is, ask of God" (JS--H 1:13).<br><br>Joseph went into the woods near his family home to offer his first vocal prayer to God. He had barely begun to offer up the desires of his heart when a power of darkness so overcame him that he could not speak (see JS--H 1:15). This was not an imaginary power but the power of some actual being from an unseen world trying to destroy him.<br><br>Joseph later testified:<br><br>[After] <i>exerting all my powers to call upon God . . . , I saw a pillar of light exactly over my head, above the brightness of the sun, which descended gradually until it fell upon me.</i><br><br><i>. . . When the light rested upon me I saw two Personages, whose brightness and glory defy all description, standing above me in the air. One of them spake unto me, calling me by name and said, pointing to the other--</i>This is My Beloved Son. Hear Him! [JS--H 1:16–17; emphasis in original]<br><br>From that day forward the heavens were open again. Joseph learned line upon line, precept upon precept. He studied the scriptures and he communed with angels. Apostles and prophets from ancient times came to confer on him sacred priesthood authority and keys. Heavenly messengers taught him the ordinances of everlasting life and the mysteries of the kingdom of God. Revelation flowed from on high.<br><br>Evidences of this revelation are many. Among them is the Book of Mormon, which Joseph Smith translated by the gift and power of God. Through him the Church of Jesus Christ was established again on the earth with the same structure and the same priesthood authority the Lord's Church had anciently.<br><br>In a revelation given in 1831 the Lord stated the reasons for this Restoration:<br><br><i>Wherefore, I the Lord, knowing the calamity which should come upon the inhabitants of the earth, called upon my servant Joseph Smith, Jun., and spake unto him from heaven, and gave him commandments;</i><br><br><i>And also gave commandments to others, that they should proclaim these things unto the world. . . .</i><br><br><i>That faith also might increase in the earth;</i><br><br><i>That mine everlasting covenant might be established;</i><br><br><i>That the fulness of my gospel might be proclaimed by the weak and the simple unto the ends of the world.</i> [D&amp;amp;C 1:17–18, 21–23]<br><br>Having the fulness of the gospel should not lead any of us to feel arrogant or harbor a holier-than-thou attitude. We should simply be grateful with all our heart for the truth restored and for the privilege of bringing this truth and these eternal blessings to our brothers and sisters.<br><br>What a great time to live in. We are living in the dispensation of the fulness of times. The gospel of Jesus Christ has been restored. Future generations will look upon you with gratitude and appreciation for how you used your opportunities.<br><br>Do not fear! Trust the Lord! Be courageous! Seek learning! Have faith!<br><br>Brothers and sisters, let us never be ashamed to testify of this wonderful Restoration, the restored gospel of Jesus Christ, "for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth" (Romans 1:16).<br><br>Let us never be ashamed to testify that Joseph Smith was a true prophet of God and that we have a living prophet today.<br><br>The keys of the kingdom of God have been restored again, and they are held by apostles of the Lord Jesus Christ. The president of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, who is the senior apostle, holds all the keys necessary to preside over all the organizational and ordinance work of the Church. President Gordon B. Hinckley has this authority today. He stands as the prophet of God--the most recent in an unbroken succession of prophets and apostles from Joseph Smith to our own day. This is my apostolic witness of the reality of the Restoration and the truthfulness of this great work.<br><br>May God bless you and your loved ones, today and always, I pray, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Dieter F.

<h1>of Learning: BYU&#039;s Accreditation Report- BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I consider it a great privilege to welcome you to our Annual University Conference. For those of you who are with us for the first time, we extend a hearty welcome and hope that you will also be with us every late August as we prepare for another exciting academic year. For those who have retired, but still return, a special thanks to you for your loyalty to and continued interest in BYU. For those of you who have been with us for a season and expect to be here for yet another year or several years, let me thank you for all you do. I have been here long enough now to have an appreciation for what a wonderful institution this is and for the many significant and diverse contributions made broadly across campus by so many. This enables BYU, in large part, to be such a remarkable university.<br><br>I suspect that many of you have been thinking about some of the same things that I have been considering over the summer and even before. Today I will have the privilege of sharing some of my musings, observations, and suggestions, and I hope that you will also find ways to share your own as we move forward. Although I am still in the relatively early days, I hope, of my presidency, this is my fourth Annual University Conference. My first year here I focused on a number of questions that had been asked of me or had occurred to me and gave the best answers that I could at the time. Two years ago I focused on the notion that BYU is a changing university in a changing world and suggested some opportunities and realities that we have faced and do face. Last year I entitled my remarks "The BYU Way" and discussed some of the unique dimensions of our quest to become the best that we can be as we have been charged by President Hinckley.<br><br>Candidly, I don't expect that you will be able to remember much of anything I said on those occasions. In fact, I needed to look in my files to refresh my own memory of what I have said when. I mention these previous messages because they have been somewhat of a measuring rod for me personally in trying to determine whether or not we are having any success in terms of both direction and rate in our quest to become what we are expected to be. I do believe we are making progress--some of which is very significant and for which I am grateful. I also believe that we have much to do and much yet to achieve and become. I voice this sentiment because I feel we are in a somewhat tenuous and yet very important and positive position.<br><br>We are receiving the acclaim of the world in a number of areas--for which we are appreciative. At the same time, we cannot afford to become complacent or satisfied because there is so much more that we can do and must do if we are to be fully faithful to the charge and confidence placed in us. In general, people at BYU work very hard. This is true of the students, the faculty, the staff, and even the administration. I believe we do much better in terms of effort than do most other institutions, even some very fine ones.<br><br>I think we would not be classified by anyone who knows us in the same way as was the case when a distinguished leader of a large organization was asked a question by a curious foreign guest who was visiting the high-rise headquarters office building of the large and complex organization.<br><br>The query was, "How many people work in this building?"<br><br>The answer the hosting leader gave--only partly in jest--was, "About half of them."<br><br>Although I suppose that all of us can profit from time to time from analyzing our own situations and determining if in some ways we might work harder, I would suggest that at BYU it would usually be much more productive and much more realistic to ask how we might work smarter or work more effectively or contribute more clearly to our stated mission and responsibilities. The Savior identified this notion when He admonished the scribes and Pharisees to pay more attention to "the weightier matters." Let me share the verse:<br><br><i>Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye pay tithe of mint and anise and cummin, and have omitted the weightier matters of the law, judgment, mercy, and faith: these ought ye to have done, and not to leave the other undone.</i> [Matthew 23:23]<br><br>Now I am not aware that we have either scribes or Pharisees at BYU, and I certainly hope that we have no hypocrites. I do believe, however, that we must be constantly alert to and focus on "the weightier matters" in our important work. Incidentally, on occasion this verse is quoted in part by those who wish to violate the Honor Code or choose not to fulfill some of their seemingly "lighter" obligations. We must remember as Jesus called attention to "the weightier matters," He also declared that we must not "leave the other undone."<br><br>In the spirit of focusing on the weightier matters, let me share for your consideration my view of BYU as "a house of learning" (D&amp;amp;C 88:119) within the context of our unique environment and special situation.<br><br>First, BYU is an extraordinary university in part because of the board of trustees, to whom we look for direction and from whom we receive the core of our very substantial support. Because we understand that the officers of the board are the First Presidency of the Church and the other members of the board are General Authorities and general officers, we sustain them as they support us. Because we are led by prophets and apostles who teach us correct principles, we acknowledge and try to follow the counsel and guidance we receive. We also understand that they teach us correct principles but expect us--each of us--to be wise in governing ourselves and in making correct decisions as we formulate the specific applications in our individual duties as a true reflection of the general principles that govern us. Our board is very clear in general guidelines and direction but delegates to us the specific implementation of policy and procedure in the classroom, laboratory, or office.<br><br>As I have mentioned before, one of the truly noteworthy and unique characteristics of almost everyone at BYU is that you not only sustain the mission of BYU in serving the students with whom we interact but you also place that emphasis at a higher priority than you do advancing your own careers or personal opportunities in your individual disciplines. I believe there is common agreement at BYU that we all desire and aspire to be as good as our increasingly faithful and capable students. Because of our agreement that we are ultimately all about the growth and development of our students, it helps us cooperate in significant ways that are not typical on other campuses.<br><br>A clear manifestation of this understanding and cooperation was demonstrated again by the tremendous effort and goodwill of so many across campus during our spring and summer strategic resource planning process. We know the sacred funds that come to BYU are a shared stewardship and responsibility to be used for the best common good. These monies, representing a large portion of the tithing funds contributed by faithful Church members around the world, are generously provided by our leaders with great stability over extended periods of time. Because all funds that come to the university are considered sacred, the same goodwill and care also apply to the allocation of contributed and donated resources.<br><br>Second, we as a campus community take seriously the injunction of President Hinckley to make BYU the best it can be. This charge from our prophet and board chairman is understood broadly to mean not only the university as an institution but also for each of us individually, whatever our role or responsibility is at BYU.<br><br>As I have said before, I am persuaded that making BYU the best it can be involves continued prioritizing and focusing. I hope and believe that most of you share my view that we must always be looking for better ways to accomplish our work and our responsibilities. To say "we've always done it that way" is insufficient reason to do old things in old ways. We won't be better until we learn to do better.<br><br>In this context we are also asked to decide what programs or activities we must stop or discontinue if we are to add new or needed others. Admittedly, it is always easier to add to the load than it is to delete something that might still have some utility or be the favorite "child" of part of our community. I am reminded of the statement of a frustrated fictional student in a British novel of the past century. As this student struggled to cram into his memory all of the facts he thought he would need to pass an important examination along the path to his chosen career, he said: "My mind is just like my grandmother's attic--filled with things no longer useful but too good to throw away." I fear that it is not just our individual minds or our grandmothers' attics that are burdened with things "too good to throw away." We must not allow such things to prevent the inclusion of new ideas or activities that will be essential if we are to reach the potential expected of us here at BYU.<br><br>Because so many are working so hard, it seems to me that we may need to adjust to the idea of learning to do fewer things but doing them better than we ever have before. This is not a new idea at BYU. President Holland spoke of it in the 1980s, and others have as well. While certainly not easy and often very arduous, I believe we can accomplish these things as we hone a greater sense of our responsibilities within BYU and the place BYU has within the kingdom.<br><br>This spirit and approach are already evident in the significant internal reallocation of resources accomplished at every level of the university, not only during strategic resource planning but regularly throughout the year. But there is more for us to do--much more--at all levels of BYU. This is particularly true as we seek to accelerate the pace and focus of fulfilling President Hinckley's injunction and meeting the prophetic predictions made by others since the beginning days of this wonderful institution.<br><br>Third, part of making BYU the best it can be is to be true to our mission, aims, and objectives. This means documenting our educational quality and our commitment to effective and continuous improvement in ways and in terms those outside the university can understand and those responsible for accreditation require. We do these things not only because of who we are but also to be sure that we provide our students and our institution the important benefits of being an accredited university.<br><br>In this regard I am pleased to announce that as of July 26, 2006, the Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities (NWCCU) officially notified BYU that the "accreditation of Brigham Young University has been reaffirmed on the basis of the spring 2006 comprehensive evaluation visit."<sup>1</sup> The commission extended "congratulations on receiving this continued recognition."<br><br>At the July 13, 2006, NWCCU meeting at Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, and in its NWCCU full-scale evaluation report, Chancellor Stephen Reno, chair, and the NWCCU evaluation team expressed gratitude for the "kindness, sincerity, and readiness to help" and the "warm and generous hospitality extended to it by all members of the BYU community." "We acknowledge and express appreciation," the commission said, "to all who planned and executed the myriad arrangements needed to support our work--from those who directed the study process through those who drove the vans." Way to go, Ron Clark and our campus hosting colleagues and students! And way to go, Gerrit Gong, who shepherded, guided, and facilitated this entire process.<br><br>Please also join in expressing appreciation to our President's Council and to our Accreditation Executive Committee members--Doug Belliston, Ron Chapman, Doug Christensen, Newell Dayley, Julie Franklin, Steve Hite, Scott Howell, Carri Jenkins, Gary Kramer, Kelly McDonald, Danny Olsen, Randy Olsen, J. B. Ostlund, Ole Smith, Ford Stevenson, Ron Terry, and Richard Williams--for organizing and representing us all so well.<br><br>The NWCCU complimented BYU "on the uncommonly large number of persons who were engaged in the self-study process, a number far larger than most of the committee had known at other institutions." As listed in our self-study documents, some 275 faculty, staff, students, and administrators participated in one or more capacities in the nine standard working groups and campus focus groups and in many other ways.<br><br>The NWCCU praised BYU's self-study. "Without question," the commission report states, "great care and effort went into the preparation of the [BYU] self-study report. The product is beautifully presented, formatted . . . , and included at the end of each section a 'Summary' that sets out strengths as well as challenges and opportunities."<br><br>Such accomplishments do not just happen. Please thank Scott Howell, chair of the Accreditation Production Committee, and Larry Morris, chair of the Accreditation Editorial Committee, and their dedicated committees and associates for long, late, and creative hours.<br><br>As part of the usual reaffirmation of the accreditation process, the university received commendations and recommendations. What was not usual, according to Chairman Reno, was that we received more commendations than are typically given and fewer recommendations. In the aggregate, then, these descriptions of the NWCCU's view of BYU were very positive and in recognition of good work and progress.<br><br>BYU received commendations in six areas: (1) the design and maintenance of its buildings and grounds; (2) the strength of the McKay School of Education's Educator Preparation Program for future teachers; (3) the institutional support for the Lee and Hunter libraries; (4) the effective use of information technology; (5) the significant mentoring and research opportunities available for undergraduate students; and (6) BYU's exemplary commitment to foreign language instruction. Congratulations and appreciation to all who contribute so much in each of these areas of commendation.<br><br>Within the body of the long and complex final report submitted by the visiting evaluation team and accepted by the NWCCU were found many other compliments and obvious strengths throughout the university. One very senior academic administrator from a large and prominent midwestern state university who was part of the visiting team mused that he wished he could find a way to have his institution leave their state system of higher education and become part of the LDS Church education system!<br><br>As would be expected, BYU also received NWCCU recommendations, including one regarding the identification and publication of expected learning outcomes. The NWCCU offered its recommendations in a spirit of constructive collegiality. Wrote the NWCCU evaluation team: "We committee members have also benefitted enormously from the opportunity to 'compare notes' with colleagues [at BYU] regarding both the timely as well as the perennial challenges of higher education." We will discuss specific recommendations at later academic meetings, but here let me put the learning outcome recommendation in the broader context.<br><br>You may be aware of ongoing national discussions being conducted under the auspices of the Spellings Commission, named for U.S. Secretary of Education Margaret Spellings. The Spellings Commission draft report states its interest in "clear, reliable information about the cost and quality of postsecondary institutions" and better "accountability mechanisms to ensure that colleges succeed in educating students."<sup>2</sup> Several members of Congress, various organizations representing the nation's colleges and universities, and others wishing to represent their views of the broader public interest have also vigorously entered the dialogue. It is obvious to me that accrediting agencies, including the NWCCU, are paying close attention to these developments with their attendant pressures.<br><br>Given the ongoing as well as immediate importance of documenting learning outcomes and other continuing university academic priorities, I have asked John Tanner and Gerrit Gong to cochair a university advisory task committee to (a) identify and publish expected learning outcomes, (b) provide evidence for their accomplishment, and (c) assure documentation that these assessments are improving learning and teaching. Because we are asked to provide the results of these endeavors for each program across the entire university, we are taking this activity very seriously and invite all of the campus community to do so as well.<br><br>We want these measurable outcomes to be those our BYU graduates can demonstrate to their greatest benefit. We also want to move both deliberately and quickly according to a timetable that will include focusing our fall college visits on inviting students and faculty to describe how they achieve their stated program outcomes and how that process improves learning and teaching.<br><br>In the weeks ahead I plan to say more about two other university advisory task committees I have asked Jim Gordon and Gerrit Gong and Brian Evans and Gerrit Gong to cochair as part of our efforts to make BYU the best we can be. Happily, these efforts--including an ongoing focus on demonstrating achievement of the outcomes we really seek for our students, faculty, and programs--will contribute to BYU becoming even more than it is today the ideal "house of learning" that is our opportunity and responsibility.<br><br>Let me conclude this section of my remarks by saying again how pleased we are by the reaffirmation of Brigham Young University's institutional accreditation by our regional accrediting agency, the Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities, and by thanking again each of those in our BYU community who contributed to this important outcome. Let me also express appreciation to all who will continue with us in the months and years ahead on this quest, which is not only important for accreditation by our regional agency but also is vital for an even more important and significant accreditation that ultimately comes from the heavens.<br><br>During this Annual University Conference we will focus on the phrase and theme "a house of learning" with the hope that we can bring BYU--as solid as it already is and has been over the years--even closer to the Lord's definition. As I have watched Brigham Young University from a distance for most of my life and on-site for these past few years, it has been apparent that the wonderful 88th section of the Doctrine and Covenants has been one of the most oft-quoted scriptural, constitutional statements used by our leaders to instruct, to inspire, and, on occasion, to correct us in our quest to fulfill our prophetic role and charge. You will have your favorite verses, and there are many. I will share just a few and then conclude with some that may not seem at first glance to be as educationally directed as those that we quote more often.<br><br>First, two verses that place our theme in context:<br><br><i>And as all have not faith, seek ye diligently and teach one another words of wisdom; yea, seek ye out of the best books words of wisdom; seek learning, even by study and also by faith.</i><br><br><i>Organize yourselves; prepare every needful thing; and establish a house, even a house of prayer, a house of fasting, a house of faith, a house of learning, a house of glory, a house of order, a house of God.</i> [D&amp;amp;C 88:118–19]<br><br>The direction and implications for each of us individually and for BYU institutionally seem clear and high-reaching. Next, three other very familiar verses:<br><br><i>And I give unto you a commandment that you shall teach one another the doctrine of the kingdom.</i><br><br><i>Teach ye diligently and my grace shall attend you, that you may be instructed more perfectly in theory, in principle, in doctrine, in the law of the gospel, in all things that pertain unto the kingdom of God, that are expedient for you to understand;</i><br><br><i>Of things both in heaven and in the earth, and under the earth; things which have been, things which are, things which must shortly come to pass; things which are at home, things which are abroad; the wars and the perplexities of the nations, and the judgments which are on the land; and a knowledge also of countries and of kingdoms.</i> [D&amp;amp;C 88:77–79]<br><br>For those who might think that the NWCCU has high standards and expectations, think of the requirements of the Ultimate Accrediting Agency! Of course there are many other important insights and inspiration to be mined from this section. I'll leave it to you to find them, to understand them, and to incorporate them into your lives.<br><br>Let me share a perspective that probably does not apply universally across the higher education landscape but most certainly should be central to what we do at BYU. Most consider a fundamental role of higher education to be broadening the thinking, knowledge, and understanding of those in the university. With that we wholeheartedly agree.<br><br>Some good and honorable people believe that the only way this added enlightenment can happen is through conflict and controversy. While we fully acknowledge the need to challenge ideas, listen to and understand the perspective of others, and be willing to change ourselves and our views when we gain insights not previously achieved, we are also committed to the notion that it is not necessary to have animosity to create change, nor acrimony to accomplish learning. In our quest to build, strengthen, and be part of "a house of learning" where we accomplish our work "by study and also by faith," we acknowledge and proclaim that often there is a better way.<br><br>In the heading of section 88, this revelation is described as "the Lord's message of peace to us." Even in the university, and particularly at BYU, we need to heed the Lord's message of peace and do what we can to bring it about. By this we mean both collective peace in terms of how we respect and treat each other and also individual peace that comes with the conviction that our lives have congruence with the values we hold dear. Listen to these words of the Lord from this most instructive section:<br><br><i>Wherefore, I now send upon you another Comforter, even upon you my friends, that it may abide in your hearts, even the Holy Spirit of promise; which other Comforter is the same that I promised unto my disciples, as is recorded in the testimony of John.</i> [D&amp;amp;C 88:3]<br><br>Let me now refer to the Savior's words in John that speak to this point:<br><br><i>If ye love me, keep my commandments.</i><br><br><i>And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever;</i><br><br><i>Even the Spirit of truth; whom the world cannot receive, because it seeth him not, neither knoweth him: but ye know him; for he dwelleth with you, and shall be in you.</i><br><br><i>I will not leave you comfortless: I will come to you.</i> [John 14:15–18]<br><br>What a great and magnificent promise and blessing to have the Holy Ghost or First Comforter to be our companion and guide in our quest for enlightenment and understanding in the "house of learning." And what a marvelous goal and promise to have the Second Comforter, even the Lord, Jesus Christ Himself, become part of our lives. With these Comforters, our avenues for learning are expanded greatly and our comfort is increased with the assurance that what we are learning is that which is really most important. What a great privilege to be able to combine the best of the spiritual and the secular in such a special way and in such a special place as is BYU.<br><br>As we strive to master the material of our disciplines and assist our tremendous students in meeting their academic goals and objectives, we must never forget that it is at BYU where we are able and expected to meld our developing discipleship with our growing educational competence. It is also at BYU where we are able to achieve the peace the Lord has promised us in the midst of the turmoil and confusion of the world and even the disconcerting challenges of our university demands.<br><br>Although we often, like Nephi, must confess, "I do not know the meaning of all things" (1 Nephi 11:17), we can with assurance agree with the words of the hymn by Mary Ann Morton. Let me read a few stanzas and ask that you liken these sentiments unto yourselves and your own situations here at BYU.<br><br><i>Sweet is the peace the gospel brings</i><br><br><i>To seeking minds and true.</i><br><br><i>With light refulgent on its wings</i><br><br><i>It clears the human view.</i><br><br><i>Its laws and precepts are divine</i><br><br><i>And show a Father's care.</i><br><br><i>Transcendent love and mercy shine</i><br><br><i>In each injunction there.</i><br><br><i>Faithless tradition flees its pow'r,</i><br><br><i>And unbelief gives way.</i><br><br><i>The gloomy clouds, which used to low'r,</i><br><br><i>Submit to reason's sway.</i><br><br><i>May we who know the sacred Name</i><br><br><i>From every sin depart.</i><br><br><i>Then will the Spirit's constant flame</i><br><br><i>Preserve us pure in heart.</i><br><br><i>. . .</i><br><br><i>That which we have in part received</i><br><br><i>Will be in part no more,</i><br><br><i>For he in whom we all believe</i><br><br><i>To us will all restore.</i><sup>3</sup><br><br>My dear brothers and sisters, colleagues and associates, what a unique and special opportunity we have to live and work in surroundings that allow and even stimulate us to do our very best intellectually and also challenge us to develop our faith and spiritual strength under the sponsorship of heaven. It is this dual quest that ultimately is the same unified goal that should inspire us, enliven us, and encourage us, for "the glory of God is intelligence, or, in other words, light and truth" (D&amp;amp;C 93:36).<br><br>As we deal with challenges and opportunities--both vexing and exciting, both proximate and more distant--let us consider the counsel of the Apostle Paul to his young associate Timothy. Each of us serving as faculty, staff, administrators, Church leaders, or in any capacity with our marvelous students have young people looking to us for counsel and for reliable examples after which to model their own lives. Paul's words, in my judgment, are cogently current and directly targeted to each of us. Said he:<br><br><i>Take heed unto thyself, and unto the doctrine; continue in them: for in doing this thou shalt both save thyself, and them that hear thee.</i> [1 Timothy 4:16]<br><br>We are here not only to "save" ourselves--meaning to advance our careers, accomplish our personal and academic goals, and increase our individual spirituality--but we are also here to do the same for all of our students, however it is and in whatever ways they hear us.<br><br>Thank you all for being with us today and every day. Thank you for your devoted and capable service, without which we would all be the poorer. Thank you for being worthy of the great trust placed in your hands to nurture, teach, encourage, bless, and help in every appropriate way our wonderful students. You are making sacrifices to be here, but you are also reaping blessings that could not be obtained anywhere else.<br><br>May God bless us all, individually and collectively, to be equal to the daunting challenges before us. May we be worthy of, and achieve, the peace in our lives promised by the Prince of Peace Himself as we do our very best in this next exciting year of progress at Brigham Young University, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Cecil O.

<br>
<br>
I am grateful for the lovely music and for the Spirit that it has brought. I am grateful for this opportunity to be with you this evening. Many of you are here in the Marriott Center at Brigham Young University. There are thousands more listening and watching at locations across the world. I cannot see all of you, but your Heavenly Father can. He knows your name and your needs. He knows your heart. Each of you has unique challenges. I pray that I may be inspired to say the words He would have you hear.<br><h2><b>Blessings and Challenges of the Last Days</b></h2><br>With all of our uniqueness, we all have some things in common. We are all in the probationary test of mortality. And, wherever we live, that test will become increasingly difficult. We are in the last dispensation of time. God's prophets have seen these times for millennia. They saw that wonderful things were to happen. There was to be a restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ. The true Church was to be brought back with prophets and apostles. The gospel was to be taken to every nation, kindred, tongue, and people. Most marvelous of all, the true Church and its members are to become worthy for the coming of the Savior to His Church and to His purified disciples.<br><br>But the true prophets also saw that in the last days Satan would rage. There would be wars and rumors of wars. That would inspire fear. The courage of many would fail. There would be great wickedness. And Satan would deceive many.<br><br>Yet, happily, many would not be overcome. And many would not be deceived. The fact that you are here listening tonight is evidence that you want to be among those who will not be overcome and will not be deceived. My purpose is to teach you how you can reach that happy and glorious goal.<br><h2><b>The Holy Ghost Is the Key</b></h2><br>The key for each of us will be to accept and hold the gift we have been promised by God. You who are members of the true Church of Jesus Christ will remember that, after you were baptized, authorized servants of God promised you that you could receive the Holy Ghost. Some of you may have felt something happen when that ordinance was performed. Most of you have felt the effects of that promise being fulfilled in your lives. I will tell you tonight how to recognize that gift, how to receive it every day in your life, and how it will bless you in the days ahead.<br><br>You have felt the quiet confirmation in your heart and mind that something was true. And you knew that it was inspiration from God. For some of you it may have come as the missionaries taught you before your baptism. It may have come during a talk or lesson in church. It may have come already tonight when something that was true was said or sung, as I felt when I heard the singing, as some of you did. The Holy Ghost is the Spirit of Truth. You feel peace, hope, and joy when it speaks to your heart and mind that something is true. Almost always I have also felt a sensation of light. Any feeling I may have had of darkness is dispelled. And the desire to do right grows.<br><br>The Lord promised that having those experiences would be true for you. Here are His words, recorded in the Doctrine and Covenants:<br><br><i>And now, verily, verily, I say unto thee, put your trust in that Spirit which leadeth to do good--yea, to do justly, to walk humbly, to judge righteously; and this is my Spirit.</i><br><br><i>Verily, verily, I say unto you, I will impart unto you of my Spirit, which shall enlighten your mind, which shall fill your soul with joy.</i> [D&amp;amp;C 11:12–13]<br><br>The Lord also promised that those who have accepted the gift of the Holy Ghost in their lives would not be deceived. He spoke reassuringly to you and to me, who live in the times when the Church is being made ready for the time when He comes again. Here is the promise from the Doctrine and Covenants:<br><br><i>And at that day, when I shall come in my glory, shall the parable be fulfilled which I spake concerning the ten virgins.</i><br><br><i>For they that are wise and have received the truth, and have taken the Holy Spirit for their guide, and have not been deceived--verily I say unto you, they shall not be hewn down and cast into the fire, but shall abide the day.</i><br><br><i>And the earth shall be given unto them for an inheritance; and they shall multiply and wax strong, and their children shall grow up without sin unto salvation.</i><br><br><i>For the Lord shall be in their midst, and his glory shall be upon them, and he will be their king and their lawgiver.</i> [D&amp;amp;C 45:56–59]<br><h2><b>Manifestations of the Spirit</b></h2><br>As you heard those words just now, you may have felt another instance of receiving a manifestation of the Spirit that you have been promised. Those words paint a picture of the day when we may be with the Savior, who spoke of the ten virgins and of His coming again--only this time in glory. And they describe a day when we might be with Him and have His glory upon us. Of all the things to which the Holy Ghost testifies, and which you may have just felt, none is more precious to us than that Jesus is the Christ, the living Son of God. And nothing is so likely to make us feel light, hope, and joy. Then it is not surprising that when we feel the influence of the Holy Ghost, we also can feel that our natures are being changed because of the Atonement of Jesus Christ. We feel an increased desire to keep His commandments, to do good, and to deal justly.<br><br>Many of you have felt that effect from your frequent experiences with the Holy Ghost. For instance, in the mission field some of you had to rely on the Spirit to have the words to teach what the people needed. More than once, and perhaps every day, you had the blessing that Nephi and Lehi had among the people in their mission, described in Helaman:<br><br><i>And it came to pass that Nephi and Lehi did preach unto the Lamanites with such great power and authority, for they had power and authority given unto them that they might speak, and they also had what they should speak given unto them--</i><br><br><i>Therefore they did speak unto the great astonishment of the Lamanites, to the convincing them, insomuch that there were eight thousand of the Lamanites who were in the land of Zarahemla and round about baptized unto repentance, and were convinced of the wickedness of the traditions of their fathers.</i> [Helaman 5:18–19]<br><br>Although you may not have been blessed with so miraculous a harvest, you have been given words by the Holy Ghost when you surrendered your heart to the Lord's service. At certain periods of your mission, such an experience came often. If you will think back on those times and ponder, you will also remember that the increase in your desire to obey the commandments came over you gradually. You felt less and less the tug of temptation. You felt more and more the desire to be obedient and to serve others. You felt a greater love for the people.<br><br>One of the effects of receiving a manifestation of the Holy Ghost repeatedly was that your nature changed. And so, from that faithful service to the Master, you had not only the witness of the Holy Ghost that Jesus is the Christ but you saw evidence in your own life that the Atonement is real. Such service, which brings the influence of the Holy Ghost, is an example of planting the seed, which Alma described:<br><br><i>And now, behold, because ye have tried the experiment, and planted the seed, and it swelleth and sprouteth, and beginneth to grow, ye must needs know that the seed is good.</i><br><br><i>And now, behold, is your knowledge perfect? Yea, your knowledge is perfect in that thing, and your faith is dormant; and this because you know, for ye know that the word hath swelled your souls, and ye also know that it hath sprouted up, that your understanding doth begin to be enlightened, and your mind doth begin to expand.</i><br><br><i>O then, is not this real? I say unto you, Yea, because it is light; and whatsoever is light, is good, because it is discernible, therefore ye must know that it is good; and now behold, after ye have tasted this light is your knowledge perfect?</i><br><br><i>Behold I say unto you, Nay; neither must ye lay aside your faith, for ye have only exercised your faith to plant the seed that ye might try the experiment to know if the seed was good.</i><br><br><i>And behold, as the tree beginneth to grow, ye will say: Let us nourish it with great care, that it may get root, that it may grow up, and bring forth fruit unto us. And now behold, if ye nourish it with much care it will get root, and grow up, and bring forth fruit.</i> [Alma 32:33–37]<br><h2><b>Receiving Revelations Daily</b></h2><br>Now, if you and I were visiting alone (I wish we could be), where you felt free to ask whatever you wanted to ask, I can imagine your saying something like this: "Oh, Brother Eyring, I've felt some of the things you have described. The Holy Ghost has touched my heart and mind from time to time. But I will need it consistently if I am not to be overcome or deceived. Is that possible? Is it possible, and, if it is, what will it take to receive that blessing?"<br><br>Well, let's start with the first part of your question. Yes, it is possible. Whenever I need that reassurance--and I need it from time to time too--I remember two brothers. Nephi and Lehi, and the other servants of the Lord laboring with them, faced fierce opposition. They were serving in an increasingly wicked world. They had to deal with terrible deceptions. So I take courage--and so can you--from the words in this one verse of Helaman. The reassurance is tucked into the account of all that happened in an entire year, almost as if to the writer it was not surprising. Listen:<br><br><i>And in the seventy and ninth year there began to be much strife. But it came to pass that Nephi and Lehi, and many of their brethren who knew concerning the true points of doctrine, having many revelations daily, therefore they did preach unto the people, insomuch that they did put an end to their strife in that same year.</i> [Helaman 11:23]<br><br>They had "many revelations daily." So, for you and for me, that answers your first question. Yes, it is possible to have the companionship of the Holy Ghost sufficiently to have many revelations daily. It will not be easy. But it is possible. What it will require will be different for each person because we start from where we are in our unique set of experiences in life. For all of us there will be at least three requirements. None of them can be gained and retained from a single experience. All of them must be constantly renewed.<br><h2><b>Faith in God</b></h2><br>First, receiving the Holy Ghost takes faith in our Heavenly Father and in His Beloved Son, Jesus Christ. A memory of a great spiritual experience some time ago, where you had confirmed to you that truth, won't be sufficient. You will need to be sure of your faith in the moment of crisis, which may come at any time day or night, when you plead for the influence of the Spirit. You must then be unshaken in your confidence that God lives, that He hears your cry for help, and that the resurrected Savior will do for you what He promised to do for His servants in His mortal ministry. You remember:<br><br><i>But when the Comforter is come, whom I will send unto you from the Father, even the Spirit of truth, which proceedeth from the Father, he shall testify of me.</i> [John 15:26]<br><br>The brothers Nephi and Lehi received many revelations daily. The record shows that they knew concerning the true points of doctrine. Of all the true doctrine, nothing is more important to you and me than the true nature of God the Father and His Son, Jesus Christ. For that I return again and again to the scriptures. For that I return again and again to prayer. For that I return again and again to partaking of the sacrament. And, above all, I come to know God and Jesus Christ best by keeping the commandments and serving in the Church. By diligent service in the Church we come not only to know the character of God but to love Him. If we follow His commands, our faith in Him will grow and we may then qualify to have His Spirit to be with us.<br><br>Vibrant faith in God comes best from serving Him regularly. Not all of us have received callings to offices in the Church. Some of you may not yet be called to something in a formal way, yet every member has a multitude of opportunities to serve God. For instance, for years we have heard the phrase "every member a missionary." That is not a choice. It is a fact of our membership. Our choice is to speak to others about the gospel or not. Similarly, each member is to care for the poor among us and around us. Some of that we do privately and alone. Some we do together with other members. That is why we have fast offerings and service projects. Our choice is to decide whether to join with the Lord and His other disciples in our day as He and His disciples did during His mortal ministry.<br><br>Most of us have or may have callings as home and visiting teachers. There is in those callings great opportunity to grow in faith that the Lord sends the Holy Ghost to His humble servants. That builds faith and renews our faith in Him. I've seen it and so have many of you. I received a phone call from a distraught mother in a state far away from where I was. She told me that her unmarried daughter had moved to another city far from her home. She sensed from the little contact she had with her daughter that something was terribly wrong. The mother feared for the moral safety of her daughter. She pleaded with me to help her daughter.<br><br>I found out who the daughter's home teacher was. I called him. He was young. And yet he and his companion both had been awakened in the night with not only concern for the girl but with inspiration that she was about to make choices that would bring sadness and misery. With only the inspiration of the Spirit, they went to see her. She did not at first want to tell them anything about her situation. They pleaded with her to repent and to choose to follow the path that the Lord had set out for her and that her mother and father had taught her to follow. She realized as she listened that the only way they could have known what they knew about her life was from God. A mother's prayer had gone to Heavenly Father, and the Holy Ghost had been sent to home teachers with an errand.<br><br>More than once I have heard priesthood leaders say that they had been inspired to go to someone in need, only to find the visiting teacher or the home teacher had already been there. My wife, who is here with me tonight, is an example. We had a bishop once who said to me, "You know, it bothers me--when I get an inspiration to go to someone, your wife has already been there." Your faith will grow as you serve the Lord in caring for Heavenly Father's children as the Lord's teacher to their home. You will have your prayers answered. You will come to know for yourself that He lives, that He loves us, and that He sends inspiration to those with even the beginnings of faith in Him and with the desire to serve Him in His Church. Stay close to the Church if you want your faith in God to grow. And as it grows, so will your ability to claim the promise you were given that you can receive the gifts of the Spirit.<br><h2><b>Requirement to Be Clean</b></h2><br>The first requirement was faith in the Lord Jesus Christ and in our Heavenly Father. A second requirement for frequent companionship and direction from the Holy Ghost is to be clean. The Spirit must withdraw from those who are not clean. You remember the sad illustration of that in the history of the people in the Book of Mormon:<br><br><i>And because of their iniquity the church had begun to dwindle; and they began to disbelieve in the spirit of prophecy and in the spirit of revelation; and the judgments of God did stare them in the face.</i><br><br><i>And they saw that they had become weak, like unto their brethren, the Lamanites, and that the Spirit of the Lord did no more preserve them; yea, it had withdrawn from them because the Spirit of the Lord doth not dwell in unholy temples.</i> [Helaman 4:23–24]<br><br>The path to receiving the Holy Ghost is to exercise faith in Christ unto repentance. We can become clean through qualifying for the effects of the Savior's Atonement. The covenants offered in baptism by authorized servants of God bring that cleansing. We renew our pledge to keep those covenants each time we partake of the sacrament. And the peace we all seek is the assurance that we have received forgiveness for our sins of omission or commission.<br><br>The Savior is the one who has been given the right to grant that forgiveness and to give that assurance. I have learned that the Lord gives that assurance at the time He chooses, and He does it in His own way. And I have learned to ask for it in prayer. One way He grants that assurance is through the Holy Ghost. If you have difficulty in feeling the Holy Ghost, you might wisely ponder whether there is anything for which you need to repent and receive forgiveness.<br><br>If you have felt the influence of the Holy Ghost during this day, or even this evening, you may take it as evidence that the Atonement is working in your life. For that reason and many others, you would do well to put yourself in places and in tasks that invite the promptings of the Holy Ghost. Feeling the influence of the Holy Ghost works both ways: the Holy Ghost only dwells in a clean temple, and the reception of the Holy Ghost cleanses us through the Atonement of Jesus Christ. You can pray with faith to know what to do to be cleansed and thus qualified for the companionship of the Holy Ghost and the service of the Lord. And with that companionship you will be strengthened against temptation and empowered to detect deception.<br><h2><b>Pure Motive</b></h2><br>A third requirement for the companionship of the Holy Ghost is pure motive. If you want to receive the gifts of the Spirit, you have to want them for the right reasons. Your purposes must be the Lord's purposes. To the degree your motives are selfish, you will find it difficult to receive those gifts of the Spirit that have been promised to you.<br><br>That fact serves both as a warning and as helpful instruction. First, the warning: God is offended when we seek the gifts of the Spirit for our own purposes rather than for His. Our selfish motives may not be obvious to us. But few of us would be so blind as the man who sought to purchase the right to the gifts of the Spirit. You remember the sad story of a man named Simon and of Peter's rebuke:<br><br><i>And when Simon saw that through laying on of the apostles' hands the Holy Ghost was given, he offered them money,</i><br><br><i>Saying, Give me also this power, that on whomsoever I lay hands, he may receive the Holy Ghost.</i><br><br><i>But Peter said unto him, Thy money perish with thee, because thou hast thought that the gift of God may be purchased with money.</i><br><br><i>Thou hast neither part nor lot in this matter: for thy heart is not right in the sight of God.</i><br><br><i>Repent therefore of this thy wickedness, and pray God, if perhaps the thought of thine heart may be forgiven thee.</i><br><br><i>For I perceive that thou art in the gall of bitterness, and in the bond of iniquity.</i><br><br><i>Then answered Simon, and said, Pray ye to the Lord for me, that none of these things which ye have spoken come upon me.</i> [Acts 8:18–24]<br><br>Apparently Simon recognized his own corrupt motives. It may not be so easy for each of us. We almost always have more than one motive at a time. And some may be mixtures of what God wants as well as what we want. It is not easy to pull them apart.<br><br>For instance, consider yourself on the eve of a school examination or an interview for a new job. You know that the direction of the Holy Ghost could be of great help. I know from my own experience, for example, that the Holy Ghost knows some of the mathematical equations used to solve problems in thermodynamics, a branch of the sciences. I was a struggling physics student studying in a book that I still own. I keep it for historical and spiritual reasons. Halfway down a page (I could even show you where it is on the page), in the middle of some mathematics, I had a clear confirmation that what I was reading was true. It was exactly the feeling I had had come to me before as I pondered the Lord's scriptures and that I have had many times since. So I knew that the Holy Ghost understood whatever was true in what I might be asked on an examination in thermodynamics.<br><br>You can imagine that I was tempted to ask God to send me the Holy Ghost during the examination so I wouldn't need to study further. I knew that He could do it, but I did not ask Him. I felt that He would rather have me learn to pay a price in effort. He may well have sent help in the examination, but I was afraid that my motive might not be His. You have had that same choice to make often. It may have been when you were to be interviewed for a job. It may even have been when you were preparing for a talk or to teach a missionary discussion. Always there is the possibility that you may have a selfish purpose for yourself that is less important to the Lord.<br><br>For instance, I may want a good grade in a course, when He prefers that I learn how to work hard in the service of others. I may want a job because of the salary or the prestige, when He wants me to work somewhere else to bless the life of someone I don't even know yet. He surely will have purposes for your hearing me speak tonight. He knows you. I might have a desire to entertain or impress you. But I have tried to suppress my desire and surrender to His.<br><br>I saw a man do that once. It changed my life. A member of the General Authorities came to speak to a conference where I was sitting on the stand. I was in the local priesthood presidency. I knew personally the struggles of the local families and the members. He, the General Authority, had just flown in from a long assignment in Europe. He was obviously tired. He stood to speak in the meeting. It seemed to me that he rambled from one subject to another. At first I felt sorry for him. I thought he was failing to give a polished sermon of the kind I knew he had delivered many times.<br><br>After a while I was thrilled to recognize that as he moved from one apparently unrelated topic to another, he was touching the need of every poor struggling member and family we were trying to help. He did not know them and their needs. But God did.<br><br>How grateful I am that his motive was not to give a great sermon or to be seen as a powerful prophet. He must have done what I hope you and I will always do. He must have prayed something like this: "Father, I need Thy help. I am tired. Please guide me with the Holy Ghost. Bless these people. I love them. I ask only that I can do Thy will to help them."<br><br>The Holy Ghost came that night. And the Lord's will was done. The General Authority had spent a lifetime feeding himself and others on the good word of God. He had served the Master faithfully. He was a special witness of Jesus Christ because he had paid the price to be one. All of that came from keeping his motives as closely tied as he could to what the Lord wanted. That made it possible for the Lord to send the whisperings of the Holy Ghost to His servant and so bless the people.<br><h2><b>Pure Love of Christ</b></h2><br>I surely don't understand all the meaning of the scriptural words "the pure love of Christ." But one meaning I do know is this: It is a gift we are promised when the Atonement of Jesus Christ has worked in us. The gift is to want what He wants. When our love is the love He feels, it is pure because He is pure. And when we feel our desire for people is moving toward being in line with His, that is one of the ways that we can know that we are being purified. When we pray for the gifts of the Spirit--and we should--one for which I pray is that I might have pure motives, to want what He wants for our Father's children and for me and to feel, as well as to say, that what I want is His will to be done.<br><br>That is what these words from Moroni mean to me:<br><br><i>Wherefore, my beloved brethren, if ye have not charity, ye are nothing, for charity never faileth. Wherefore, cleave unto charity, which is the greatest of all, for all things must fail--</i><br><br><i>But charity is the pure love of Christ, and it endureth forever; and whoso is found possessed of it at the last day, it shall be well with him.</i><br><br><i>Wherefore, my beloved brethren, pray unto the Father with all the energy of heart, that ye may be filled with this love, which he hath bestowed upon all who are true followers of his Son, Jesus Christ; that ye may become the sons of God; that when he shall appear we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is; that we may have this hope; that we may be purified even as he is pure. Amen.</i> [Moroni 7:46–48]<br><br>I bear you my witness that God the Father lives, a glorified and exalted Man. He is the Father of our spirits. He and His Beloved Son, both resurrected and glorified, appeared to the boy Joseph Smith in a grove of trees in New York. They were there. The Father spoke to Joseph, first calling him by name and then introducing His Son. Heavenly messengers came to restore all the priesthood keys of authority. Joseph translated the Book of Mormon by the gift and power of God. It had been written on plates by ancient prophets, one of whom gave them to Joseph and took them back when the translation was done. The keys of the priesthood are on the earth today. As a witness of Jesus Christ, I testify to you that I know He lives and that He leads His Church.<br><br>I pray with all the energy of my heart that you will have your prayers answered to meet the requirements to receive the Holy Ghost. And I pray that you will endure faithful to the end and that, for you, it will be glorious.<br><br>I leave you my blessing that your pleadings for the gifts of the Spirit to serve the Lord will be granted. And I leave you my love. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Henry B. Eyring was a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when this fireside address was given on 10 September 2006.</i><br><br><i>© Intellectual Reserve, Inc.

<h1>r Code: What is it That We Honor? - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
As always at this time of year, I look forward to welcoming each of you to campus and the start of what we anticipate will be a wonderful, productive, and enriching new academic year. We are grateful to have each of you: those who are here for the first time, those who are continuing, and those who are returning after missions or other endeavors elsewhere. It is good to be in your company.<br><br>If I were a student, which I try to be, I would now be entering my senior year at BYU. I have been generally delighted by my experiences and hope that this is your lot as well. BYU is wonderful. It is also a big, complicated, and sometimes intimidating place. I am grateful to so many who go out of their way to be friendly and extend greetings as we pass each other on the campus. I hope that all of you will make special efforts to reach out and befriend your new associates. Some of you come with already made friends and previous contacts. While these relationships will and should continue, I hope and ask that all of you will consciously seek to broaden your circles, meet new friends, and always be friendly and courteous to everyone you encounter. This is part of what BYU is and should be.<br><br>We must never forget that BYU is not just another "good" university. It was established by the Lord's servants and continues to be blessed with the direction and support of prophets, seers, and revelators. While we may not understand all of the details, we do know that Brigham Young University occupies a key place in the Lord's plans for the completion of His work in these last days.<br><br>Because there is so much that is good and praiseworthy here at BYU, and because almost all of you are so good and praiseworthy, it is a great temptation to spend our limited time together in complimentary expressions. These are in order, and I do express my deep and profound appreciation and admiration for so much and to so many of you, especially those who make the BYU experience possible: the faithful tithe payers of the Church, your loyal families and supporting friends, our generous supporters and donors, and others who contribute in so many ways.<br><br>As I do so, however, I also feel impressed to share with you some reflections of admonition that accompany my appreciation and admiration. I listen to and read with deep interest the comments that many in our community make and those that are shared by people who mainly love and care about BYU and you. You would not be surprised that in my responsibilities I receive significant input. My e-mail and letter boxes are often quite full, and in my meetings and question-and-answer sessions with students, faculty, staff, and administrative colleagues, as well as with alumni, community groups, university supporters, and Church leaders, I am provided with volumes of feedback, suggestions, and occasional criticisms. Almost all are constructive and well-meaning, although there is occasional evidence of a little carping, lack of charity, or limited understanding of issues being addressed.<br><br>While not a universal theme, it continues to impress me that so much of the dialogue at BYU and about BYU seems to focus on our Honor Code in one way or another. It is typically not so much that individuals are overtly opposed to the Honor Code as it is they are concerned about the perceived understandings or applications that other individuals have about what the Honor Code really means and what it really is or should be.<br><br>As I have tried to think seriously and ponder all of the dimensions of this issue, I have repeatedly been reminded of the words of the Savior. I hope you will consider them carefully and see if there are applications to the Honor Code that you can identify and use to deepen your own understanding and commitment.<br><br>As we know, Jesus was rich in His praise and encouragement when conditions allowed Him to do so, but He was also crisp and clear in His corrections and criticisms when such was necessary. I hope we can avoid being selective in our attention to His correctives, just as I hope we can find joy in considering that many of His compliments are directed to us when we live as we should.<br><br>Think of that terrible night, just prior to the Atonement, when Jesus met with His apostles to keep the Passover with them. As He opened the curtain for them about the events to occur shortly, He announced that one of their quorum would betray Him. Listen to Matthew's account of their reaction to this distressing announcement: "And they were exceeding sorrowful, and began every one of them to say unto him, Lord, is it I?" (Matthew 26:22).<br><br>Note that Peter didn't say, "Is it Andrew?" Nor did James say, "Is it John?" I don't know what any of them really thought of or about Judas Iscariot. Their reflections and concerns were upon themselves and their own weaknesses and limitations. Although we know that they were perceptive and undoubtedly aware of the shortcomings of others, at that sacred moment they were most anxious that their own lives were in order and, however their actions, thoughts, weaknesses, or failings might be afflicting themselves and others, they did not want to be involved in any way in the betrayal of the Lord. In my judgment, this is an attitude and approach worthy of our emulation and application generally and in particular with respect to the Honor Code.<br><br>With the question "Lord, is it I?" at the forefront of our minds and hearts, think about Jesus' description and condemnation of the scribes and Pharisees. I don't believe we have a single scribe or Pharisee among us, but I do fear that, on occasion, some of their characteristics and attitudes find their way into our circle. The entire 23rd chapter of Matthew is worthy of our careful study and consideration. Rarely has a recorded rebuke by the Master been so lengthy, specific, and scathing. In a similar vein, in modern revelation, the Savior drew searing attention to those who neglected or omitted "the weightier matters of the law" (Matthew 23:23; see also D&amp;amp;C 117:8).<br><br>Like those mentioned in the meridian of time and in the early days of the Restoration, we in our day continue to be tempted to be selective in our discipleship and choosy about which conventions and commandments we will observe and which we might justify in ignoring.<br><br>Jesus Himself suggested a hierarchy of importance in the things we have been asked to do and to observe. Most would agree that murder is more vile than is cheating on our taxes and that physical assault is more vexing than a lack of common courtesy. Likewise, violation of sacred temple covenants should trouble us more than a missed day of scripture study, and disappointing a friend or loved one by an act of dishonesty is more distressing than is a hurt engendered only by thoughtless forgetfulness.<br><br>Nevertheless, we must be clear that an emphasis on the seemingly "weightier matters" does not excuse us "to leave the other undone" (Matthew 23:23). Because we consider the mandate never to cheat on examinations, plagiarize in writing our papers, steal from our associates or the university, or commit any immoral act absolute, it does not excuse us from seemingly lesser requirements having to do with proper parking on campus or requirements with respect to dress and grooming. Yes, some things are more important than others. Yes, we can agree to disagree individually on the place in the hierarchy of importance a particular standard explicated in the Honor Code should have.<br><br>What we must agree on--and have agreed on as we signed the appropriate document of acceptance when we came to BYU--is that we will abide by the Honor Code. Is our Honor Code all-inclusive? It is a remarkably broad and detailed description of things deemed to be important institutionally to us. We need to remember that, like all important documents, it has constituents that are implicit as well as those obviously explicit. Remember the words of King Benjamin as he completed his remarkable benedictory sermon:<br><br><i>And finally, I cannot tell you all the things whereby ye may commit sin; for there are divers ways and means, even so many that I cannot number them.</i><br><br><i>But this much I can tell you, that if ye do not watch yourselves, and your thoughts, and your words, and your deeds, and observe the commandments of God, and continue in the faith of what ye have heard concerning the coming of our Lord, even unto the end of your lives, ye must perish. And now, O man</i> [BYU students, faculty, staff, administrators, friends, families, supporters, and visitors], <i>remember, and perish not.</i> [Mosiah 4:29–30]<br><br>Some have suggested that because Jesus was so concerned about the importance of what goes on inside of us, we should be less concerned about external appearances or observances. Make no mistake, who we are in private and what we value most at our core are of supreme importance and are "weightier matters." However, it is also true that what we project externally should reflect who we really are.<br><br>In a recent tribute to President James E. Faust, his daughter, Janna F. Coombs, remarked that even when performing priesthood ordinances for members of his family in the privacy of their own home, he would be dressed appropriately as a representative of the priesthood he was exercising. President Faust is not stuffy; he is not pretentious. He makes no efforts to impress anyone unduly. He is meek, humble, and self-effacing. But he is fearless in his defense of the Lord and all things sacred. He is scrupulous in his devotion and honor to those things serious and fundamental. In other words, he lives the Honor Code with exactness.<br><br>I would suggest that you men who hold the priesthood have the same responsibility to honor the priesthood. President Faust did not become honest, honorable, and respectful when he was called to the First Presidency. It did not begin when he was ordained as an apostle or called as a bishop, stake president, or General Authority. He did not suddenly become a man of honor when he was called as a missionary or when he graduated from law school. He made all of these decisions and commitments when about your age and before--and all that has transpired since has been made possible because he has always taken the matter of honor seriously.<br><br>Likewise, you sisters who know that you "are daughters of our Heavenly Father" who loves you (Young Women theme) have a similar obligation and opportunity to demonstrate what you really understand and value by how you follow the Honor Code--to which you have attached your own name and personal honor.<br><br>All of us are beset with ideas, temptations, and distractions that have the potential to lead us to places we do not wish to go and to consequences we would not choose. The Word of Wisdom was given "in consequence of evils and designs which do and will exist in the hearts of conspiring men [and women] in the last days [our days]" (D&amp;amp;C 89:4). It is my judgment that this is also a major reason for the development of the Honor Code at Brigham Young University.<br><br>Similarly, the BYU Honor Code--not a canonized revelation but "adapted to the capacity of the weak and the weakest of all [BYU students]--is associated with promised blessings (D&amp;amp;C 89:3).<br><br>Included in the many blessings that a BYU education and experience may provide is the opportunity to understand and reflect carefully on what things in life are most important to us. This occurs in an environment where sacred things are held sacred and where we are committed to helping each other understand and apply eternal truths as we strive and grow in the quest for academic and scholarly excellence.<br><br>In addition, like the Word of Wisdom, the Honor Code is not primarily a law of health or blind conformity. It is a principle of obedience. It is an outward manifestation of our inner appreciation for and understanding of the privilege of being at BYU.<br><br>As we do our best to live the Honor Code in this light, we are assisted by focusing on "the weightier matters" ourselves and by not distracting others by our carelessness or neglect of those things "not to [be left] undone" (Matthew 23:23).<br><br>I like the attitude and approach of the Apostle Paul. In a discourse that has many applications to our current Honor Code dialogue, Paul makes some observations that I suggest for your consideration. The specifics of his attention had to do with the eating of meat and offerings made to idols. Our doctrine has not changed, although many other dimensions of life have. Listen to Paul's words and try to grasp the Honor Code implications of things that you might have considered to be of little importance or consequence:<br><br><i>But meat commendeth us not to God: for neither, if we eat, are we the better; neither, if we eat not, are we the worse.</i><br><br><i>But take heed lest by any means this liberty of yours become a stumblingblock to them that are weak. . . .</i><br><br><i>Wherefore, if meat make my brother to offend, I will eat no flesh while the world standeth, lest I make my brother to offend.</i> [1 Corinthians 8:8–9, 13]<br><br>If you do not care enough to shave for yourselves, do it for your associates and friends. If you do not respect yourselves enough to dress modestly and appropriately, do it for others.<br><br>If you are ambivalent about the importance of the little things as they apply to you, do them anyway out of respect for those who have sacrificed and do sacrifice in order that you might have the remarkable experience of a BYU education. Is the Honor Code a small thing? I do not accord it as such. Is compliance with the Honor Code to which you have attached your signature and pledged your personal honor really that significant? I judge it to be.<br><br>Now, I have been direct and, hopefully, clear as I have expressed my concerns and observations. I hope that I have not given offense to anyone, but I also hope that I have added clarity to some matters that may have been blurry in the thinking of some. I feel somewhat as Jacob may have felt as he attempted to be helpful to the people of Nephi. Said he:<br><br><i>O, my beloved brethren, give ear to my words. Remember the greatness of the Holy One of Israel. Do not say that I have spoken hard things against you; for if ye do, ye will revile against the truth. . . . I know that the words of truth are hard against all uncleanness; but the righteous fear them not, for they love the truth and are not shaken.</i> [2 Nephi 9:40]<br><br>I am convinced that what I have said is true and consistent with the statements and teachings of the Savior and the prophets. Some years ago, in a BYU devotional, President Gordon B. Hinckley said the following:<br><br><i>Every one of us who is here has accepted a sacred and compelling trust. With that trust, there must be accountability. That trust involves standards of behavior as well as standards of academic excellence. For each of us it carries with it a larger interest than our own interest. It carries with it the interest of the university, and the interest of the Church, which must be the interest of each and all of us.</i><br><br><i>Some few students resent the fact that the board has imposed a code of honor and a code of dress and behavior to which all are expected to subscribe. . . .</i><br><br><i>I think I can hear a student, perhaps a number of them, saying to a bishop, "Why do we have to sign these codes? Don't they trust us?"</i><br><br><i>I am reminded of what I heard from a man--a great, strong, and wise man--who served in the presidency of this Church years ago. His daughter was going out on a date, and her father said to her, "Be careful. Be careful of how you act and what you say."</i><br><br><i>She replied, "Daddy, don't you trust me?"</i><br><br><i>He responded, "I don't entirely trust myself. One never gets too old nor too high in the Church that the adversary gives up on him."</i><br><br><i>And so, my friends, we ask you to subscribe to these codes and to have the endorsement of your respective bishops and stake presidents in doing so. It is not that we do not trust you. But we feel that you need reminding of the elements of your contract with those responsible for this institution and that you may be the stronger in observing that trust because of the commitment you have made. With every trust there must be accountability, and this is a reminder of that accountability.</i> [Gordon B. Hinckley, "Trust and Accountability" (13 October 1992), <i>BYU 1992–93 Devotional and Fireside Speeches</i> (Provo: BYU, 1993), 24]<br><br>Might we truly recognize what it is and who it is that we really honor. Might we understand the trust that has been bestowed upon us and the accountability that is ours is my prayer in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Cecil O.

<h1>;t Follow the Crowd: &quot;Even if All, Not I&quot; - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
The Lord has said to all of us, "Seek ye out of the best books words of wisdom; seek learning, even by study and also by faith."<sup>1</sup> Welcome to all of you wonderful young men and women who are moving forward in your lives to acquire knowledge and to use it to enhance your futures, both intellectually and spiritually. Our prophet, President Gordon B. Hinckley, has said, "We live in a world where knowledge is developing at an ever-accelerating rate. Drink deeply from this ever-springing well of wisdom and human experience."<sup>2</sup><br><br>My dear friends, these schooling years pass quickly. I can attest to that fact. Having the wonderful opportunity to be in your midst often gives me many opportunities reminiscent of my university experiences. They seem like a long time ago, but the time between then and now seems to have just whizzed by so rapidly.<br><br>Your education is the road to many wonderful opportunities. This is a defining and refining time of your lives. Plato said, "The direction in which education starts a man [or woman], will determine his [or her] future life."<sup>3</sup> Your Brigham Young University education can bless your lives as well as those of your immediate family, descendants, church, and community. My experiences in university life--now and in the past--have influenced my life in so many different ways. Yours will do likewise. It is also true that friendships made at these times will last a lifetime.<br><br>About four months ago my husband and I were having dinner with such friends. I noticed that above an archway in their home they had placed some printed words. They were in Latin, and I did not know what they meant. These were the words: "Et si omnes ego non."<br><br>I was curious as to what they meant and why they had them in such a prominent place in their home. I was told that their translation was, roughly: "Even if all, not I." In other words, "Even if everybody does it, I will not." They proceeded to explain to me that the saying was the motto of the Barons von Boeselager, an old German noble family. Two descendants in the family, Philipp and Georg von Boeselager, were members of the resistance group that had planned the failed assassination attempt on Adolph Hitler on July 20, 1944. Their involvement in the operation went undetected, and they were not executed along with the majority of the other conspirators. The saying is carved in a timber beam on the outside of Philipp's family home in Germany.<sup>4</sup><br><br>Our friends explained that they used this quote as a motto for their family and that it was a reminder to them that they are members of a chosen generation and must be different in the world of today. As members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, they should make choices consistent with the teachings of the gospel and shun the negative, misleading, and evil messages of the world that surround them.<br><br>How many of you can remember when you were a small child? For some of us here it is a stretch, but for you it should be relatively easy. Can you recall when you and your friends wanted to do something and you had to ask permission of your parents? If they hesitated in the least in saying your desired response of yes, did you ever say, "But, Mom (or Dad), everybody else gets to do it"? I tried that ploy quite often. Or I might have said, "Sally's mom is letting her go."<br><br>I love the story told by President Hinckley of the time he learned about having the courage to make his own decisions and not "follow the crowd." The year that he started junior high school, the building was not large enough to accommodate all the students, and his class had to return to the elementary school. He and his friends were not very happy, so the boys decided that they would go on strike and not attend school the next day--and they didn't. They had no place to go, so they just wandered around wasting time.<br><br>The next morning, the principal, Mr. Stearns, met the boys at the front door and told them that they had to have a note from their parents to be able to return to school. Young Gordon went home and reluctantly approached his mother, who knew something was wrong. He told her the situation.<br><br>She did write him a note, which read, "Dear Mr. Sterns, Please excuse Gordon's absence yesterday. His action was simply an impulse to follow the crowd."<sup>5</sup> President Hinckley stated, "I determined then and there that I would make my own decisions on the basis of their merits and my standards and not be pushed in one direction or another by those around me. That decision has blessed my life many times."<sup>6</sup><br><br>During the last general conference in April we were warned many times concerning the fact that the world of today is shifting in its values and standards. We cannot nor should we live secluded from the world around us. It is indeed an exciting time to be alive, but it is also one that is fraught with danger both physically and spiritually. The adversary is very subtle and deceitful and will entice you any way possible to get you to "follow the crowd" or succumb to the evil ways of the world. He would have you ignore and not understand the blessings and promises available to you because of the Lord's great love for you.<br><br>What are some of the messages we hear from many of the "world crowd"? You who are students here today live in a very different world from that experienced by your parents and many others of us here.<br><br>From all types of media we are shown and told that chastity before marriage and fidelity afterward is not the norm in dating and marriage today. However, the Lord tells us: "Be thou an example of the believers . . . in purity."<sup>7</sup><br><br>You are given many examples of how to dress and look. There are examples for both men and women. The pressure can be strong to "be in style." However, we are constantly taught by our Church leaders that "modesty in dress is a quality of mind and heart, born of respect for oneself, one's fellowmen, and the Creator of us all. Modesty reflects an attitude of humility, decency and propriety."<sup>8</sup><br><br>We live in a world where success seems largely measured by possessions and professional status. To many the manner of obtaining these often seems to be of no consequence. This can also apply to university experiences and studies as you strive to achieve high grades, earn degrees, and gain desired employment positions. Qualities such as integrity, charity, honesty, and spirituality often are thought to be of less value than the means of obtaining what is assumed to be outward signs of success.<br><br>There may be the pressure and desire to have the largest house, the best car, expensive clothes, and so forth. Our Church leaders have warned us against unnecessary buying and cumbersome debt. It may be necessary to borrow for an education and, at appropriate times, an affordable home and other necessary items. However, we are constantly counseled to stay out of debt by purchasing wisely and living within our means. Do not be unduly swayed or influenced by those around you to do otherwise.<br><br>My dear friends, in the world today our voices can be heard as we speak of and stand for our convictions of truth and righteousness. I love the example in the Book of Mormon of Captain Moroni, of whom it was said:<br><br><i>If all men had been, and were, and ever would be, like unto Moroni, behold, the very powers of hell would have been shaken forever; yea, the devil would never have power over the hearts of the children of men.</i><sup>9</sup><br><br>Oh that such could be written of us as we stand for and speak of our beliefs!<br><br>As I see you here today and around the campus, my heart is filled with admiration for the wonderful lives you live and the examples you are to the world. I would love to know each one of you personally. However, you are 33,000 strong; therefore that is impossible. I do, however, have a testimony that you can stand up to worldly influences that would draw you away from your beliefs and say, in mighty voices, "Even if all, not I." Those who see and hear you can know of your testimonies of the Savior and our Father in Heaven.<br><br>Elder David B. Haight said it this way:<br><br><i>You need not look just like the world; you need not entertain like the world; your personal habits should be different; your recreation will be different; your concern for your family will be vastly different. If you establish this distinctiveness firmly in your life pattern, only blessings await you for doing what is right.</i><sup>10</sup><br><br>It would be the desire of those who love and lead you in many areas of your lives that you follow the admonition of the 13th article of faith, which reads:<br><br><i>We believe in being honest, true, chaste, benevolent, virtuous, and in doing good to all men; indeed, we may say that we follow the admonition of Paul--We believe all things, we hope all things, we have endured many things, and hope to be able to endure all things. If there is anything virtuous, lovely, or of good report or praiseworthy, we seek after these things.</i><sup>11</sup><br><br>That we may all do so would be my prayer in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Sharon G.

<h1>ined Heavenly Home - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Half a century ago Elder Adam S. Bennion of the Quorum of the Twelve was the assigned speaker at this devotional. His address was preceded by a stirring passage from <i>Cavalleria Rusticana</i> by Mascagni, performed by one of the university's fine choral groups. Elder Bennion was so touched that he began his message with these words: "I will shorten my remarks today so that this musical masterpiece may be performed for us a second time at the close of this assembly."<br><br>The nearer we get to God, the more easily our spirits are touched by refined and beautiful things. If we could part the veil and observe our heavenly home, we would be impressed with the cultivated minds and hearts of those who so happily live there. I imagine that our heavenly parents are exquisitely refined. In this great gospel of emulation, one of the purposes of our earthly probation is to become like them in every conceivable way so that we may be comfortable in the presence of heavenly parentage and, in the language of Enos, see their faces "with pleasure."<sup>1</sup><br><br>Brigham Young said: "We are trying to be the image of those who live in heaven; we are trying to pattern after them, to look like them, to walk and talk like them."<sup>2</sup> To prepare us to do this, the 13th article of faith encourages: "If there is anything virtuous, lovely, or of good report or praiseworthy, we seek after these things."<sup>3</sup> Refinement is a companion to developed spirituality. Refinement and spirituality are two strings drawn by the same bow.<br><br>Today I would like to peek behind the veil that temporarily separates us from our heavenly home and paint a word picture of the virtuous, lovely, and refined circumstances that exist there. I will speak of the language, literature, music, and art of heaven, as well as the immaculate appearance of heavenly beings, for I believe that in heaven we will find each of these in pure and perfected form.<br><br>God speaks all languages, and He speaks them properly. He is restrained and modest of speech. When God described the grand creational process of this earth, He said in measured tones that "it was good."<sup>4</sup> We would be disappointed if God had to use "awesome" or other exaggerated phrases in every paragraph.<br><br>Britain's Ben Jonson said: "Language most shows a man: Speak, that I may see thee."<sup>5</sup> Our language reveals our thoughts, our virtues, our insecurities, our doubts, even the homes from which we come. We will feel more comfortable in Heavenly Father's presence if we have developed proper habits of speech. We not only wish to see God's face "with pleasure," we want to open our mouths with confidence that our speech harmonizes with the refinement of heaven.<br><br>We will thrill to hear exalted beings express their sublime thoughts in perfectly chosen words. I suppose that the language of heaven, properly spoken, may approach a form of music. Did C. S. Lewis have this in mind when he wrote: "Isn't it funny the way some combinations of words can give you--almost apart from their meaning--a thrill like music?"<sup>6</sup> At Jesus' birth the angels appeared and spoke, not sang, "Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men."<sup>7</sup> We now try to capture that beauty in song, but the original angelic utterance was in spoken words, which thrilled like music.<br><br>Van Wyck Brooks, in his biography <i>The Life of Emerson,</i> told us that Ralph Waldo Emerson was invited to speak at the commemoration of the 300th anniversary of Shakespeare's birth. After proper introduction Emerson presented himself at the pulpit and then sat down. He had forgotten his notes. He preferred to say nothing rather than words not well measured. For some, it was Emerson in one of his most eloquent hours.<sup>8</sup><br><br>A few years ago I overheard a Church leader lament the fact that he never had time for anything except to read the scriptures and other works of literature and to prepare talks. His wife admiringly responded, "I know, dear. We all know. We know every time you stand up to speak." As he spoke, listeners saw. The unremitting preparation through a lifetime of reading great literature naturally produced messages eloquent in both phrase and substance.<br><br>Refinement in speech is more than polished elocution. It results from purity of thought and sincerity of expression. A child's prayer on occasion may reflect the language of heaven more nearly than a Shakespearean soliloquy.<br><br>Refinement in speech is reflected not only in our choice of words but also in the things we talk about. There are those who always speak of themselves, and they are either insecure or proud. There are those who always speak of others. They are usually very boring. There are those who speak of stirring ideas, compelling books, and inspiring doctrine. These are the few who make their mark in this world. The subjects discussed in heaven are not trifling or mundane. They are sublime beyond our most extended imagination. We will feel at home there if we are rehearsed on this earth in conversing about the refined and noble, clothing our expressions in well-measured words.<br><br>I grew up in a home in which the Sunday afternoon meal was an institution. We remained in our church attire. My parents almost always invited a special guest to join us at the dinner table. Several times it was the then president of this university. We were expected to remain at the table and converse about worthwhile things. In later years, as a student at this school, we attempted to do the same, often gathering in one of the Heritage Halls' kitchens on a Sabbath afternoon for a reverie of uplifting conversation.<br><br>Is there a generation today that needs to be superficially entertained? What is the prospect of a young man sitting in a dorm on Friday evening to read a great book and be thrilled by the music of the masters? Is Friday evening a frenetic flight to see where the entertainment and action will be? Could our society produce a Newton or a Mozart? Can 85 channels and uncountable DVDs ever fill our insatiable appetite to be entertained? Do any unwisely become addicted to computer games or Internet surfing, thereby missing the richer experiences of great reading, conversations, and music enjoyment?<br><br>One wrote: "We need the slower and more lasting stimulus of solitary reading as a relief from the pressure on eye, ear and nerves of the torrent of information and entertainment pouring from ever-open electronic jaws."<sup>9</sup> This solitary reading should evidence our spiritual and refined taste in selection of the reading materials.<br><br>Another said: "[Education] has produced a vast population able to read but unable to distinguish what is worth reading."<sup>10</sup> This happy chapter of your lives at Brigham Young University will help you focus on reading materials of greatest worth.<br><br>I don't know whether our heavenly home has a television set or a DVD machine, but in my mind's imagery it surely has a grand piano and a magnificent library. There was a fine library in the home of President Hinckley's youth. It was not an ostentatious home, but the library contained about 1,000 volumes of the rich literature of the world, and President Hinckley spent his early years immersed in these books. When President Hinckley once came to my home, he spent time perusing the library. He observed the 50-volume collection of the Harvard Classics, commented that he has the same collection in his home, and said he had read much of it. To be well read, however, it is not necessary to possess expensive collections of literature, for they are available to rich and poor alike in the libraries of the world.<br><br>President David O. McKay was inclined to awaken at 4:00 a.m., skim read up to two books each day, and then commence his labors at 6:00 a.m. He could quote 1,000 poems from memory. We knew that whenever he stood at the pulpit. He referred to the grand masters of literature as the "minor prophets." He was a living embodiment of the scriptural admonition to "seek ye out of the best books words of wisdom."<sup>11</sup><br><br>My wife and I recently spent four years on Church assignment in Eastern Europe, residing in Moscow, Russia. We often traveled on the Moscow underground subway called the Metro. We noticed the bowed heads of the Russian passengers, for they were reading Tolstoy, Chekhov, Dostoyevsky, or Pushkin--and, sometimes, Mark Twain. The people were poor, but they were not obsessed with their poverty. They possessed the rich tradition of Russian literature, art, and music.<br><br>Elder James E. Talmage, before his call to the Twelve, was a mining geologist. He once spoke of the features of certain geology he had observed during a field trip more than a year before. He explained that he could not with certainty recall the terrain until after he developed a photograph he had made of the location. The photographic plate had been laid away in darkness for an extended time. It had only been exposed to the light for one-fiftieth of a second--but the image was indelibly impressed on the negative, awaiting a future date to reveal its message.<sup>12</sup><br><br>The lesson does not escape us. The images to which our minds are exposed are held in store, seemingly forgotten, even for years. But at the crucial moment they re-present themselves to influence our thoughts and lives. And so it is with the music, literature, art, media, and other images to which we are exposed. The pamphlet <i>For the Strength of Youth</i> states: "Whatever you read, listen to, or look at has an effect on you. Therefore, choose only entertainment and media that uplift you."<sup>13</sup><br><br>These are the words of President McKay:<br><br><i>As with companions so with books. We may choose those which will make us better, more intelligent, more appreciative of the good and the beautiful in the world, or we may choose the trashy, the vulgar, the obscene, which will make us feel as though we've been "wallowing in the mire."</i><sup>14</sup><br><br>If we know the books located at the bedside, we know much about the man.<br><br>A good book, such as the scriptures, becomes a lifelong companion. A thoughtful man wrote:<br><br><i>An unliterary man may be defined as one who reads books once only.</i><sup>15</sup><br><br><i>I can't imagine a man really enjoying a book and reading it only once.</i><sup>16</sup><br><br><i>Clearly one must read every good book at least once every ten years.</i><sup>17</sup><br><br><i>The sure mark of an unliterary man is that he considers "I've read it already" to be a conclusive argument against reading a work. ... Those who read great works, on the other hand, will read the same work ten, twenty or thirty times during the course of their life.</i><sup>18</sup><br><br>Of all the works worthy of repetitive reading, the scriptures stand paramount, for they are not founded in the opinions of men. Over the years I have oft remembered the counsel of the late Hugh Nibley: "If you pray for an angel to visit you, you know what he'll do if he comes. He'll just quote the scriptures to you--so you're wasting your time waiting for what we already have."<sup>19</sup><br><br>Many years ago, while living in another part of the country, I became acquainted with a fine Latter-day Saint young man. He was a superior athlete, but he had never attended a cultural event. Living in the same community was a lovely young LDS sister. She spoke French as well as English. She played the violin. She presented herself as a refined daughter of God. One day the American Ballet Theatre came to our town. A group of us decided to attend, including this young man and young woman.<br><br>Now and then I glanced at the young man during the ballet. His eyes were riveted on the stage. Windows of new appreciation were opened. After the performance he approached me privately and said, in reference to the refined young sister, "Where have I been all of my life? This is what I want in my home. This is what I want as the mother of my children. Until now I thought only physical appearance mattered." I gently reminded him that she would likely be drawn to one of refined nature, like herself, and it was time for him to look within.<br><br>Dear daughters of God, you are the crown jewels of all of His creations. There has never been a sunset, symphony, or work of art as lovely as you. May you catch the vision that you are destined to be a refined and regal queen, honored by an uncountable posterity, worlds without end.<br><br>If we could peek behind the heavenly veil we would likely be inspired by the music of heaven, perhaps more glorious than any music we have heard on this earth.<br><br>When some music has passed the tests of time and been cherished by the noble and refined, our failure to appreciate it is not an indictment of grand music. The omission is within. If a young person grows up on a steady diet of hamburgers and french fries, he is not likely to become a gourmet. But the fault is not with fine food. He just grew up on something less. Some have grown up on a steady diet of musical french fries.<br><br>Elder Neal A. Maxwell said:<br><br><i>We ... live in a world that is too prone to the tasteless, and we need to provide an opportunity to cultivate a taste for the finest music. And, likewise, we're in a world that's so attuned to the now that we need to permit people to be more attuned to the best music of all the ages.</i><sup>20</sup><br><br>A few years ago I made my way to the bedroom of one of my sons to say good night. He was a junior in high school. As I approached his room, I heard the strains of Tchaikovsky's sixth symphony. I was surprised. I knew the boy loved sports, but I didn't know he loved Tchaikovsky. Months later, as my wife and I were listening to a videotape of three tenors singing, our son came in and sat down. He listened and saw, and a new appreciation developed. He said: "You never told me about opera." He took the videotape to his room, and I never saw it again. Appreciation of the finest in music does not depend upon your age.<br><br>President J. Reuben Clark of the First Presidency, one of our greatest Christ scholars, used to listen to inspirational music in the evening before he began his insightful writings concerning the life of the Savior. The music opened his spiritual pores, as it does for all of us.<br><br>Recognizing the penetrating influence of great music, Oscar Wilde had one of his characters say: "After playing Chopin, I feel as if I had been weeping over sins that I had never committed, and mourning over tragedies that were not my own."<sup>21</sup> After the first performance of <i>Messiah,</i> Handel said: "My lord, I should be sorry if I only entertained them; I wish to make them better."<sup>22</sup> Haydn "dressed in his best clothes to compose because he said he was going before his maker."<sup>23</sup><br><br>There are events of life so sublime that they cannot be imagined without the companionship of beautiful music. We could not have a Christmas without carols or a general conference without sacred anthems. And there could not be a heaven without music of surpassing beauty. Brigham Young said: "There is no music in hell, for all good music belongs to heaven."<sup>24</sup> It would be punishment enough to go to hell and not hear a note of music for all eternity.<br><br>This would be a good time to sift through your music library and choose primarily that which uplifts and inspires. It is part of the maturing process of your eternal journey. This would also be a fine time to learn a musical instrument or improve musical skills now partially possessed.<br><br>On the eve of his release, one of my fine missionaries during my tenure as a mission president spoke of a girl at home with whom he intended to renew association.<br><br>He inquired, "How will I know if she is the right one?"<br><br>I suggested, among other things, that he invite her to a cultural event. If she responded that this would be of no interest to her, then maybe he should pursue other alternatives. But if she had compelling spiritual qualities and could be enthralled by culture on Friday and love the athletic contest on Saturday, she might be the type of young lady he could choose as the mother for his children. It might be balanced and rewarding to be paired with her for eternity.<br><br>That which has been said about bringing great language, music, and literature into the home may be said with equal truth of great art--perhaps tastefully displayed in our heavenly home. It may also be said of our physical appearance and manners, as well as the order of the place in which we live, the way we offer our prayers, and the way we read God's word.<br><br>I once had opportunity to visit briefly with Audrey Hepburn, the great actress of days gone by, at the time she was making the movie <i>My Fair Lady.</i> She spoke of the opening scene in the movie in which she depicted a modest, unpolished flower girl. Her face had been besmirched with charcoal to make her seem part of her surroundings. "But," she said, with a twinkle in her eye, "I was wearing my Chanel perfume. Inside I still knew I was a lady." It doesn't take expensive perfume to make a lady, but it does require cleanliness, modesty, self-respect, and pride in one's appearance.<br><br>Many years ago an associate of mine decided he would please his wife by sharing with her a very specific compliment each night as he arrived home. One night he praised her cooking. A second night he thanked her for excellence in housekeeping. A third night he acknowledged her fine influence on the children. The fourth night, before he could speak, she said: "I know what you are doing. I thank you for it. But don't say any of those things. Just tell me you think I am beautiful."<br><br>She expressed an important need that she had. Women ought to be praised for all the gifts they possess that so unselfishly add to the richness of our lives, including their attentiveness to their personal appearance. We must not "let ourselves go" and become so casual--even sloppy--in our appearance that we distance ourselves from the beauty heaven has given us. Every man has the right to be married to a woman who makes herself as beautiful as she can be and who looks in the mirror to tidy herself up before he comes home. Every woman has a right to be married to a man who keeps himself clean, physically as well as morally, and takes pride in his appearance. A husband should hurry home because of the angel who awaits him, and that angel should be watching the clock awaiting his arrival.<br><br>Occasionally a young man comes home from his mission and hastens to distance himself in appearance from everything associated with missionary service. He becomes slovenly. Heaven blushes. The young man who wants an exemplary spouse needs to look in the mirror and ask why she would want him. Then he should shave and press his clothes.<br><br>Years ago I attended a stake conference in California at which the wife of the stake president shared this story: She had been born considerably after the other children in the family, and her father was unusually protective of her. When a suitor would stop by to pick her up for a date, the father would look him over very carefully and then say: "Do you want to date my princess? Go home and wash your car and shine your shoes. Then I will give my permission." I sometimes wonder if our Heavenly Father whispers the same when we date His precious daughters. The Book of Mormon speaks of a people who "did not wear costly apparel, yet they were neat and comely."<sup>25</sup><br><br>There are those who flippantly say: "How I look has nothing to do with how God feels about me." But it is possible for both earthly and heavenly parents to have unspoken disappointment in their offspring without diminished love. I say it again: Sometimes heaven blushes but loves on.<br><br>President Joseph F. Smith, the sixth president of the Church, owned few things, but he took care of them. He was fastidious in his appearance. He pressed his dollar bills to remove the wrinkles. He allowed none but himself to pack his overnight bag. He knew where every article, nut, and bolt of the household was, and each had its place.<br><br>Would this be true of the environment in which you live? Is it a house of order? Need you dust, clean, and rearrange before you invite the Spirit of the Lord into your apartment? President Lorenzo Snow said: "The Lord does not intend that the Saints shall live always in dens and caves of the earth, but that they shall build fine houses. When the Lord comes he will not expect to meet a dirty people, but a people of refinement."<sup>26</sup><br><br>David Starr Jordan, a former president of Stanford University, wrote:<br><br><i>To be vulgar is to do that which is not the best of its kind. It is to do poor things in poor ways, and to be satisfied with that. ... It is vulgar to wear dirty linen when one is not engaged in dirty work. It is vulgar to like poor music, to read weak books, to feed on sensational newspapers, ... to find amusement in trashy novels, to enjoy vulgar theatres, to find pleasure in cheap jokes.</i><sup>27</sup><br><br>I once heard a story about an imaginary king whose wife gave birth to a baby boy. The parents knew that the lad would someday inherit the kingdom. Desiring that their son be a wise king, fully familiar with the needs of the people over whom he would reign, the king and queen took the infant into the country to be raised as part of a peasant family. He was to be told nothing of his secret destiny until he became a man.<br><br>At the appropriate time the king and queen returned to the country to confer on their son the kingdom. They were greatly disappointed. Having been told nothing of his appointed destiny, he was exactly that which life had prepared him to be. He understood the proper care of animals and the gathering of crops, but he knew nothing of armies and palaces and courtyards and presiding. He had lost his vision.<br><br>It should not be difficult for you to glean the truth in this story. Another King, your Father in Heaven, has sent you away from His presence to have experiences you would not have had in your heavenly home--all in preparation for the conferral of a kingdom. He doesn't want you to lose your vision. You are children of an exalted being. You are foreordained to preside as kings and queens. You will live in a home and environment of infinite refinement and beauty, as reflected in the language, literature, art, music, and order of heaven.<br><br>I close with the words of President Brigham Young: "Let us ... show to the world that we have talent and taste, and prove to the heavens that our minds are set on beauty and true excellence, so that we can become worthy to enjoy the society of angels."<sup>28</sup> Even more, that we may enjoy the refined society of heavenly parentage, for we are of the race of the gods, being children of the Most High.<br><br>This is my testimony and my humble supplication for you, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Douglas L.

<h1> Bridges to Harmony Through Understanding - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
<i>President Boyd K. Packer, Acting President of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, gave this introduction of Dr. Alwi Shihab prior to Dr. Shihab&#39;s forum address on 10 October 2006.</i><br><br>Dr. Alwi Abdurrahman Shihab was born in 1946 in Sulawesa, Indonesia. He and his wife, Ashraf, who is here on the stand today, are the parents of three children. Their son, Sammy, is here. He is 11 years old.<br><br>Dr. Shihab's significant governmental experience includes service in Indonesia's Parliament, as Indonesia's Minister of Foreign Affairs (equivalent to our U.S. Secretary of State), and as a key leader of Indonesia's emergence from dictatorship to democracy.<br><br>Dr. Shihab is now Presidential Advisor and Special Envoy to the Middle East. This places him squarely in a region amid all the problems and struggles of the world.<br><br>Dr. Shihab is exceptionally accomplished. He holds five degrees (including two PhDs and a post-doctorate degree) from five universities in Egypt and the United States. He has taught or been a professor at seven universities in Indonesia and the United States. The first time I met him, he was a professor of Islamic Studies at Harvard University.<br><br>He is a world authority on Islamic law and has published widely on Islam and inter-religious harmony, including several books. A recent book was translated into English here at Brigham Young University. In that book he has a chapter on the Latter-day Saints. It is a very accurate and honest portrayal of who we are.<br><br>Ahead of us, indeed already all around us, is the world of Islam. Christianity and Islam will clasp hands in cooperation and understanding or clench fists in confrontation and prejudice.<br><br>A year or two ago, Brother Alwi and I met in San Diego. For a morning we sat, he with his Quran and I with my Book of Mormon, and compared and discussed the many things we have in common.<br><br>We have witnessed two watershed events: September 11, 2001, the World Trade Center terrorist attack brought Christians and Muslims into confrontation. The December 27, 2004, tsunami opened opportunity for Christians and Muslims to cooperate. The first was a wake-up call; the other pushed us out of bed.<br><br>The December 2004 tsunami, which devastated the Indian Ocean region, struck Indonesia particularly hard. Two days after the tsunami, I called Brother Alwi on his cell phone. He said, "I am standing at Banda Aceh, next to President Yudhoyono. You cannot believe what we see." I told him we would help.<br><br>They first asked for 20,000 body bags. We located them in China and had them air-freighted to Jakarta. Not long after that, they asked for 30,000 more.<br><br>Shortly thereafter, Elder David A. Bednar of the Quorum of the Twelve, Dr. Gerrit Gong of Brigham Young University, and I traveled to Jakarta and then on to Banda Aceh which is on the north end of the island of Sumatra, vulnerable to the open ocean. We witnessed scenes words cannot describe. Over 200,000 were dead, families broken and dislocated, homes washed away. We saw one cemetery where 40,000 bodies had been buried.<br><br>The Doctrine and Covenants has this very interesting prophecy: "For after your testimony cometh the testimony of earthquakes, that shall cause groanings in the midst of her, and men shall fall upon the ground and shall not be able to stand.<br><br>"And also cometh the testimony of the voice of thunderings, and the voice of lightnings, and the voice of tempests, <i>and the voice of the waves of the sea heaving themselves beyond their bounds</i>" (D&amp;amp;C 88:89–90; italics added).<br><br>The First Presidency called a special fast for funds to aid the victims of the tsunami. The money flowed in--several million dollars.<br><br>Part of our purpose in traveling to Indonesia was to review the significant Church humanitarian relief to those hardest hit. The assistance began flowing immediately, and it continues today.<br><br>The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints expresses "special love and concern for the eternal welfare of all men and women, regardless of religious belief, race, or nationality, knowing that we are truly brothers and sisters because we are sons and daughters of the same Eternal Father."1<br><br>We believe that "the great religious leaders of the world such as Mohammed, Confucius, and the Reformers, as well as philosophers including Socrates, Plato, and others, received a portion of God's light. Moral truths were given to them by God to enlighten whole nations and to bring a higher level of understanding to individuals."2<br><br>It is not a coincidence that the world's great religions come together at Temple Hill in modern-day Jerusalem. Known now as the Place of the Rock, it is a religious shrine for Islam, for Christianity, and for Judaism. All three great religions hold ties to this place. All three, likewise, have a common thread in a tradition that Elijah the prophet would return.3<br><br>Knit together by world history and by Old Testament history and doctrine, the Church and the Islamic world can see each other as People of the Book, indeed Family of the Book.<br><br>Church members and Muslims share similar high standards of decency, temperance, and morality. We have so much in common. As societal morality and behavior decline in an increasingly permissive world, the Church and many within Islam increasingly share natural affinities.<br><br>Muslim scholars point out that the Quran does not restrict Paradise to Muslims. The Quran rewards all those of faith who perform righteousness and believe in the after-life. The Book calls Jesus Christ Messiah, Son of Mary, and by the names Messenger, Prophet, Servant, Word, and Spirit of God.4<br><br>It is important that we in the West understand there is a battle for the heart, soul, and direction of Islam and that not all Islam espouses violent jihad, as some Western media portray.<br><br>It is as well important that friends in the Islamic world understand there is a battle for the heart, soul, and direction of the Western world and that not all the West is morally decadent, as some Islamic media portray.<br><br>Several years ago, I was invited to speak at a convention of insurance executives in Vail, Colorado. On the way, we crossed the Colorado River.<br><br>We could see a new bridge in process of construction. It was an engineering marvel. Anchored to the sheer stone walls on both sides was an abutment for the bridge. Launching out into space from that abutment, reaching out for the other side, were sections of steel girders. When they met and were locked together in the middle 1,000 feet above the Colorado River, each would give strength to the other, and that bridge would be locked together over which traffic of all kinds could flow back and forth safely and conveniently.<br><br>Alwi, a devout Muslim of Arabic ancestry, and I, a Christian and devout Mormon, have agreed to symbolically walk arm in arm into the future. Together we hope to build a bridge. Except what that symbolizes is accomplished, all of us face a very dark and very dangerous future.<br><br>Now I introduce Dr. Alwi Shihab with a title which I borrow from another venerable Islamic leader and cleric (whom we both know and love), Abdurrahman Wahid, former president of Indonesia--Gus Dur. I apply that title to you, Alwi. You know that by interpretation it means "Dear Friend."<br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>1. "Statement of the First Presidency regarding God's Love for All Mankind," February 15, 1978.<br><br>2. Ibid.<br><br>3. See Boyd K. Packer, <i>The Holy Temple,</i> [Bookcraft: 1980] 117.<br><br>4. See Alwi Shihab, "Jesus in the Quran," Inter-Religious Dialogue Seminar, spring 1992; Alwi Shihab, "Christian-Muslim Relations in the Twenty-first Century,"<i> Islam and Christian-Muslim Relations,</i> January 2004, vol. 15, no. 1, 65–77.<br><h2><b>Building Bridges to Harmony Through Understanding<b></b></b></h2><br>ALWI SHIHAB<br><br>It is indeed a great honor for me to address this forum, where academicians, scholars, and religious leaders are present to explore ways and means to foster global cooperation in building an ecumenical and harmonious interfaith community.<br><br>It is hardly necessary for me to remind you that Indonesia is the largest Muslim country in the world today. Indonesia also is the largest archipelagic state in the world, spread around some 17,000 islands that stretch along the equator from the Indian Ocean to the Pacific and cover a distance of 5,100 kilometers between its farthest points east and west. This is comparable to the distance between Los Angeles and New York.<br><br>It may, however, be important for me to stress two vital facts. First, Indonesia was not conquered by Muslim armies for Islam; rather, it was won by the piety and good examples of immigrant scholars, traders, and Sufi masters. Second, in Indonesia, communities of faith representing many if not most world religions live side by side in amity and peace most of the time.<br><br>It is worth noting that the Muslim world is too large and too diverse to march to the beat of a single drummer. Many people of the West mistakenly assume that the Muslim world is equivalent to the Middle East. The fact is that the Muslim world extends from Morocco to Merauke, Indonesia, and from Uzbekistan to Cape Town, South Africa. In addition, more Muslims live in China than in the Arabian Peninsula, and more Muslims live in Indonesia than in the entire Arab world combined.<br><br>Although Indonesia is more than 85 percent Muslim, it is neither an Islamic state nor a secular one. <i>Pancasila,</i> which literally means "five principles," is the ideology of the nation and the state. These five principles are (1) belief in the One Supreme God, (2) humanitarianism, (3) Indonesia's national unity, (4) democracy led by the wisdom of deliberations in representative bodies, and (5) social justice for all people.<br><br>Because the term <i>pancasila</i> is a human invention derived from Sanskrit and not from religious vocabularies, some observers argue that Indonesia is a secular state. Such an observation is incorrect. Indonesia is not a secular state in the true meaning of complete separation between state and religion. In other words, Indonesian nations do not separate themselves from religious life and values.<br><br>Despite a greater presence of Islamic values and symbols in the contemporary Indonesian public and social space, the Indonesian people are far from rigid in their understanding of Islam. Among Indonesians the moderate understanding of Islamic teachings prevails. The peaceful manner by which the five major religions--namely, Hinduism, Buddhism, Islam, Catholicism, and Protestantism--were introduced to Indonesia has left a long-lasting positive influence on the promotion of mutual trust and tolerance among the communities of faith.<br><br>Unfortunately, the moral, spiritual, and social values that made Indonesia a model of religious pluralism and harmony are being challenged every day by religious, ideological, and political radicalism. It is a sad reality that even international efforts to counter radicalism and terrorism often themselves become radical--and, hence, counterproductive. We must, therefore, deal with religious radicalism and intolerance not with brute force but with wisdom and the willingness to address the root causes of these problems.<br><br>We have been driven by misfortune to the need for a mission of peace through inter-religious harmony. World spiritual leaders from all faiths should lead the world in this mission of respect, harmony, and cooperation among all believers and all races. Only in this way can we dissolve hatred and live in peace and security. It will not happen through force alone.<br><br>No one denies that Muslims are hurt and affected more than anyone else in relation to the several tragic events of late because the terrorists claimed an Islamic affiliation and justification--even though Islam never condones, let alone endorses, any act of terror. This forum, I believe, can motivate and stimulate concerted efforts to bring together a wide range of perspectives, opinions, and backgrounds for the purpose of furthering constructive dialogue in mobilizing the force of moderation.<br><br>Through this academic gathering I want to invite us all to try to reflect with a clear mind and objectivity the root cause of such a dangerous phenomenon--namely, the religious radicalism encountered by humanity today. Indeed, our world has been thrust into a crisis of significant proportion. People are dying, hearts are breaking, and enmity is evident.<br><br>No one denies the rivalry between the world of Islam and the West. It has lasted more than 14 centuries. Almost 100 years after the birth of Islam, the Muslims managed to establish an empire that extended across North Africa, the Middle East, Iberia, Persia, and North India. Yet at the end of the 11th century, after two centuries of stability, tensions began with the First Crusade in 1095. The long period of continuous encounter since then has demonstrated more of enmity, hostility, and prejudice than friendliness and understanding.<br><br>It goes without saying that the interaction between the world of Islam and the West is an important part of the structure of contemporary global affairs. Without positive relations between Islam and the West, a constructive global network of people and societies will not be possible. For almost a millennium and a half Islam and the West have been viewed as two civilizations interacting in conflicting dialogue. To reach constructive dialogue and find solutions to the obstacles, it is important to think in terms of actual existing conditions in today's world of the 21st century and not impose concepts and programs from an earlier age.<br><br>The central reality of the 21st-century world with its spreading terrorism demonstrates that our era is globally interdependent but far from integrated. According to Norman Daniel, in his book <i>Islam and the West,</i> "Up to the present time, the mentality of the Middle Ages Christian (viewing Islam and Muslims as a real threat and the worst enemy) still lingers in the mind of many Westerners."<br><br>With the same spirit and emphasis, Dr. Barbara Brown Zikmund, former president of the Hartford Seminary--home to the Duncan Black Macdonald Center for the Study of Islam and Christian-Muslim Relations--stated: "I deplore the lack of knowledge about Islam and other religious traditions that continues to characterize the contemporary Christian community."<br><br>Indeed, one cannot deny that throughout the Western world there is tension between Westerners and Muslims. In many European countries Muslims are seen not only as outsiders but also as a menace, a threat, to European values and cultures. In many countries this tension is palpable; in some countries it remains subdued. But the West has never been very comfortable with Islam and Muslims.<br><br>With all frankness, Muslims should admit that they themselves have not always been able to present their case in a manner that is both understandable and acceptable to Western society. Sometimes Islam has been presented in a complicated way that the minds of common people hardly can absorb. And oftentimes Islam has been introduced in such a simplified way that it cannot reach the hearts of people. Such phenomenons have created an unnecessary misunderstanding that can bring about mistrust between Muslims and Westerners and often lead to a bitter feeling.<br><br>We all are aware that the West accommodates many faiths, including Islam. It is, therefore, essential that both Muslims and Westerners realize the urgent need to overcome the history of hostility between them in order to clear up the existing prejudices against Islam. In addition, we must always bear in mind that religion is not just an abstract doctrine or simple belief. It has been and continues to be the significant factor that shapes people's identities as individual persons and as groups. It is again our duty to find the way to harness the potential of religions to motivate their adherents to strive for peace, justice, and tolerance in everyday life and in all walks of life.<br><br>Unfortunately, for a long time many Westerners have believed that Islam is threatening their way of life. Likewise, many Muslims believe that the West is the source of the problem. I think one of the biggest challenges of our time is to comprehend and appreciate the values of Islam as well as the way of life and the mind of the West. No one denies that it has not been easy for the West to understand the spirit of Islam, nor for Muslims to accept the mind of the West; but, in the end, I believe, the West, if it is to understand Islam and the Muslims, has to adopt the faith and teachings of the <i>prophets of power or firm resolve,</i> as have been described by the Quran--namely, Noah, Abraham, Moses, Jesus, and Muhammad.<br><br>We all must strive to correct the erroneous perception in the mind of any Western intellectual who puts Islam today where communism was yesterday--against the West--and hence believes that dialogue between Islam and the West is a waste of time; that, therefore, the only way for the West to deal with Islam and Muslims is the argument of force, not the force of argument.<br><br>On the other hand, there are people in the Muslim countries who believe that the West is an old enemy of Islam, citing the history of past conflict. Accordingly, they believe that Muslims should fight the West. They believe that there is no room for dialogue. There can be only dialectical opposition between the two.<br><br>Our problem in encountering the above radical views lies in the fact that those who promote the idea of religious and cultural conflict take Islam as their starting point for the idea of clashing civilizations. They ignore the fact that Islam is not communism. In fact, Islam is far removed from communist values.<br><br>Islam is the very way of a life that is compatible with common reason and human decency--and, thus, democratic values, freedom, and human rights. In addition, the Muslim world is a great diversity of nations and cultures united by the idea of human goodwill, respect, love, and justice among all nations.<br><br>Islam has never been the reason for the suspension of freedom. On the contrary, Islam has taught humanity that there shall be no compulsion in religion. There shall be freedom in religion because the lie cannot be imposed and the truth needs no force.<br><br>Islam, as vividly presented by the Quran, is a universal teaching that does not limit itself to geographical boundaries or ethnic and racial backgrounds. Indeed, it is beyond the East and the West. The Quranic verse says:<br><br><i>You should know by now that it is not the Right Way only to face your faces towards East and West. But the Right Way is for you to have trust in God, and in the Day of accountability, and in Angels, and in the Book, and in the God's Messengers.</i><br><br><i>It is the Right Way also that you spend your property for your kin in need, for orphans, for the needy, for the wayfarer, for those who ask, and for the freedom of slaves. Also, the Right Way is to hold fast to prayer, to observe prescribed charity, to honor the contracts which you have made, to be firm and patient in hardship, and to overcome times of fear. Such people are on the Right Way to the truth and they are close to God.</i> (Quran 2; 177)<br><br>Islam, indeed, is beyond the East and the West because Jews, Christians, and Muslims share the belief in One God who created us all from a single soul and then scattered us like seeds into countless human beings. They share the same father, Adam, and mother, Eve. They share Noah's ark for salvation and Abraham's faith, they share respect for Moses and love for the virgin Mary and admiration for her son Jesus, and they share the clear word of the Quran of promoting good and preventing evil.<br><br>It is, therefore, important to remember the major elements the three Abrahamic religions have in common to enable each of the respective adherents to feel close affinity to one another. In fact, Islam describes Judaism and Christianity as People of the Book, indicating that all the three religions are of one and the same family.<br><br>They all come from the same Hebraic roots and claim Abraham as their originating ancestor. All three traditions are religions of ethical monotheism; that is, they all claim there is one, loving, just, creator God and that God expects all human beings to live in love and justice. Judaism, Christianity, and Islam are all religions of revelation. In all three religions this revelation has two special vehicles: prophets and scriptures.<br><br>The relation between the Quran and the Bible is repeatedly mentioned in the Quran. The Quran expressly claims this relationship and calls the attention of the Prophet Muhammad himself to this relationship. Here is, among others, a verse that especially acknowledges this relationship:<br><br><i>And this Quran is not such as could be forged by those besides Allah, but it is a verification of that which is before it and a clear explanation of the Book, there is no doubt in it, from the Lord of the worlds. </i>(Quran 10:37)<br><br>It is, therefore, imperative that Jews, Christians, and Muslims learn how to share their common spiritual roots and their common futuristic hopes without prejudice in order to avoid discrimination and religious and racial hatred so that they all can raise their children in peace and security on the basis of "Ethics of Sharing."<br><br>In other words, we must create in ourselves the sense that there are many paths to God, that the people of each path are held in special relationship to God: each chosen, not only for a mission but also for a special love. The three religions are like siblings in a healthy family; we may have great differences and competition, but in the end we must try to protect each other from danger and ill fate. We must try to pull together to mend the world around us in some small way.<br><br>Let me suggest, dear brothers and sisters, that religious tolerance is not enough. We have often seen--particularly after the tragic events of 9/11 and, most recently, the Danish cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad--that tolerance does not always lead to true social peace and harmony. To tolerate something is to learn to live with it, even when you think it is wrong and downright evil. Often tolerance is a tolerance of indifference, which is at best a grudging willingness to put up with something or someone you hate and wish would go away. We must go, I believe, beyond tolerance if we are to achieve harmony in our world. We must move the adherents of different faiths from a position of strife and tension to one of harmony and understanding by promoting a multifaith and pluralistic society. We must strive for acceptance of the other based on understanding and respect. Nor should we stop even at mere acceptance of the other; rather, we must accept the other as one of us in humanity and, above all, in dignity.<br><br>The Quran tells us:<br><br><i>We have honored the children of Adam, have carried them on land and sea, provided them with good and wholesome things and have preferred them over many of Our creations.</i><br><br>We must respect this God-given dignity in every human being, even in our enemies. For the goal of all human relations--whether they are religious, social, political, or economic--ought to be cooperation and mutual respect.<br><br>This goal can only be achieved through meaningful and constructive dialogue among the people of faith in every religious tradition. Nor should dialogue be limited to interfaith dialogue; it should touch on human rights and political and economic issues, as well as issues of social justice and the right of all people everywhere to live in security, prosperity, and peace.<br><br>We must not try to reduce our social, racial, and religious diversity to global uniformity or make it the cause of conflict and strife; rather, we must celebrate it as a manifestation of Divine wisdom and mercy.<br><br>The Quran says:<br><br><i>Surely, the most honored of you in the sight of God is he /she who is most righteous</i>.<br><br>Indeed, we are living in a difficult time, and we have to realize that the best way to begin working for peace is to build it up from within. It depends on us. The solution to the ignorance, bigotry, and narrow-mindedness that lead to hatred is within ourselves, within our communities.<br><br>It is our burden and our challenge to find solutions to these global problems. The solutions, as Shakespeare would have said, lie in ourselves, not in the stars under which we were born (see <i>Julius Caesar,</i> act 1, scene 2, lines 140–41), which is precisely what the Quran states:<br><br><i>We can only change our human condition if there is a change in our individual makeup and outlooks as well as our soul and mind.</i><br><br>The greatest lesson from any conflict that touches upon religious sensibility is that the global community cannot allow such conflict in any part of the world to fester because it will, sooner or later, generate dangerous complications elsewhere. It is, therefore, important to establish interaction and understanding across cultures as the best safeguard against acts of terror. We have to maintain an uncompromising stance towards those who would utilize terror to achieve their goals.<br><br>The unity of the civilized world in fighting the horror of radicalism against both sides (Western and Islamic) is absolutely indispensable. Educating the next generation and preventing them from brainwashing with hatred and ignorance are our shared moral duties.<br><br>I strongly believe that true harmony comes from resolving historical hatred and increasing mutual care and love. The only sure path to peace requires that we work to end the misunderstanding and resentment that afflict individuals, communities, and nations. Religious leaders, in particular, must reflect if they have preached God's love for all people universally--beyond nation, religion, and race.<br><br>It is our collective responsibility through this forum to find ways and means to overcome the tragic barriers that divide religious believers--not only those of different religions but also believers of the same religion. Religious leaders should seek valid theological foundations abundant in different religious texts on which to build religious tolerance and a culture of respect and acceptance.<br><br>With all honesty and sincerity we should confess that nobody knows where the dialogue between us will lead. But what we all ought to believe is that there must be an alternative to so much global violence and hatred. Therefore, in closing, let me invite you all to respond to the crisis of values that pervades so many regions of our world. Let us together try to reach out to the hearts and minds of our communities, strengthen the voice of moderation, and isolate the force of extremism and radicalism. May the fruits of this academic forum be a positive step forward on the long and difficult road to harmony among all of God's children.<br><br>God bless us all.<br><br><i>© Intellectual Reserve, Inc.

<h1>ces Worth Remembering - Gordon B. Hinckley - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
My dear friends, over the years I have spoken many times to generations of students who have assembled in this great Marriott Center. Today, if you will bear with me, I think I shall change the pattern of those previous addresses. Whether that change will be acceptable or not will depend on you. Furthermore, it is Halloween, and that calls for something a little different, though I don't know why it should.<br><br>As all of you recognize, I am now an old man who has weathered many seasons and been touched and affected by many experiences. Emerson was once asked what books he had read that had most influenced his life. He replied that he could no more remember the books he had read than the meals he had eaten, but they had made him.<br><br>And so, in the spirit of what Emerson said, rather than giving a speech I have thought to offer several brief cameos or vignettes or seemingly little experiences that I remember from out of the past and that have touched my life in an unforgettable manner. They have all been published, and some of you may be familiar with them. They will not be in chronological order.<br><br>I begin with number one.<br><br>I was in the city of Torreó, Mexico, and was being driven about in a beautiful and expensive automobile. It belonged to a man named David Casteñ. At one time he and his wife and their children lived on a little rundown farm. They owned 30 chickens, two pigs, and one skinny horse. They walked in poverty.<br><br>Then one day two missionaries called on them. Sister Casteñ said, "The elders took the blinders from our eyes and brought light into our lives. We knew nothing of Jesus Christ. We knew nothing of God until they came."<br><br>They moved into the little town of Bermejillo. Circumstances led them to the junk business. They bought wrecked automobiles. This led to association with insurance companies. They gradually built a prosperous business in which the father and his five sons worked. With simple faith they paid their tithing. They lived the gospel. They served wherever they were called. Four of their sons and three of their daughters filled missions.<br><br>Through their influence some 200 of their family and friends have joined the Church. More than 30 sons and daughters of family and friends have served missions. They donated the land on which a chapel now stands. At the time I met them, the children--now grown to maturity--and the parents were taking turns going to Mexico City each month to work in the temple. They are a shining and inspirational example of the miraculous power of missionary work. Think of the wonderful consequences of their being taught and receiving the teachings of the gospel from two humble missionaries. Such miracles are occurring today all across the world.<br><br>Now, vignette number two.<br><br>I have stood at the tomb of Napoleon in Paris, at the tomb of Lenin in Moscow, and before the burial places of many others of the mighty leaders of the earth. In their time they commanded armies, they ruled with near omnipotence, and their very words brought terror into the hearts of people.<br><br>I have reverently walked through some of the great cemeteries of the world. I have reflected quietly and thoughtfully as I have stood in the military cemetery in Manila in the Philippines. There, laid out in perfect symmetry, are marble crosses marking the graves of 17,000 Americans who gave their lives in the Second World War. Encircling this burial ground are beautiful marble colonnades, where are remembered another 35,000 who died in the terrible battles of the Pacific and whose remains were never found.<br><br>I have walked with reverence through the British cemetery on the outskirts of Rangoon, Burma (now known as Myanmar), and noted the names of hundreds and thousands of young men who came from the villages, towns, and great cities of the British Isles and who gave their lives in hot and distant places. I have strolled through old cemeteries in Asia and Europe and yet other places, and I have reflected on the lives of those who were once buoyant and happy, who were creative and distinguished, who gave much to the world in which they lived. They have all passed into the darkness of the grave.<br><br>All who have lived upon the earth before us are now gone. They have left all behind as they have stepped over the threshold of silent death. As I have visited these various cemeteries I have reflected, first, on the terrible cost of war. What a fruitless thing it so often is, and what a terrible price it exacts.<br><br>I have thought further of the oblivion of the grave. What would we do without the atoning sacrifice of Jesus Christ, the Son of God, our Savior and our Redeemer? He has given us the assurance that life goes on beyond the veil, that it is purposeful and productive, and that each of us shall go on living after we depart this life.<br><br>Number three, the next item in my chronicle of significant events, is the great and deadly plague of the 14th century, followed by the Renaissance, and eventually followed by the Restoration of the gospel.<br><br>Following the death of the Savior the centuries rolled on. A cloud of darkness settled over the earth. Isaiah described it: "For, behold, the darkness shall cover the earth, and gross darkness the people" (Isaiah 60:2).<br><br>It was a season of plunder and suffering, marked by long and bloody conflict. Charlemagne was crowned emperor of the Romans in the year 800.<br><br>It was an age of hopelessness, a time of masters and serfs.<br><br>The first thousand years passed, and the second millennium dawned. Its earlier centuries were a continuation of the former. It was a time fraught with fear and suffering. In the 14th century the great plague began in Asia. It spread to Europe and on up to England. Everywhere it went there was sudden death. Boccaccio said of its victims, "At noon [they] dined with their relatives and friends, and at night [they] supped with their ancestors in the next world!" (Giovanni Boccaccio, <i>The Decameron,</i> trans. Richard Aldington [1930 trans.; Garden City, New York: Garden City Books, 1949], 7).<br><br>The plague struck terror in the hearts of people. In five years it took the lives of 25 million--onethird the population of Europe. Periodically it reappeared, with its dark and ghoulish hand striking indiscriminately.<br><br>But this was also a season of growing enlightenment, the dawning of the Renaissance. As the years continued their relentless march, the sunlight of a new day began to break over the earth. There was a magnificent flowering of art, architecture, and literature.<br><br>Reformers worked to change the church--notably such men as Luther, Melanchthon, Hus, Zwingli, and Tyndale. These were men of great courage, some of whom suffered cruel deaths because of their beliefs. Protestantism was born with its cry for reformation.<br><br>While this great ferment was stirring across the Christian world, political forces were also at work.<br><br>There came the American Revolutionary War, resulting in the birth of a nation whose constitution declared that government should not reach its grasping hand into matters of religion. A new day had dawned--a glorious day. Here there was no longer a state church. No one faith was favored above another.<br><br>All of the history of the past had pointed to this season. The centuries, with all of their suffering and all of their hope, had come and gone. The Almighty Judge of the nations, the Living God, determined that the times of which the prophets had spoken had arrived. Daniel had foreseen a stone that was cut out of the mountain without hands and that rolled forth and filled the whole earth (see Daniel 2:34–35).<br><br>Then occurred that most wonderful event, the revealing of the Father and the Son to the 14-year-old Joseph Smith. There followed in orderly procession the coming forth of the Book of Mormon and the restoration of the priesthood with keys to unlock the door of eternal life. How thankful we should be for these marvelous and wonderful things that so richly bless our lives, including the privilege of attending this university.<br><br>And now, number four is a cameo of a little different nature.<br><br>Joseph Anderson was a Seventy. He lived to be 102, the oldest General Authority ever.<br><br>He served as secretary to President Heber J. Grant, beginning way back in 1922. In his old age, President Grant became seriously ill. When Joseph visited with him, President Grant said, "Joseph, have I ever been unkind to you? Have I ever abused you in any way?"<br><br>Joseph said, "No, President Grant, you have never been unkind to me in all these many years."<br><br>Tears rolled down President Grant's cheeks, and he said, "Joseph, I am glad that you can say that I have never been unkind to you."<br><br>President Grant died the next day. Joseph Anderson, through the remainder of his life, had reason to rejoice in the kindness, the civility, the decency, the honesty, and the integrity on the part of a most remarkable and wonderful man--President Heber J. Grant.<br><br>Number five is a touch on the lighter side. My father used to tell this story:<br><br>A boy came down to breakfast one morning and said to his father, "Dad, I was dreaming about you last night."<br><br>"You were?"<br><br>"Yes."<br><br>"What were you dreaming?"<br><br>"I was dreaming that I was climbing a ladder to heaven, and on each rung of the ladder as I went up, I had to write one of my sins."<br><br>His father said, "Yes, where do I come into your dream?"<br><br>The boy said, "As I was going up, I met you coming down for more chalk."<br><br>Now for number six:<br><br>I have always loved this piece of poetry by Rosemary and Stephen Bené. It is entitled "Nancy Hanks" and speaks the thoughts of the mother of Abraham Lincoln. It reads as follows:<br><br><i>If Nancy Hanks</i><br><br><i>Came back as a ghost,</i><br><br><i>Seeking news</i><br><br><i>Of what she loved most,</i><br><br><i>She'd ask first</i><br><br><i>"Where's my son?</i><br><br><i>What's happened to Abe?</i><br><br><i>What's he done?</i><br><br><i>"Poor little Abe,</i><br><br><i>Left all alone</i><br><br><i>Except for Tom,</i><br><br><i>Who's a rolling stone;</i><br><br><i>He was only nine</i><br><br><i>The year I died.</i><br><br><i>I remember still</i><br><br><i>How hard he cried.</i><br><br><i>"Scraping along</i><br><br><i>In a little shack,</i><br><br><i>With hardly a shirt</i><br><br><i>To cover his back,</i><br><br><i>And a prairie wind</i><br><br><i>To blow him down,</i><br><br><i>Or pinching times</i><br><br><i>If he went to town.</i><br><br><i>"You wouldn't know</i><br><br><i>About my son?</i><br><br><i>Did he grow tall?</i><br><br><i>Did he have fun?</i><br><br><i>Did he learn to read?</i><br><br><i>Did he get to town?</i><br><br><i>Do you know his name?</i><br><br><i>Did he get on?"</i><br><br>[Rosemary and Stephen Vincent Bené, "Nancy Hanks," in <i>A Book of Americans</i> (New York: Farrar and Rinehart, 1933), 65]<br><br>You know the answer. He became America's most-admired president.<br><br>Number seven:<br><br>No series of vignettes drawn from Church history would be complete without reference to the handcart pioneers of 1856--150 years ago at this very season.<br><br>My wife's great-grandmother, Mary Penfold Goble, was baptized in England. The family joined the Hunt Wagon Company, which accompanied the Martin Handcart Company. Her daughter's account is written in the simple, matter-of-fact manner of a young girl, but behind those plain words is stark tragedy. She wrote:<br><br><i>We traveled from 15 to 25 miles a day....</i><br><br><i>We traveled on till we got to the Platte River. ... We caught up with the handcart companies that day. We watched them cross the river. There were great lumps of ice floating down the river. It was bitter cold. The next morning there were fourteen dead. ... We went back to camp and went to prayers. We sang the song "Come, Come, Ye Saints, No Toil Nor Labor Fear." I wondered what made my mother cry. ... The next morning my little sister was born. It was the 23rd of September. We named her Edith, and she lived six weeks and died. ...</i> [She was buried at the last crossing of the Sweetwater.]<br><br><i>When we arrived at Devil's Gate it was bitter cold. ... My brother James . . . was as well as he ever was when he went to bed. In the morning he was dead.</i><br><br><i>My feet were frozen</i> [also my brother's and sister's]. <i>It was nothing but snow. We could not drive the pegs . . . for our tents....</i><br><br><i>. . . We did not know what would become of us. One night a man came to our camp and told us . . .</i> [Brigham] <i>Young had sent men and teams to help us. ... We sang songs, some danced and some cried....</i><br><br><i>. . . My mother . . . never got well. ... She died between the Little and Big Mountains. ... She was 43 years old....</i><br><br><i>We arrived in Salt Lake City</i> [at] <i>nine o'clock at night the 11th of December 1856. Three out of</i> [the] <i>four that were living were frozen. My mother was dead in the wagon....</i><br><br><i>Early next morning . . . Brigham Young . . . came. ... When he saw our condition--our feet frozen and our mother dead--tears rolled down his cheeks.</i><br><br><i>The doctor amputated my toes . . .</i> [while] <i>the sisters were dressing mother</i> [for her grave]. ... <i>That afternoon she was buried.</i> [Life of Mary Ann Goble Pay, autobiographical sketch, typescript, LDS Church Archives, Salt Lake City; also, "Mary Goble Pay Autobiography," in Arthur D. Coleman, comp., <i>Pay-Goble Pioneers of Nephi, Juab County, Utah</i> (Salt Lake City: n.p., 1968), 78–81; text modernized]<br><br>What a story in a few brief words.<br><br>Number eight:<br><br>In 1966, while the Vietnam War was raging, I went to that land. When we landed at Tan Son Nhut Airport, Colonel Rosza put a piece of paper in front of me and said, "Sign this."<br><br>I said, "What is it?"<br><br>He said, "It's a release relieving the United States government of any responsibility for you while you are in Vietnam."<br><br>I signed the release, and we climbed aboard an old "goony bird" airplane and went down the runway. The sergeant had left the door open. When we got up in the air I said, "Aren't you going to close the door?"<br><br>And he said, "It's too hot."<br><br>And so we flew up to Da Nang, and I'll never forget that meeting as long as I live. Men came in from the battle areas and stacked their rifles at the door of the building. Three of their number had been killed that previous week, and we held a memorial service for them and had a meeting. Soldiers of the Jewish faith were to have had the building that night--it was Saturday--and when they saw how many of us there were (there were only about a dozen of them), they generously said, "You go back in and use the building."<br><br>When the meeting was over, we were loaded into an army ambulance and taken to stay the night in an unfinished field hospital. It was made of components that were being bolted together--produced in the States and shipped to Vietnam. The windows were all sealed and the air-conditioning wasn't working, so it was like an oven. To take a shower we had a big barrel of water with a dipper. All through the night fighter aircraft were flying north, and we wondered how many of them would come back.<br><br>We went down to Nha Trang on Sunday morning and held a wonderful meeting there. We had the sacrament with men who hadn't had the sacrament in months.<br><br>For me that was a great and significant and unforgettable experience.<br><br>Number nine:<br><br>I had a long-remembered meeting with Mr. Shimon Peres of Israel. He was a former prime minister. He had seen much of conflict and trouble in his time.<br><br>I asked him whether there was any solution to the great problems that constantly seem to divide the people of Israel and the Palestinians. He replied, "Of course there is."<br><br>As I recall, he said, "When we were Adam and Eve, we were all one. Is there any need for us now to be divided into segments with hatred for one another?"<br><br>He told a very interesting story that he said he had heard from a Muslim. The Muslim told of a Jewish rabbi who was conversing with two of his friends. The rabbi asked one of the men, "How do you know when the night is over and a new day has begun?"<br><br>His friend replied, "When you look into the east and can distinguish a sheep from a goat, then you know the night is over and the day has begun."<br><br>The second was asked the same question. He replied, "When you look into the distance and can distinguish an olive tree from a fig tree, then you know morning has come."<br><br>They then asked the rabbi how he could tell when the night is over and the day has begun. He thought for a time and then said, "When you look into the east and see the face of a woman and you can say, 'She is my sister.' And when you look into the east and see the face of a man and can say, 'He is my brother.' Then you know the light of a new day has come."<br><br>Think of that for a few moments, my dear friends. How eloquently it speaks of the true meaning of brotherhood.<br><br>And so, my brothers and sisters, I might go on. I have given you a sampling of significant occasions that have forever touched my life.<br><br>They have influenced my thinking and my behavior. They have affected my life in an unforgettable manner.<br><br>You likewise will have significant experiences. I hope that you will write them down and keep a record of them, that you will read them from time to time and refresh your memory of these meaningful and significant things.<br><br>Some of them may be funny. Some may be of significance only to you. Some of them may be sacred and quietly beautiful. Some may build one upon another until they represent a lifetime of special experience. So it was with the girl I married nearly 70 years ago. My experiences with her stand out vividly in my memory. I cannot forget them. When she was young I was bewitched and in love. That love strengthened through the years. She came to be a woman of recognized capacity. She traveled across the world with me and spoke on every continent, giving encouragement and bearing her testimony. She authored books. She was once honored here as the woman of the year. A chair at this university carries her name.<br><br>She left me two and a half years ago. The resulting loneliness never entirely disappears. On the granite marker at her grave site are inscribed the words "Beloved Eternal Companion." Such she is and such she always will be.<br><br>I remind you that the association you now enjoy as students is probably the best time of your lives to find your own "Beloved Eternal Companion." Do so with a prayer in your heart. It will be the most important decision you will ever make. It will influence your life from now through all eternity.<br><br>God bless you, my beloved friends. May this be a wonderful season in your lives as you attend this great Church-sponsored university is my humble prayer, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Gordon B.

<h1>d Works in a Secular World - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
My dear brothers and sisters, what a sobering sight you are, coming from various walks of life and various parts of the country. And to think this evening we are assembled across the breadth of the earth. Between now and the rebroadcast of these proceedings, young adults throughout the Church will gather together and participate in such an event as this. It is truly marvelous.<br><br>A glorious thing happened at general conference last month. For most of the world it went unnoticed, but for those who know and love the truth it was as unforgettable as the clap of 10,000 thunders.<br><br>Think back to the closing session. From the Tabernacle Choir came the familiar strains:<br><br><i>We thank thee, O God, for a prophet</i><br><br><i>To guide us in these latter days.</i><br><br><i>We thank thee for sending the gospel</i><br><br><i>To lighten our minds with its rays.</i><sup>1</sup><br><br>Of a sudden, men and women, boys and girls assembled in the Conference Center arose in reverence and gratitude for the blessings spoken of in this hymn. We stood in grateful acknowledgment that the gospel of Jesus Christ has been restored, that God the Father and His Beloved Son have spoken from the heavens, that Joseph Smith was a prophet, and that President Gordon B. Hinckley is the Lord's prophet on the earth today.<br><br>It was a spiritually moving experience. It was a time when citizens of God's kingdom, acting under the influence of the Holy Ghost, <i>stood up for their faith!</i><br><br>Earlier that day President Hinckley had spoken tenderly and gratefully about his advanced years and attendant health. Always an example of faithfulness, he pledged anew his life to the Lord's purposes. Said he:<br><br><i>The Lord has permitted me to live; I do not know for how long. But whatever the time, I shall continue to give my best to the task at hand. . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . We shall carry on as long as the Lord wishes. . . . When it is time for a successor, the transition will be smooth and according to the will of Him whose Church this is. And so, we go forward in faith--</i>and faith is the theme I wish to discuss this morning.<sup>2</sup><br><br>His message was timely and inspired. It came as a spiritual reminder of what life is really about and how Heavenly Father's children can overcome every obstacle. It came to a world steeped in secularism, unbelief, and sin.<br><h2><b>Secularism</b></h2><br>Education in secular subjects contributes much to the betterment of our world. Secular learning of the highest level blossoms in an atmosphere of virtue, moral responsibility, spiritual truth, and faith.<br><br>Much is touted today about secular societies. People and nations pride themselves in being <i>secular,</i> in focusing on "worldly things or [on] things that are not regarded as religious, spiritual, or sacred."<sup>3</sup><br><br>Much of the world today views secularism as vital to a balanced, just, and ordered government. Hence, religious expression is discouraged in public forums, civil rights are dependent on the courts and legislative processes, and men and women readily seek solutions and redress through litigious means. In the extreme, society's secularism overlooks the concept of eternal life, places all things in the context of the natural world, and consequently is prone to <i>works without faith.</i><br><br>It requires watchfulness and great effort to be men and women of faith in a secular world. When inundated by worldliness, it is the nature of man to "first endure, then pity, then embrace."<sup>4</sup> Secularism is inundating people today with such results.<br><br>Unchecked by faith in Christ as the Redeemer of mankind, this secular or natural world produces men and women who are<br><br><i>proud, obsessed with self, overly competitive, reactionary, fiercely independent, driven by desires, appetites,</i> [and] <i>worldly acclaim. . . . In general, the natural man is an unredeemed creature, a being who walks . . . in the light of his own fire . . .</i> [see 2 Nephi 7:10–11]. <i>Such a one is acclimated to the nature of things about him, taking his cues and bearings from a fallen world.</i><sup>5</sup><br><br>Succinctly stated, "Men that are in a state of nature . . . are without God in the world" (Alma 41:11).<br><br>Because secularism typically ignores the eternal perspective, it can in time lead to unbelief. In the words of Wolfhart Pannenberg, a professor of theology at the University of Munich:<br><br><i>A public climate of secularism undermines the confidence of Christians in the truth of what they believe. . . .</i><br><br><i>In a secular milieu, even an elementary knowledge of Christianity . . . dwindles. It is no longer a matter of rejecting Christian teachings; large numbers of people have not the vaguest knowledge of what those teachings are. . . . The more widespread the ignorance of Christianity, the greater the prejudice against Christianity. . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . The difficulty is exacerbated by the cultural relativizing of the very idea of truth. . . . In the view of many, . . . Christian doctrines are merely opinions that may or may not be affirmed according to individual preference, or depending on whether they speak to personally felt needs. . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . The thoroughly secularized social order gives rise to a feeling of meaninglessness.</i><sup>6</sup><br><br>Faith in Christ is replaced by faith in man. In public discourse and private thought, the questions of where we came from, where we go when life is over, and what ultimately governs the here and now not only go unaddressed but are also considered irrelevant. This state of unbelief is becoming a calamity of colossal proportions.<br><br>Heavenly Father knew this would happen. The Restoration of the gospel rekindled faith in Jesus Christ as Creator, Savior, and Redeemer. It brought again the correct understanding of life's purposes. In 1831 Heavenly Father's children were told:<br><br><i>Wherefore, I the Lord, knowing the calamity which should come upon the inhabitants of the earth, called upon my servant Joseph Smith, Jun., and spake unto him from heaven, and gave him commandments; . . .</i><br><br><i>That faith . . . might increase in the earth.</i> [D&amp;amp;C 1:17, 21]<br><br>Before the foundations of this world were laid, before the orbs of the universe received their place, men and women lived and moved and had their being (see Acts 17:28). The secular thought that life is nothing more than biology denies the fundamental truth, the subconscious awareness residing in the recesses of every living soul, that "man <i>was</i> also in the beginning <i>with God"</i> (D&amp;amp;C 93:29; emphasis added). This fact is immutable and irrefutable.<br><br>Paradisiacal Eden with our first parents, Adam and Eve, came thereafter so that man, through mortal life's experiences and Christ's Redemption, might become a complete, fully developed, and perfected being. The ages of the patriarchs, the supernal advent of our Savior and His incomparable Atonement in the meridian of time, and "the times of restitution of all things" (Acts 3:21), which began in 1820, set the framework by which men and women, boys and girls could once more govern their lives and surroundings by "faith in the Lord Jesus Christ" (Articles of Faith 1:4).<br><br>My dear young friends, you stand at the confluence of these world events. "What is past is prologue, and what has been is yet to be."<sup>7</sup> What can happen--what must happen--is that your faith and accompanying works will stem the tide of unbelief. This is your lot in life. This is your sacred duty.<br><h2><b>Benchmarks of Faith</b></h2><br>Our Master said, "If ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed, . . . nothing shall be impossible unto you" (Matthew 17:20). President Hinckley reminded us: "When all is said and done, the only real wealth of the Church is in the faith of its people."<sup>8</sup><br><br>He also said: "In the on-working of this great cause, increased faith is what we most need. Without it, the work would stagnate. With it, no one can stop its progress."<sup>9</sup><br><br>Such faith is more than attitude, more than belief, more than testimony of what one knows or feels. Real faith, the faith spoken of by our beloved prophet, begets righteousness in this life and salvation in the life to come. It is centered in the true and living God and in Jesus Christ whom He has sent (see John 17:3). It is founded on truth, preceded by knowledge, and perfected by works. It causes mortals to understand and behave as Heavenly Father's children should. This faith "is the first great governing principle which [enables us to have] power, dominion, and authority over"<sup>10</sup> how we think, how we act, and what manner of men and women we are.<br><br>The Apostle James gave us the formula for such faith:<br><br><i>What profit is it . . . for a man to say he hath faith, and hath not works? . . .</i><br><br><i>Yea, a man may say, I will show thee I have faith without works; but I say, Show me thy faith without works, and I will show thee my faith by my works. . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . Faith, if it have not works is dead, being alone. . . .</i><br><br><i>Seest thou how works</i> [are] <i>wrought with . . . faith, and by works</i> [is] <i>faith made perfect?</i> [JST, James 2:14–15, 17, 21]<br><br>We hear much about <i>benchmarks.</i> A benchmark is "a standard of excellence [or] achievement . . . against which similar things [are] measured or judged."<sup>11</sup><br><br>There are four benchmarks that can help each of us know if our personal faith in Christ is being "made perfect" by our works. These benchmarks are (1) the choices we make, (2) the devotion we exhibit, (3) the obedience we practice, and (4) the service we give. Permit me to explain.<br><h2><b>The Choices We Make</b></h2><br><i>First, the benchmark of choice.</i> Latter-day Saints "believe in <i>being</i> honest, true, chaste, benevolent, virtuous. . . . If there is anything virtuous, lovely, or of good report or praiseworthy, <i>we seek after</i> these things" (Articles of Faith 1:13; emphasis added).<br><br>Imagine a young elder, whom we will call Bill. He learned this in Primary. He believed it then; he believes it now. For some time, however, Bill has been plagued with pornography. He has found its allurements powerful and addictive. After each encounter with this sleazy stuff, Bill has felt sickened, ashamed, and worthless inside.<br><br>Bill attended general conference a few weeks ago. In the priesthood session, he heard President Hinckley say:<br><br><i>There is not a man or boy in this vast congregation tonight who cannot improve his life. And that needs to happen. After all, we hold the priesthood of God. . . .</i><br><br><i>With this priesthood comes a great obligation to be worthy of it. We cannot indulge in unclean thoughts. We must not partake of pornography. We must never be guilty of abuse of any kind. We must rise up above such things. "Rise up, O men of God!" and put these things behind you, and the Lord will be your guide and stay.</i><sup>12</sup><br><br>Bill decided, "It is time for me to stand up for my faith!"<br><br>He went to that secret place, retrieved the filthy pictures, the vulgar films and literature, and destroyed them. He purged his library of the hard, raucous music and sordid lyrics. He deleted from his computer all references to pornographic sites, installed a protective filter, and placed his computer in a more public place so as to fortify himself against repeating his sin.<br><br>Bill acknowledged his transgressions before God. He prayed fervently for the strength to repent, to expel this evil from his life. He sought help from his bishop and loved ones. In his extremity, Bill has felt the quiet assurance "My son, you are on the right path." His faith, because of his works, is being affirmed and strengthened.<br><br>Much remains to be done. There will be fasting, prayer, scripture study, and many tears. A good bishop will provide indispensable help. The faithfulness and prayers of parents and loved ones will provide needed support. Nevertheless, <i>the benchmark shows: Bill is beginning to exercise faith unto repentance--he has made the right choice!</i><br><h2><b>The Devotion We Exhibit</b></h2><br><i>Second, the benchmark of devotion.</i> Latter-day Saints<br><br><i>believe all that God has revealed, all that He does now reveal, and we believe that He will yet reveal many great and important things pertaining to the Kingdom of God.</i><br><br><i>We believe in the literal gathering of Israel and in the restoration of the Ten Tribes; that Zion (the New Jerusalem) will be built upon the American continent.</i> [Articles of Faith 1:9–10]<br><br>And Latter-day Saints believe that men and women are "called of God, by prophecy" and divine authority to bring this about (Articles of Faith 1:5).<br><br>True devotion is tied to divine causes set in motion before the foundations of this world. Righteous ancestors enlisted in them and gave their lives to the furtherance of Heavenly Father's purposes. We have been entrusted to carry on, to build upon their consecrated labors.<br><br>Now a story, one familiar to some of you:<br><br>In 1856 Robert and Ann Parker, with their four children, embarked from England to join the Saints in Utah. A prophet had spoken, and theirs was the charge to gather to the Great Basin and help build Zion. As members of the McArthur Handcart Company, each in their family bore a share of the work. Father and Mother pulled the heavy cart, Maxie (12 years of age) pushed, and Martha (10 years old) tended little Arthur (six years of age). Baby Ada (one year old) toddled, was carried, and rode in the cart.<br><br>Somewhere in Nebraska little Arthur sat down to rest and fell asleep. A sudden storm arose. The company hurried on and made camp. It was then they discovered that Arthur was not with the other children.<br><br>Days of searching were in vain. The company had to press on. This was the time for Robert and Ann Parker to act in accordance with their faith. Archer Walters recorded in his diary under July 2, 1856: "Brother Parker's little boy . . . was lost, and the father went back to hunt him."<br><br>As Robert departed, Ann pinned a bright red shawl about his shoulders and said: "If you find him dead, wrap him in the shawl to bury him. If you find him alive, you could use this as a flag to signal us." She, with the other children, took up the handcart and struggled on with the company.<br><br>Robert retraced the miles of forest trail, calling, searching, and praying for their helpless little son. At last he reached a mail and trading station where he learned that their child had been cared for by a woodsman and his wife. Little Arthur had been ill from exposure and fright, but God had heard the prayers of his loving parents.<br><br>On the trail each night, Ann and her children kept watch. On the third night, as the rays of the setting sun caught the glimmer of a bright red shawl, this brave mother sank in a pitiful heap in the sand. Completely exhausted, Ann slept for the first time in six long days and nights.<sup>13</sup> God indeed was kind and merciful; their works had rewarded their devotion and sanctified their faith, and in the gladness of their hearts the Saints sang, "All is well!"<sup>14</sup><br><br>Baby Ada, my grandmother, grew to womanhood and married my grandfather, Brigham Young McMullin. Now here is the moral. She never allowed her children to forget that she and her family came across the plains with the Daniel D. McArthur Handcart Company. The story of the red shawl became our story--the legacy of their faith became ours as well. And so we all "carry on,"<sup>15</sup> and great obstacles fade as the dew before the morning sun.<br><br>About these early Saints, <i>the benchmark shows: Their works were a hallmark of faith, their devotion a standard for their posterity to live by.</i><br><h2><b>The Obedience We Practice</b></h2><br><i>Third, the benchmark of obedience.</i> Latter-day Saints "believe that through the Atonement of Christ, all mankind may be saved, by <i>obedience to the laws and ordinances of the Gospel"</i> (Articles of Faith 1:3; emphasis added).<br><br>Here we imagine a young couple representative of those living in this secular world. David and Michelle knew this article of faith long before they knew each other. Even so, they deal with concerns facing many participating in this broadcast. You see, David and Michelle are in their mid-to-late twenties. They have known one another for some time, they "hang out" together, and they are in love. Nevertheless, they are indecisive about marriage and family. Should they postpone marriage until they have completed their schooling, until they have more money, until some of their personal ambitions are realized?<br><br>They also wonder about the escalating trends of divorce, the wars and tumults around the world, and overpopulation. Would their marriage survive? Should they bring children into such a world?<br><br>Oh, David and Michelle, exercise your faith! Remember: "Marriage between a man and a woman is ordained of God."<sup>16</sup> "What . . . God hath joined together, let not man put asunder" (Matthew 19:6; see also D&amp;amp;C 132:19–20). "Children are an heritage of the Lord" (Psalm 127:3). "The earth is full, . . . there is enough and to spare" (D&amp;amp;C 104:17).<br><br>Act upon what you know to be true and your righteous works will perfect your faith. Your lives will be full and wonderful. Follow the good example of your parents. They could not afford to get married, but they did. They too worried about war and tumult, but they exercised their faith and had you! The demands of marriage and family did not deter their education; they enriched it. As for their personal ambitions, they are completely and happily entwined in the well-being of each other and of you, your brothers and sisters, and the grandchildren.<br><br>Life was not easy for your parents. They had to scrimp and save, make do with what they had. They too faced questions and circumstances they could not answer, but they knew that the pathway ordained by Almighty God decreed that they move ahead. And you are so much "richer" because of it.<br><br>From the stories they have told you over and over again, you know that everything for them has been uphill, "both ways." But their works have sanctified their faith.<br><br>They are older, to be sure. Their step is not as spry, their manner not as intense, their appearance not something advertisers typically clamor for. But their love for God and for each other reflects deep reverence and adoration. The scars of life have afforded them wisdom, patience, and gratitude. In small but important ways they have become "the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen" (Hebrews 11:1)--things they could not see earlier in life. But they obeyed. Exercising their faith, they were sealed in the temple, were blessed with children, and now know the true sources of happiness. <i>The benchmark shows: Obedience calls forth the blessings of heaven--it did so for your parents and it will do so for you.</i><br><h2><b>The Service We Give</b></h2><br><i>Fourth, the benchmark of service.</i> Latter-day Saints<br><br><i>believe in God, the Eternal Father, and in His Son, Jesus Christ, and in the Holy Ghost. . . .</i><br><br><i>We believe . . . that Christ will reign personally upon the earth; and, that the earth will be renewed and receive its paradisiacal glory.</i> [Articles of Faith 1:1, 10]<br><br>We know more about the Godhead than all the minds of men have ever conceived--and what we know is true. Furthermore, we know the purposes of Deity for this earth and all of its creatures. Because of what we know and because the Lord has placed upon our shoulders the sacred duty to help bring it to pass, we must not be casual about our Church membership.<br><br>Some are enticed into being less committed for fear of appearing to be too religious. They view "the Church as an institution, but not as a kingdom."<sup>17</sup> "O youth of the noble birthright,"<sup>18</sup> make the work of the Church and kingdom of God the center of your life. When called to serve, say, "Yes," and do your very best. Listen to this charge from the Lord:<br><br><i>Wherefore, seek not the things of this world but seek ye first to build up the kingdom of God, and to establish his righteousness, and all these things shall be added unto you.</i> [JST, Matthew 6:38]<br><br>In just four days from now, on November 9, it will be 150 years since the ill-fated Willie Handcart Company pioneers struggled into the Salt Lake Valley. They had waded through much suffering and death. The storms and their weakened condition had claimed many--the rescuers had saved many more.<br><br>Levi Savage was among those arriving that day. History records his faithful and dogged labors to save the Saints and bring them safely to the valley. But his noble service did not begin on the snowbound plains of Wyoming. This was but another chapter, perhaps the crowning one, in a consecrated life of service.<br><br>Levi was baptized in June 1846 at 26 years of age. Answering the prophet's call to move west, he noted that<br><br><i>we prepared as well as we could for a long journey into a strange and to us wholly unknown country. . . . We bid adieu to the old homestead . . . and directed our course westward, not knowing the place of destination, only we expected to locate somewhere in the western wilds of the Rocky Mountains.</i><sup>19</sup><br><br>On July 16, 1846, he, with other valiant men, again responded to the prophet's urging, enlisted in the Mormon Battalion, and marched approximately 2,000 miles from Council Bluffs, Iowa, to San Diego, California, and then on to Los Angeles. Here they were discharged from government service. Though they knew nothing of the whereabouts of their homes and families, they began their trek to the valley of the Great Salt Lake. The route Levi Savage traveled was an additional 1,300 miles over rugged and hostile terrain, but he finally arrived in the Salt Lake Valley.<br><br>Here Levi pioneered, fought crickets, married, had a son, and buried his wife some months following the child's birth. Ten months after his wife's death, in the October conference of 1852, he and several other faithful brethren were called by the prophet to open a gospel mission to Siam (today's Thailand).<br><br>This time they journeyed by team and wagon back to lower California and the Pacific Ocean. In time, they sailed from San Francisco to Calcutta, bound for their mission to Siam. Levi's journal entry of January 29, 1853, provides us a glimpse into the hearts of these early missionaries. He wrote:<br><br><i>Our gallant ship, propelled by a gentle breeze, steered her course across the boisterous deep for our places of destination; leaving behind us our much loved native land. . . . Each sought his own place for meditation, and there reflected upon the comforts of his home, the affections of his beloved wife and children or friends. . . . But now he was called to take up his abode in the remote parts of the earth, and for what? For the sake of heaping up gold and silver, or to secure for himself the honors, pomp and splendor of this world?</i> No, verily no! But in obedience to the commands of the Lord to carry the message of truth and . . . salvation to the benighted and superstitious nations. <i>Soon after, each retired to his cot for rest and repose. But whether asleep or awake, his mind continued to wander upon the realities of the past, and the prospects of the future.</i><sup>20</sup><br><br>Following his mission, Levi sailed home by way of Boston, Massachusetts, made his way to his place of birth in Greenfield, Ohio, and noted upon his arrival there, "I have circled the globe."<sup>21</sup> He joined the Willie Handcart Company in Iowa City, Iowa, which began a saga of eternal importance to him, his family, and the entire Church. His works in that epic crowned a life of sacrifice and service. Of these pioneers, <i>the benchmark shows: Their faith and works were a beacon in an unbelieving world, their service a pattern for each of us to follow.</i><br><br>We are moved by the words from the clergyman Frederick W. Faber:<br><br><i>Faith of our fathers, living still,</i><br><br><i>In spite of dungeon, fire, and sword;</i><br><br><i>Oh, how our hearts beat high with joy</i><br><br><i>Whene'er we hear that glorious word.</i><br><br><i>Faith of our fathers, we will strive</i><br><br><i>To win all nations unto thee,</i><br><br><i>And thru the truth that comes from God,</i><br><br><i>Mankind shall then be truly free.</i><br><br><i>Faith of our fathers, we will love</i><br><br><i>Both friend and foe in all our strife,</i><br><br><i>And preach thee, too, as love knows how,</i><br><br><i>By kindly words and virtuous life.</i><br><br><i>Faith of our fathers, holy faith,</i><br><br><i>We will be true to thee till death!</i><sup>22</sup><br><br>I bear you my witness, my dear brothers and sisters--God is in His heavens, His name is Elohim, and He knows all of His children, irrespective of from whence they come or where they dwell. Jesus, the Holy One of Israel, is His Beloved Son, the Redeemer of all mankind. Joseph Smith, a young lad, was called by the voice of God and His Holy Son as a prophet, and ensuing from that call the true Church and kingdom of God was restored on the earth. How blessed we are to know these things, and you, my dear brothers and sisters, you stand at the confluence of history. You came from realms of glory. It is your singular privilege to be true to the faith, to press forward in good works. Do what the prophets say. Generations past expect it, generations present are saved by it, generations future depend upon it, and the Holy Spirit will guide you every step of your way.<br><br>In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Keith B.

<h1>tes to Open - Thomas S. Monson - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
It's humbling to sit here and gaze from left to right and see how many people are assembled here waiting for what they might hear from their speaker. It reminds me of a little boy in our fast and testimony meeting a couple of months ago. I watched him from the stand, and I could tell he was fidgeting, trying to get up enough courage to come up and bear his testimony. He was just a little fellow. Finally he made the move. He stood up, walked solemnly up that long aisle, passed in front of me and smiled, stepped over to the pulpit, put his hands down, looked at the audience, removed his hands, and turned around and walked back to his parents.<br><br>All I could do today would be to turn around and walk back to the arms of President Samuelson. I think he would rather I speak now than have to take over. You're my friends. I feel close to you, and it is a privilege to be with you and to speak to you today.<br><br>What a wonderful opportunity you have to attend Brigham Young University and to be taught by the fine faculty we have here. As I think of learning, I am reminded of a father and his son who went fishing one day. After a couple of hours in the boat, the boy suddenly began asking questions about their surroundings.<br><br>"How does this boat float?" he asked his father.<br><br>His father thought for a moment and then replied, "I don't rightly know, son."<br><br>The boy returned to his contemplation, then looked again at his father. "How do fish breathe underwater?" he asked.<br><br>Once again the father replied, "Don't rightly know, son."<br><br>Next the boy asked, "Why is the sky blue?"<br><br>Again, the father replied, "Don't rightly know, son."<br><br>Worried he would annoy his father, the boy said, "Dad, do you mind my asking you all of these questions?"<br><br>"Of course not, son. If you don't ask questions, you'll never learn anything."<br><br>As I have pondered what message I would wish to leave with you today, I have thought of the scripture from Ecclesiastes, or the Preacher: "To every thing there is a season, and a time to every purpose under the heaven."<sup>1</sup> This is your time. What will you do with it? Are you where you want to be with your life? If not, what are you going to do about it?<br><br>The Prophet Joseph Smith counseled:<br><br><i>Happiness is the object and design of our existence; and will be the end thereof, if we pursue the path that leads to it; and this path is virtue, uprightness, faithfulness, holiness, and keeping all the commandments of God.</i><sup>2</sup><br><br>I have devoted considerable time reflecting on years gone by, when I was your age and facing your challenges, your objectives, your opportunities, your futures.<br><br>During my high school years, and into my first year at the University of Utah, World War II was raging in full conflict. The daily newspapers carried the news of men dying, cities being obliterated, hospitals filled with grievously burned and maimed servicemen. They faced futures altered, dreams shattered, homecomings ruined.<br><br>It didn't seem to matter that gasoline was severely rationed. This was a catalyst for double dating and carpooling. Textbooks were delayed due to paper shortages. They weren't available until midway through our courses, and yet we were expected to know everything in them by final exams.<br><br>It was the era of the big bands, and everyone enjoyed a date to the dance, although dancing then was quite different from dancing now.<br><br>Looming in the background of every thought for each young man was the inevitable call to serve one's country. Left behind were the comforts of family and home, the teachings of classrooms, and, of course, a special girlfriend. (By the way, she and I have now been married for 58 years!)<br><br>Whether speaking of your generation or of mine, there are some constancies amid the changes of the times. The past is behind--we must learn from it. The future is ahead--we must prepare for it. The present is now--we must live in it.<br><br>Years ago, I discovered a thought which is true and, in a way, prophetic. It is this: The gate of history swings on small hinges, and so do people's lives.<br><br>Today I have chosen to discuss three gates which you alone can open. You must pass through each gate if you are to be successful in your journey through mortality:<br><br>• Gate Number 1: The Gate of Preparation<br><br>• Gate Number 2: The Gate of Performance<br><br>• Gate Number 3: The Gate of Service<br><h2><b>The Gate of Preparation</b></h2><br>First, let us speak of the Gate of Preparation. The Lord has counseled, "If ye are prepared ye shall not fear."<sup>3</sup> Fear is the enemy of growth and accomplishment.<br><br>It is necessary to prepare and to plan so that we don't fritter away our lives. Without a goal, there can be no real success. The best definition of success I have ever found goes something like this: "Success is the progressive realization of a worthy ideal." Someone has said that the trouble with not having a goal is that you can spend your life running up and down the field and never crossing the goal line.<br><br>Years ago there was a romantic and fanciful ballad that contained the words "Wishing will make it so; Just keep on wishing and cares will go."<sup>4</sup> I want to state here and now that wishing will not replace thorough preparation to meet the trials of life. Preparation is hard work, but it is absolutely essential for our progress.<br><br>Concerning your preparation, let me share with you this time-honored advice, which has never been more applicable than it is right now: It is not the number of hours you put in but what you put in the hours that counts.<br><br>Have discipline in your preparations. Have checkpoints where you can determine if you're on course. Study something you like and which will make it possible for you to support a family. While this counsel would apply almost certainly to every young man, it also has relevance to young women. There are situations in life which we cannot predict which will require employable skills. You can't get the jobs of tomorrow until you have the skills of today. Business in the new economy, where the only guarantee is change, brings us to serious preparation.<br><br>Make certain as you prepare that you do not procrastinate. Someone has said that procrastination is the thief of time. Actually, procrastination is much more. It is the thief of our self-respect. It nags at us and spoils our fun. It deprives us of the fullest realization of our ambitions and our hopes.<br><br>In academic preparation, I found it a good practice to read a text with the idea that I would be asked to explain that which the author wrote and its application to the subject it covered. Also, I tried to be attentive in any lecture in the classroom and to pretend that I would be called upon to present the same lecture to others. While this practice is very hard work, it certainly helps during test week!<br><br>It is hazardous in the extreme to count on a situation typical of one I read about some years ago pertaining to a large, ecclesiastically oriented college in the eastern part of America, where every student had to enroll in a class called Religion 101. The professor of that particular class had been there many years and loved the writings and teachings of the Apostle Paul. He loved them with such vigor that that is about all he taught in Religion 101. Consequently, he would tell the class at the beginning of the semester, "I will not give any examinations during the semester except the final. The result of the final examination will determine your grade for the course."<br><br>Now, that would be kind of overwhelming, except that every semester for 21 years he had given the same examination in every class of Religion 101. The examination consisted of one question. And for all those years, the question had been the same. Can you believe it? What a snap class! The question had always been: <i>Describe the travels and teachings of the Apostle Paul.</i><br><br>Some young people would come to class the first day and get their name on the record. That was about it until the final examination. Then they would come, having boned up on an answer to that question.<br><br>One particular semester, three young men who had followed that practice of registering and then absenting themselves until the end of the semester sat with their pencils poised as the professor went to the chalkboard and said, "I shall place on the board the question on which your entire grade will depend." To their great astonishment he did not write the usual question. Instead, he wrote, "Criticize the Sermon on the Mount."<br><br>One of the three young men said, "I don't even know what book it is in." He closed his test book and left the room.<br><br>The second young man thought for a moment. He didn't know anything about the Sermon on the Mount because he had prepared for a different test question. He left the room, anticipating a failing grade.<br><br>The third one of this trio stayed in the class. He wrote line after line and page after page. His friends were outside in the hallway, looking through the door window, wondering what he was writing. They knew that he had no more knowledge of the Sermon on the Mount than did they, that he had prepared for the question that was not asked. They wondered what he was writing in that test book.<br><br>He didn't tell them until the day the papers were examined and returned. They all huddled around to see what grade he had received. He had an A on the test and therefore an A in the course. As he opened the cover of the exam book, there was the question: "Criticize the Sermon on the Mount." And here is what this enterprising young man had written: "I will leave it to someone far more knowledgeable and experienced than I am to criticize the greatest sermon from the greatest life ever lived. As for me, I would prefer to describe the travels and teachings of the Apostle Paul."<br><br>May I now turn to the Gate of Performance. Like the Gate of Preparation, you alone can open it.<br><h2><b>The Gate of Performance</b></h2><br>The Apostle Paul provided sound counsel to guide our performance: "Let no man despise thy youth; but be thou an example of the believers, in word, in conversation, in charity, in spirit, in faith, in purity."<sup>5</sup><br><br>Remember that the mantle of leadership, my brothers and sisters, is not the cloak of comfort but the robe of responsibility. Accountability is not for the intention but for the deed. You must continue to refuse to compromise with expediency. You must maintain the courage to defy the consensus. You must continue to choose the harder right, instead of the easier wrong. The poet John Greenleaf Whittier expressed this truth when he wrote these lines:<br><br><i>For of all sad words of tongue or pen,</i><br><i>The saddest are these: "It might have been!"</i><sup>6</sup><br><br>Don't forget: One of the saddest things in life is wasted talent.<br><br><i>It is a good idea to be ambitious, to have goals, to want to be good at what you do, but it is a terrible mistake to let drive and ambition get in the way of treating people with kindness and decency. The point is not that they will then be nice to you. It is that you will feel better about yourself.</i><sup>7</sup><br><br>Whenever we are inclined to feel burdened down with the blows of life, let us remember that others have passed the same way, have endured, and then have overcome. When we have done all that we are able, we can rely on God's promised help.<br><br>You, my brothers and sisters, have access to the lighthouse of the Lord. There is no fog so dense, no night so dark, no mariner so lost, no gale so strong as to render useless the lighthouse of the Lord. It beckons through the storms of life. It seems to call, "This way to safety; this way to home."<br><br>Will you remember to select your friends carefully, for you will tend to be like them and to be found where they choose to go. Consider the love your parents have for you and that you have for them. Instead of simply asking them, "Where are the keys to your car?" you might add, "I'll be a bit late tonight." Often the clock ticks more loudly and the hands move more slowly when the night is dark, the hour is late, and a son or a daughter has not yet come home. A telephone call--"We're okay; we just stopped for something to eat. Don't worry; we're fine"--is an indication of true love of parents and of the training of a Latter-day Saint home.<br><br>Let me relate another example. At the funeral service of a noble General Authority, H. Verlan Andersen, a tribute was expressed by a son. He related that, years earlier, he had a special school date on a Saturday night. He borrowed from his father the family car. As he obtained the car keys and headed for the door, his father said, "Remember, tomorrow is Sunday. The car will need more gas before then. Be sure to fill the tank before coming home."<br><br>Elder Andersen's son then related that the evening activity was wonderful. Friends met, refreshments were served, and all had a good time. In his exuberance, however, he failed to follow his father's instruction and add fuel to the car's tank before returning home. He simply forgot.<br><br>Sunday morning dawned. Elder Andersen discovered the gas gauge showed empty. The son saw his father put the car keys on the table. In the Andersen family the Sabbath day was a day for worship and thanksgiving, and not for purchases.<br><br>As the funeral message continued, Elder Andersen's son declared, "I saw my father put on his coat, bid us good-bye, and walk the long distance to the chapel, that he might attend an early meeting." Duty called. Truth was not held hostage to expedience.<br><br>In concluding his funeral message, Elder Andersen's son said, "No son ever was taught more effectively by his father than I was on that occasion. My father not only knew the truth, but he also taught the truth and lived the truth."<br><br>Youth need fewer critics and more models to follow. Your own personal performance in all aspects of your life, including reading the scriptures regularly and following their teachings, will help you to become such models. Then the Gate of Performance will open before you as you proceed to Gate Number 3--the Gate of Service.<br><h2><b>The Gate of Service</b></h2><br>Albert Schweitzer, the noted theologian and missionary physician, declared: "I don't know what your destiny will be, but one thing I know: the only ones among you who will be really happy are those who have sought and found how to serve."<br><br>May I share with you an experience I had with a dear friend of mine, Louis McDonald. Louis never married. Because of a crippling disease, he had never known a day without pain nor many days without loneliness. One winter's day, as I visited him, he was slow in answering the doorbell's ring. I entered his well-kept home; the temperature in save but one room--the kitchen--was a chilly 40 degrees. The reason? Insufficient money to heat any other room. The walls needed papering, the ceilings needed to be lowered, the cupboards needed to be filled.<br><br>I was troubled by Louis's needs. A bishop was consulted, and a miracle of love, prompted by testimony, took place. The members of the ward--particularly the young adults--were organized and the labor of love begun.<br><br>A month later, my friend Louis called and asked if I would come and see what had happened to him. I did and indeed beheld a miracle. The sidewalks which had been uprooted by large poplar trees had been replaced, the porch of the home rebuilt, a new door with glistening hardware installed, the ceilings lowered, the walls papered, the woodwork painted, the roof replaced, and the cupboards filled. No longer was the home chilly and uninviting. It now seemed to whisper a warm welcome.<br><br>Louis saved until last showing me his pride and joy: there on his bed was a beautiful plaid quilt bearing the crest of his McDonald family clan. It had been made with loving care by the women of the Relief Society. Before leaving, I discovered that each week the Young Adults would bring in a hot dinner and share a home evening. Warmth had replaced the cold, repairs had transformed the wear of years, but, more significantly, hope had dispelled despair, and now love reigned triumphant.<br><br>All who participated in this moving drama of real life had discovered a new and personal appreciation of the Master's teaching "It is more blessed to give than to receive."<sup>8</sup><br><br>The holy scriptures are replete with examples of service by the servants of the Lord and by Jesus Himself. Of Him it is recorded: "[He] went about doing good, . . . for God was with him."<sup>9</sup> He caused lame beggars to walk and blind men to see. He cleansed the lepers and healed the centurion's servant. He restored to the widow at Nain her dead son, who through Him now lived. He raised Lazarus from the tomb. He forgave the woman taken in adultery. He atoned for the sins of all of us. He died that we might eternally live.<br><br>As we go about our daily lives, we discover countless opportunities to follow the example of the Savior. When our hearts are in tune with His teachings, we discover the unmistakable nearness of His divine help. We are on the Lord's errand, and when we are on the Lord's errand, we are entitled to the Lord's help.<br><br>Through the years, the offices I have occupied have been decorated with lovely paintings of peaceful and pastoral scenes. However, there is one picture that always hangs on the wall which I face when seated behind my desk. It is a constant reminder of Him whom I serve, for it is a picture of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ. When confronted with a vexing problem or difficult decision, I always gaze at that picture of the Master and silently ask myself the question "What would He have me do?" No longer does doubt linger, nor does indecision prevail. The way to go is clear, and the pathway before me beckons. Such will also work for each of you as you focus on what the Lord would have you do.<br><br>The noble King Benjamin counseled his many subjects, after a lengthy but powerful sermon on the subject of service: "When ye are in the service of your fellow beings ye are only in the service of your God."<sup>10</sup><br><br>At times we may think that no one cares--but someone <i>always</i> cares! Your Heavenly Father will not leave you to struggle alone but stands ever ready to help. Most often such assistance comes quietly, at other times with dramatic impact. Elder Marion D. Hanks, some years ago, related an account of one who received such assistance. He told of a young divorced woman, the mother of seven children then ranging in ages from five to 16. One evening she went across the street to deliver something to a neighbor. She indicated later that as she turned to walk back home, she could see her house lighted up. She could hear echoes of her children as she had walked out of the door a few minutes earlier: "Mom, what are we going to have for dinner?" "Can you take me to the library?" "Mom, I have to get some poster paper tonight." Tired and weary, she thought of all of those children who were home waiting for her to come home and meet their needs. She said that at that moment her burdens felt very heavy on her shoulders.<br><br>She recalled looking through tears toward the sky, and she said, "O my Father, I just can't handle things tonight. I'm too tired. I can't face it. I can't go home and take care of all those children alone. Could I come to You and stay with You for just one night? I'll come back in the morning."<br><br>She didn't really hear the words of reply, but she heard them in her mind. The answer was, "No, little one, you can't come to me now, for you would never wish to return. But I can come to you."<br><br>Seek heavenly guidance one day at a time. The help you need may not come just as you envision, but it will come. When we remember that each of us is literally a child of God, we will not find it difficult to approach Him.<br><br>Seek heavenly help also to know how to serve others. There is no feeling so gratifying nor knowledge so comforting as knowing that our Father has answered the prayer of another through you.<br><br>I close with a tender yet simple experience. Each time I would visit Mattie, a dear friend and an older widow whom I had known for many years and whose bishop I had been, my heart grieved at her utter loneliness. One of her sons lived many miles away, halfway across the country, but he rarely visited her. He would come to Salt Lake, take care of business matters, see his brothers and sisters, and leave for his own home without visiting his mother. When I would call to see this mother, she would make an excuse for her boy and tell me just how busy he was. Her words did not carry power or conviction. They simply masked her disappointment and grief.<br><br>The years passed. The loneliness deepened. Then one afternoon I received a telephone call. That special son was in Salt Lake City. A change had occurred in his life. He had become imbued with a desire to help others, to adhere more faithfully to God's commandments. He was proud of his newfound ability to cast off the old man and become new and useful. He wanted to come immediately to my office that he might share with me the joy in service that he now felt. With all my heart I wanted to welcome him and to extend my personal congratulations. Then I thought of his grieving mother, that lonely widow, and suggested, "Dick, I can see you at four o'clock this afternoon, provided you visit your dear mother before coming here." He agreed.<br><br>Just before our appointment, a call came to me. It was that same mother. There was an excitement in her voice that words cannot adequately describe. She exuded enthusiasm even over the phone and declared proudly, "Bishop, you'll never guess who has just visited me." Before I could answer, she exclaimed, "Dick was here! My son Dick has spent the past hour with me. He is a new man. He has found himself. I'm the happiest mother in the world!" Then she paused and quietly spoke: "I just knew he would not really forget me."<br><br>Years later, at Mattie's funeral, Dick and I spoke tenderly of that experience. We had witnessed a glimpse of God's healing power through the window of a mother's faith in her son.<br><br>Today I pray earnestly that all of us may open wide the three gates of which I have spoken--the Gate of Preparation, the Gate of Performance, and the Gate of Service--and walk through them to our exaltation. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Thomas S.

<br>
My dear brothers and sisters, do we really mean what we say when we address each other as brother and sister?<br><br>These are rather peculiar titles for many people not familiar with our Mormon culture. Names such as Brother Jim or Sister Smith are used fondly and respectfully when addressing each other to express our kinship in the family of God. Why do we use these affectionate titles?<br><br>Let me quote from the missionary guide <i>Preach My Gospel:</i><br><br><i>God is the Father of our spirits. We are literally His children, and He loves us. We lived as spirit children of our Father in Heaven before we were born on this earth. We were not, however, like our Heavenly Father, nor could we ever become like Him and enjoy all the blessings that He enjoys without the experience of living in mortality with a physical body.</i><br><br><i>God's whole purpose--His work and His glory--is to enable each of us to enjoy all His blessings. He has provided a perfect plan to accomplish His purpose. We understood and accepted this plan before we came to the earth.</i> [<i>Preach My Gospel: A Guide to Missionary Service </i>(Salt Lake City: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 2004), 48]<br><br>When I was a small boy growing up, my older brother was bigger than life to me. He was nine years older and the best player on every team he played on. He always looked out for his little brother and spent many hours teaching me the skills of various sports. Since we shared a bedroom--much to his chagrin--I oftentimes would hear him awake late at night and slip out to the backyard to lift weights to get stronger. I spent many nights peering out the window at his example of extra effort and dreamed I one day could be like him. He truly was, and still remains, a great brother. He continues to influence my life for good as my big brother.<br><br>Elder Henry B. Eyring taught: "Your responsibility is to touch people so that they will make the choices that will take them toward eternal life. And eternal life is the greatest of all the gifts of God" ("To Touch a Life with Faith," <i>Ensign,</i> November 1995, 37–38).<br><br>Perhaps one of the more thought-provoking questions asked in the scriptures is the one asked by Cain when questioned by the Lord on the whereabouts of his brother Abel: "Am I my brother's keeper?" (Genesis 4:9). Cain had slain his younger brother because God had accepted Abel's offering and rejected his. Cain's words have come to symbolize man's unwillingness to accept responsibility for the welfare of his "brothers" on this earth. In our present-day situations, we would all do well, as children of our Heavenly Father, to contemplate our answer to that same question: "Am I my brother's keeper?"<br><br>To be able to answer in the affirmative, "Yes, I am my brother's keeper!" we must be obedient to the command given us by Jesus when He said:<br><br><i>A new commandment I give unto you, That ye love one another; as I have loved you, that ye also love one another.</i><br><br><i>By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to another.</i> [John 13:34–35]<br><br>Just how do we determine who our brothers and sisters are? The Apostle Paul stated on Mars Hill that God "hath made of <i>one blood all nations</i> of men for to dwell on all the face of the earth" (Acts 17:26; emphasis added). All mankind have chosen to come to this earth in obedience to the plan of salvation and are indeed the sons and daughters of God--and thus brothers and sisters in His heavenly family.<br><br>Modern revelation further describes the familial relationship that we are granted through the Atonement of our Savior. We learn from King Benjamin of our place in the family of Christ:<br><br><i>And now, because of the covenant which ye have made ye shall be called the children of Christ, his sons, and his daughters; for behold, this day he hath spiritually begotten you; for ye say that your hearts are changed through faith on his name; therefore, ye are born of him and have become his sons and his daughters.</i> [Mosiah 5:7]<br><br>We catch a further glimpse of who Jesus considers His brothers and sisters from this exchange found in Matthew:<br><br><i>While he yet talked to the people, behold, his mother and his brethren stood without, desiring to speak with him.</i><br><br><i>Then one said unto him, Behold, thy mother and thy brethren stand without, desiring to speak with thee.</i><br><br><i>But he answered and said unto him that told him, Who is my mother? and who are my brethren?</i><br><br><i>And he stretched forth his hand toward his disciples, and said, Behold my mother and my brethren!</i><br><br><i>For whosoever shall do the will of my Father which is in heaven, the same is my brother, and sister, and mother.</i> [Matthew 12:46–50]<br><br>The hoped-for result of this knowledge of our heavenly family was described by Paul in his letter to the Romans:<br><br><i>Let love be without dissimulation. Abhor that which is evil; cleave to that which is good.</i><br><br><i>Be kindly affectioned one to another with brotherly love; in honor preferring one another.</i> [Romans 12:9–10]<br><br>Furthermore, we are instructed in Timothy:<br><br><i>Rebuke not an elder, but intreat him as a father; and the younger men as brethren;</i><br><br><i>The elder women as mothers; the younger as sisters, with all purity.</i> [1 Timothy 5:1–2]<br><br>Brothers and sisters, love one another. Serve each other. I would think that most of you here today have followed and accepted the premise of brotherhood and sisterhood as taught from the scriptures. The issue is not so much that you don't accept a stranger as a brother or sister as much as it is you simply have not conditioned yourself to serve them. Serving those who we love and who love us--those who think like us or look like us or speak like us, or even worship like us--is good. However, we must learn to reach out to those we don't know: to the discarded, the sick, those less fortunate, the inflicted, the lonely, and those we don't necessarily understand.<br><br>The story of the dramatic rescue of the members of the Martin and Willie Handcart Companies--a group of our early pioneer Saints trapped and frozen on the plains--is one that inspires me today to listen for the call to action and GO! Elder Jeffrey R. Holland reminded us that being our brother's keeper is a theme we need oft remember. Quoting from Elder Holland's most recent general conference address:<br><br><i>As surely as the rescue of those in need was the general conference theme of October 1856, so too is it the theme of this conference and last conference and the one to come next spring. ... The needy ... can be rescued only by those who have more and know more and can help more. And don't worry about asking, "Where are they?" They are everywhere, on our right hand and on our left, in our neighborhoods and in the workplace, in every community and county and nation of this world. Take your team and wagon; load it with your love, your testimony, and a spiritual sack of flour; then drive in any direction. The Lord will lead you to those in need if you will but embrace the gospel of Jesus Christ.</i> ["Prophets in the Land Again," <i>Ensign,</i> November 2006, 106]<br><br>President Thomas S. Monson, speaking of our call to service, stated:<br><br><i>This is the service that counts, the service to which all of us have been called: the service of the Lord Jesus Christ.</i><br><br><i>Along your pathway of life you will observe that you are not the only traveler. There are others who need your help. There are feet to steady, hands to grasp, minds to encourage, hearts to inspire, and souls to save.</i> ["How Firm a Foundation," <i>Ensign,</i> November 2006, 68]<br><br>The Prophet Joseph Smith--oft referred to by the people of his day as Brother Joseph--was the epitome of selflessness. He reached out to strangers in many ways to assist them and bless their lives. We need not look far to find excellent examples of brotherly and sisterly love. The Lord's chosen servants of today emulate their predecessors and shine a light on all that is good, devoting their lives to serving others.<br><br>A story is told of a man having a conversation with the Lord one day. He said, "Lord, I would like to know what heaven and hell are like."<br><br>The Lord led the man to two doors. He opened one of the doors, and the man looked in. In the middle of the room was a large round table. In the middle of the table was a large pot of stew, which smelled delicious and made the man's mouth water.<br><br>The people sitting around the table were thin and sickly. They appeared to be famished. They were holding spoons with very long handles that were strapped to their arms. Each found it possible to reach into the pot of stew and take a spoonful, but because the handle was longer than their arms, they could not get the spoons back into their mouths.<br><br>The man shuddered at the sight of their misery and suffering. The Lord said, "You have seen hell."<br><br>They went to the next room and opened the door. It was exactly the same as the first one. There was the large round table with the large pot of stew that made the man's mouth water. The people were equipped with the same long-handled spoons strapped to their arms, but here the people were well nourished and plump, laughing and talking.<br><br>The man said, "I don't understand!"<br><br>"It is simple," said the Lord. "It requires but one skill. You see, they have learned to feed each other, while the greedy think only of themselves."<br><br>Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., wondered why men do not treat each other like brothers and sisters. Let me quote Dr. King:<br><br><i>Modern man has brought this whole world to an awe-inspiring threshold of the future....</i><br><br><i>Yet ... something basic is missing. There is a sort of poverty of the spirit which stands in glaring contrast to our scientific and technological abundance. The richer we have become materially, the poorer we have become morally and spiritually. We have learned to fly the air like birds and swim the sea like fish, but we have not learned the simple art of living together as brothers.</i> [Speech accepting the Nobel Peace Prize (11 December 1964)]<br><br>I believe Dr. King would be pleased with the response from people all over the world to our brothers and sisters in Indonesia who were suffering from the devastation of last year's tsunami. Millions of people came to the aid of brothers and sisters they didn't even know. They acted on the impression of loving our neighbors as ourselves (see Matthew 19:19).<br><br>Brothers and sisters, the business of making a living, raising a family, receiving an education, and any other worthy endeavor we are involved in truly tests how we answer the question "Am I my brother's keeper?" God works miracles in the lives of His children through the Christlike service rendered by their brothers and sisters. A warm smile, a friendly greeting, a door held open, any good deed--however simple it may be--can turn a bad day into a good one.<br><br>I enjoy singing the words of a favorite Church hymn:<br><br><i>Have I done any good in the world today?</i><br><br><i>Have I helped anyone in need?</i><br><br><i>Have I cheered up the sad and made someone feel glad?</i><br><br><i>If not, I have failed indeed.</i><br><br>["Have I Done Any Good?" <i>Hymns,</i> 1985, no. 223]<br><br>It will be a long time before I forget the special kindness expressed by my friend Verl Rasband, an older gentleman who attended my ward. Verl served well in many capacities throughout his life and still finds the time and makes the effort today to continue to make a difference in the lives of others. Verl learns the first names of many of the children in our ward and goes out of his way to greet and talk with them regularly. At first the children are surprised that an older man would even know their name. But his warm greeting makes them feel good. As a result of his kind heart and sweet spirit, all my children respect, admire, and love Brother Rasband. From his fine example my children now go out of their way to greet Verl before he can find them. His love is contagious.<br><br>It is unlikely that any of us will be honored for our service, but recognition is not the reward. Our reward is blessing lives. Loving one another is not merely a suggestion or a good recommendation. It is a commandment. When we are obedient to this command, our lives and the lives of our brothers and sisters are richly blessed. As we express our love through actions on behalf of our brothers and sisters, we set a good example to others of Christlike service.<br><br>BYU is a <i>big</i> place with <i>many</i> people moving in <i>all</i> directions. It sometimes may seem a difficult task to make a difference in the life of one of your fellow students, faculty, or staff members. I often enjoy looking for examples of good works here on campus and seeing acts of brotherly kindness. Two years ago, when I was appointed director of athletics, I was touched by the many helping hands extended to my associates and me by brothers and sisters across campus. Words of encouragement, free time spent assisting us with our plans, and other extra effort enabled us to lighten our load and ensure us a good start. As a result of their service to us, I feel a strong camaraderie and a greater desire to do more to further build up our campus.<br><br>One group of BYU students I admire--our own BYU football team--refers to each other affectionately as the Band of Brothers.<br><br>The team's motto was inspired from the lines of Shakespeare's play <i>Henry V:</i><br><br><i>We few, we happy few, we band of brothers;</i><br><br><i>For he to-day that sheds his blood with me</i><br><br><i>Shall be my brother.</i><br><br>[William Shakespeare, <i>Henry V,</i> act 4, scene 3, lines 60–62]<br><br>This year's members of the BYU football team have bonded to the cause of restoring tradition, being honorable, and living by the Spirit. Skeptics were cynical concerning the rare approach of this team and their leader. How can there be enough time to prepare for game day when weekly firesides are held on the eve of each game? Rough and tumble football players will get soft focusing on things of the Spirit instead of visualizing on-field violence.<br><br>This Band of Brothers strives toward holding each other accountable for the good of the whole. Selfish motives are shelved in place of team objectives. The duty to represent not only each other but also BYU and The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is not just a part-time thing. When one falters, all are affected. When one succeeds, all benefit!<br><br>Coach Bronco Mendenhall and the team's leadership council have instituted what they call the Big Brother Program. Each younger player on the team is paired up with one of the upperclassmen. Each week the "big brother" conducts an interview with his "younger brother." They address such topics as academics, football, family, girlfriends, spirituality, and any other issue the two care to discuss. Then the big brother writes a letter to Coach Mendenhall sharing any thoughts, experiences or concerns the two might have concerning each other, the team, or their teammates. The letters are confidential--some are even sacred to Bronco. Privately, Coach Mendenhall is able to assist his boys based on their communication. What has developed within this year's team goes way beyond what is witnessed on the field of play, as can be seen in such activities as the Band of Brothers performing a team hymn at a recent pre-game fireside in Fort Collins, Colorado, the night before the Cougars played the Colorado State Rams.<br><br>Like many of you here today, my life took further shape through my experiences as a student at BYU. Not only was I challenged physically and emotionally through athletics, but I also grew mentally and emotionally through the rigors of academics and was changed forever by the ever-present Spirit that is often expressed through many brothers and sisters on campus.<br><br>I will be eternally grateful for the wonderful example of the best teacher I ever had: Joe Wood--a man more affectionately referred to by his students as Uncle Joe. Uncle Joe taught religion and history here. When I arrived at BYU, I was not a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. I was way out of my element: in a very different culture, homesick for my family, and feeling like a fish out of water. As weeks went by during my first semester, I considered abandoning my hopes and dreams for BYU and returning to the friendly confines of home. Somehow, Uncle Joe saw something missing in me. He went out of his way to approach me after class and encourage me to stay strong. He reached out a hand of friendship, which I gladly accepted. He continued to look after me, and soon I looked forward to his class as the highlight of my day. He laughed and smiled and even shed tears of gratitude. He called his students by their first name and often shook our hand or put his arm around our shoulders. I grew to realize that he hadn't just taken a special interest in <i>me.</i> He made <i>everyone</i> in class feel special. The sweet spirit that radiated from Uncle Joe was what first softened my heart to the gospel of Jesus Christ. I am grateful for all people on our campus like Uncle Joe who care enough to make a difference in the lives of their brothers and sisters.<br><br>I love the spirit of our BYU students. Your desire to be the best you can be--to educate and train yourselves toward becoming future family, community, and national leaders--is impressive. Many of you have made the worthy choice to pause from your college education to serve full-time missions for the Lord. Truly this is brotherly love in action: to seek out your brothers and sisters from all walks of life and from the four corners of the earth, to find all those who have been separated from the truth, and then to help lead them back to their Father in Heaven and remind them of the one great plan of salvation that leads to eternal life.<br><br>Ask yourself this question: Have I done any good in the world today?<br><br><i>Then wake up and do something more</i><br><br><i>Than dream of your mansions above.</i><br><br><i>Doing good is a pleasure, a joy beyond measure,</i><br><br><i>A blessing of duty and love.</i><br><br>["Have I Done Any Good?" <i>Hymns,</i> 1985, no. 223]<br><br>It is my hope and prayer that we may serve our Lord by being actively engaged in blessing the lives of <i>all</i> our brothers and sisters and being an instrument in the hands of our Heavenly Father, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Tom Holmoe was BYU athletic director when this devotional talk was delivered on 28 November 2006.</i><br><br><i>© Brigham Young University.

<h1> Earth, Some Restrictions Apply - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
During an exceptionally hectic morning my mind was full to overflowing as I thought about the stress of my day at work, family responsibilities, and additional large assignments I had at the time. I was trying to work out the physical and emotional commitment to each and was overwhelmed, knowing that one person with two hands and 24 hours in a day couldn't possibly do it all. I turned on the car radio only to hear the kind of news that makes you want to cry. As all these things swirled through my brain, the thought came to mind: "So much for peace on earth, good will to men." I wondered how the heavenly host at the birth of Christ could have possibly pronounced peace on earth and good will to men when normal people like me can be distracted by chaos, feel a lack of peace, and find a lack of evidence of good will.<br><br>Because of that little experience and the musing I did, I decided to prepare this talk about peace and good will. I began my preparation with the scriptures and read the account of the angels' appearance to the shepherds. I imagined how the shepherds must have felt, how startled they must have been, what the angel might have looked like, and how the heavenly host appeared. As I imagined the heavenly host, I saw a group of beautiful angels illuminated by heavenly light and expressing exquisite joy through song. My children are young, and in our home the expressions of happiness and joy are full-body experiences, so the angels in my thoughts were not standing still; in my imagination they were dancing for joy. Then I got to the verse in Luke from which I believe Henry Wadsworth Longfellow took his familiar phrase "peace on earth, good will to men." The heavenly host sang out, "Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men."<sup>1</sup><br><br>I used the tools available to me on the Web and several commentaries in the Harold B. Lee Library to learn as much as I could about this scripture. I found that all of the conference addresses that quote this particular verse speak primarily of peace. Peace is mentioned in the scriptures multiple times and good will only a small handful of times. The two ideas of peace and good will are found together only once, in Luke 2:14. Through all of my reading and studying I decided that from a purely cerebral standpoint I think I understand the "glory to God in the highest" part and the "on earth peace" part, but when it came to "good will toward men" I was stumped. My dictionary defines <i>good will</i> as "a desire for the well-being of others; benevolence,"<sup>2</sup> but I couldn't quite figure out how it fit into the verse. It had never occurred to me that I didn't really understand the scripture I had read literally hundreds of times.<br><br>I questioned if the angels commanded the people on earth to have "good will toward men" at the same time they pronounced peace on earth--that is, to have peace and be men of good will. I wondered if perhaps the good will mentioned was a reference to the good will of our Father expressed to us by the coming of His Only Begotten Son, the source of peace to the earth. Then I considered if perhaps the mention of good will could possibly be a condition that has to exist in order for peace to be experienced on earth.<br><br>I read several passages from books--and there are a couple of different opinions by very convincing authors, some of them learned LDS scholars and other qualified sources. I do not claim to be an expert on this subject, nor to be worthy to declare the one true way to interpret the scripture. I will leave that to each of you to discover through your own investigation. In the end, all of the different possibilities may be true, and I don't believe one interpretation contradicts the others sufficiently to cause anyone to have heartburn--unless that person happens to be writing a devotional address. For the purpose of today's discussion I have chosen to assume "good will toward men" refers to a condition that must exist in the hearts of men in order for peace to be felt on earth. In other words, the scripture could be read, "Glory in the highest to God and on earth peace among men of good will."<sup>3</sup> Another way to state this, consistent with messages we receive in the media today, is "Glory to God in the highest and on earth peace--some restrictions apply." Some may assume this is proof that in heaven there is a legal office--I personally won't go that far.<br><br>One reason I believe that peace comes to earth with restrictions in place is based on the fact that I have experienced that phenomenon in my own life. The times I have felt the greatest peace were times when I was striving to be an instrument in the Lord's hands and was purposefully reaching out to others. We read "there is no peace, saith my God, to the wicked"<sup>4</sup> in the scriptures and sing "there is peace in righteous doing"<sup>5</sup> from the hymnbook.<br><br>The restrictions that apply to the ability to have peace on earth are somewhat specific and have nothing to do with the circumstances we find ourselves in: We can be unprepared for final exams, papers, or projects; have minimal financial resources; still have no idea what we should get for the hard-to-shop-for person in our life; have an undeclared major; be a graduate without a job offer or graduate school acceptance; have health concerns, relationship issues, acne, or a bad haircut; or live in areas where there are wars, rumors of wars, religious intolerance, oppressive leaders, or obnoxious radio talk show hosts and still have the peace the angels promised.<br><br>Henry Wadsworth Longfellow probably understood this when he penned the poem "Christmas Bells" that would be set to music and become a favorite Christmas carol--the refrain of which I mentioned earlier.<br><br>Mr. Longfellow used church bells ringing on Christmas Day as the setting for a poem he wrote during the Civil War. The fighting had been fierce and touched the lives of the Longfellow family personally. Mr. Longfellow's son Charles, who had enlisted in the Union Army at 17 years of age, had arrived home about two weeks prior to Christmas 1863 after being critically injured in a battle.<sup>6</sup> While Charles eventually recovered from his wounds, his father was likely concerned about the long-term health of his son and of his country. In addition to these concerns, Mr. Longfellow continued to feel the grave loss of his beloved wife, Francis Appleton Longfellow, also known as Fanny. In 1861, the same year the Civil War broke out, Fanny died from injuries she sustained when her light summer dress ignited in their home. The light weight of the fabric and the hoops she wore allowed ample oxygen to feed the flames, and Mrs. Longfellow was quickly engulfed. Mr. Longfellow attempted to extinguish the fire and was himself burned in the process. With her death he was left to raise five children and manage the affairs of his home as a single parent.<sup>7</sup> The death of his wife and his son's critical injuries were not the only tragedies in Mr. Longfellow's life. Fanny was Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's second wife, and together they had a daughter also named Frances who died when she was 17 months old.<sup>8</sup> His first wife, Mary Potter Longfellow, died just over a month after she miscarried during her sixth month of pregnancy.<sup>9</sup> This was a man who had every reason to pity himself and feel cranky about his condition, and yet he declared in beautiful verse:<br><br><i>Then pealed the bells more loud and deep:</i><br><br><i>"God is not dead, nor doth he sleep;</i><br><br><i>The wrong shall fail, the right prevail,</i><br><br><i>With peace on earth, good will to men."</i><br><br><i>Till, ringing, singing, on its way,</i><br><br><i>The world revolved from night to day,</i><br><br><i>A voice, a chime, a chant sublime,</i><br><br><i>Of peace on earth, good will to men!</i><sup>10</sup><br><br>Jesus Christ, that highly anticipated infant whose birth has been celebrated with the ringing of Christmas bells, is a perfect example for us of how to feel peace and good will. The circumstances of His life were anything but tranquil. His world was politically unstable. He and His family experienced life under Roman rule and a Jewish king who wanted Jesus dead. Jesus was challenged and criticized. He felt hunger, fatigue, sorrow, temptation, and frustration. He was mocked, abandoned, and betrayed. In the world where Jesus lived there were problems in families and people had severe illness, injuries, and tragic losses. Neighbors were not always kind to one another, at times business was bad, salt lost its savor, and occasionally folks ran out of refreshments during wedding receptions; and yet every incident we have recorded of the Savior's life points to a life of peace.<br><br>When Christ was in situations where He was challenged, confronted, or pestered, we read of a man who stood firm and unshaken. When He rebuked individuals who needed correction, His words were measured and delivered with the precise level of emotion to bring about the desired result. During the events leading to the Crucifixion, Jesus Christ did not shrink. I love the account where Christ was taken into custody and Peter, the loyal Apostle, drew his sword and cut off the ear of one of the high priest's servants. Jesus did not use the opportunity to run, nor to feel smug that someone else might suffer a fraction of what He had and would endure. He also did not criticize Peter. With a few of what I would characterize gentle words to Peter, He simply touched the servant's ear and healed him.<sup>11</sup> We have no evidence Jesus was ever out of control; instead, in all things He displayed peace.<br><br>As for finding evidence of a person who possessed good will, there has never been another person whose entire life reflected benevolence more completely than Jesus Christ. At the lowest level of good will, I believe we simply think kindly or hope the best for others. At the highest level of good will, I believe we have charity. At some point in the middle I think we are service oriented. It appears Jesus never acted without considering the impact of His behavior on others. He comforted, gave hope, taught, healed the sick, and raised the dead. We know the Savior possessed charity; He provided us with the Atonement. In fact, He possessed charity so perfectly that when Mormon defined the word <i>charity</i> as "the pure love of Christ,"<sup>12</sup> he listed Jesus in the definition.<br><br>Having peace all of the time sounds like a noble project. Knowing that restrictions apply to having peace, though, means that you and I, who could use an additional measure of it in our lives, need to be striving to live in a way that qualifies us. Becoming a person of constant good will and feeling peace more consistently can be problematic for a person like me. I looked in the BYU Bookstore and did not find a book titled <i>Peace for Dummies.</i> Since I know Jesus is a good example of being a person who possesses good will and enjoys peace in His life 100 percent of the time, I looked for clues in His life that might help me and you on our quest for the same.<br><br>My first realization is very simple. Jesus knows who He is. One experience from His life that gives us a bit of insight into this occurred in the temple when Jesus was 12 years old. After celebrating the Passover with His family, Jesus went to the temple to talk to the learned men of the day. His family had left Jerusalem and was on the way back to Nazareth. It wasn't until the family had been traveling for a day that Joseph and Mary discovered Jesus was missing from their numbers and returned to find Him. The worried parents had to travel the day's journey back to Jerusalem, and then it took them an additional two days of searching before they located Him in the temple talking to "the doctors."<sup>13</sup> When Mary and Joseph finally located Jesus in the temple, Mary asked Jesus in a tone I imagine was a little sharp and a lot relieved:<br><br><i>Son, why hast thou thus dealt with us? behold, thy father and I have sought thee sorrowing.</i><br><br><i>And he said unto them, How is it that ye sought me? wist ye not that I must be about my Father's business?</i><sup>14</sup><br><br>My second realization is equally simple and connected to the first. Not only was Jesus clear about who He is, He also understood why He was here on the earth and who He was to become. The knowledge of Jesus that He was the literal offspring of our Heavenly Father and that His role in life was to bring immortality and the possibility of eternal life to all of His spiritual siblings framed every aspect of Jesus Christ's mortal life. He was so clear about His divinity and His role in our Heavenly Father's plan that every decision Jesus made and every behavior He displayed was consistent with His knowledge. Nothing He ever did or said disqualified Him from being the perfect, sin-free, unblemished sacrificial lamb of the Most High God.<br><br>I have sung "I Am a Child of God"<sup>15</sup> since I was a young child, and yet it has taken me longer than Jesus to figure out that as a daughter of God I need to keep my decisions, behaviors, and words consistent with the roles my Father would have me fill on this earth and in eternity.<br><br>My son loves animals. At five years of age, two of his favorite places are Hogle Zoo in Salt Lake City and the Monte L. Bean Museum here on campus. Until recently he did not know the official names of those places, and he would distinguish between them by calling one "the live zoo" and the other "the dead zoo." He has informed me that he wants to be a zookeeper when he grows up. He spends hours playing with the toy animals we have in our collection--setting them up, assembling similar animals into family groups, creating safe and comfortable places for them to live and sleep. In his play he is developing skills and trying to act in ways he thinks are appropriate for a role he intends to fulfill at some time in the future.<br><br>There are many roles each of us will fulfill during our lives. In addition, we know as sons and daughters of our Father in Heaven that we have the ability to someday become gods and goddesses. Jesus Christ lived His life as our Savior long before He stepped into the Garden of Gethsemane or emerged from the tomb. Even when we think it might be in the distant future, it is not too early for us to develop now the characteristics and skills, like peace and good will, that will help us take on those roles.<br><br>It is always exciting at the beginning of each new school year to see new students come to campus. One of the most fulfilling parts of the work we do in Residence Life is to see the progress students make in solidifying their understanding of who they are and then acting according to that understanding. We enjoy being a part of students' lives while they are building their character. I have a special place in my heart for the few students who may stumble a bit and then catch the vision of their great divine potential and blossom.<br><br>Over the years of my service at the university I have observed good will through quiet acts of service students do for each other in the halls and in their apartments off campus. On a number of occasions I have been told of groups of students who have banded together to send a student without the means home for the Christmas break. A couple of years ago a close family member of one of our students committed suicide. The student's floor mates gathered and read <i>Ensign</i> articles about suicide so they could better support their friend when he returned from the funeral. I know when one student was seriously injured, the people on her floor--some who hardly knew her--gathered quickly to pray for her. The list of these simple acts of good will goes on and on. These students and so many others like them are examples to me of people who understand who they are and are living their lives in a way that qualifies them to feel peace.<br><br>While having an understanding of who you are and who you are to become and striving to have good will in your heart will allow you to feel peace, one surefire way to mess it up is to become distracted and to behave in ways that are not congruent with your divine nature.<br><br>This brings me to the third realization I want to share today. Once again the lesson is very simple, and again the example I have comes from the life of the Savior. Another way to refer to behaviors that are unbecoming of someone with a divine and royal destiny is through the word <i>sin.</i> Jesus Christ successfully avoided sin, and He did it by managing temptation in His life.<br><br>Before you discount the possibility of managing temptation and avoiding sin as unique to Jesus because of His divine parentage, allow me to remind you of what He inherited from His mortal mother. From Mary, Jesus inherited the potential for death, both physical and spiritual. Jesus felt temptation: "He suffered temptations but gave no heed unto them."<sup>16</sup> President Howard W. Hunter said, "It is important to remember that Jesus was capable of sinning, ... but ... he remained true. ... He had to retain the capacity and ability to sin had he willed so to do."<sup>17</sup><br><br>Two rather small details from the scriptures provide us with insights on how Christ successfully responded to temptation. In the account of the time Jesus Christ was tempted by Satan, Matthew wrote, "And when the tempter came to him, he said, If thou be the Son of God, command that these stones be made bread."<sup>18</sup> The minor point that I am convinced has critical importance is that Satan approached Christ: "the tempter came to him." Christ was not out looking for Satan.<br><br>Then, following the three temptations that Satan exposed our Savior to, Jesus simply dispatched Satan with the words "Get thee hence, Satan."<sup>19</sup> None of the Savior's responses to the temptations engaged Satan in conversation. He did not flirt with the possibility of actually going along with Satan. He did not ask anyone for clarification about how close to the line He could get before a sin would actually be committed and He never claimed it was His right to experience some fun or indulge Himself before He had to get serious about preparing for His future role.<br><br>My smallest daughter and I enjoy doing finger plays. One finger play we do over and over is about five little monkeys who swing in the trees teasing Mr. Alligator and jeering, "You can't catch me!" Each of the five monkeys teases Mr. Alligator in turn. In the end of the finger play, Mr. Alligator is the only one left. We laugh as we end the play about Mr. Alligator, who is "just as full as he could be."<br><br>It is not a laughing matter when I learn of students who have felt somehow indestructible and who have teased and flirted with Satan by engaging in behaviors that are not absolutely congruent with who they are and who they are supposed to become.<br><br>One student came to BYU from out of state. During high school she had distinguished herself among her friends as an individual with high standards. Then she met some people in Provo who were not unlike the students she had gone to school with back home. Over time her evening activities became dances and parties where Y Sparkle and BYU brownies were not the refreshments of choice. To fit into this crowd of people, clothing was worn in a more provocative manner. Early on, the rationalization given for the behaviors was that technically she had not broken any of the commandments. As time went on, the flirting with Satan became a more committed relationship.<br><br>This young woman was intelligent. Her grades and test scores qualified her for admission into BYU. She had a track record of being a committed member of the Church. She was not exceptionally different from any of us. Intellectual ability and confidence in our moral strength do not prevent us from being the special sort of stupid that lets us think we can tease Satan and not be caught--like the monkeys swinging in the trees.<br><br>Sin distracts us and blurs our vision. The young woman lost sight of who she was and who she was to become. She blamed others for her situation, and good will dried up. Her life became void of peace. I lost contact with the young woman when she went home to get her life back on track. It would take effort, the help of her ecclesiastical leader, support from her family, and a commitment on her part to fully utilize the blessing of the Atonement--the ultimate gift of our Redeemer--to restore the feeling of peace in her life.<br><br>As you know, sin is not the only distraction we can experience in our lives. At times the hectic nature of our responsibilities, concerns we have, and trials we experience can distract us too. Although there are days we may wish our lives were less chaotic and our responsibilities and pressures would go away, we must be realistic and understand that these things will always be around us. We may wish the world would become a perfect reflection of good will, but we must realize that it is not likely to happen soon. While we strive to live our lives as Jesus did, our efforts will and do fall short and we have need to repent over and over. Chaos, pressures, and sin are part of our lives. The angels knew this when they pronounced peace on the earth more than 2,000 years ago. If we can follow the Lord's example of knowing who we are and living our lives in a way that is congruent with our current status as children of our Eternal Father and our future status as gods and goddesses, we will indeed have good will in our hearts. Hopefully we can do a better job of avoiding sin by removing ourselves from situations where we are flirting with Satan.<br><br>Developing an understanding of who we are, learning to live according to that understanding, avoiding sin, and repenting when we fail--and figuring out how to be individuals with good will in our hearts--are all part of the reason we are here on this earth. Jesus Christ came to the earth and is our example in all things; He learned who He was, lived according to that understanding, avoided sin, and was an individual of supreme good will. The Christmas bells Henry Wadsworth Longfellow heard will ring again this year celebrating the birth of our Savior, "The Prince of Peace."<sup>20</sup> We are reminded again of the pronouncement of the heavenly host. That we will have good will in our hearts, that the restrictions will not apply to us, and that we will feel the promised peace now and always is my prayer, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Julie Franklin was director of Residence Life at BYU when this devotional talk was given on 5 December 2006.</i><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>1.

<h1>Answers - BYU Speeches</h1>

<br>
Addressing the Saints in Nauvoo on the subject of revelation, the Prophet Joseph Smith said:<br><br><i>I am going to take up this subject by virtue of the knowledge of God in me, which I have received from heaven. The opinions of men, so far as I am concerned, are to me as the crackling of thorns under the pot, or the whistling of the wind. I break the ground; I lead the way like Columbus when he was invited to a banquet, where he was assigned the most honorable place at the table, and served with the ceremonials which were observed towards sovereigns. A shallow courtier present, who was meanly jealous of him, abruptly asked him whether he thought that in case he had not discovered the Indies, there were not other men in Spain who would have been capable of the enterprise? Columbus made no reply, but took an egg and invited the company to make it stand on end. They all attempted it, but in vain; whereupon he struck it upon the table so as to break one end, and left it standing on the broken part, illustrating that when he had once shown the way to the new world nothing was easier than to follow it.</i><sup>1</sup><br><br>Having been privileged to have had some rather remarkable mentors--men who have clearly marked the way--and having had a few experiences that might be worth sharing, I will take the occasion this morning to make some suggestions relative to the matter of finding answers.<br><br>Like making an egg stand on end, the principles are quite simple. If I can articulate them well enough, it will be as though you always knew them.<br><h2><b>Learning to Solve Your Own Problems</b></h2><br>It was not long after my graduation from this institution that I found myself in Vietnam. I had been commissioned an officer in the Army of the United States and was serving as an LDS chaplain.<br><br>Throughout the country our LDS servicemen were organized into groups that functioned like quorums and moved with their military units. These groups were placed in one of three districts, each of which acted under the direction of a district presidency.<br><br>My military unit was base-camped in the southern part of the country. Our district president was an air force chaplain by the name of Farrell Smith. I served as his first counselor. As chaplains we were responsible for meeting the spiritual needs of the military units to which we were assigned and also had the general assignment of looking after our LDS servicemen wherever we might find them.<br><br>Time will not permit me to describe the nature of the problems we faced. Suffice it to say, they reached far beyond our experience.<br><br>We were extremely pleased when we received word that Victor L. Brown of the Presiding Bishopric was on his way to visit with us. We were to travel with him from one end of the country to the other, meeting with as many of our servicemen's groups as possible.<br><br>We quickly made the arrangements; I cite but one example. We needed a pilot who could commandeer either a chopper or fixed-wing craft and be able to fly at a moment's notice.<br><br>For such arrangements we bypassed the military chain of command and dealt with a higher authority. The Lord always saw that the right man was in the right place.<br><br>Chaplain Smith and I then sat in council together. We made a list of the questions we wanted to ask our visiting authority. We divided them up and committed them to memory.<br><br>When the times and places of our meetings were announced, our servicemen came from all over the country. We held meetings on the sides of runways, in bunkers and ditches. We held meetings with the ground rumbling beneath our feet and the sound of large guns thundering around us. In some instances we were even able to meet in small military chapels.<br><br>Between meetings, as soon as we were airborne, Chaplain Smith and I would take turns asking Bishop Brown questions. His counsel was wise, but it became more than evident what we were doing, and he called a sharp halt to our question asking.<br><br>He said, "Brethren, I am going to tell you a story. You won't like it, but it is a great story."<br><br>He then proceeded with his story, and, as he had anticipated, we did not like it.<br><br>The story centered around a young man who had a very difficult problem. He did not know what to do, so he visited with his bishop.<br><br>The bishop listened carefully and thoughtfully. He asked a few questions to assure that he understood all that was involved. He then confessed that he had no idea what counsel to give but told the young man that he would be meeting with the stake president the next evening and that he would present the matter to him.<br><br>The next evening the bishop met with the stake president. He explained the young man's problem. The stake president listened attentively and asked a few questions to assure he understood all that was involved. He then said, "Bishop, I have no idea what to tell you, but tomorrow I will be meeting with a member of the Quorum of the Twelve. I will present the matter to him."<br><br>The next day, as he met with the member of the Quorum of the Twelve, the stake president raised the matter. The Apostle listened attentively and asked a few questions to assure that he fully understood what was involved. He then said, "President, I have no idea what to tell you, but this afternoon I will be meeting with President McKay. I will ask him."<br><br>That afternoon he met with President McKay and carefully explained the problem. President McKay listened attentively and asked a few questions to assure that he understood all that was involved and then said, "Well, that's his (meaning the young man's) problem, isn't it."<br><br>Such was the story. We thought the ending a little abrupt. We had expected a great line, something we could chisel in stone; instead, we got one of those drab old truths that build character but can't get the hair on your arms to stand up.<br><br>The story brought an end to our question session and with it the realization that our problems were ours and it was for us to solve them. That is why the Lord placed us there.<br><br>The lesson is one that we are generally reluctant to learn. I had a father and two grandfathers who shared a great love of the gospel and who had devoted their lives to its study. They were a marvelous source of understanding.<br><br>I have, however, a very distinct memory of the occasion that I went to my father with some gospel questions only to receive the following response: "Look, Junior, you have the same sources available to you as I have to me."<br><br>More important than any answers these men gave to my questions was their teaching me how to get answers for myself. They are now gone. Questions continue, as does the confidence that the same sources that were available to them are available to me.<br><br>All of you know that we believe in the ministering of angels. You also know that angels will not do for us what we can do for ourselves. For them to do so would be contrary to the order of heaven.<br><br>There is a measurable difference between a student coming to my office to seek clarification on something they have read or that was taught in class and the student that comes asking to be taught what they missed because they chose not to come to class or complete the reading assignment.<br><br>Would not the same difference exist between those who keep their covenants and those who choose to miss meetings, skip their reading, and ignore assignments while asking God to overlook their neglect in the dispensing of His blessings?<br><br>We are generally familiar with the process of revelation announced in section 9 of the Doctrine and Covenants where we are directed to study the matter out in our minds, draw the best conclusion we can, and then bring our best offering to the Lord, asking for His approval while yet being ready to accept His counsel otherwise. The very nature of this process is designed to balance our experience and agency with the wisdom of heaven.<br><h2><b>Seeking the Companionship of the Holy Ghost</b></h2><br>Now let us couple the wise use of agency with the gift of the Holy Ghost. To enhance our understanding of this gift, let us first distinguish it from the Light of Christ, which is given to every soul born into this world.<sup>2</sup> This Light, often referred to as "conscience," enables people to distinguish between right and wrong and entices them to do things that are edifying, enlightening, and uplifting.<br><br>Possession of the Light of Christ does not require faith in God or the testimony that Jesus is the Christ. Its purpose, however, is to lead all men to that end.<sup>3</sup><br><br>Revelations from the Holy Ghost are of a higher order, or reach beyond the light and knowledge that is had by the generality of humankind.<sup>4</sup><br><br>Membership in the Church is not requisite to receiving a revelation from the Holy Ghost. Were this the case, no one could obtain the spiritual witness necessary to join the Church.<sup>5</sup><br><br>In fact, such a spiritual confirmation is required of those we refer to as converts before they are baptized and before we lay hands upon their heads and give them the promise of the gift of the Holy Ghost.<sup>6</sup><br><br>We frequently speak of our right to the constant companionship of the Holy Ghost. We are generally left without any explanation as to what this means.<br><br>We know that the intent is not to suggest that we stand in a constant deluge of revelation. It is the slothful and unwise servant who has to be commanded in all things.<sup>7</sup><br><br>Perhaps an analogy, one taught me by my father, will help in distinguishing between having received a revelation from the Holy Ghost and our having the gift of the Holy Ghost.<br><br>Imagine yourself traveling in the dark of night through very rugged and difficult terrain carefully seeking your way to a place of safety where you will be reunited with your family. Let us also suppose that a flash of lightning momentarily marks the path of safety before you.<br><br>The momentary flash of light pointing you in the direction of safety and shelter in our analogy represents a manifestation through the Holy Ghost.<br><br>If you then follow the path it marked out, it will lead you to the waters of baptism at the hands of a legal administrator who will, as he confirms you a member of the Church, say, "Receive the Holy Ghost," which means "the gift of the Holy Ghost."<br><br>The light by which you now walk embraces the companionship of the Holy Ghost. It is the light of the gospel--or, for some, the gospel in a new light. In either case, it enables you to see that which you could not see before.<br><br>It now becomes your privilege to walk, as it were, by the light of day. The light is constant, and, in most instances, the path you are called on to travel is clearly marked. In those instances in which it is not, you are entitled to the necessary vision, impression, or prodding necessary to assure your arrival at the place of safety.<br><br>To enjoy the "constant companionship of the Holy Ghost" means, for instance, that, as you fill your assignments as a teacher in the Church (if you are prepared properly), you will be taught things from on high as you teach others.<br><br>Such an experience will require more of you than the kind of presentation in which you simply repeat or rearrange the thoughts of others. The fact that every member of the Church is given the gift of the Holy Ghost is the evidence that the Lord wants to reveal things to you and through you.<sup>8</sup><br><br>I have heard my father observe that he learned the gospel by listening to what he was directed to say when he preached the gospel. That experience should be universal among Latter-day Saints.<br><br>As you young men lay your hands on the heads of your wives to bless them before they give birth to your children or as you take those children in your arms to give them a father's blessing, if you hold yourself open to them, thoughts and promises will flow into your mind and you will become an instrument for the Lord in conveying or giving His blessing.<br><br>As you serve in positions of leadership or trust and seek direction as to who should be called or what should be done, that same Spirit will lead you far beyond your own thought process and mark a course that reaches beyond that which you can see even by the light of day. This is the companionship of which we speak.<br><h2><b>When No Sure Answer Comes</b></h2><br>There will be some instances in which no sure answer comes. We have a series of revelations in the Doctrine and Covenants in which the Lord tells the early missionaries of this dispensation that there were some matters that were to be left to their discretion. The phrase that is constantly repeated is "it mattereth not unto me."<sup>9</sup><br><br>Brigham Young explained this doctrine:<br><br><i>If I do not know the will of my Father, and what He requires of me in a certain transaction, if I ask Him to give me wisdom concerning any requirement in life, or in regard to my own course, or that of my friends, my family, my children, or those that I preside over, and get no answer from Him, and then do the very best that my judgment will teach me, He is bound to own and honor that transaction, and He will do so to all intents and purposes.</i><sup>10</sup><br><h2><b>Asking the Right Question</b></h2><br>So it is that in finding answers we must find the balance between agency and inspiration. Building upon this foundation, let me teach you a very fundamental but often overlooked principle relative to getting answers to prayers and to questions that trouble you.<br><br>Few things facilitate getting the right answer like asking the right question. Let me illustrate.<br><br>A young woman came up to me after a meeting at which I had spoken a few weeks ago. She asked if I could help her with a question dealing with the Old Testament. I told her that I would be willing to try.<br><br>She asked the question, and I did not have an idea in the world how to answer it. I told her so and then asked why the answer to such a question was important to her.<br><br>She indicated that her husband had raised the issue along with other like questions. Each question he was asking carried with it the spirit of doubt. His questions were intended to challenge, not to build faith.<br><br>The real question here is: If I had been able to answer each of the questions with which this man was challenging his wife, would it have accomplished anything more than require him to come up with more questions?<br><br>The real question needing answering is: Why was he so anxious to discredit God and show the foolishness of scripture? Perhaps he ought be asked "What commandment is it that you don't want to keep?" or "What blessings would you like to quit receiving?"<br><br>I recently received a note from a former student. He requested help in answering questions common to anti-Mormon literature.<br><br>I know the answers to these questions, but I also know that my answering them will make no difference whatsoever unless there is a change in the purpose and spirit of those asking them.<br><br>My questions are these: Is there really a shortage of evidence that Joseph Smith is a prophet? Are the unanswered questions in the Old Testament the real lion in our path?<br><br>I have a letter on my desk from a mother who told me a tragic story about the behavior of a man who had been called as a priesthood leader. "How," she asked, "can I explain to my daughter that callings in this Church are inspired and at the same time explain the behavior of this man?"<br><br>While I share her hurt and embarrassment over what took place, I cannot help but wonder if she is not asking the wrong question. Surely her faith and that of her daughter cannot be so fragile that the misdeeds of one man would call the truthfulness of the whole gospel plan into question.<br><br>At issue is if our faith should rest in the infallibility of priesthood leaders or on the assurance that if we keep our covenants the Spirit of the Lord will always be our companion.<br><br>Again, often what stands between us and answers to our prayers is our failure to ask the right questions. The role of the Holy Ghost is as important in determining what we pray about as it is in bringing the answers we seek.<br><br>In the book of James we find the promise that we may ask wisdom of God, but it requires that we do so "in faith, nothing wavering."<sup>11</sup> Of those who "waver," James said, "Let not that man think that he shall receive any thing of the Lord."<sup>12</sup><br><br>Perhaps the greatest revelation of this dispensation was the one Joseph Smith received prompting him to go into the woods and find a place to pray. Having read the injunction in James, he said:<br><br><i>Never did any passage of scripture come with more power to the heart of man than this did at this time to mine. It seemed to enter with great force into every feeling of my heart. I reflected on it again and again, knowing that if any person needed wisdom from God, I did.</i><sup>13</sup><br><br>Do you see what is taking place here? Joseph was getting a revelation telling him to go get a revelation. The Spirit was directing him in what he asked, and, because the Spirit was his companion in the asking of the question, he could do it with complete faith.<br><br>In 3 Nephi, Christ is recorded as saying, "And whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my name, which is right, believing that ye shall receive, behold it shall be given unto you."<sup>14</sup><br><br>Think of that! We have the sure promise that if we pray in the manner prescribed by Christ and ask for that "which is right," our prayers will be answered.<br><br>Our instruction is to pray to the Father in the name of Christ. To pray in Christ's name obligates us to pray as He would pray or to pray in His Spirit. This is true of all that we do in His name.<br><br>This principle is affirmed in revelation both ancient and modern. To those of our day, the Lord said: "And if ye are purified and cleansed from all sin, ye shall ask whatsoever you will in the name of Jesus and it shall be done. <i>But know this, it shall be given you what you shall ask.</i>"<sup>15</sup><br><br>Again we read, "He that asketh in the Spirit asketh according to the will of God; wherefore it is done even as he asketh."<sup>16</sup><br><br>To those of his day, John the Beloved wrote, "And this is the confidence that we have in him, that, if we ask any thing according to his will, he heareth us."<sup>17</sup><br><h2><b>Returning to Vietnam</b></h2><br>I return to where we began, with two young chaplains in Vietnam. Upon examination, my story is most common--indeed, it is a universal story.<br><br>For all of us, growing up includes leaving the security of home and the protective care of loving parents to enter a world full of problems and challenges that reach far beyond the experience that is ours.<br><br>In doing so, we would like to have a ready source to tell us how to handle difficult situations. Such is not the Lord's system.<br><br>If angels will not do for you what you can do for yourself, be assured that the Holy Ghost will not do it either. It is not the design of heaven that we be rescued from all difficult situations. Rather, it is the system that we grow up and learn to handle them.<br><br>The sense of being overwhelmed is very much a part of the journey. The power with which God clothes us in His holy temples does not suppose that the journey we have been called to make will be an easy one.<br><br>Nevertheless, the path we seek will always be clearly marked by the covenants we have made and the callings we have received.<br><br>It is in the accepting of our lot and moving forward with what the Lord has asked of us that we discover that the Holy Ghost enjoys our company, angels feel constrained to join us, and the heavens open to our vision.<br><br>Of such I testify, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Joseph Fielding McConkie was a BYU emeritus professor of ancient scripture when this devotional address was delivered on 12 December 2006.</i><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>1.
