<h1>: &quot;All This Way for That?&quot; - Elaine L. Jack - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
What a joyful noise comes from this congregation! It fills my heart with joy to be here with you, to sing the songs of Zion, and to hear your prayers and share in your spirit. How good you are! Your mothers probably tell you that, but I want to tell you, too. The members of the Church are blessed with the goodness of your generation.<br><br>The opening hymn was so appropriate for the first of January: "Come, let us anew our journey pursue, Roll round with the year, And never stand still till the Master appear" ("Come, Let Us Anew,"<i>Hymns,</i>1985, no. 217). As Latter-day Saints, those words have special meaning to us. They echo a theme about this journey of life that has characterized our entire dispensation: "No toil nor labor fear; But with joy wend your way" ("Come, Come, Ye Saints,"<i>Hymns,</i>1985, no. 30).<br><br>These stirring words inspired the early pioneer Saints who traveled west to find a sanctuary for religious freedom. This year, throughout the Church, we will observe the sesquicentennial of that great westward trek with a celebration that has been titled "Faith in Every Footstep." Today the headquarters of the Church is in the desert valleys the pioneers settled. It is also the setting for the 2002 Olympics and home to Brigham Young University. The spirit that characterized the pioneer era is very much a part of our lives today.<br><br>At the beginning of this new year, most of us have closed our journals on 1996 and opened new ones. Before us are blank pages to be filled in day by day as we each give shape to the year 1997. The first of January is usually marked by the tradition of making resolutions--the always well-intentioned list of what we are going to do differently in the months ahead.<br><br>A scripture in 1 Thessalonians can be a good guide for us in this process. In verse 3 the apostle Paul praises the Saints of Thessalonica: "Remembering without ceasing [their] work of faith, and labour of love, and patience of hope in [the] Lord Jesus Christ" (1 Thessalonians 1:3).<br><br>I like Paul's choice of words in commending those Saints. To me they speak as a powerful reminder of our need to set priorities and to center our work, labor, and patience of hope in Jesus Christ, to believe in him and in his ways enough to abandon selfish inclinations and develop direction in our spiritual journey.<br><br>This scripture makes some interesting connections. Work is tied to faith, labor is associated with love, and patience is woven in with hope. This juxtaposition points out that what we do is balanced by how we do it. The ordinary tasks of work, labor, and patience are transformed into faith, love, and hope in Jesus Christ when we realize that it is through these seemingly commonplace tasks that we bring glory to our Father.<br><br>In my message tonight I want to focus on the quality of patience. What kind of patience was Paul speaking of in this scripture? I don't think the praise was for standing calmly in the checkout line or for a passive acceptance of circumstances. Rather, I envision "patience of hope" as an active part of a testimony of Jesus Christ.<br><br>Patience of hope in Jesus Christ demonstrates our understanding that there is more to existence than just today, more than our current problems, more than what we need or want now. This form of patience is often described with terms like<i>serenity, peace, quiet resolve,</i>and<i>dignity.</i>Patience displays confidence that "not my will, but thine, be done" (Luke 22:42), that all things will be accomplished in the Lord's way. We should not make the mistake of viewing patience as being idle, indifferent, apathetic, or nonchalant. Patience does not abdicate responsibility, nor does it simply give us a seat on the sideline of events. Patience brings balance and perspective. Think about it. We need patience most when things seem out of control or out of step with what we had intended. Patience has to be applied immediately and often to wounds that are slow to heal.<br><br>In contrast, impatience is to try to assert our own timetable on life, to assume we know more than God knows. What folly! This impatience with our earthly experience is a signal that we are not sure of God's omniscience and a rebuke of the view of life as "a time to prepare to meet God" (Alma 12:24; see also Alma 34:32).<br><br>Patience isn't given as much attention as other virtues. I want to share two scriptures that I like because they don't isolate patience but rather place it in a context with other merits. The first is from Alma, who describes the greatest of personal virtues:<br><br><i>I would that ye should be humble, and be submissive and gentle; easy to be entreated; full of patience and long-suffering; being temperate in all things; being diligent in keeping the commandments of God at all times.</i>[Alma 7:23]<br><br>The Doctrine and Covenants also places patience in good company: "Remember faith, virtue, knowledge, temperance, patience, brotherly kindness, godliness, charity, humility, diligence" (D&amp;amp;C 4:6). We should all have such good company!<br><br>Many of you in attendance tonight stand at the threshold of your adult lives. At this critical crossroad you can actively choose these rich qualities that are "of good report or praiseworthy" (Articles of Faith 1:13) or you can be distracted by the need to prepare to make all the money you can as quickly as you can. If you are patient with your lives and your experiences, the Lord's will for you can be the turning point. Exercising patience now in your daily life prepares for that which is ahead.<br><br>As I mentioned in the beginning, we now are writing chapter 1997 in our journals. Just like the scripture in Thessalonians, many personal journal accounts speak of work, labor, and patience. Because this is a year of celebrating the pioneers who crossed the plains, I want to draw an example from the journal of Ruth May, a young teenage convert who boarded a ship in Britain bound for America in 1867. Her story weaves in a "patience of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ" with the effort to gather in Zion (see Ruth May Fox, "From England to Salt Lake Valley in 1867,"<i>Improvement Era</i>37, no. 8 [July 1935]: 406–9, 450).<br><br>Ruth wrote of the excitement at the dock as the huge steamer slipped out to sea. It was an exhilarating moment filled with thoughts of the future and how good it would be. You've had such moments when the world was before you, when you felt the energy of something new and challenging. Yet there were also many days when the immigrant ship<i>Louisiana</i>dipped dangerously low with the swells of the sea.<br><br>"The old ship rolled and tossed," Ruth wrote of an inevitable storm. "But fear--I had none. We were Mormons, our family at least, going to Zion, and no ship would think of going down with such a precious cargo" (Fox, "From England," p. 407). Did she not have hope in Jesus Christ?<br><br>When they reached America, Ruth's father joined his family of five and their newly acquired one yoke of oxen with a certain brother who had a wagon but was short a yoke of oxen. Ruth May wrote, "There were fourteen persons with all their worldly possessions in that one wagon. ... My father bought a small tent, just large enough for the five of us to lie down side by side like sardines in a can" (Fox, "From England," p. 408).<br><br>Ruth's company of Mormons was one of many who made their way west with few incidents. "Other than one birth and an accidental death by a bullet when men were shooting sage-hens, our journey across the plains seems to have been rather lacking in perilous adventure but was always interesting," she recalled (Fox, "From England," p. 409).<br><br>We know Brigham Young's first response when from the canyon crest he gazed over the valley he had seen in a dream: "This is the right place" (<i>The Utah Pioneers</i>[Salt Lake City: Deseret News Printing and Publishing Establishment, 1880], p. 23; quoted in B. H. Roberts,<i>A Comprehensive History of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Century One</i>[Salt Lake City: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 1930], 3:224).<br><br>Twenty years later Ruth May reached a similar summit and gazed out upon the desert valley below. Let me read her account:<br><br><i>Our last pull was through Parley's</i>[Canyon]<i>and up to the top of the hill. This was accomplished at twilight and here we got our first glimpse of the little city of Salt Lake.</i><br><br><i>I have to admit some disappointment as I exclaimed: "Oh, have we come all this way for that?"</i>[Fox, "From England," p. 450]<br><br>She expected so much. After all, this was Zion. Perhaps after a significant effort or contribution you have made, you, too, have felt like you've walked more than 1,300 miles, climbed mountains, slept out of doors, and "come all this way for that." This is when patience plays a central role: "Remembering without ceasing your work of faith, and labour of love, and patience of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ." Ruth hadn't come for the valley; she had come to Christ.<br><br>There were no crowds lining the streets to welcome the travelers to Zion. No brass bands met the party. No one announced their arrival with fanfare. They arrived on Saturday, Ruth remembered, and they got up the next morning, washed in a basin, and put on their "best clothes and went to the tabernacle services. ... All was well in Zion" (Fox, "From England," p. 450).<br><br>What does Ruth's experience teach us of patience? Often we expect that our righteousness, our willingness to stand firm, and our efforts to be faithful are to be rewarded here--now. But patience born of hope in Jesus Christ reminds us otherwise. Luke said it so well with these words: "In your patience possess ye your souls" (Luke 21:19). Ruth May initially was disappointed by the stark physical realities of her new desert home. Soon, her hunger for spiritual purpose supplanted that momentary disillusionment.<br><br>Like the early pioneers, we are on a journey, one that I hope is joyful. This is a great time to be on earth. It is a time of technological wonder and a time of advancement in so many avenues of academics. It is a great time for the Church.<br><br>Look ahead to 1997. This can be a better year as you exercise the patience of hope in Jesus Christ. Now I have some suggestions for this new year and your opportunity to embrace patience.<br><br><b>First, recognize that patience plays a vital role in making Saints.</b><br><br>Patience is a constant companion of self-discipline. In 1856, after the pioneers had gotten settled in the valley, Brigham Young said, "This is a good place to make Saints" (<i>JD</i>4:32). He knew settlement of this isolated frontier was hard. The people learned patience in working in a harsh climate; patience with one another; patience with God's work; patience with their own fortitude.<br><br>Patience is like happiness. It isn't something you jot down on a list of things to do like "do the laundry." It comes as we are doing something else.<br><br>Patience can be lost or found everywhere: at stop lights, in crowds, in long lunch lines, at the library when someone has failed to return the book you needed, when your roommate's problems become your problems, when you can't figure out that calculus problem and you've tried so hard. These are the everyday listings of patience at work. It takes patience to go on a mission and pray for someone to listen. Just listen. It takes patience to do your home teaching or visiting teaching or care for an elderly parent or a disabled brother or sister. It takes patience to recognize your mistakes and work to correct them, and it takes patience to learn how to do something well. Patience is in short supply in so many lives and is so critical in all our lives.<br><br>Elder Henry B. Eyring has told a story about his father, Dr. Henry Eyring, a renowned chemist and university professor who in his late seventies contracted bone cancer, which made movement difficult. As the senior high councilor in his stake, he was responsible for the welfare farm. Dr. Eyring and his group worked a long, full day to complete the job of weeding a field of onions.<br><br>The man weeding the row next to Dr. Eyring watched as this great university chemist pulled himself along on his stomach with his elbows, wrenching up the unruly weeds as he went. It was an awkward process and obviously painful; the cancer in his hips made it impossible for him to kneel. Yet as he dragged himself he smiled, laughed, and talked happily with his fellow members as they worked in that row of onions.<br><br>Near the end of the day, after all the onions were weeded, someone exclaimed, "Henry, good heavens! You didn't pull<i>those</i>weeds, did you? Those weeds were sprayed two days ago, and they were going to die anyway." Dr. Eyring laughed at the error that would have brought fury to many people's lips.<br><br>When Dr. Eyring told his son the story, Elder Eyring looked at his aging father and asked, "How could you take it so pleasantly?"<br><br>At that point Dr. Eyring said something that his apostle son will never forget. He said, "I wasn't there for the weeds." (See Henry B. Eyring, "Waiting upon the Lord,"<i>BYU 1990–91 Devotional and Fireside Speeches</i>[Provo: Brigham Young University, 1991], pp. 21–22.)<br><br>Sometimes it will be hard to see where you are going or you may find yourself in the wrong row of the onions, but remember this: You didn't come for the weeds. They're merely what you are doing while you learn true patience.<br><br>Observe the patience of Jesus Christ. Picture him patiently teaching the woman at the well, reaching out to lift Peter as his faith faltered, washing the feet of his disciples in the upper room. He taught patience as he was scourged, as he carried his cross, as he was hung among thieves.<br><br><b>Second, know that trials and adversity teach and train us. Recognize them for what they are and how they make us strong and effective.</b><br><br>The experience of the Prophet Joseph Smith in Liberty Jail, a filthy hovel, teaches us of patience. He had been taken from his home and young family with no promise that he might return. His people were being persecuted and tortured, driven from their homes, and their farms confiscated. He was locked up in jail, helpless to do anything. He turned to the Lord and received this answer to "O God, where art thou?"<br><br><i>My son, peace be unto thy soul; thine adversity and thine afflictions shall be but a small moment;</i><br><br><i>And then, if thou endure it well, God shall exalt thee on high.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 121:7–8]<br><br>This was a firm reminder to have patience in hope of Jesus Christ. In the Book of Mormon Alma also speaks of the difficulties that beset his people when "the hearts of many were hardened":<br><br><i>Now this was a great trial to those that did stand fast in the faith; nevertheless, they were steadfast and immovable in keeping the commandments of God, and they bore with patience the persecution which was heaped upon them.</i>[Alma 1:24–25]<br><br>I was visiting with a neighbor's family that had traveled to Salt Lake City for the holidays. I asked how they liked their ward in their distant city, and Hanna said, "Cary likes it, but I don't. Sister Jack, I'm having a hard time. I'm the only Hispanic in the ward, and they are not friendly to me. They ignore me in the hallways, and sometimes I don't go at all."<br><br>My heart went out to this usually happy and gregarious woman. I said, "Be patient with them. Maybe you are there to help them learn understanding, and it will take time."<br><br>Sometimes our pattern and response to difficulty is to circumvent the situation rather than to step back and try to learn from it. We become immersed in the circumstances and lose sight of the long-range goal. A better approach is to do what we can, being "steadfast and immovable in keeping the commandments" and carrying in our hearts the assurance that the Lord is with us and that our patience will turn the tide.<br><br>The scriptures often couple<i>patience</i>with the word<i>long-suffering.</i>For instance, in Colossians we read, "Strengthened with all might, according to his glorious power, unto all patience and longsuffering with joyfulness" (Colossians 1:11). Have you ever wondered about long-suffering? It does not mean that patience is a painful process. To "suffer" in this context means to tolerate, to hold out, to allow, to nurture growth in ourselves and in others. I do not equate long-suffering or patience with submissiveness or lack of energy. Quite the opposite: this form of patience is persistent in reaching goals. Patience of hope is submissive only to the Spirit of the Lord. Sometimes the most important thing we do is suffer long on behalf of others.<br><br>Sometimes it helps just to keep a sense of humor. We can easily get distracted and use up our supply of patience on things that have no eternal significance. I have a friend who is a writer. One day, not so long ago, she was pressured to complete an assignment and print off a lengthy script. Her printer jammed so many times that after four hours she decided her next move would be to smash the machine to pieces. So she went to the kitchen to fix dinner. She put a can in her fairly new but unreliable electric can opener, and the can just went around and around without the blade cutting open the lid. This was the last straw. She picked up the can opener, marched over to the garbage can, and threw it away. She felt much better. Don't take too seriously the things that don't really matter.<br><br><b>Third, the scriptures inspire us to be patient. In particular they remind us to be patient with each other.</b><br><br>In Romans we read, "For whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our learning, that we through patience and comfort of the scriptures might have hope" (Romans 15:4).<br><br>The scriptures bring us comfort and prompt patience of hope. Next time everything is unraveling around you, sit down and read the scriptures. The scriptures also include stirring examples of showing patience with each other. We are all familiar with the account in Matthew when the king took an accounting of his servants and found that one owed him 10,000 talents. He called the man before him and demanded payment, threatening to sell the servant, his wife, and children for payment.<br><br><i>The servant therefore fell down, and worshipped him, saying, Lord, have patience with me, and I will pay thee all.</i><br><br>The king relented and forgave the debt.<br><br><i>But the same servant went out, and found one of his fellowservants, which owed him an hundred pence: and he laid hands on him, and took him by the throat, saying, Pay me that thou owest.</i><br><br>Now listen to this plea:<br><br><i>And his fellowservant fell down at his feet, and besought him, saying, Have patience with me, and I will pay thee all.</i><br><br><i>And he would not.</i><br><br>The king heard of this act and called the "wicked servant" before him whose debts he had forgiven and "delivered him to the tormentors, till he should pay all that was due unto him" (Matthew 18:23–34). The message to show patience to each other could not be more clear.<br><br>On a particularly busy day during the Christmas season, a woman in my neighborhood--Marion, a mother of 12--was in line in a local specialty food store picking up five smoked turkeys for her family gathering. Chatting with the woman behind her in line, Marion mentioned the size of her order. The other woman quickly suggested that since she had only one turkey to pick up and she was in such a hurry, couldn't she just step ahead with her order? My friend smiled and motioned the bustling shopper ahead.<br><br>The next woman in line then said, "I am in a huge hurry as well, and I have a long way to go. Since you are picking up so much more than I am, couldn't I just pick up my order, too?"<br><br>My friend nodded again. When she finally reached the counter, the clerks looked at her and said, "We watched what happened and how you handled it. We want to give you these turkeys at half price." In Romans we read, "Be likeminded one toward another according to Christ Jesus" (Romans 15:5).<br><br>Patience with hope in Jesus Christ means we follow his example in the way we treat each other. Have you ever taken advantage of someone's "good nature"? How many times have you wanted to fall before your friends or fellow members of the Church, those with whom you work or live, and say, "Have patience with me." Others may have bad days, too. Be patient. Don't be like the servant in the story in Matthew who took the man who owed him "by the throat." Show love for those who use you or fail you. Reach out to those floundering in their mistakes and give them a hand. The early pioneers had to cross the plains to reach Zion, but we can have Zion right where we are by sharing with each other pure, patient hearts.<br><br><b>Patience is an expression of spiritual maturity.</b><br><br>Patience brings balance into our lives. Ruth May and her fellow pioneers sang "all is well" on the plains by firelight. Today that song is sung in dozens of foreign languages in small and large congregations around the world. The Church's growth testifies that the gospel is the same in every tongue. We have a bold and endearing message for the world. And when it is shared it changes lives. People grow and mature in spiritual ways, and they become closer to God.<br><br>This fall I visited Mongolia. There are more than 600 Saints building the kingdom of God in a country that until recently was, to me, only a name on a map--a country at the end of the earth. These people are accepting the gospel, and the Spirit is with them. They, too, sing "all is well." They have no chapel and no stakes There are a handful of proselyting missionaries and some wonderful couples helping establish the work through teaching English at the universities. The Mongolian Saints are just beginning their journey to Zion.<br><br>The most exciting part of the gospel in Mongolia is that there are already 23 elders and sisters from that country serving as missionaries in many other parts of the world. Think of the surge of strength these missionaries will bring back to their fellow members when they return with their experience and knowledge. Now is their time for patience--patience of hope in Jesus Christ.<br><br>The Church in Russia is only a few years ahead of the Saints in Mongolia. In a recent letter to me, some Russian sisters described the patience required in accepting the gospel in their country, or in any country for that matter. Listen to the sequence they described:<br><br><i>Baptism is just a beginning of a long journey. Having joined the Church, we accept a new mode of living, which is very far from being easy for a grown-up person. Being a member of the Church is not a guarantee against any problems in our life, and it is very important to understand that. On the contrary, it is just the beginning of hard work. It is necessary to change one's way of living, to get rid of many old habits and to acquire new ones. It takes time.</i><br><br>They understand the prolonged need for patience of hope. They wrote:<br><br><i>We are constantly praying for our neighbors, for our friends and foes, for our spiritual sisters and brothers in our faith all over the world, for our long-suffering country, for all the people on the earth, and for our world. We believe that our Lord God hears the prayers of the righteous people, and we are doing our best to fulfill the commandments, to regularly attend our Sunday meetings, to find joy in serving in our callings, to love our neighbors, and to strengthen each other and our families. It is a great blessing for us all that the only true church--The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints--has come to us in Russia.</i>[Personal letter to Elaine L. Jack from six district Relief Society presidents in Moscow, Russia, 25 September 1996]<br><br>From Africa comes another example of being patient in the gospel.<br><br><i>Robert Israel Muhile was one of the first from Tanzania to accept the gospel. He was converted while working and studying in Cairo, Egypt. ... His decision to join the Church brought him "great joy and peace."</i><br><br><i>A year later Robert, by then an elder, returned to his home in Tanzania with the strong desire to convert his family. ... He was unsuccessful. His family had no interest in his newfound religion. He was isolated from other Church members, for his home ... was six hundred miles, three days by bus, from the nearest branch of the Church.</i><br><br>Robert went to the mission president and received permission to administer the sacrament to himself each week. The next Sunday he invited his family to attend his worship service, but no one came. So he held his meeting alone. This is his poignant description of his Sunday meetings:<br><br><i>I prepared water and bread. I also had more water to clean my hands and a small towel. I sang a song to myself out loud. I had my hymn book. After that I offered an opening prayer. Because I was alone, I didn't have any business to do, so I sang the sacrament hymn and prepared the sacrament. Then I knelt and blessed it and took it. After the sacrament I covered it, as we respect it always. I offered myself a talk--my testimony. Then I sang as we did in Sunday School and then read from</i>Gospel Principles.<i>I finished with a prayer. I then attended priesthood meeting. After singing a hymn, I said a prayer and then read a lesson from the priesthood manual. After that, I finished by singing and then offered the closing prayer. Each Sunday I had all three meetings. When I partook of the emblems it helped me to be more worthy.</i>[Heidi S. Swinton, "I Sang to Myself,"<i>Pioneer Spirit: Modern-Day Stories of Courage and Conviction</i>(Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Company, 1996), pp. 127–28]<br><br>It was with patience that members cut off from the rest of the world by the Iron Curtain waited for decades to incorporate religion in their lives. Their governments had forbidden church meetings and missionary work. In the meantime, the few LDS Church members did what they could to live close to God. They fasted the third Sunday of every month for the return of the missionaries. When the wall finally came down, a young missionary, one of the first sent into East Germany, exclaimed, "It was a great honor to be the answer to someone's 40 years of prayers."<br><br>Temples, too, have brought blessings to those who have waited patiently. Today there are 49 temples in countries around the world. Nine more are under construction. Temples have been announced for Massachusetts, Montana, Tennessee, and New York in the United States and for Mexico and Venezuela. Already the sisters in Russia pray constantly for the continued growth of the Church there so that a temple might be built in that land.<br><br>Years ago, Ruth May walked across the plains for the Lord. Today, a young man in Africa sits alone holding his Sunday services and renewing his covenants and the Saints in Russia and Mongolia are holding fast to the gospel. The spiritual principle of patience is exercised by them all. They reflect what is said so well in Hebrews: "Let us run with patience the race that is set before us" (Hebrews 12:1).<br><br>"Run with patience" suggests determined movement. Each one of us can cross the finish line. This year focus your attention on strengthening the quality of patience. It is a characteristic prized by the Lord, for he is infinitely patient with each one of us.<br><br>Let me close with a poem of Walt Whitman's, one that could sit at the front of each of our journals. In this poem, "A Noiseless Patient Spider," Whitman compares the ceaseless work of a spider spinning a web to the human experience:<br><br><i>A noiseless patient spider,</i><br><i>I mark'd where on a little promontory it stood isolated,</i><br><i>Mark'd how to explore the vacant vast surrounding,</i><br><i>It launched forth filament, filament, filament, out of itself,</i><br><i>Ever unreeling them, ever tirelessly speeding them.</i><br><br><i>And you O my soul where you stand,</i><br><i>Surrounded, detached, in measureless oceans of space,</i><br><i>Ceaselessly musing, venturing, throwing, seeking the spheres to connect them,</i><br><i>Till the bridge you will need be form'd, till the ductile anchor hold,</i><br><i>Till the gossamer thread you fling catch somewhere, O my soul.</i><br>[Walt Whitman, "A Noiseless Patient Spider"]<br><br>"Ceaselessly musing, venturing, throwing, seeking"--these are the works of patience "till the bridge you will need be form'd." That bridge is the patience of hope in Jesus Christ, and it reaches to heaven across our mortal life, this "ocean of space."<br><br>The new year is before us. It brings the promise of a host of new experiences and challenges, joys and sorrows. These are the building blocks of our souls, for we take back with us to our Father in Heaven only those things that reside inside. The little spider "launched forth filament, filament, filament, out of itself, ... tirelessly ... till the ... anchor h[e]ld." Patience of hope in Jesus Christ is like those gossamer threads, strong enough to catch and hold securely and anchor our souls to Jesus Christ and all eternity.<br><br>In the Doctrine and Covenants we are told, "Ye are not able to abide the presence of God now, neither the ministering of angels; wherefore, continue in patience until ye are perfected" (D&amp;amp;C 67:13).<br><br>May we seek that blessing and be patient in the process is my prayer in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Elaine L. Jack was the Relief Society general president of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when this fireside address was given on 5 January 1997.</i><br><br><i>© Intellectual Reserve, Inc.

<h1>That Preserves and Strengthens - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
The first principle of the gospel is faith in the Lord Jesus Christ. This principle is fundamental to the way we think and act. It defines the set of beliefs and motivations not only for members of the Church but for us as a university community. It explains why most of us have chosen to be here. It is the basis for the university code by which we try to live. Our faith pushes us to do our best not only for ourselves but to make this institution better. It provides the cohesiveness that makes the whole greater than the sum of the parts.<br><br>Faith is both a principle and a process. It defines the path by which we build a relationship of trust with the Savior. In order for faith to develop, we must begin with a humble heart and contrite spirit, have a strong desire to know the Lord, and then be obedient to gospel principles. In return, the Savior rewards the obedient with spiritual confirmations of their actions (see Alma 32:16, 27–32). As faith grows, our vision of eternity expands, which increases our capacity to meet life's challenges. As we become more familiar with the Lord's plan of happiness, we understand that trials and adversity occur for many reasons and are a part of the testing and growth process.<br><br>Both ancient and modern-day prophets have taught that mortality is a probationary state--a time of testing--and that the Lord gives us experiences to enable us to grow (see Abraham 3:25–26; Proverbs 3:11–12; Alma 42:4). Some events cause heartache and pain. If our faith in the Lord is weak, the probability is high that we will not learn the lessons intended. Elder Richard G. Scott spoke about the relationship between faith and adversity in the October 1995 general conference ("Trust in the Lord,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 1995, pp. 16–18). He suggested that when adversity strikes, there is a natural tendency to feel sorry for ourselves and to waste energy wondering why such adversity came upon us. In contrast, if our faith in the Lord and his plan is strong, we will accept the adversity and try to learn from it. This opens the door for the Holy Spirit to work within us, increasing our faith and bestowing upon us divine gifts. Elder Scott further stated:<br><br><i>This life is an experience in profound trust--trust in Jesus Christ, trust in His teachings, trust in our capacity as led by the Holy Spirit to obey those teachings. . . . To produce fruit, your trust in the Lord must be more powerful and enduring than your confidence in your own personal feelings and experience.</i>["Trust in the Lord," p. 17]<br><br>As our faith in the Lord grows, we can put aside our own desires and feelings and submit to the Lord's will. There are many accounts of faithful souls who have faced adversity and through faith in Christ have met the challenges and emerged victors. Today I wish to explore the meaning of the term<i>faith</i>as defined by the apostle Paul and the Prophet Joseph Smith and then illustrate the preserving and strengthening power of faith with three examples--the first two from the life of an ancient patriarch and the third from a modern-day story of a young girl and her family.<br><h2><b>Paul's Definition of Faith</b></h2><br>Chapter 11 of Paul's epistle to the Hebrews is devoted to the principle of faith. After defining the term in the first verse, the apostle cites a number of events from the lives of Old Testament prophets that exemplify faith. In particular, Paul uses these stories to teach the Jewish members of the Church about faith and how the faith of the ancient prophets was centered in Jesus Christ. Paul's definition of faith is as follows: "Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen" (Hebrews 11:1).<br><br>Although I used this scripture as a missionary to explain to investigators the concept of faith, I did not grasp fully the meaning of Paul's succinct statement, and I suspect that many of my investigators wondered as well. Further, I did not appreciate the lessons of faith taught by the illustrations that followed his definition.<br><br>A few years ago I discovered that the Prophet Joseph Smith made a simple change in Paul's statement when he translated the Bible. In the Joseph Smith Translation, the Prophet changed the word<i>substance</i>to<i>assurance.</i>Thus the JST definition reads: "Now faith is the<i>assurance</i>of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen" (JST, Hebrews 11:1). The word<i>assurance</i>provides insight as to the foundation upon which faith is built. It suggests that the underpinning of our faith or belief is an internal, spiritual witness. The word<i>substance</i>suggests something tangible. The word<i>assurance</i>indicates a spiritual affirmation of the "things hoped for." As Moroni promised, belief and works will be followed by a witness of the Spirit (see Moroni 10:3–5).<br><br>In my early years I was confused by the fact that some individuals read the Book of Mormon, prayed about it, and received the witness promised, but others seemed to follow the same course but never received the witness. I have since learned that it is not God who is random but we mortals. Some individuals don't believe they will receive a spiritual prompting even though they may pray. Others are not diligent in applying the truths they have been taught. An important lesson of life is to learn that the Father and the Son deliver on their promises.<br><br>We should remember, however, that the Holy Ghost's witness comes after the trial of faith and not necessarily on our time schedule (see Galatians 3:14; 2 Corinthians 1:22, 5:5; Ephesians 1:13–14; Ether 12:6). In Alma's explanation of the process, the experiment of faith begins with a humble heart combined with a desire to believe. This is followed by the planting and nurturing of the seed, and then come the "swelling motions" and enlightened understanding (Alma 32:27–32). Alma does not specify how long the planting and nurturing process takes. For some it may be short. For others more time may be required for the lessons to be learned. Because of the internal nature of the witness, the evidence is not seen or seeable by others except when they follow the same process.<br><br>When a witness is received, is that the end? No! There are still many lessons to be learned and fruits of the Spirit to be received. An investigator who has felt the first promptings of the Holy Ghost does not know all there is to know about the gospel. But a foundation has been laid for his or her spiritual growth. Spiritual confirmation becomes an integral part of a person's faith; it becomes an anchor for a more sure hope (see Ether 12:4) and leads men and women to higher and deeper levels of faith as they continue to "nourish the word . . . with great diligence" (Alma 32:41). When we understand that faith matures over time through belief, obedience, and witness, Joseph's substitution of<i>assurance</i>for<i>substance</i>is meaningful.<br><h2><b>Paul's Examples of Faith</b></h2><br>In Hebrews 11, Paul cites many examples of faith from the lives of ancient prophets and patriarchs. The events taken from the lives of these great leaders illustrate the preserving and strengthening power of faith. Paul begins with Abel's sacrifice, followed by other examples from the lives of Enoch, Noah, Abraham, and others. Paul shows how each prophet's faith is rooted in Christ. In order to understand the centrality of Christ and the Atonement in the faith of the ancient prophets, it is instructive to ask two questions. First, what are the things hoped for by the prophet? Second, what is the evidence not seen? I have selected two events that illustrate Abraham's hopes, the evidence not seen, the importance of Christ in Abraham's life, and the power of his faith.<br><h3><strong><i>A Promised Land</i></strong></h3><br>The first event is described in Hebrews 11:8–10. In these passages Paul discusses the Lord's instructions to Abraham to leave his homeland and journey to a new land that would be given to him as an everlasting possession. The Lord called it a "strange" land, one unfamiliar to Abraham. Although not familiar with the route or with his destination, Abraham took Sarah and other family members and departed. Not only did Abraham's faith sustain him on the journey, but Paul states that it took faith for Abraham to stay in the strange country. Paul also states that Abraham's faith caused him to look beyond Canaan "for a city . . . whose builder and maker is God" (Hebrews 11:10).<br><br>What were Abraham's hopes? The first was for a land of promise, or Canaan. The second was to be worthy of "the land of promise," or the heavenly city (see Hebrews 11:9). What was the evidence not seen? First, Abraham had never seen Canaan. Second, to enter the city whose builder and maker is God requires the Savior's atonement. Abraham lived 2,000 years before Christ. The Atonement had not yet occurred. He could only behold the Lord's sacrifice through eyes of faith.<br><br>This year is the 150th anniversary of the pioneer exodus from Winter Quarters to Utah. How similar Brigham Young's hopes were to those of Abraham. He, too, wanted a promised land in which the Saints could worship God and be safe from their enemies. He had never seen the Great Salt Lake Valley except through an eye of faith. When he finally reached the summit and looked down into the valley, however, he knew that it was the right place. However, the Saints' hopes included more than a safe haven. They, like Abraham, were looking for "the land of promise"--the heavenly city. Living almost 2,000 years after Christ, they also had to accept the Atonement through eyes of faith.<br><h3><strong><i>A Promised Son</i></strong></h3><br>The second event concerns the Lord's promise to Abraham and Sarah that they would have a covenant son even though he was 99 and she was 90. Hebrews 11:11–12 indicate that Sarah and Abraham received strength through faith to conceive Isaac--their son of promise. Again, what were the things hoped for? Abraham and Sarah desired a son of promise so that their posterity might be as numerous as the sands of the seashore and the nations of the earth might be blessed through their seed. They also hoped for<i>The Son of Promise,</i>and Isaac was a type for Christ. Paul states in verse 13 that Abraham, Sarah, Isaac, and others "died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them afar off." Through eyes of faith they knew Jehovah would come to earth, take up a physical body, suffer in the Garden, die on the cross, and be lifted up the third day. The fulfillment of the blessings promised to Abraham were dependent on<i>The Son of Promise</i>as well as on<i>a son of promise.</i><br><br>What was the evidence not seen? First, no woman past bearing age had ever conceived. Even Abraham's body appeared dead as to procreative power (see Genesis 18:11–12, Romans 4:19). Only through faith in Christ could the promise of a son be realized. Second, with respect to The Son of Promise, a virgin would conceive. Again, Christ's miraculous birth could only be seen through spiritual eyes.<br><br>How Abraham's and Sarah's faith must have been strengthened by Isaac's birth! This was the son who would preserve the Lord's promises to the ancient patriarch. Isaac's birth must also have deepened his parents' faith in the future birth of God's Only Begotten Son. After all, the most important promise to all of us was given in the Grand Council before the creation of the earth when our Father promised to send his Firstborn Son, who would sacrifice his life that we might live forever (see Abraham 3:22–27).<br><h3><strong><i>A Faith Centered in Christ</i></strong></h3><br>Paul's discussion of the events in Abraham's life poignantly reflects the ancient patriarch's belief in Christ. The Lord's command to Abraham to sacrifice "his only begotten son" as a type for the Savior's sacrifice highlights the focus of Abraham's faith (see Hebrews 11:17). Paul states that Abraham believed that Isaac would be raised from the dead just as Christ would rise from his grave (see Hebrews 11:19). Abraham's knowledge of the gospel and the Savior's mission was profound. His and Isaac's trust in the Savior and the events that would transpire almost two millennia in the future carried them from Hebron to Mount Moriah believing that Isaac would be sacrificed. What sweeping joy and relief they must have felt when the angel stopped them.<br><h2><b>We Can Trust Him</b></h2><br>In closing, I wish to illustrate with a modern-day story the trust that we may place in the Savior. I know that faith in Christ and obedience to the principles of the restored gospel bring answers to prayers and divine help when the hour is darkest. The story that follows concerns a young girl, the fourth child in a family of six children. Her name is Heather. Three of the children, including Heather, suffer from a rare disease called glutaric acidemia. In each case, the onset of the disease occurred during the first year of life when an enzyme attacked the brain, causing paralysis. The disease results in acid forming in the muscles, similar to that which occurs following a period of intense physical activity. The problem faced by the children is that the acid never leaves and causes great pain. Cindy, the first child with the disease, died just over one year ago at the age of 23. She was one of the oldest living persons known with the disease. At death she weighed about 40 pounds.<br><br>Soon after Heather's birth, the parents realized that she would be physically handicapped and that her spirit would be housed in a body with great restrictions. As she grew, she was confined to a wheelchair, unable to speak, and could only send messages with her eyes. A direct gaze and a smile meant yes. A blink meant no. Despite the handicaps, one could feel the vibrant spirit inside.<br><br>As Heather progressed, it became obvious to the parents that she was extraordinarily bright. She would play guessing games with the family using her limited means to communicate. When she was old enough, the parents enrolled Heather in a special school to see if she could learn to speak. The teacher was a gifted therapist. One morning as Heather and the teacher visited about the prior weekend, the teacher learned that Heather had attended Primary. The teacher then sang for Heather "When He Comes Again" (<i>Songbook,</i>p. 82). The expression on Heather's face revealed the delight within her. When the teacher asked Heather if she had a favorite song, the young girl's wide eyes and engaging smile left little doubt. But what was the song? Through a series of questions, the teacher learned that Heather's song was one she had heard in Primary. She wasn't sure which songbook it was in, but it was about Jesus. The teacher sang all the songs she could think of, but to no avail. However, Heather was not about to quit--she wanted to share her favorite song. At the end of the day, the two were still searching. The teacher agreed to bring her Primary songbooks to school the next day.<br><br>On the following morning, Heather and her teacher continued the quest. From the first hymn to the last, the little girl blinked her eyes indicating no. They were still unsuccessful. But Heather was not about to give up. She wanted to share her favorite song. Finally, the teacher told Heather that her mother would have to help her find the song and then they would sing it. The next day Heather arrived with the green Church hymnal tucked in her chair, but there was no marker. So they began with the first hymn. The teacher would sing the first part of each song and Heather would give her answer. After the first 100 hymns, there were 100 no's. After 200 hymns there had been 200 no's. Finally, the teacher began to sing "There is sunshine in my soul today . . ." (<i>Hymns,</i>1985, no. 227). Heather's body jumped, and a big smile crossed her face. Her eyes gazed directly into the teacher's, indicating success after three days of searching. Both teacher and student rejoiced.<br><br>As the teacher sang the first verse and began the chorus, Heather mustered all her strength and joined in with a few sounds. After finishing the first verse and chorus, the teacher asked if she wanted to hear the rest of the verses, and Heather's eyes opened wide with a firm yes. The teacher began to sing:<br><br><i>There is music in my soul today,</i><br><i>A carol to my King,</i><br><i>And Jesus listening can hear</i><br><i>The songs I cannot sing.</i><br><br>Heather's reaction to these lines was so strong that the teacher stopped. As the reality and significance of the words pressed on the teacher's mind, she wondered if those lines were the reason Heather liked the song? The teacher asked: "Heather, is that what you like about the song? Is that what you want me to know? Does Jesus listen? Does he hear the songs you cannot sing?"<br><br>The direct, penetrating gaze was a clear answer.<br><br>Feeling guided by the Spirit, the teacher asked, "Heather, does Jesus talk to you in your mind and in your heart?"<br><br>Again, the child's look was penetrating.<br><br>The teacher then asked, "Heather, what does he say?"<br><br>The teacher's heart pounded as she saw the clear look in Heather's eyes as the little girl awaited the questions that would allow her to share her insights.<br><br>"Does Jesus say, 'Heather, I love you'?"<br><br>Heather's radiant eyes widened and she smiled.<br><br>After a pause, the teacher asked next, "Does he say, 'Heather, you're special'?"<br><br>The answer again was yes.<br><br>Finally, the teacher asked, "Does he say, 'Heather, be patient; I have great things in store for you'?"<br><br>With all her strength, Heather's head became erect and her eyes penetrated the teacher's soul. She knew she was loved, she was special, and she only needed to be patient. (Story adapted from Jean Ernstrom, "Jesus, Listening, Can Hear,"<i>Ensign,</i>June 1988, pp. 46–47.)<br><br>Two years later, Heather died because of the ravages of the disease. Her younger brother, Mark, also suffers from the disease but not to the extent of his older sisters. He can talk, although it is not easy. As the parents discussed Heather's passing and the funeral that would take place, Mark exclaimed, "No go Heather's funeral!" Heather was his best friend. As the parents tried to explain death to him, he would not be consoled. He was crushed and did not want to attend the service. For two days he could not be persuaded.<br><br>On the morning of the funeral, the father went to Mark's room to get him up. As he entered the room, Mark was sitting up in bed with a big smile on his face. His first words were: "Dad, go Heather's funeral!"<br><br>The father responded: "Mark, what has changed your mind?"<br><br>"Dad, had dream."<br><br>"What did you dream about, Mark?"<br><br>"Dad, dreamed about Heather."<br><br>"Mark, what was Heather doing?"<br><br>"Oh, Dad, Heather running and jumping and singing 'There is sunshine in my soul today.' Dad, go Heather's funeral." (Mark's part of the story was obtained through conversations with the parents and also from the book written by the family: Bruce and Joyce Erickson,<i>When Life Doesn't Seem Fair</i>[Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1995]; see pp. 65–66.)<br><br>I ask each of you: Would the God of this earth who learned about Heather's pains and sufferings in the Garden listen to a little girl sing songs to him even though she could not speak? Would he tell her he loves her? Would he tell her to be patient, that he has great things in store for her? If a little boy did not understand death, would he give him a dream to help him understand that life does not end with death? As Alma teaches us, Christ experienced our pains and sufferings so that he would know how to succor us (see Alma 7:11–12). We can trust him. He earned our trust in the Garden and on the cross. If we exercise faith in him, he will respond. He will strengthen and preserve us in our time of need. May the Lord bless each of us as we develop faith in him, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Merrill J. Bateman was president of Brigham Young University when this devotional address was given on 7 January 1997.</i><br><br><i>© Intellectual Reserve, Inc.

<h1>;s Personal Influence - Marlyn S. Bateman - BYU Speeches</h1>

<br>
I extend a greeting to all of you today. I extend my best wishes for a happy New Year. We are one week into 1997, and the remaining pages of the days ahead are empty--a stark white. The empty pages are there to be filled. It is my wish that we may do it prayerfully and with purpose and that this year will be the best ever, overflowing with happiness and success.<br><br>William George Jordan, editor of the<i>Saturday Evening Post,</i>made a wonderful statement about each of our lives in one of his articles:<br><br><i>Man's</i>[or woman's]<i>conscious influence, when he is on dress-parade, when he is posing to impress those around him,--is woefully small. But his unconscious influence, the silent, subtle radiation of his personality, the effect of his words and acts, the trifles he never considers,--is tremendous. . . . Every man has an atmosphere which is affecting every other. So silent and unconsciously is this influence working, that man may forget that it exists. . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . In all Nature the wonders of the "seen" are dwarfed into insignificance when compared with the majesty and glory of the "unseen." . . .</i><br><br><i>Into the hands of every individual is given a marvellous power for good or for evil,--the silent, unconscious, unseen influence of his life.</i>[William George Jordan, "The Power of Personal Influence,"<i>The Majesty of Calmness</i>(New York: Fleming H. Revell Company, 1900), pp. 18–19]<br><br>I think this statement is beautifully illustrated in the movie<i>Mr. Holland's Opus.</i>The story is about a man whose dream is to compose a noted piece of music. He becomes sidetracked by having to teach music at a high school to provide for his family. At first he views his job as just punching the clock, but a loving and dedicated principal awakens a realization within him of the opportunity he has to influence the minds of his students. At the end of the movie he is honored by those whose lives have been touched over a 30-year period. One former student, now the governor of the state, emcees the program in an auditorium filled with past students and colleagues. The governor reminds Mr. Holland that his desire was to write a symphony that would make him both rich and famous. He is neither. Consequently, she suggests he might think of himself as a failure. If so, he is wrong. His success is far greater. She suggests that he look around the auditorium. There isn't a life in the room that has not been touched, and each is a better person because of association with him. The former students are his symphony.<br><br>What isn't apparent to those in the room is the unseen influence of the principal, who gave him the advice to not only fill young minds with knowledge but to give those minds a compass so that the knowledge would not go to waste. And, as we know, all knowledge will be wasted if our compass is not directed by Christ.<br><br>The apostle Paul teaches: "For as the body is one, and hath many members, and all the members of that one body, being many, are one body: so also is Christ" (1 Corinthians 12:12). Paul then likens us to members of this body--Christ's body, whether we be the foot or hand or eye or ear. Paul continues: "And the eye cannot say unto the hand, I have no need of thee: nor again the head to the feet, I have no need of you" (verse 21). He then goes on to say:<br><br><i>There should be no schism in the body; but that the members should have the same care one for another.</i><br><br><i>And whether one member suffer, all the members suffer with it; or one member be honoured, all the members rejoice with it.</i><br><br><i>Now ye are the body of Christ, and members in particular.</i>[1 Corinthians 12:25–27]<br><br>Brothers and sisters, all of us are members of Christ's family and are dependent on each other.<br><br>Paraphrasing the great English poet John Donne, these lyrics put it another way:<br><br><i>No man is an island,</i><br><i>No man stands alone,</i><br><i>Each man's joy is joy to me,</i><br><i>Each man's grief is my own.</i><br><br><i>We need one another,</i><br><i>So I will defend</i><br><i>Each man as my brother,</i><br><i>Each man as my friend.</i><br>["No Man Is an Island," words and music by Joan Whitney and Alex Kramer, 1950]<br><br>In my life there have been many people who have influenced me for good. President Bateman and I have moved many times with his schooling and career opportunities. During the first years of our married life, we moved 19 times. Our moves were never back to where members of our families lived. We were always on our own. Wherever we went, though, I was fortunate to find wonderful friends who touched my life. They became role models for me. In most cases, these people were totally unaware of their influence on me.<br><br>For example, when we lived in the Boston area, I was called to be a district missionary. My companion happened to be another young mother like myself. She and her husband were a few years ahead of us in terms of schooling and also in raising their family. She was a woman with a lot of common sense, and I could tell she had a peace about her that I wanted in my life. I don't think she realized the impact she had on me during that time.<br><br>I could tell you about many others I have quietly observed in many countries who have been notes in my opus. I challenge you to live your lives in such a way that your influence for good will make a difference in the lives of others. Always remember your influence will be felt--whether it be for good or for ill.<br><br>As we look to our Savior as our greatest example, we will find Christlike qualities in others. Be a righteous example. Be a great influence. Again, I close with the words of William George Jordan:<br><br><i>To make our influence felt we must live our faith, we must practice what we believe. . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . No individual is so insignificant as to be without influence. . . . We should ever let our influence filter through human love and sympathy. We should not be merely an influence,--we should be an inspiration. By our very presence we should be a tower of strength to the hungering human souls around us.</i>[<i>The Majesty of Calmness,</i>pp. 22–23]<br><br>May we all be blessed through the influence and example of the Lord Jesus Christ. He is our Savior, our Redeemer, our hope for the eternities. I testify of this and I do it in his name, that of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Marilyn S. Bateman, wife of Merrill J.

<h1>ow Believe About a BYU Education That I Wish I Had Believed When I First Came - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I can imagine no greater honor or responsibility for a member of this faculty than to be privileged to speak with you for a few minutes in this capacity. In fact, for the life of me, I could not imagine why I was even considered for this opportunity until I received an interesting letter from KBYU informing me that the devotional addresses I gave in October 1980 and November 1981 would be rebroadcast in November. This was puzzling because I was a graduate student during those years, and I don't remember giving any devotional addresses. But my grandfather gave wonderful addresses both years. Maybe they thought I was somebody else. I really was grateful to learn of these rebroadcasts, but I can hardly resist the temptation to write them back thanking them and then explaining that "these were the last two talks I gave at BYU before I passed away in 1983." Whatever the reason I was asked, I am delighted by the opportunity to address you.<br><br>I know that devotionals can transform lives. Not so many years ago, as an undergraduate student, I entered this very building out of breath and distracted by one of the myriad issues that can cloud a student's mind. Elder Marion D. Hanks was the assigned speaker. The building was quite full, and I remember finally finding a seat just under the clock on the top row of the top concourse. I don't remember Elder Hanks' topic--I'm sure it was important--but I do remember that I was troubled by a personal matter. As I sat, feeling miles away from the speaker, wandering in my own private world, I suddenly felt the Spirit reach up to me to answer my personal concern through the words of Elder Hanks. It was as though he took a time-out to speak with me one-on-one, as if there were a special conduit reaching directly to me to tell me, even in a sea of faces, that the Lord cares about me personally--as I know he cares about you. I'd like to speak personally to you about my experiences, and I pray that what I say may add power to yours.<br><br>When I was invited to speak, I reflected on the years I've spent at BYU. I remember the first university assembly I attended as a freshman. It was held in the Smith Fieldhouse, where we had a graphic demonstration of all the areas across the world from which our student body had come. There were banners from each of the states and countries from which we had gathered. If I remember correctly, we sang songs representing many of the areas. I was so impressed: What a privilege it is to be here! I also remember those first classes--I'd look around and all the other students looked so much smarter than I. How could I compete with them? I remember the dazed feelings I had at finals and the joy of finding out that I had been successful in surviving that first semester. As I look at you, I am reminded of those days. I am also grateful that I applied for admission in 1969, because I doubt that with my scores I would have been allowed admittance to your class.<br><br>I think I was a fairly normal student, but, unfortunately, not everything I brought with me to BYU back then was helpful. I brought some baggage from my culture and previous experience that hindered my capacity to learn all I could have. Since then I have experienced many semesters at BYU, and I've learned a little bit about what a BYU education could be. I am convinced that the restored gospel of Jesus Christ provides the most profound and powerful learning theory ever proposed, but, in practice, this theory is far too often overshadowed by the world's counterfeits. For the next few minutes then, I would like to share with you three beliefs about education I now have that I wish I had believed when I first came to BYU as a student.<br><br>You know, when an activity isn't very important, we tend to make it into a game. Sometimes education is viewed this way, not because learning is unimportant but because we trivialize the manner in which it is obtained or the reason for which we seek it. I'm afraid that I used to view education as a game; it was a serious game, but a game nevertheless. There were specific rules for winning or losing; there were tricky moves you could make to compete more effectively for those elusive grades; there were secrets you could apply to make it easier. I saw a difference between learning and schooling, but I saw schooling as a game.<br><h2><b>First Belief</b></h2><br>I wish I had placed my education in its eternal context, which is anything but a game. The Lord outlined a comprehensive curriculum for the School of the Prophets. We have been told to "teach one another the doctrine of the kingdom" (D&amp;amp;C 88:77) and have been promised that in doing this the Lord's grace will attend us that we<br><br><i>may be instructed more perfectly in theory, in principle, in doctrine, in the law of the gospel, in all things that pertain unto the kingdom of God, that are expedient for you to understand;</i><br><br><i>Of things both in heaven and in the earth, and under the earth; things which have been, things which are, things which must shortly come to pass; things which are at home, things which are abroad; the wars and the perplexities of the nations, and the judgments which are on the land; and a knowledge also of countries and of kingdoms.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 88:78–79]<br><br>That's a broad curriculum, and if we stopped reading section 88 of the Doctrine and Covenants at this point, we might misinterpret the reason for such a curriculum. We are not to study these vast frontiers in order to be smarter than the rest of the world or to compete better in the marketplace or to win some national ranking or monetary reward. We aren't even to learn it for its own sake. The next verse reads:<br><br><i>That ye may be prepared in all things when I shall send you again to magnify the calling whereunto I have called you, and the mission with which I have commissioned you.</i>[verse 80]<br><br>I believe that each of us has been foreordained to a specific mission. We have been preserved to come forth in this particular time of the world's history, and we will be held accountable to a loving Father in Heaven for how well we learn and fulfill the divine purpose whereunto we have been called. The purpose of education, then, is to assist us as we discover, prepare for, and freely fulfill our divinely ordained missions.<br><br>Let me distinguish between mission and career. The world teaches that we will find our life's fulfillment through our jobs. This is a lie, but it is a lie taught in the most subtle ways. When we ask, "Who is he?" or "What does she do?" we typically expect some answer regarding the person's chosen career, the social role they play (doctor, lawyer, teacher, etc.), how much money they have, or the amount of property they own.<br><br>Of course, it is wonderful to find meaningful employment, and we do have obligations to provide for our families, but a career is different from your life's mission. In all the generations of mankind, very few have even had the luxury to consider or choose careers. (Ask Adam or Noah how they chose their careers!) But I do understand the pressure you feel to decide a major and a career. The biggest danger I see in yielding to this pressure is the tendency to belittle the family. When I was in fourth grade, if you had asked the children in my class "What do you want to be when you grow up?" a few of the boys may have said, "I want to be a dad," but nearly all of the girls would have said they wanted to be a mom. If you were to ask the same question today of a typical fourth-grade class, it is likely that none of the boys would think that fatherhood is even a possible response. And if perhaps one or two of the girls said, "I want to be a mom," they would probably be met with the question "And what else?" I believe that my role of father is a far more important part of my life's mission than my career can ever be, and if I allow my job to dominate my perspective, no matter how important I think my job is, I will shortchange that which is more important.<br><br>President David O. McKay reminded us that education is far more than mere job training: "The paramount ideal permeating all education in the grades, the high school, through college and the university, should be more spiritual than economic" (<i>GI,</i>p. 430).<br><br>President McKay also reminded us that "no success in life can compensate for failure in the home" (see<i>CR,</i>April 1935, p. 116; quoting James Edward McCulloch, ed.,<i>Home: The Savior of Civilization</i>[Washington, D.C.: Southern Co-operative League, 1924], p. 42). May I add the corollary that no other success in life can compete with success in the home. When you reach the age of retirement, not many of you will wish that you had published one more article, sold one more commodity, or spent more time in business meetings. The most treasured moments in my life are very simple. I think of my daughter's tiny hand holding onto her daddy's finger while we climbed down from the front porch to watch ants crawl across the sidewalk, while we rushed to the train tracks to catch a glimpse of a passing train, or while we fed dandelions to the neighbor's chickens. I think of the dance concerts in my living room to "The Tiki, Tiki, Tiki Room" or "Ease on Down the Road" and of late nights sewing a costume or dress. I remember the gentle touch of a hand twirling the hair on the back of my neck while I heard the excitement or trauma of a school day. I think of priesthood blessings, minidates for ice cream, and tickle fights. I watched each of my children take their very first breath. These are the treasures of my life! What professional honor would be worth trading for these memories? The love of a family takes quality time--and a great quantity of it. Don't limit your concept of mission to the notion of a career.<br><br>Fulfilling our life's mission is not a part-time project. It can't be something we do only on weekends, in between classes, outside other assignments, or in our spare time. It must dominate our lives. It is far broader than the majors we select--and the resources available at BYU to help you prepare for and fulfill your earthly mission are substantial.<br><br>We have some of the most beautiful facilities in the world. We have a marvelous library, and where in the world could you find a faculty more willing to provide individual assistance or more dedicated in their personal lives to eternal purposes? And so I ask: How well are you using the resources available to you on this campus for preparing to fulfill the mission to which you have been foreordained? Note that I am not asking, what is your GPA or your class ranking?<br><br>When I first came to BYU, I'm afraid I spent most of my energy trying to do only what was required of me and nothing more. That seemed hard enough! The only parts of campus I visited, aside from the rest rooms, were the places I was required to go for a class. I was so busy playing the game that I hardly allowed myself to think eternally about my learning. In fact, I could never quite understand how I could be a month and a half behind when classes only started last week, but my thinking was far too shortsighted. I even remember making a list of the things I wanted to study as soon as I was out of school (and when I probably would not have access to such wonderful learning resources).<br><br>As you seek to discover your divine mission, learn to grow where you are planted. In fact, learn to look for places where you can make a difference. Church service should not be postponed until life is easier. I don't know if it ever gets easier. If you don't learn to serve the Lord while you are in school, how will you answer that you learned all you should have while attending BYU? I once heard wonderful counsel about selecting a career. When a man was asked why he had chosen to become a minister, he replied, "I looked where the fighting was the heaviest and where the lines were the thinnest, and that's where I chose to go." Part of your opportunity to serve the kingdom of God depends more upon where you live than on the specific career you select. Seeking the comforts of an exclusive neighborhood may exclude you from significant opportunities to make a difference. Don't aspire to comforts, be they economic or religious. Don't stay here too long. The world needs you!<br><br>The Lord has told us that those who need to be commanded in all things are slothful servants. We should be anxiously engaged in good causes of our own free will and choice and "bring to pass much righteousness" (see D&amp;amp;C 58:26–27), even if it doesn't increase our GPA. We are to "seek learning, even by study and also by faith" (D&amp;amp;C 88:118), even if it isn't required on the final exam. We are to pursue everything that is "virtuous, lovely, or of good report or praiseworthy" (Articles of Faith 1:13), even if we don't get credit for it.<br><br>In contrast, the thinking most useful for excelling in the game of school does not fit very well into the kingdom of God. For example, can you imagine someone seriously asking, "What's the least I can do to make it into the celestial kingdom?" Wouldn't it seem strange to try to think up strategies to help you compete better in the final judgment or to practice techniques for making a better impression at the judgment bar? This type of thinking may work well for schooling as a game, but it isn't celestial thinking--and these aren't celestial questions.<br><br>I've heard it said that education is the only area that Americans pay for and almost hope to be cheated--to be asked to do as little as possible for the credit. I'm afraid I was guilty. In the world's education one can get A's in theology without even believing in God, and one can receive top honors in the "Marriage and Family Living" course while contributing to a painful divorce or abusing family members. But an education for the Lord's errand requires a focused mind, a pure heart, and a life of integrity.<br><br>Not many yards from the Marriott Center is a miraculous learning institution--the Missionary Training Center. It is very possibly the greatest language training school in the world, but it would be impossible for the world to copy it.<br><br>Think of it. Imagine a school where young men and women, most of them still in their teens, pay their own way to come to an almost boot-camp type regimen--eating, drinking, and sleeping their new language. During this time they voluntarily refrain from alcohol, tobacco, drugs, dating, dances, rock music, visitors, parties, television, or any other distracting activities. Uncertified college students are hired to be part-time teachers at student wages. There are no transcripts, no grades, no minimum entrance achievement scores, no GPAs--but in the short space of just a few weeks, the young men and women learn more than they would at the best university and for the most part see their experience as a portion of "the best two years of their life."<br><br>Of course the MTC has its problems and may yet need to improve in numerous ways, but why does it work so well? Is it the methods? the materials? the instructional theory? the facilities? Is it the training of the teachers? the staff? the food? The reason it works is the very reason it cannot be copied. It is not built on a secular model. The people who attend are not there for secular purposes.<br><br>Now ask yourself, why doesn't the same spirit of purpose and inquiry permeate the rest of this campus? I believe that it could, but only if we, as students and faculty, develop the same sense of mission in our lives, and only if our hearts are far less preoccupied in obtaining the things of this world and aspiring to the honors of men (see D&amp;amp;C 121:35).<br><br>I'm not completely comfortable with describing our effort at BYU as trying to combine the sacred with the secular. I would feel better describing it as an effort to learn the temporal in the context of the eternal. Spiritual experiences cannot be secular, but I know of no "secular" subject that cannot and should not be spiritual. Tell Abraham, for example, that astronomy is a secular subject. The Lord has told us that he never gives temporal commandments because all things are spiritual unto him--and I believe that they ought to be for us as well. The languages of Chinese or Finnish could certainly be considered secular subjects, but when we study them in the context of serving a mission--a proselyting mission or a life mission--they become unequivocally spiritual.<br><br>The sacred and the secular are not determined primarily by the subject matter but by the hearts and purposes of those engaged in the process. From this perspective, if we are not studying to prepare for our divine mission, even to study the most sacred texts will be a secular experience. (I fear that for me, too often my religion classes were almost as secular as my other classes because my heart was so enamored with the game of school.) Our challenge is to see the sacred nature of all truth and to pursue it in such a way that we fulfill the mission to which God has and will call us. I am not suggesting that all truth is of equal value or importance but that the way in which we pursue it, if done by the Spirit, will become part of our divine mission--part of our exaltation.<br><h2><b>Second Belief</b></h2><br>As an undergraduate, I wish I had believed that my professors were nothing more and nothing less than my brothers and sisters. Jesus condemned the professional teachers of his day who loved to walk in long robes, to sit at the head tables in the schools, and "to be called of men, Rabbi, Rabbi." He declared: "But be not ye called Rabbi: for one is your Master, even Christ; and all ye are brethren" (Matthew 23:5–8). I wish we believed this today. I once proposed a column in the<i>Daily Universe</i>entitled "Verses I Wish We Believed." If we believed this verse, it would profoundly affect the relationships between teachers and students.<br><br>The typical teacher-student relationship is a hierarchical and secular one--like the king to his subjects. To illustrate this, I sometimes ask my students for a week or two to address me as "Your Royal Highness"--just to show them how embarrassingly well it fits. "Oh, Your Royal Highness, I tried to get my assignment to you on time, but I was hit by a train on my way to campus and I've been crawling for three days. Won't you please, please, accept it a little late?"<br><br>Do you realize how I could respond? "Well, my lowly subject, first you must run 12 laps around the McKay Building and kiss my ring. And then I have to decide whether it is fair to the other subjects in my kingdom who got their assignments in on time!"<br><br>You may love your kings or hate them, but the hierarchical relationship of secular power is typical of the world's education. Given the secular model on which universities are built, even teachers who see themselves as brothers and sisters may, almost unwittingly, slip into patterns that are not consistent with the Lord's way.<br><br>As long as I viewed my teachers as classroom kings, the roles we played were part of the game--there was no need to admit that I was a brother nor that they were. As brothers and sisters, most teachers sincerely want to be helpful. Nearly all are passionate about their subjects and are delighted to assist anyone who is truly curious or even slightly interested in some aspect of their specialty. Most sincerely feel the responsibility to provide only the best possible learning experiences, but as role players in the game, we look very different. When we, as teachers, are not acting as brothers and sisters, we often act like petty tyrants, making demands and judgments of you that are anything but familial. Can you imagine how your spouse or your family would react if you demanded to be treated as their king or queen? Few situations better illustrate the problem of unrighteous dominion than those of teachers who forget their relationship to their students when they acquire "a little authority, as they suppose" (D&amp;amp;C 121:39).<br><br>On the other hand, as brothers and sisters, most students here really want to become what the Lord would have them be. I know you pray about it. You feel the need to learn wisdom and to prepare yourselves to make a difference in the world. But when students play the role as in a game, they act as beasts of burden, resistant or resentful of the very process they hope will provide them with what they need. I'm embarrassed to admit that I used to do this. At first I did not see my teachers as brothers and sisters--they were potentates of power. They held the goodies of their kingdoms, which I could acquire only by pleasing them. I've seen students become so competitive, bickering over the most trivial issues for an extra point or the chance to move ahead of another. Seldom are we as concerned about the truth as we are about the score. I've seen students who sit passively and seem to dare their professors to prove that their subjects have any value or relevance. I suppose I used to do this. I never considered that if a class was boring it might be my fault. I don't think I prayed very often that my professors would speak with the power of the Holy Ghost or that I would listen with that same power. I didn't then, but I wish I would have. I doubt I expressed genuine gratitude for the efforts of my professors, even for those who seemed to play the game with me.<br><br>I don't think I recognized what a great teacher the Lord is. I'm embarrassed that too often I spent so much effort attempting to impress my mortal teachers that I neglected to ask what the Lord wanted me to know. As a student, too often my prayers were limited to asking for help in guessing the correct answers to some mortal's exam questions. But you have a far more noble purpose. Of course, you will have many exams that you will need to pass, but if you set your standards too low you may risk much more than a low grade.<br><br>Knowingly or unknowingly, some of your professors may exercise unrighteous dominion over you. How will you respond? Your actions need not be determined by theirs; in fact, you are as spiritually obligated to them as they are to you. Can you prepare to fulfill your divine mission while serving petty tyrants? Of course you can--look at Joseph, Daniel, Ammon, and Mormon. They fulfilled their missions, but not because they were serving the tyrants alone--rather because they served God, even while subjecting themselves to mortals. But the Lord has warned: "No man can serve two masters. . . . Ye cannot serve God and mammon" (Matthew 6:24). And note this: The way Joseph, Daniel, and Ammon served the Lord actually blessed the lives of the tyrants who ruled over them. When you serve the Lord while seeking the education of your divine mission, you will even bless the lives of your teachers--no matter what kinds of teachers they may be.<br><br>As professors, we pray that someday we, too, will live up to all of the promises and principles of the gospel in the ways we teach and treat our students--but you cannot afford to wait until we fully do. The kingdom of God needs you now. You are not victims of education; you are not our products. You are ultimately accountable to one far more important than any mortal teacher for how well you use your time, talents, and energy. A loving Father in Heaven has promised that if you ask of him in faith, ye shall receive from him. Don't abdicate your agency--even to well-meaning mortals, who don't know or understand your eternal mission.<br><br>At the same time, though, open yourselves to learn from the richness of the experience that your brothers and sisters can share with you. Don't require your teachers to tempt you into learning or to trick you, entertain you, or cheat you into it. We aren't always helped best by those most entertaining. Welcome high expectations and rigorous standards, but don't feel satisfied with them. Make your own.<br><h2><b>Third Belief</b></h2><br>When I was a student I wish I had believed that the standards of the world were not sufficient for a consecrated people. I believed this phrase as it pertained to religion, but I supposed that it didn't have much to do with my education: "Zion cannot be built up unless it is by the principles of the law of the celestial kingdom" (D&amp;amp;C 105:5). It isn't enough to go beyond the standards of the world. We must build upon a different foundation "according to the pattern" the Lord has given (D&amp;amp;C 94:2).<br><br>In 1914 Joseph F. Smith offered the Church a prophetic warning. He told us:<br><br><i>There are at least three dangers that threaten the Church within, and the authorities need to awaken to the fact that the people should be warned unceasingly against them. . . . They are the flattery of prominent men in the world, false educational ideas, and sexual impurity.</i>["Editors' Table: Three Threatening Dangers,"<i>Improvement Era</i>17, no. 5 (March 1914): 476–77]<br><br>With the perspective of time, we see how prophetic this warning was and is. I was serving a mission when Elder Ezra Taft Benson built on this theme, declaring, "As a watchman on the tower, I feel to warn you that one of the chief means of misleading our youth and destroying the family unit is our educational institutions" ("Strengthening the Family,"<i>Improvement Era</i>73, no. 12 [December 1970]: 46).<br><br>If BYU is to heed these warnings, we must build on a different foundation than the world's. In his "Second Century" address, President Spencer W. Kimball reminded us that "this university is not of the world any more than the Church is of the world, and it must not be made over in the image of the world" ("The Second Century of Brigham Young University," BYU Founders Day address, 10 October 1975, in<i>Classic Speeches,</i>vol. 1 [Provo: Brigham Young University, 1994], p. 139).<br><br>We could not build the Mount Timpanogos Temple on a foundation designed for the state capitol building. It wouldn't fit, and the compromises necessary to make the attempt would severely affect the purpose of the structure. Likewise, an education built upon the world's foundation will not adequately serve the purposes of Zion.<br><br>The world's education is built upon pride. If pride were removed from the normal concept of a university, I'm not sure what would be left. President Benson taught that "pride is essentially competitive in nature" ("Beware of Pride,"<i>Ensign,</i>May 1989, p. 4). Quoting C. S. Lewis, he declared:<br><br><i>Pride gets no pleasure out of having something, only out of having more of it than the next man. . . . It is the comparison that makes you proud: the pleasure of being above the rest.</i>[<i>Mere Christianity</i>(New York: Macmillan, 1952), pp. 109–10]<br><br>An education built on pride is more concerned with comparison than with truth; it is more interested in its ranking than its virtue.<br><br>President Benson also taught that "the proud cannot accept the authority of God giving direction to their lives" ("Beware of Pride," p. 4). Have you ever considered how unwilling the world's educational institutions are to give any legitimate place to Jesus Christ? But this position has developed only relatively recently, almost as if it were a response to the Restoration. Typical of nearly all other early universities in this country, one of Harvard's founding documents from 1643 states:<br><br><i>Let every student be plainly instructed, and earnestly pressed to consider well, the main end of his life and studies is, to know God and Jesus Christ which is eternal life, John 17:3, and therefore to lay Christ in the bottom, as the only foundation of all sound knowledge and learning.</i>["New England's First Fruits," in Samuel Eliot Morison,<i>The Founding of Harvard College</i>(Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1935), p. 434; text modernized]<br><br>Does that sound like the foundation of a modern university? Today, like Korihor of old, the world teaches that "no deity will save us; we must save ourselves" ("Humanist Manifesto II," in<i>Humanist Manifestos I and II,</i>ed. Paul Kurtz [New York: Prometheus Books, 1973], p. 16). Students are taught to rely upon the arm of flesh in the form of science, technology, or even laws and principles for the solutions to all the world's problems. It has become academic heresy to believe and practice that Jesus Christ is the only "name given under heaven whereby man can be saved" (2 Nephi 31:21).<br><br>As social problems are identified, we turn more and more to the schools to solve them: from racial prejudice to AIDS, from malnutrition to drug abuse, from teenage pregnancy to gang warfare. At the same time, any reference to God, the Ten Commandments, or Jesus Christ is being carefully purged from the schools under the pretense that the Constitution requires it. Our students are allowed to read and write profanity but may not offer prayers. They can listen to music with the vilest of lyrics but are not even exposed to George Washington's inaugural address or to excerpts from Thomas Jefferson or Benjamin Franklin because they are "too religious."<br><br>Today's teachers receive more training and have better facilities and quicker access to the latest curricular materials. They are trained in the latest practices, newest theories, and most current information. For the most part, they are remarkably dedicated and sincere. In spite of this, the moral decline of our society in nearly every category is more dramatic than ever. Literacy rates are decreasing; gang activity and drug traffic are at an all-time high; violent crime, illegitimate births, and teenage suicide rates are appalling; and divorce has reached epidemic proportions. The rich are richer and the poor are poorer, even though the average years of schooling are steadily increasing.<br><br>Too often professional educators, fully aware of this moral slide, spend their "labor for that which cannot satisfy" (2 Nephi 9:51). We argue about methods and measurements while our children are starving for real substance. We search out publishable results to questions that are for the most part beside the point.<br><br>What could make a real difference to our moral decline? Will our society be saved by a new reading program or by requiring greater proficiency in mathematics? Will a new sex education program taught in a secular context solve the problems of infidelity, pornography, or illegitimate births? I don't condemn those who engage in today's educational research--certainly contributions are being made to many valuable questions--but I am reminded of President Kimball's promise:<br><br><i>By dealing with basic issues and basic problems, we can be effective educationally. Otherwise, we will simply join the multitude who have so often lost their way in dark, sunless forests even while working hard. It was Thoreau who said, "There are a thousand hacking at the branches of evil to one who is striking at the root" (</i>Walden<i>[1854], I, "Economy"). We should deal statistically and spiritually with root problems, root issues, and root causes in BYU's second century. We seek to do so, not in arrogance or pride, but in the spirit of service. We must do so with a sense of trembling and urgency because what Edmund Burke said is true: "The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing"</i>[or for good men and women to work on irrelevant projects!]<i>(letter to William Smith, 9 January 1795).</i>[Kimball, "The Second Century," p. 143]<br><br>I fear that most of what is published in education wouldn't make much difference even if it were used at the grandest scale, because it doesn't address the most important issues. Moroni saw our day and warned us plainly that we must "serve the God of the land, who is Jesus Christ" or we will ripen in iniquity, and when we are fully ripe, we will be "swept off" (see Ether 2:8–12).<br><br>Whether or not it wants to hear it, the world is crying out for what we often take for granted. It most needs faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, and though it may seem to want anything but this, there are yet many "who are only kept from the truth because they know not where to find it" (D&amp;amp;C 123:12). If the world needed bread, would we give it a stone? (See Matthew 7:9.) Whatever else we may offer the people of the world, if it doesn't ultimately lead them to Christ, how good can it be?<br><br>In a world obsessed with appearances, it should be no surprise that many of us suffer from academic bulimia. I used to. Toward the end of the semester or just before a test I would binge on information, cramming as much as possible into my brain. Then I would walk carefully and quickly to the Testing Center, hoping that I didn't spill too much before I arrived, only to purge my system into categories of A, B, C, D, or "none of the above."<br><br>Grades seemed to dominate my life. But whatever else grades can measure, they cannot measure what is most important. A GPA is not an average of that which matters most. Even with the most conscientious effort to be fair and equitable in how grades are given, they are often used to justify assigning people into a society divided into "ranks, according to their riches and their chances for learning" (3 Nephi 6:12). And whatever Christian justification might be given for grades, I do know that if we allow our learning to be primarily motivated and dominated by them, we will be serving the wrong master. If any of us were to die at the end of the semester, I doubt that Saint Peter would ask to see our transcripts. We might, however, be asked, "You've just had a semester at BYU (or two or 12). How well have you used your time, talents, and energy to prepare yourself to serve the Lord?"<br><br>"But, Brother Richards," some may say, "you aren't being realistic! Grades do matter. I have to play the game. Unless I focus on grades, I won't be able to keep my scholarship; I won't be admitted into the most prestigious graduate program; I may not get the best job." The reality is, however, that you are not on this earth to maintain a scholarship, enter prestigious graduate schools, or beat someone else in the marketplace. You have a much higher standard. You need to please the Lord God Omnipotent. I promise you that if you please him, with an eye single to his glory, your life will not be without great opportunities. The Lord doesn't want you to shortchange your educational preparations. Your scholarship won't be less if you consecrate these preparations to him as an offering. I doubt your GPA will even decrease when you seek to serve the real Master. And, as with Daniel of old, others will see your good works and because of them "glorify your Father which is in heaven" (Matthew 5:16). True accountability is to him to whom someday we must all give an accounting. No mortal standard, no matter how rigorous, is high enough.<br><br>Let me conclude with a parable: Once there was an army. It was strong, handsome, and fairly well trained. The soldiers knew their duty. They were assigned to be watchmen on the towers. They were to sound the alarm to warn the people when the enemy approached. In times of relative peace, however, it isn't always easy to remain alert in such an assignment. To help spend the time, the soldiers often invented games to amuse themselves; some of these games required great skill. One game was particularly engrossing, and many soldiers became quite proficient at it. Someone suggested that they start a tournament to determine who in all of the army was the best player. The tournament became the talk of the whole village and even beyond. In fact, game players from all over the land actually began to join the army simply so they could compete in the tournament. Each year great honors were given to the champions, parades were held in tribute to their achievements, and children dreamed of the day when they, too, could join the army to participate in the tournament. Of course the enemy was not disappointed by the tournament's acquired popularity; it was one of the enemy, in fact, who proposed the competition in the first place.<br><br>My brothers and sisters, we are the army of Zion. We can make a difference, but we must stay alert as watchmen on the tower and not be distracted by the games or purposes of the world. I bear you my witness that God cares about the way you think and what you are doing with the time you spend at BYU. I pray you will consecrate it to him, in the sacred name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>A. LeGrand Richards was a BYU professor of education when this devotional address was given on 14 January 1997.</i><br><br><i>© Brigham Young University. All rights reserved.</i>
<h1>ghteous in Our Hearts - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Good morning, brothers and sisters. It is always a joy for me to be among you on this beautiful campus. Your enthusiasm is contagious, and I come away from my visits to Brigham Young University with renewed energy and confidence in the youth of our divine Church. I bring you the greetings and love of the First Presidency and of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. As you face the challenges of a new year, please know that our thoughts and prayers are with you. We pray often that our Heavenly Father will bless you in your studies and in your efforts to be true to the covenants that you have made with him.<br><br>I add my congratulations to Coach LaVell Edwards, to his assistant coaches, and to the entire Cougar football team for that thrilling Cotton Bowl victory! The media refers to Coach Edwards as "the face of stone--heart of gold," and under his picture reads "Profile of a Winner." Coach Edwards, thanks to you and to all the players for a great season, and a special thanks for representing the Church and this university so well while basking in the national spotlight. You've given us much to be proud of and plenty to rise and shout about!<br><br>I pay tribute to your president, Merrill J. Bateman, for his great leadership in guiding the destiny of this institution. I know he is a true servant of the Lord, and his only goal for this university is to make sure that the testimony of the truth of the gospel will burn brighter in each of your hearts when you graduate than it did when you first came here as a freshman.<br><br>I know of President Bateman's outstanding testimony, courage, and ability. I had the privilege of being assigned with him to reorganize a stake in Arkansas. It wasn't until Sunday morning that he said he hadn't slept for two nights because of a shoulder injury that had occurred before leaving on the conference assignment. Instead of letting the Brethren know of his disability, he accepted the assignment and endured the pain. His heart is similar to Nathanael of old, of whom the Savior said, "Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile!" (John 1:47).<br><br>One of the major messages of our Lord and Savior was to be righteous within our hearts. Jesus, who knows with complete clarity and compassion all the diverse ways of sin, spoke with special intensity and passion about the soul-destroying effects of hypocrisy. He despised hypocrites--those who feign righteousness and make a public display of it but are in reality shams and frauds. Jesus intoned, "Ye also outwardly appear righteous unto men, but within ye are full of hypocrisy and iniquity" (see Matthew 23:27–28).<br><br>The antithesis of hypocrisy is integrity, with its connotation of wholeness of spirit and completeness of personality. How glorious is integrity! Those who have it display a constancy of character. Their behavior is the same in private as in public. Their goodness is not dependent on whether someone is watching. Their actions are based on principle, not expediency. Perhaps that is what Jesus had in mind when he said, "He that hath my commandments,<i>and keepeth them,</i>he it is that loveth me" (John 14:21; emphasis added).<br><br>A true measure of whether one has integrity, therefore, is provided by an honest answer to the following question: Am I righteous when no one is watching? Your answer to that simple query tells much about your true character.<br><br>The constancy of character that distinguishes a person of integrity comes only if one's actions are rooted in principles. Faced as we all are with the recurring need to make choices throughout life, we must base our decisions on firm and inflexible principles if we are to escape "the pollutions of the world" (2 Peter 2:20).<br><br>Our behavior, both public and private, does not happen by accident. It is the product of conviction, resolution, and habitual practice. We become what we believe; we practice the principles that are etched upon our souls. When the moment of decision is upon us, we act according to the principles that have become internalized in our hearts and minds. The following news story, which was widely circulated in 1982, provides vivid evidence that, when faced with the unexpected, our actions are dependent on the principles we believe in.<br><br><i>Moments after Air Florida's Flight 90 left the runway at Washington's National Airport, it was clear that the Boeing 737 was not going to fly. As it shuddered and stalled, the co-pilot said, "We're going down," and the pilot answered grimly, "I know it." With a deafening crash it slammed into the Fourteenth Street Bridge and plunged into the icy waters of the Potomac. Witnesses watched in horror as the fuselage, which had broken free of the tail section, rolled gently and sank beneath the surface, its rows of passengers still strapped into their seats. Only the tail remained afloat--with six people clinging to it.</i><br><br><i>One of them was Arland D. Williams, Jr., a balding, graying, middle-aged bank examiner and father of two, who was on his way to an investigation in Florida. Although divorced two years previously, he was soon to be remarried and was probably the one with the best chance, for while the others had broken limbs and collapsed lungs, he was relatively free of injury. All he had to do was hang on until help arrived.</i><br><br><i>At 4:20, nineteen minutes after the crash, the rotors of the U.S. Park Police helicopter were heard thwacking through the cold winter air. Bert Hamilton, who was treading water about ten feet from the floating tail, took the single lifeline dangling beneath the chopper and passed it under his arms. The others watched while the helicopter carried him a hundred yards to the Virginia shore and returned. This time Arland Williams caught the line. Instead of wrapping it around himself, however, he passed it to flight attendant Kelly Duncan. Soon she too was safe.</i><br><br><i>On its third trip back to the wreckage, the helicopter trailed two lifelines, for its crew knew that survival in the river was now only a matter of minutes. One of the lines was aimed at Williams. He caught it again and again passed it on, this time to Joe Stiley, the most severely injured survivor. Stiley slipped the line around his waist and grabbed Priscilla Tirado, who, having lost her husband and baby, was in complete hysteria. Patricia Felch took the second line, and the helicopter pulled away. Before it reached the shore, however, Priscilla Tirado lost her grip and fell back into the water, so the helicopter, on its next trip, had to return for her.</i><br><br><i>Arland Williams' turn came at last. The chopper crew was eager to meet him and salute his selfless heroism. But, as they approached the wreckage, they saw that he was gone. It was 4:30. He had been in the paralyzing cold for twenty-nine minutes--a minute or so too long.</i><br><br><i>Rescue Officer Gene Windsor wept as he related the incident to his wife. "He could have gone on the first trip," said the pilot, Donald Usher, "but he put everyone else ahead of himself. Everyone."</i>[News story quoted in Robert F. Bennett,<i>Gaining Control</i>(Salt Lake City: Franklin Quest Company, 1987), pp. 35–36]<br><br>The virtue of a life based on sound principles is shown in the story of Corrie ten Boom, a devout Dutch Christian who was imprisoned in the infamous women's concentration camp at Ravensbrück during World War II because of her Christlike service in providing refuge to Jews and others. Corrie's beloved sister, Betsie, was imprisoned with her. While in Ravensbrück, the two sisters held a nightly worship service at which they read from a Bible Corrie had smuggled past the sadistic guards. They read first in Dutch and then translated aloud in German. And then, said Corrie:<br><br><i>We would hear the life-giving words passed back along the aisles in French, Polish, Russian, Czech, back into Dutch. They were little previews of heaven, these evenings beneath the light bulb. . . . And I would know again that in darkness God's truth shines most clear.</i>[Corrie ten Boom,<i>The Hiding Place</i>(New York: Bantam Books, 1971), p. 201]<br><br>Nearly 100,000 other poor souls also knew that "in darkness God's truth shines most clear."<br><br>Betsie died, the victim of starvation, abuse, and disease. Corrie miraculously survived. Through a clerical error her papers were stamped<i>Entlassen</i>(released). A week later all women her age were taken to the gas chambers.<br><br>After the war was over, Corrie spoke often about her horrifying experiences. On one such occasion, at a church service in Munich, she saw one of her former tormentors, the former Nazi who had stood guard at the shower-room door in the prisoner-processing center at Ravensbrück. Corrie wrote:<br><br><i>And suddenly it was all there--the roomful of mocking men, the heaps of clothing, Betsie's pain-blanched face.</i><br><br>[The former guard]<i>came up to me as the church was emptying, beaming and bowing. "How grateful I am for your message,</i>Fräulein."<i>he said. "To think that, as you say, He</i>[Christ]<i>has washed my sins away!"</i><br><br><i>His hand was thrust out to shake mine. And I, who had preached so often to the people in Bloemendaal the need to forgive, kept my hand at my side.</i><br><br><i>Even as the angry, vengeful thoughts boiled through me, I saw the sin of them. Jesus Christ had died for this man; was I going to ask for more? Lord Jesus, I prayed, forgive me and help me to forgive him.</i><br><br><i>I tried to smile, I struggled to raise my hand. I could not. I felt nothing, not the slightest spark of warmth or charity. And so again I breathed a silent prayer. Jesus, I cannot forgive him. Give me Your forgiveness.</i><br><br><i>As I took his hand the most incredible thing happened. From my shoulder along my arm and through my hand a current seemed to pass from me to him, while into my heart sprang a love for this stranger that almost overwhelmed me.</i><br><br><i>And so I discovered that it is not on our forgiveness any more than on our goodness that the world's healing hinges, but on His. When He tells us to love our enemies, he gives, along with the command, the love itself.</i>[<i>The Hiding Place,</i>p. 238]<br><br>The principles by which all true Latter-day Saints live are embodied in the covenants they make with God. These include covenants referred to by Alma the Elder as he baptized in the Waters of Mormon:<br><br><i>Ye are desirous to come into the fold of God, and to be called his people, and are willing to bear one another's burdens, that they may be light;</i><br><br><i>Yea, and are willing to mourn with those that mourn; yea, and comfort those that stand in need of comfort, and to stand as witnesses of God at all times and in all things, and in all places that ye may be in, even until death.</i>[Mosiah 18:8–9]<br><br>You will have noted, no doubt, that these covenants relate to your relationships with other people.<br><br>King Benjamin, in his great valedictory address to his people, aroused them to an exalted understanding of their relationship to God. They cried, as it were, with one voice, saying:<br><br><i>We believe all the words which thou hast spoken unto us; and also, we know of their surety and truth, because of the Spirit of the Lord Omnipotent, which has wrought a mighty change in us, or in our hearts, that we have no more disposition to do evil, but to do good continually. . . .</i><br><br><i>And we are willing to enter into a covenant with our God to do his will, and to be obedient to his commandments in all things that he shall command us, all the remainder of our days.</i>[Mosiah 5:2, 5]<br><br>These covenants relate to our relationship with God. We see that we make two different types of covenants with God. One type is highly personal, reflecting our relationship only with him. The other type relates to our relationship with other people. Of course, both types are intertwined and interconnected. They cannot be separated. As we learn wisdom, we come to understand that "when ye are in the service of your fellow beings ye are only in the service of your God" (Mosiah 2:17).<br><br>Before we discuss the implications of these covenants in our everyday lives, I mention another covenant commandment God has given to his children. I mention it because it is increasingly honored more in the breach than in the observance, in this and in many other lands. The commandment to which I refer is found in the revelation that has come to be known as "the law of the Church" (D&amp;amp;C 42):<br><br><i>Thou shalt love thy wife with all thy heart, and shalt cleave unto her and none else.</i><br><br><i>And he that looketh upon a woman to lust after her shall deny the faith, and shall not have the Spirit; and if he repents not he shall be cast out.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 42:22–23]<br><br>Though written in terms of men, this commandment applies equally, of course, to women as well.<br><br>"But," some of you may say, "that commandment to love thy wife (or husband) with all thy heart speaks to those who are married, and I am not." May I simply suggest that each of us ought to be true to our future eternal partner, even if we have not found him or her yet. The importance of keeping oneself clean, pure, and worthy of an eternal partner cannot be overemphasized, even if the realization and fulfillment of that relationship lies in the future.<br><br>I have spoken briefly of covenants, the most sacred and supernal promises made between God and man. And the most sublime of them must surely be the temple covenants, with the crowning glory of eternal marriage and its promise not only of continuance but also of eternal increase (see D&amp;amp;C 132:19).<br><br>If we have internalized these covenants and take them seriously, they ought to be reflected in our lives--all the time, in all places, and in all things--that is, in our homes, in our business dealings, in the workplace, at school, and in our dating. They are to be more than words, more than a formality. They ought to be more than just in our minds or written on a page. They should be engraved on our hearts. In fact, the Lord said to apostate ancient Israel, "The days come [when] I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel. . . . I will put my law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts; and will be their God, and they shall be my people" (Jeremiah 31:31, 33; see also Hebrews 8:10, 2 Corinthians 3:2–3).<br><br>What is meant by having the laws of God written in our hearts? References to hearts have to do with desires, longing, yearning--what the most inner self really wants. The natural man within us craves the things of the world. To have the law of God written in our hearts, we must undergo a change of heart. We must be changed from our "carnal and fallen state, to a state of righteousness" (Mosiah 27:25). We must be "born again," or "born of God," or "born of the Spirit," as were Alma the Elder and the people to whom he preached (see Alma 5:11–19); Alma the Younger (see Mosiah 27:23–29, Alma 36:10–22); and King Lamoni and his servants (see Alma 19:33–34). Hosts of others had their disposition to do evil replaced by a strong desire to do good continually. That made them "firm and steadfast in the faith" (Helaman 15:8). To such changed hearts, keeping the commandments of God--including the sacred covenants we have made at baptism and at the altars of the temple--is not burdensome or bothersome because then we love righteousness and<i>want</i>to do the will of God.<br><br>If we live the law of God, Satan will not be able to tempt us as easily as if we break the laws of God.<br><br>Ask yourself, If my heart has not been so changed, where do I start? How can I make such a change in my own life? Alma wrote that it all begins with even a "desire to believe" (Alma 32:27), with voluntary humility, and with a willingness to try an experiment with the word of God. He wrote that we can plant a seed and then nourish it with patience and obedience (see Alma 32). Nephi affirmed that this change requires "full purpose of heart, acting no hypocrisy and no deception before God, but with real intent" (2 Nephi 31:13). Samuel the Lamanite testified that the process can begin by believing the holy scriptures and the prophets, "which leadeth them to faith on the Lord, and unto repentance, which faith and repentance bringeth a change of heart unto them" (Helaman 15:7).<br><br>Will hearts once changed always remain changed? Not necessarily. Alma, after preaching about being spiritually born of God and having his image in our countenances, asked his fellow disciples of Christ in Zarahemla, "And now behold, I say unto you, my brethren, if ye have experienced a change of heart, and if ye have felt to sing the song of redeeming love, I would ask,<i>can ye feel so now?"</i>(Alma 5:26; emphasis added). Alma seemed to acknowledge that the change of heart, the desire for righteousness, can be lost. It can be lost when our lives are out of harmony with the teachings of our Lord and Savior. When we offend the Spirit by being disobedient or even by being casual about our covenants, our desires for righteousness wane and we drift away from righteousness.<br><br>For those whose hearts truly have been changed, the Lord promised: "My yoke is easy, and my burden is light" (Matthew 11:30). President Brigham Young commented on this principle:<br><br><i>They who try to serve God and still cling to the spirit of the world, have got on two yokes--the yoke of Jesus and the yoke of the devil, and they will have plenty to do. They will have a warfare inside and outside, and the labor will be very galling, for they are directly in opposition one to the other. Cast off the yoke of the enemy, and put on the yoke of Christ, and you will say that his yoke is easy and his burden is light. This I know by experience.</i>[<i>JD</i>16:123]<br><br>Must we take a very long time to come to love the truth and want to keep the commandments?<br><br>We must always remember that eternity is now and not some abstract time we look forward to in some far-distant future. You and I are living at this moment in a very important part of eternity. If we understand this truth, we will find it easier to make wise decisions in the many choices placed before us each day. We will be less likely to clutter our lives with frivolous, time-consuming dead ends that are unimportant in the eternal perspective.<br><br>Yes, brothers and sisters, we are living in one of the most critical parts of all eternity because we are living in the day of our mortal probation. Concerning mortality, the Lord said: "We will prove them herewith, to see if they will do all things whatsoever the Lord their God shall command them" (Abraham 3:25). We read in the Book of Mormon that "this life is the time for men to prepare to meet God; yea, behold the day of this life is the day for men to perform their labors" (Alma 34:32).<br><br>The questions we might pose to ourselves are "Do I merit the blessings of eternity with the life I am presently living?" or "How am I spending eternity now?" If we make every earthly decision with eternity in mind, we shall have used our mortal probation wisely.<br><br>At the tender age of 18, J. Reuben Clark wrote these words:<br><br><i>Self control is something that we should all cultivate, for upon exercise of our mind over our bodies, which constitutes self control, depends our future prosperity and usefulness in this world, and our salvation in the next. Shakespeare tells us that, "Our bodies are our gardens, to the which our wills are gardeners." Or in other words we can so control our minds that it will make us</i>[Christlike]<i>human beings. . . . If we firmly resolve to do anything we generally accomplish it. . . . If we resolve in our minds that we will make of ourselves good, honorable, honest, virtuous, and industrious men, and keep this resolve firmly rooted in our minds, we will surely become that kind of a person . . . who is respected by his friends, who secures the affection of his family ties, and who is loved by his God.</i>[J. Reuben Clark,<i>Selected Papers,</i>ed. David H. Yarn, Jr. (Provo: Brigham Young University Press, 1984), p. 263]<br><br>What we need to do is commit to become serious about being truly covenant people of the Lord. If we have real intent and are willing to follow, the Holy Ghost will guide our lives in sure paths; we will meet the expectations the Lord has for us as his covenant people and we will surely receive the promised blessings.<br><br>May we live out our lives in obedience to sacred covenants. May we be righteous when none save God witnesses our actions. May we be motivated by principles and not by expedience, having God's laws written in our hearts, his image in our countenances. May "virtue garnish [our] thoughts unceasingly; then shall [our] confidence wax strong in the presence of God. . . . The Holy Ghost shall be [our] constant companion, and [our] scepter an unchanging scepter of righteousness and truth" (D&amp;amp;C 121:45–46). May we remember that today is an important part of eternity and live to be sure our days of probation will give us peace in this life and eternal life in the world to come.<br><br>Each one of you is a child of God. He loves you and longs for your happiness.<br><br>During this year President Gordon B. Hinckley has relentlessly traveled throughout the world, giving 187 talks. In October 1996 general conference, the prophet said, "I have determined that for so long as I have the strength to do so, I will get out and meet with the Saints I love, both the youth and the adults" (Gordon B. Hinckley, "This Thing Was Not Done in a Corner,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 1996, p. 48). He is living those words and those he spoke at his first press conference after being introduced as our new prophet in March 1995. He said then:<br><br><i>We</i>[the First Presidency]<i>are dedicated, as have been those before us, to teaching the gospel of peace, to the promotion of civility and mutual respect among people everywhere, to bearing witness to the living reality of the Lord Jesus Christ, and to the practice of his teachings in our daily lives. . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . Our theme will be to carry on the great work which has been furthered by our predecessors who have served so admirably, so faithfully, and so well in the great traditions of this church--building family values, fostering education, building a spirit of tolerance and forbearance among people everywhere, and proclaiming the gospel of Jesus Christ.</i>[Quoted in Jay M. Todd, "President Gordon B. Hinckley: Fifteenth President of the Church,"<i>Ensign,</i>April 1995, pp. 5–6]<br><br>About you, President Hinckley has said:<br><br><i>I meet young people everywhere who are wonderful and faithful; youth who want to do the right thing and who indicate the reality of what I have been saying for a long time, that we've never had a better generation of young people in the Church than we have today. They are faithful. They are active. They're knowledgeable. They are just a great generation, notwithstanding the environment in which many of them are growing up.</i>[Quoted in Dell Van Orden, "Pres. Hinckley Notes His 85th Birthday,"<i>Church News,</i>24 June 1995, p. 6]<br><br>I bear testimony that President Gordon B. Hinckley is the Lord's chosen prophet today, and I bear unwavering testimony that our Heavenly Father and his Divine Son, Jesus Christ, guide the affairs of this great Church. We must all understand that the gospel is everlasting. It is forever and applicable to all, and each of us is to be held accountable. The gospel has been restored through the Prophet Joseph Smith. May the Lord bless us to keep his commandments, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Joseph B.

<h1>inds and Broken Hearts - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I have chosen a topic today about which I am still learning, both in principle and in practice. I claim no final expertise about it, but I do claim much thought and some experience. I have chosen this topic because of who you are--bright, faithful individuals, the "hope of Israel." My desire is that you can learn from my words and my experiences and thus avoid some painful experiences of your own.<br><br>I am going to speak about the relationship between learning and humility. I am proceeding from the assumption that, because we are associated here at a university, all of us are interested in learning. I am also assuming that that interest is even stronger here than at most universities because we have been commanded to "seek learning, even by study and also by faith" (D&amp;amp;C 88:118). Today, as I talk about the relationship of humility and learning, I'd like to begin by discussing some ways of acquiring humility. Then I'd like to offer some cautions about trying to learn without humility and discuss some thoughts about some of the costs that might be associated with humility. Finally, I'd like to look at reasons why we, as learners, would want humility in spite of the costs.<br><br>C. S. Lewis has treated the subject of humility in several of his works. One of my favorite treatments occurs in<i>The Screwtape Letters.</i>This volume is a supposed collection of letters from an experienced and senior demon, Screwtape, to his nephew, the inexperienced and junior demon, Wormwood. Screwtape advises his nephew on how to tempt his "patient"--that is, the person Wormwood has been assigned to bring down. Uncle Screwtape begins his 14th letter to Wormwood with the following:<br><br><i>My dear Wormwood,</i><br><br><i>The most alarming thing in your last account of the patient is that he is making none of those confident resolutions which marked his original conversion. No more lavish promises of perpetual virtue, I gather; not even the expectation of an endowment of "grace" for life, but only a hope for the daily and hourly pittance to meet the daily and hourly temptation! This is very bad.</i><br><br><i>I see only one thing to do at the moment. Your patient has become humble; have you drawn his attention to the fact? All virtues are less formidable to us once the man is aware that he has them, but this is specially true of humility. Catch him at the moment when he is really poor in spirit and smuggle into his mind the gratifying reflection, "By jove! I'm being humble," and almost immediately pride--pride at his own humility--will appear. If he awakes to the danger and tries to smother this new form of pride, make him proud of his attempt--and so on, through as many stages as you please. But don't try this too long, for fear you awake his sense of humour and proportion, in which case he will merely laugh at you and go to bed.</i>[C. S. Lewis,<i>The Screwtape Letters,</i>8th printing (New York: Macmillan Publishing Company, 1960), pp. 71–72]<br><br>I love Lewis because he makes me laugh at our human weaknesses. In this case, I think he also illustrates one of the ways of obtaining humility--learning to laugh at ourselves, our foolish pride, and other foibles. I have seen this trait in many great persons. They know how to laugh gently at themselves and the situations they're involved in. I don't know how many times I've heard President Hinckley say as he looked around a pretty impressive looking group of missionaries or leaders, "You're not much, but you're all the Lord's got." We all laugh, but we waited eagerly for the results when he told us last April about the upcoming broadcast of the CBS<i>60 Minutes</i>program with these words: "If it turns out to be favorable, I will be grateful. Otherwise, I pledge I'll never get my foot in that kind of trap again" (Gordon B. Hinckley, "Remember ... Thy Church, O Lord,"<i>Ensign,</i>May 1996, p. 83). Awakening our sense of humor about ourselves is a great step toward humility.<br><br>As a general rule, however, as we try to acquire humility, I think it is best approached through indirect means. There seems to be something a little strange about the "head-on" declarations "I'm going to become humble" or "I'm going to develop humility." In some less than mysterious way, the very declaration both points out the need for such a virtue and tends to make the hearer suspicious about whether the virtue might be obtained.<br><br>When I was set apart for my mission to Chile I was told, "You will learn the true meaning of humility." I recognized at the time that I probably had a problem with pride, and so I looked forward to what I might learn about humility. I think I assumed that I was going to learn this virtue by observation of its application in the lives of others, probably the people I was going to serve. But the Lord is a much more powerful teacher than that.<br><br>My oldest sister had served a mission while I was just six and seven years old. As long as I could remember, I had wanted to serve a mission, and, although I never would have said it this way, I was determined to be the "world's greatest lady missionary." I had listened for years to numerous stories told by my returned missionary friends and family of problems caused by lady missionaries (this was back in the old days when people didn't think as highly of lady missionaries)--how the sisters couldn't get along together, how they were always getting sick or needing the elders to do something, and how they slowed down the work. I was determined to not do any of those things; I was going to be exemplary.<br><br>And so I was off to Chile, where I worked very hard. Things were not always easy with my companions (isn't that true of all missionaries, not just lady missionaries?), but we were able to work things out and get along. My companions and I worked hard, we followed the rules, and we had success. I felt that I was a good missionary, just as I had planned on being.<br><br>When I had been out in the field a little more than a year, I began to not feel well. At first I laughed at the way I felt, calling it hypochondria because my symptoms seemed to match the symptoms of people we visited who had health complaints. When someone complained of a headache, I smiled wryly because I felt that my head ached also. When someone complained that their side hurt, I was amused by that fact because I felt that my side hurt, too. When someone complained of being exhausted, I understood and considered myself quite sympathetic because I felt that way also. But the "world's greatest lady missionary" would not stop and just kept on working. So things got worse. Food would go down, but it wouldn't stay there for long. I remember more than one visit that we concluded quickly so we could get out in the street before I threw up. Because great missionaries do not get sick and stop working, I found a way to handle this problem also: I stopped eating.<br><br>One day after this had been going on for a while and we came home for lunch, I told my companion to go eat and I would just rest until it was time to go out again. When it was time to go she came up to the room. I literally could not get out of bed. It would have taken more energy than I had even to roll over and<i>fall</i>out of bed. We got a doctor. I had a severe case of hepatitis. The world's greatest lady missionary was sick, and it was not so great.<br><br>When I could not get off that bed, I learned something about the true meaning of humility, something I was able to think about a lot as I recuperated from the hepatitis in the next few weeks. I learned that you do not go out and do missionary work, you do not keep the rules, you do not teach, you do not do one thing that good missionaries do (in fact, you do not do one thing that bad missionaries do), you do not get out of bed, you do not even draw a breath--unless God wills it. I learned gratitude to him not only for a missionary call, for a missionary plan, and for truth, but also for health to get out of bed and for the ability to breathe. I learned that all of those things are privileges, and I was thankful for them. I learned who was really in charge of the work I was doing. I don't think that anyone observing from the outside could have seen the difference in my missionary work before and after the hepatitis. My companions and I worked hard during both times; we followed the rules and we had success. But internally I was different. I knew it and the Lord knew it, and he could trust me more.<br><br>Now the Lord can use all kinds of things to help us be humble. He can use illness, and in Alma 32 we see that he uses poverty. He can use failures of one kind or another, and he can use disappointments. You may have noticed either in the newspaper or from the announcement last week that the title of this talk was to be "Bright Minds and Broken Hearts." When I told some of my students a few weeks ago about the topic of the talk and then the title, they accused me of subterfuge because of the ambiguity of the term<i>broken hearts.</i>They suggested that some, hearing the title, would come in order to find ways of assuaging some of the grief they might be feeling from a disappointing romantic relationship. (I guess, if it's disappointing, it really is an<i>un</i>romantic relationship!) I assured my students that, as a linguist, I was well aware of the ambiguity in the title and that I wanted to take advantage of it--not necessarily by using it to draw the lovelorn here but because I believe that often, particularly at the young-adult time of life, the Lord uses the one kind of broken heart (namely, the romantic broken heart) to produce the second kind of broken heart (namely, humility).<br><br>The real reason that I wanted to tell you about my missionary experience, however, was not to demonstrate that the Lord can find ways to make us humble but because I learned something about obtaining humility without having to be humbled. I learned that there is a very important connection between gratitude and humility. Although you may not be able to obtain humility by going at it directly, you may be able to obtain it by working on gratitude and the expression of gratitude. If you really think about all that has gone into making it possible for you to learn, for you to be here to learn, your own feelings of pride will diminish. And as you think about and truly understand the enormous cost that makes it possible for you to leave behind the mistakes you make as you learn, your heart will break at the great heart that broke for you on Calvary.<br><br>A year ago, at President and Sister Bateman's first devotional together at this university, I was touched by Sister Bateman's suggestions that we record "little miracles" and that we begin to notice the Lord's hand in our lives in so many small ways (Marilyn S. Bateman, "Memories,"<i>BYU 1995–96 Speeches</i>[Provo: Brigham Young University, 1996], p. 122). Though this is a small thing, I think that it is a very "doable" step toward humility. The maintenance of a journal acknowledging these many small miracles may be one of the best ways to obtain humility without the Lord's having to humble us.<br><br>I think that gratitude to others also works to develop humility in us. As we take more notice of all that others contribute to our lives and begin to express our appreciation for it more, we are less likely to treat others with arrogance. More important, we are much less likely to foster crippling expectations of others, the kind of low expectations that, when applied persistently or to entire groups, become the core of prejudice, chauvinism, and discrimination.<br><br>Because I have had the privilege of teaching English as a second language throughout much of my adult life, I have had the opportunity to come into contact with people from many other cultures. When I first started in that work, I felt a great deal of satisfaction because I could see that what I was doing was helping them. It was only as I grew older and wiser that I began to see that they were helping me. Likewise, my view of the value of my mission to Chile has changed over the years as I have looked with humbler eyes. Those of you who have served missions may add to your humility, too, if you reexamine the fruits of your mission. I think it is customary for us to think that we, through our missionary activities, were teaching others the gospel and bringing spiritual growth to the people where we served. If we look more honestly, we will see that they, through their living, were also teaching us the gospel and bringing spiritual growth to us. I am grateful for and humbled by those I have taught whose lives, because they are so different from mine, have allowed me to see whole new vistas.<br><br>Now this leads me to some cautions about trying to engage in learning without humility. It begins with a caution about being able to learn from others. Probably most of you have heard humility defined as teachableness, the willingness to learn. The truth is that almost all of us are willing to learn if the circumstances are just right, if our teacher is someone with enough prestige or authority, if arguments are presented with sophistication and eloquence, if those around us extol our learning source. But how teachable are we if the circumstances are not just right? How willing are we to listen, to try to understand, to evaluate fairly the worth of the knowledge being imparted? Would we have listened to a 14-year-old backwoods boy who just happened to know more about God than any of the sophisticated teachers of his day? Some truth may come from unlikely and lowly sources. Humility is the price that must be paid to get such truths.<br><br>Humility is also the price that determines the value of learning--"to be learned is good<i>if</i>they hearken unto the counsels of God" (2 Nephi 9:29; emphasis added). Some of those counsels may not be what we expect or want. It has been my experience (maybe just because I have a tendency to succumb to pride) that the Lord will test those "ifs" sooner or later--or maybe even both for all those with bright minds and opportunities for learning.<br><br>One of those times came for me as I was nearing the end of my classwork in my doctoral program at UCLA and preparing to write my dissertation. At the time I needed to get a doctoral committee set so they could approve my dissertation prospectus. Because of some rather strong promptings and small miracles, I had come to know what the Lord wanted me to do--look at the language learning abilities of older adults, namely, our senior missionaries. Part of what I wanted to do would use research methods that were quite common in our field. But, in consultation with the people at the MTC, I had determined that I also wanted to do some work more ethnographic in nature and requiring a more qualitative data analysis approach, something that was quite new and not as well known as it is now. The people at the MTC and I felt that gathering this kind of data would be more informative and helpful for putting together future programs for the senior missionaries. As I discussed the possibility of doing such work with teachers in my department at UCLA, none of those who had already agreed to serve on my PhD committee felt they had sufficient practice in these methods to be able to guide me. They requested that, if I wanted to do this kind of research, I find someone with this expertise to serve as one of the "outside" members of my committee. Otherwise, I would need to change my research.<br><br>At the time, members of my department and I were only aware of one person who had some expertise and interest in language instruction issues and who also had expertise in the kind of qualitative research I wanted to do. He was in the Education Department, but his training had been in anthropology. He had served on a couple of PhD committees for other persons graduating in my field. I went to see him to see if he would be willing to serve on mine. When I met the professor, I found him to be easy to talk with and, happily for me, very interested in my research topic. When he asked me where I was going to get a supply of older adult language learners to study, I told him about my plans to study our senior missionaries and about the time frame for the research. He told me that he thought the research would take longer than I was proposing, said he was a little uncomfortable with the idea of working with a "missionary" population, and asked me to think about those factors to see if I could make adjustments in what I was planning. He invited me to return the next day with my answers; we would then discuss his serving on my committee.<br><br>I went home and thought about alternatives. Even though I wanted to complete my degree as soon as possible, I was much more concerned that it be well done than that it be "fast done." I knew I could adjust my time schedule for carrying out the research. But the issue of a different population was more difficult. It wasn't that other populations didn't exist. I knew that my elderly aunt was currently living in a retirement community near San Diego and that she and others in the community regularly participated in language classes. My problem was that I knew that the Lord wanted me to study the missionaries. My whole selection of the dissertation topic had been with them in mind, and the Lord had confirmed to me in several small, miraculous ways that that was what he wanted me to do. But discussion of those kinds of miracles was not exactly the kind of thing I felt comfortable telling a UCLA professor about. Yet I desperately needed him on my committee. I needed to get my committee set, get my prospectus approved, and get up to Utah to begin the study here at the time that had been approved by the MTC. And there were no other willing professors with expertise in qualitative research whom I or any members on my committee knew about. I wondered if I could not study my aunt's colleagues and then find the necessary applications for it later at the MTC. I went to the Lord. He wanted me to do the work at the MTC.<br><br>So the next day I went back to face the professor. He asked me about my decisions. I told him that I was willing to adjust my time schedule and that I would much rather have the work done well than to have it done fast. I could tell that that pleased him. And then I told him that I didn't feel that I could adjust in the matter of the population I was going to study. I told him that I had observed the senior missionaries and their struggles with language learning. I knew they were not the same as the seniors learning languages in the retirement community. Those seniors chose which languages they wanted to learn; they were in class a couple of hours a week; they lived at home and enjoyed all of the amenities of their usual lifestyle. The seniors in the MTC were quite different. I told this professor that I could not change populations because the seniors in the MTC and their levels of sacrifice and commitment mattered too much to me. As I finished speaking, I could tell that he recognized the depth of my feeling.<br><br>He then spoke of his convictions in his academic work. He said that, as an anthropologist and consequentialist, he was opposed to proselytizing. He said that, even if my results were not directly helping the missionaries I would be studying, he recognized and knew that eventually the findings would be put to that purpose. I agreed that that was exactly what I hoped. And, so, he said, "I cannot serve on your committee." We both knew what that meant. As we parted, both of us had tears in our eyes at the mutual recognition of the integrity of the other's choice.<br><br>As I left the professor's office, although I didn't know what I was going to do about my committee, I felt some satisfaction about having been strong enough to do what the Lord wanted me to do in spite of all the intellectual and academic reasons and pressures to do something else. I felt the peace of the Lord that comes from having chosen right. But I was not prepared for what came next. As I continued to think about the encounter and to bemoan to people who cared about me what had happened, I began to have an impression about something the Lord wanted me to do. I sensed that the impression had nothing to do with my getting a committee--an issue that I used to push the impression away with for a while. The impression that was starting to grow was that I needed to write to this professor and tell him about the Book of Mormon and its effects--this to a man who had just told me about how he felt about proselytizing! You can bet this was one impression I tried to wish away or ignore.<br><br>I kept myself plenty busy for the next couple of days so that it wouldn't be in my thoughts so much, but it was always there, nagging softly from the corners of my mind. I managed two or three days like this, and then the Lord did what he always does when he has something he really wants me to do: He woke me in the middle of the night with nothing but this issue fully on my mind. I thought about how I love the Book of Mormon; I have no doubts of its authenticity and truth. I knew its power to change lives for the better, to bring happiness and a higher sense of worth to those who read it and find out its truth on their own. Because of my experiences in South America, I especially knew its power to affect the peoples there. I felt I needed to tell this professor that. I also thought about him, about his integrity. What we had felt in his office was real. I knew he respected my integrity just as I respected his. But that was also part of the difficulty for me: Would I cause him to think that I did not understand the issue of his integrity, that I did not respect that? Would he dismiss me as some kind of a fanatical "proselytizer"? Would he, when we were not face to face, mock what I would say? Would he pass the letter on to members of my own department with questions about what kind of students they were producing and what kind of good sense these students might seem to be lacking?<br><br>Satan argued with great sophistication, appealing to my pride and desire not to be thought a fool and urging me not to do what the Lord's impressions were telling me to do. I finally tumbled out of bed, fell on my knees, and told the Lord I would write the letter. I asked for his help and went to my typewriter. When I finally finished the letter, I went back to bed and slept peacefully. The next day I delivered the letter to the professor's box.<br><br>Now I know how we all want this story to end--the professor read the letter, changed his mind, decided to be on my committee, read the Book of Mormon, was converted, and is now a stake president somewhere. That is not what happened. He did read the letter, did not change his mind, did not serve on my committee (although I found someone with qualitative research expertise who did), and, as far as I know, has never read the Book of Mormon nor been converted. But something happened to me. I learned who I belonged to even in the academic world. And I had peace. The Lord helped me, and I learned again that, when we are true to him, he magnifies the intellect he has given us. I was able to get very thorough data for my dissertation, and, even though I expanded the gathering of data to match what had been suggested, I was able to complete the degree quickly.<br><br>This now leads me to the main reason why I wanted to talk about the relationship between learning and humility. Look in Alma 32, verses 16 and 25–29, to see that humility is the soil in which the seed of faith is planted. In fact,<i>humility</i>and<i>humus</i>("material ... forming the organic portion of soil") come from the same root word (<i>Merriam Webster's Collegiate Dictionary,</i>10th ed., s.v. "humus"). And we are commanded, as I said earlier, to "seek learning, even by study and also by faith" (D&amp;amp;C 88:118). We must plant our faith in our humility.<br><br>A few years back I served on the Faculty Advisory Committee with Dana Griffen, a professor in the Geology Department. As we were contemplating at that time what it meant to have a BYU education, one where learning was enlightened by faith, Dana told of an experience he had had in his research. I have asked his permission to tell you that story today because I think it illustrates so clearly the relationship between humility, study, and faith.<br><br>At the time of this experience, Dana was involved in a research project in which he was trying to make a synthetic variety of a common mineral with uncommon elements--ones that as chemical components do not occur naturally in nature. He was using equipment that would go to very high levels of pressure and temperature, and he had been working on this problem for quite a while. He tried every level of temperature and pressure that seemed reasonable, based, as all good research is, on the work presented by others. But nothing Dana tried was working, although he was totally convinced that the synthesis could be done.<br><br>One night, after trying everything he could think of, he was totally frustrated with the work. He knew that finding the right temperature and pressure was probably not a matter of great import in the eternal scheme of things, but he also knew that it was important to him, so he felt that the Lord would help him in some way. At his home, in his frustration, he humbly went to the Lord in prayer: "Father, I've done everything I know how to do. I know you know how to do this." Immediately he had a clear impression, almost like a voice, that gave a specific temperature and pressure, and the pressure was at least 50 percent higher than what anyone had thought reasonable. The next morning Dana went quickly to the lab. He took the elements, set the equipment to the pressure and temperature he had heard the night before, and, within 20 minutes, produced the long-sought-for synthesis. He has replicated the experiment numerous times since then. If we do the work, seeking learning by study, and are humble, we can also seek learning by faith.<br><br>As I think of us all engaged in the learning process, I would like to conclude by telling you of an experience I had in Israel a few years ago. I had gone to the Jerusalem Center to prepare a program for a group of teachers in training to teach English as a second or foreign language. They were coming for summer term, and I went over to spend three weeks before they arrived making arrangements with local schools and officials so that our students could teach and observe there. Because I arrived when I did, the students who had been at the Jerusalem Center for a combined winter semester and spring term were still there finishing up their studies. Among the larger group was a smaller intensive Arabic group directed by Dr. Kirk Belnap from our faculty. Kirk was a friend and former student of mine, so he invited me to participate with his group on their field trips. I was thus able to visit many sites that I visited again later with my own group.<br><br>There was one field trip, however, for which I was very excited to be invited. Kirk had made arrangements for us to visit an intensive language program out near Tel Aviv. Such intensive language programs, called<i>ulpans,</i>are fairly common in Israel, where they have had large numbers of immigrants from many nations over the years whom they have tried to incorporate as quickly as possible into the society. The ulpan we were going to visit, however, was a little different. Rather than just teaching Hebrew, this school also taught intensive Arabic, making it possible for new immigrants and others to learn to communicate with the Arabic-speaking inhabitants of the area as well as the Hebrew-speaking inhabitants. Kirk knew that I would be interested in seeing how languages were being taught there--especially interested because the director of the school was outstanding, having received awards, including a national award, for the innovative work she had done at the school. Kirk communicated this information to me and also told me that the director had had some contact with and admiration of Mormons through at least one Mormon student, a girl from the University of Utah who had come to the ulpan a few years back to learn Hebrew.<br><br>The day we arrived to tour the school and see the instruction was, unfortunately, graduation day for many of the students. Although instruction was continuing with some students, a great majority were involved in the traditional ceremony, packing, and saying good-bye to friends and teachers. We were able to observe and ask questions of some instructors, but our conversation with the director was at first only in bits and pieces as she moved from one activity to another. In one of these quick moments Kirk introduced me to her, and she asked me what I was doing in Israel. I told her that I had students coming for a training program in teaching English as a second language. Then the woman rushed on to her next activity. Finally, following the graduation ceremony, the director, Kirk, and I were able to sit down for a few minutes in her office to talk. Once again she turned to me and asked what I was doing in Israel. I explained that I had a group of students coming and that I had made arrangements for them to do some practice ESL teaching at a secondary school in Jerusalem. She then said, "You know you can't just go and preach your religion to them."<br><br>I smiled and explained to her that our leaders had reached an agreement with Israeli officials and that all of the persons coming to the Jerusalem Center had to sign a pledge not to preach the gospel.<br><br>"Ah, yes," she said, looking at us piercingly and thoughtfully, "but how do you stop the shining in your eyes? Every one of you has it."<br><br>There is a shining in the eyes and in the countenances and in the minds of those who follow the Light of the World and acknowledge his place in their lives. In the Book of Mormon, Christ promises:<br><br><i>I give unto men weakness that they may be</i>humble;<i>and my grace is sufficient for all men that</i>humble<i>themselves before me; for if they</i>humble<i>themselves before me, and have faith in me, then will I make weak things become strong unto them.</i>[Ether 12:27; emphasis added]<br><br>Our learning will be great. Our intelligence will be strong. Our minds will be bright. May we keep bright minds and broken hearts, I pray in the name of the Light of the World, even Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Cheryl Brown was a BYU professor of applied linguistics and an associate academic vice president when this devotional address was given on 28 January 1997.</i><br><br><i>© Brigham Young University.

<br>
My dear brothers and sisters--my dear young friends. There are so many of you here and so many out beyond here.<br><br>We have been speaking to some very large congregations recently--last Sunday in Guatemala City, 35,199 people. Earlier we were in South America and spoke to 35,000–40,000 in Santiago; 50,000 in Buenos Aires; and so on--crowded in great football stadiums. There is great faith out across the Church: wonderful, devoted people everywhere--some large congregations, some small ones, but everywhere there is tremendous faith in this, the work of the Lord. It is a wonderful thing to see you, my dear young friends, here tonight. When you reach my age, you can call everyone else young, and so I address you as my young friends.<br><br>It is a great pleasure and a great opportunity to be with you. I compliment you on your presence this evening. We constitute a vast congregation reaching across this entire nation from sea to shining sea and far beyond to many other areas of the world. Your large numbers and your great faithfulness speak of the tremendous growth and vitality of this, the Lord's church. You are as a great army "marching forth to conquer On life's great battlefield" ("Behold! A Royal Army,"<i>Hymns,</i>1985, no. 251).<br><br>This year we commemorate the 150th anniversary of the arrival of the Mormon pioneers in the Salt Lake Valley. We shall hear much of this during the coming year. There will be celebrations not only in Utah, but likewise among our people everywhere. It is proper that we pause to pay reverent respect to those who laid the foundation of this great work. In a larger sense we honor all of those who made the long journey from Nauvoo to the Missouri River beginning in 1846, and from there and other places beginning in 1847 to these western valleys.<br><br>They came from Nauvoo, they came from the British Isles, and they came from the nations of Europe. Their grand objective was Zion. They sang about it. They dreamed of it. It was their great hope. Their epic journey must stand forever as an incomparable undertaking. The movement of tens of thousands to these valleys of the West was fraught with every imaginable hazard, including death, whose grim reality was familiar to every wagon train and every handcart company.<br><br>I stand in reverent respect for Brigham Young. He saw the Salt Lake Valley in vision long before he saw it with his natural eyes. Otherwise I doubt he ever would have stopped here. There were greener lands in California and Oregon. There was deeper and richer soil elsewhere. There were great fields of timber in other places, much more water, and climates more equable and pleasant.<br><br>There were mountain streams here, it is true, but none of them was very large. The soil was totally untried. No plow had ever broken its hard-baked surface. I marvel, I simply marvel, that President Young would lead a large company here to a place where there never before had been a sowing and a harvest.<br><br>He had to have had a vision. He had to have had revelation that there could be sustained in these valleys a substantial and growing population.<br><br>When he arrived here he said, "This is the right place." This very statement indicates that he knew it when he saw it. Joseph Smith had seen Ensign Peak in vision. Two days after Brigham Young's arrival, with some of his brethren, he climbed the peak and there, in the words of Isaiah, unfurled "an ensign to the nations" (Isaiah 5:26). It may have only been a pocket handkerchief that was used, but it was indicative of a great millennial vision on the part of these leaders. I am convinced they saw not just 1847, but the planting and growth of this work through the years to come.<br><br>Brigham Young dug his cane into the sun-baked soil and noted where a temple should be built. That building was in fulfillment of the words of Isaiah:<br><br><i>And it shall come to pass in the last days, that the mountain of the Lord's house shall be established in the top of the mountains, and shall be exalted above the hills; and all nations shall flow unto it.</i><br><br><i>And many people shall go and say, Come ye, and let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, to the house of the God of Jacob; and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths: for out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem.</i>[Isaiah 2:2–3]<br><br>Further, said Isaiah:<br><br><i>And he will lift up an ensign to the nations from far, and will hiss unto them from the end of the earth: and, behold, they shall come with speed swiftly.</i>[Isaiah 5:26]<br><br>They were travel-worn, these pioneers. It had taken 111 days to bring them from Winter Quarters to the Salt Lake Valley. They were tired. Their clothes were worn. Their animals were jaded. The weather was hot and dry--the hot weather of July. But here they were, looking down the years and dreaming a millennial dream, a grand dream of Zion.<br><br>You are familiar with their story. You are the fruit of all of their planning and of all of their labors. Whether you have pioneer ancestry or came into the Church only yesterday, you are a part of this whole grand picture of which those men and women dreamed.<br><br>Theirs was a tremendous undertaking. Ours is a great continuing responsibility.<br><br>They laid the foundation. Ours is the duty to build on it.<br><br>They marked the path and led the way. Ours is the obligation to enlarge and broaden and strengthen that path until it encompasses the whole earth.<br><br>What a marvelous thing it is to have a great heritage, my brothers and sisters. What a grand thing to know that there are those who have gone before and laid out the way we should walk, teaching those great eternal principles that must be the guiding stars of our lives and of those who come after us. We today can follow their example. The pioneers were people of great faith, of tremendous loyalty, of unthinkable industry, and of absolutely solid and unbending integrity.<br><br>During the 22 years of the pioneer movement, from the first company of 1847 until the arrival of the transcontinental railroad in 1869, there were tens of thousands of them who gathered here from all over the earth. They were all part of a wonderful cause, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. They believed in the gospel that had come through the Prophet Joseph Smith. Thousands of them died along the way, many of them buried in unmarked graves never visited by any of their posterity. They gave their lives, their very lives--than which there is no greater sacrifice--for this cause in which they believed. They walked through the refiner's fire for the privilege of coming to these desert valleys.<br><br>Their faith was unshakable. In fulfillment of the prophecy of Jeremiah, they had been gathered "one of a city, and two of a family" and brought to Zion to be fed by pastors after their own hearts (see Jeremiah 3:14-15).<br><br>Did they ever become discouraged? Of course they did. I quote now from James Brown, this remarkable experience and prophecy:<br><br><i>The winter of 1848–49 was quite cold. Many people had their feet badly frozen. ... As the days grew warmer the gold fever attacked many so that they prepared to go to California. Some said they would go only to have a place for the rest of us; for they thought Brigham Young too smart a man to try to establish a civilized colony in such a "God-forsaken country," as they called the</i>[Salt Lake]<i>valley....</i><br><br><i>It was at this time of gloom that President Young stood before the whole people, and said, in substance ... : "Some have asked me about going. I have told them that God has appointed this place for the gathering of his saints, and you will do better right here than you will by going to the gold mines. Some have thought they would go there and get fitted out and come back, but I told them to stop here and get fitted out. Those who stop here and are faithful to God and his people will make more money and get richer than you that run after the god of this world; and I promise you in the name of the Lord that many of you that go thinking you will get rich and come back, will wish you had never gone away from here, and will long to come back, but will not be able to do so. Some of you will come back, but your friends who remain here will have to help you....</i><br><br><i>"We have been kicked out of the frying pan into the fire, out of the fire into the middle of the floor, and here we are and here we will stay. God has shown me that this is the spot to locate his people, and here is where they will prosper; he will temper the elements for the good of his Saints; he will rebuke the frost and the sterility of the soil, and the land shall become fruitful. Brethren, go to now, and plant out your fruit seeds....</i><br><br><i>" ... We shall build a city and a temple to the Most High God in this place. We will extend our settlements to the east and west, to the north and to the south, and we will build towns and cities by the hundreds, and thousands of the Saints will gather in from the nations of the earth. This will become the great highway of the nations. Kings and emperors and the noble and wise of the earth will visit us here, while the wicked and ungodly will envy us our comfortable homes and possessions. Take courage, brethren. I can stand in my door and can see where there is untold millions of the rich treasures of the earth--gold and silver. But the time has not come for the Saints to dig gold. ... For if the mines are opened first, we are a thousand miles from any base of supplies and the people would rush in here in such great numbers that they would breed a famine. ... People would starve to death with barrels of gold. ... It is our duty to preach the gospel, gather Israel, pay our tithing, and build temples. The worst fear that I have about this people is that they will get rich in this country, forget God and his people, wax fat, and kick themselves out of the Church and go to hell.</i>[That is a quotation!]<i>This people will stand mobbing, robbing, poverty, and all manner of persecution, and be true. But my greater fear for them is that they cannot stand wealth; and yet they have to be tried with riches, for they will become the richest people on this earth."</i>[See<i>Life of a Pioneer: Being the Autobiography of James S. Brown</i>(Salt Lake City: George Q. Cannon &amp;amp; Sons, 1900; New York: AMS Press, 1971), pp. 119–23, cited by Preston Nibley in<i>Brigham Young: The Man and His Work</i>(Salt Lake City: Deseret News Press, 1936), pp. 126–28]<br><br>I would like to say that we are a very rich and blessed people.<br><br>Notwithstanding the temptation to go to the California goldfields, where the entire world seemed to be rushing, the people accepted their leader's words. They stayed here and grubbed the sagebrush and made their way. Brigham Young's prophecy has been fulfilled. This is now a great and beautiful and fertile area. It has become the Crossroads of the West. Thousands and tens of thousands and hundreds of thousands pass this way constantly. We in the Office of the First Presidency are called upon day after day and week after week to meet the great of the earth.<br><br>Faith was the guiding principle in those difficult days. Faith is the guiding principle we must follow today.<br><br>From this valley we have now spread across the nation and across much of the earth. We can change our place of residence, but we must never change the principles that guide us. There must be faith as a predominant factor in our lives as it was in the lives of those who have gone before us.<br><br>Loyalty--these pioneers were loyal. They were loyal to one another. They were loyal to the Church. They were loyal to the nation of which they were a part and which, in a sense, had betrayed them. I quote from a recent article that appeared in the<i>Church News:</i><br><br><i>Heber McBride, then 13 years old, traveled to the Salt Lake Valley in the Martin Handcart Company in 1856 with his parents, Robert and Margaret, and four brothers and sisters.</i><br><br><i>The following incident, found in his memoirs, occurred one day after the company crossed the North Platte River, just west of present-day Casper, Wyoming.</i><br><br><i>"That evening as we crossed the Platte River for the last time it was very cold. The next morning there was about six inches of snow on the ground, then what we had to suffer can never be told. Father was very bad and could hardly sit up in the tent. ... I managed to get Father in one of the wagons. That was the last we ever saw of him alive....</i><br><br>"[That evening]<i>the snow was getting very deep and my sister and me had to pitch our tent and get some wood, but there were plenty of dry willows. After we had made mother as comfortable as possible, we went to find father, but the wind was blowing the snow so hard we could not see anything. ... We did not find father that night.</i><br><br><i>"The next morning the snow was about eighteen inches deep and awful cold. While my sister was preparing our little bite of breakfast I went to look for father, and found him under the wagon with snow all over him and he was stiff and dead. I felt as though my heart would burst as I sat down beside him in the snow and took his hand in mine and cried, 'Oh, Father, Father.'</i><br><br><i>"There we were, away from everything, away out on the plains with hardly anything to eat or wear, and father dead and mother sick; a widow with five children and hardly able to live from day to day. After I had my cry out I went back to the tent and told mother and the children. To try to write my feelings is out of the question.</i><br><br><i>"We were not the only family called upon to mourn the loss of a father that morning, for there were thirteen men dead in camp.</i><br><br><i>"The men that were able to do anything cleared off the snow and made a fire and thawed the ground and dug a hole and buried all in one grave. I can assure you that the men had no heart to do more than they had to do."</i>[Memoirs of Heber McBride, October 1856; cited in Pioneer Moments, "Oh, Father, Father,"<i>Church News,</i>28 December 1996, p. 16]<br><br>In those terrible, terrible circumstances they were loyal one to another. When they were sick, they nursed one another. When they died, the whole company worked together to bury them against the marauding wolves.<br><br>Absolutely unspeakable was the suffering of the James G. Willie Company, the Edward Martin Company, and the Hunt and Hodgett wagon trains in that terrible ordeal in the snow in 1856. But notwithstanding death, notwithstanding frostbite, notwithstanding meager rations, they pressed forward to reach Zion. Loyalty to one another and loyalty to the Church marked their actions.<br><br>God be thanked for their great and noble example to each of us. My brethren and sisters, we must be loyal. We cannot be found on the sidelines carping and criticizing and finding fault with one another. We must help one another with each other's burdens. We must share the sorrows of one another. We must rejoice with one another in our victories. We must be loyal to the Church against all its enemies.<br><br>"Who's on the Lord's side? Who? Now is the time to show. We ask it fearlessly: Who's on the Lord's side? Who?" ("Who's on the Lord's Side?"<i>Hymns,</i>1985, no. 260).<br><br>The pioneers were men and women of tremendous industry. It took six months for many of them to get here. Not long ago I was in Liverpool and went down to the old Liverpool docks from which many of them left. There, preserved in a museum, are the registers of the immigrant ships that brought our people here. They were slowgoing sailing vessels for the most part. They braved the storms of the Atlantic. Many of them then traveled to New Orleans, up the Mississippi to St. Louis, and up the Missouri to Florence, Nebraska, where they began the long overland trip west. It was work, work--unrelenting work. And then when they arrived here, the real labor began. They grubbed the sagebrush, they plowed the sun-baked soil, they led the waters from the mountain streams onto the soil, they planted their crops, they fought the destructive insects that attacked those crops, and with great labor they gathered in the harvest.<br><br>The Utah State seal shows the beehive--the Book of Mormon representation of the honeybee--and it carries the word<i>industry.</i><br><br>We too must work. Nothing happens in this world until there is work. You never plow a field by turning it over in your mind. You have to put your hands to the handles of the plow and walk forward. It is easier now, but the principle is the same. There must be work, and what a great and wonderful blessing that is.<br><br>They had very little money. They had no assistance from the government. They had to produce what they ate, and if they did not produce they would not eat.<br><br>What a dismal station we have reached in this nation where we have borrowed and spent and failed to repay. At the close of 1994, every man, woman, and child in the United States owed as his or her part of the national debt $17,805.64. Think of it. It is a disgrace. It affects all of our monetary policies and all of our commerce. It burdens us with taxes from which there is little or no relief.<br><br>Our pioneer forebears had as their motto:<br><br><i>Use it up,</i><br><i>Wear it out,</i><br><i>Make it do,</i><br><i>Or do without.</i><br><br>That statement of frugality and thrift served them well. We could learn a lesson from their example.<br><br>They were men and women of integrity. Repeatedly it has been said that their word was their bond. They performed as they promised. They were honest, true, benevolent, virtuous. They were men and women who kept their word. There were few if any lawyers in those days. The people in large measure lived the Golden Rule: "Therefore all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them" (Matthew 7:12).<br><br>Now we live in what is called the world's most litigious society. People are at one another's throats constantly. It seems almost that the filing of lawsuits has become a national pastime. What a disgrace that we cannot get along with one another as they got along with one another.<br><br>Those of you who read the daily papers must surely recognize that no longer do we seem to care very much about the principles or the behavior of a candidate who runs for political office. We have dishonesty in high offices in the land. How seriously we have fallen.<br><br>In all this world there is no substitute for personal integrity. It includes honor. It includes performance. It includes keeping one's word. It includes doing what is right regardless of the circumstances.<br><br>Am I an impractical idealist concerning the pioneers? No. There were exceptions here and there, but by and large they were a noble and wonderful people who walked in faith, who lived with loyalty, who were industrious, and who worked with integrity.<br><br>Shining above all of their principles and ideals was their solemn and wonderful belief in the Lord Jesus Christ as their Savior and their Redeemer. They knew him. He walked with them on that long march to the Elkhorn, up the Platte, beside the Sweetwater, over the Continental Divide, and down through the dry and desert country to this valley of the Great Salt Lake. He was their friend. They offered their prayers in his name. They sang to his glory. With humble appreciation they spoke of his great atoning sacrifice. They put their faith in him.<br><br>"And should we die before our journey's through, Happy day! All is well! We then are free from toil and sorrow, too; With the just we shall dwell!" ("Come, Come, Ye Saints,"<i>Hymns,</i>1985, no. 30). Such was their belief. Death was tragic for those left behind. But they knew there would be another day, a day of happy reunions. "But if our lives are spared again To see the Saints their rest obtain, Oh, how we'll make this chorus swell--All is well! All is well!" ("Come, Come, Ye Saints").<br><br>What a wonderful people they were. There is nothing like their great effort in all of history. There have been other great migrations. There have been many great causes for which men have given their lives. But in our time, within the span of our memory, stand these noble pioneers. God bless their memory to our good. When the way seems hard, when we are discouraged thinking all is lost, we can turn to them and see how much worse was their condition. When we wonder about the future, we can look to them and their great example of faith.<br><br>Let us during this sesquicentennial year, my dear friends, go back and read again their epic story.<br><br>With so great an inheritance, we must go forward. We must never let down. We must hold our heads high. We must walk with integrity. We must "do what is right [and] let the consequence follow" ("Do What Is Right,"<i>Hymns,</i>1985, no. 237).<br><br>May the Lord bless you, my dear friends, wherever you may be. May you go forward with your lives with great faith, with unyielding loyalty, with industry, and with noble integrity, is my humble prayer in behalf of each of you, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Gordon B.

<h1>e of a Good Name - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
We experienced a special day in our family on January 4, 1997. My brother organized a party honoring the 200th birthday of Gustavus Adolphus Perry. I am certain we were the only family holding a party for one born 200 years ago. Gustavus Perry was an important member of our family tree. He was baptized in 1832 and became the first of our family to embrace the gospel. The Perry family history records this remarkable event:<br><br><i>On a beautiful farm in the state of New York, Gustavus Adolphus Perry and his good wife, Eunice Wing, with their three sons, Orrin Alonzo, Lorenzo, and Henry Elisha, and their four daughters, Rosalie Alvira, Alvina, Amanda, and Lucy, were living very peacefully and happily. Close to the year of 1830 (we do not know the exact date) one evening after a light snow had fallen, the family was all in for the night. It was dark and the latchstring was drawn in so no one could enter the house. Then suddenly without warning, a stranger walked into the home and greeted them with these words: "God bless you." He spent the night with them explaining the principles of the gospel and told them of a new book called the Book of Mormon and quoted passages from the same. He then told them on what pages they were to find the quotations and that elders would soon visit them. The messenger disappeared in the morning just as suddenly as he had appeared the night before, leaving no tracks in the freshly fallen snow. They inquired of their neighbors to see if anyone had seen him. They had not, and no trace of him could be found.</i><br><br>This good family was ready for the gospel when it came to them, and they joined The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in 1832.<br><br>The Perrys were like other families who joined the Church in the early 1800s. They moved from their home in upstate New York to Ohio, then on to the gathering in Missouri. Forced from their Missouri home, they moved to Illinois. Again driven from their home, in the very cold winter of 1846, they made the painful trip across Iowa to settle in the Lake Branch at Winter Quarters. Here Gustavus served as a counselor in the bishopric until they were instructed in 1852 by Brigham Young to close the ward, join a wagon train, and make the long trek across the plains. Upon their arrival in Utah, he moved his family north into Box Elder County and settled at Three Mile Creek. In a few years his son, Orrin Alonzo, became the first bishop, and, as was the custom in those days, the community was named after their first bishop--thus, Perry, Utah, was named.<br><br>My brother thought that the birthday of Gustavus Adolphus Perry was significant and that we should all remember and honor the first member of our family to join the Church. As a part of the birthday celebration, my brother spent last year searching for the descendants of Gustavus Adolphus Perry. We were amazed at the record he had on the table before us as we celebrated. He had found more than 10,000 descendants of this good man. The number overwhelmed me. I could not believe that there could be more than 10,000 descendants of Gustavus Adolphus Perry, the first member of our family to join the Church. Suddenly I realized the value of a good name. In seven to eight generations, his family had sufficient numbers to organize three stakes of Zion.<br><br>In 1997, as we celebrate the 150th anniversary of those who made the great trek across the plains to find freedom to worship according to their beliefs, it seems appropriate that we take time to remember those who did so much for us to bring the gospel into our families. First, each of us has these special accounts in our family histories of the sacrifices that were made for us to be blessed with a knowledge of the gospel. In some families, you may be the first member to join. You become its pioneer family. Therefore you have the obligation to record in your history who brought the converting power of the gospel to you.<br><br>I thought this morning, as we approach this year of celebration, we should pause to consider the value of a good name. A study of the scriptures certainly demonstrates the importance the Lord places on a name and the value it can have for succeeding generations. The most exciting example I can think of is contained in Genesis 17:<br><br><i>And I will make my covenant between me and thee, and will multiply thee exceedingly.</i><br><br><i>And Abram fell on his face: and God talked with him, saying,</i><br><br><i>As for me, behold, my covenant is with thee, and thou shalt be a father of many nations.</i><br><br><i>Neither shall thy name any more be called Abram, but thy name shall be Abraham; for a father of many nations have I made thee.</i><br><br><i>And I will make thee exceeding fruitful, and I will make nations of thee, and kings shall come out of thee.</i><br><br><i>And I will establish my covenant between me and thee and thy seed after thee in their generations for an everlasting covenant, to be a God unto thee, and to thy seed after thee.</i>[Genesis 17:2–7]<br><br>The same promise was given to Abraham's son, Isaac. When his wife, Rebecca, had no children, Isaac entreated the Lord in her behalf. She was blessed of the Lord and gave birth to twins, Esau and Jacob. Esau was a hunter, an outdoorsman. The scriptures describe Jacob as a plain man who dwelled in a tent. Esau, in desperation, after coming in hungry from a hunting expedition, entreated Jacob to give him some food. He sold his birthright to Jacob for the food that he obtained. Later Jacob was blessed by his father "to have dominion and rule over peoples and nations" (Genesis 27, introduction). The blessing that Jacob received angered Esau when he found out that his father could not give two birthright blessings. He became so incensed that it was necessary for Jacob to flee because Esau desired his life. En route to the home of his mother's brother, the blessing that was promised to Abraham and Isaac was given to Jacob. Here is that blessing:<br><br><i>Thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth, and thou shalt spread abroad to the west, and to the east, and to the north, and to the south: and in thee and in thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed.</i>[Genesis 28:14]<br><br>When Jacob arrived at his uncle's place, he met Rachel tending her father's sheep. He assisted her in watering the flock. The scriptures record that she was a beautiful maid, and Jacob loved Rachel. Arrangements were made for their marriage. He was required to work seven years to receive her hand. At the end of seven years he approached his mother's brother for the wedding to take place. Jacob was informed that it was the custom in their land for the first daughter to be married before the second. He was required to marry Leah, the older sister. At the end of the seven days of wedding feasts, he was allowed to marry Rachel, but he had to work another seven years to fulfill his indebtedness. Jacob's marriages blessed him with 12 sons.<br><br>Great sorrow came to Jacob when Rachel died after giving birth to her second son, Benjamin. Added to his burden was the resentment of the brothers toward Joseph, for Jacob loved Joseph more than all his children. The brothers' feelings turned to hatred, and when the opportunity presented itself, the older brothers sold Joseph as a slave. He was then carried into Egypt.<br><br>The Lord blessed Joseph, and he prospered in the land of the pharaoh. When Jacob and his family fell on hard times, the older sons had to travel to Egypt to find relief from the famine. This led to a reunion and a great reconciliation between Joseph and his brothers. He told them: "And God sent me before you to preserve you a posterity in the earth, and to save your lives by a great deliverance" (Genesis 45:7).<br><br>Later, under the direction of the Lord, Jacob and all the souls of his house, numbering 70, moved to Egypt. Jacob was overjoyed to see Joseph again.<br><br>The honor given Jacob was that the Lord caused that his name be changed to Israel--"one who prevails with God."<br><br><i>And God said unto him, Thy name is Jacob: thy name shall not be called any more Jacob, but Israel shall be thy name: and he called his name Israel.</i><br><br><i>And God said unto him, I am God Almighty: be fruitful and multiply; a nation and a company of nations shall be of thee, and kings shall come out of thy loins;</i><br><br><i>And the land which I gave Abraham and Isaac, to thee I will give it, and to thy seed after thee will I give the land.</i>[Genesis 35:10–12]<br><br>Later, as the time drew near for Jacob (or Israel) to die, he called his sons together to bless them and their seed.<br><br>Israel's posterity were blessed in many ways, each receiving an inheritance in the land as they returned from Egypt.<br><br>Reuben and Simeon, because of their unrighteousness, were passed over in the special blessings given by Israel to his sons. To the third son, Levi, was given the priesthood. To Judah was given a blessing that through his posterity would come the King of Kings, the Lord of Lords.<br><br>Judah was the natural leader among the sons of Jacob, and the tribe descending from him took the lead after they settled in Israel.<br><br>The gospel of Matthew records the kingly lines of Jesus, the Messiah:<br><br><i>The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham.</i><br><br><i>Abraham begat Isaac; and Isaac begat Jacob; and Jacob begat Judas and his brethren.</i>[Matthew 1:1–2]<br><br>Then the scriptures continue on down through the generations to be certain that these tied into that kingly rule of David: "And Jesse begat David the king; and David the king begat Solomon" (Matthew 1:6). Then, a little further down: "And Jacob begat Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus, who is called Christ" (Matthew 1:16).<br><br>Christ's genealogical record tied into the prophecies of the Old Testament that the Savior would come through the tribe of Judah through David, the king, thus certifying his legal right to be the chosen Messiah, for this is the line that had been predicted by the prophets of old. "Judah, thou art he whom thy brethren shall praise: thy hand shall be in the neck of thine enemies; thy father's children shall bow down before thee" (Genesis 49:8).<br><br>It was to Joseph, the firstborn of Rachel, Israel's second wife, that the birthright blessing was given: "Joseph is a fruitful bough, even a fruitful bough by a well; whose branches run over the wall" (Genesis 49:22).<br><br>Joseph's blessings were passed on to his two sons, Ephraim and Manasseh. Thus, from the name of Israel came the great promise passed on from Abraham to Isaac to Israel and on to the numerous descendants who would be scattered in many lands.<br><br>Thus we see the kingly rule being promised through Israel's son Judah. To Joseph the blessing was given that his descendants would spread unto the utmost bounds of the everlasting hills. This blessing would extend into the latter days, when one named Joseph would be called to bring about a restoration of the fullness of the gospel.<br><br>It has always been interesting to me that the Prophet Joseph Smith was the third son of Joseph and Lucy Mack Smith. He had two older brothers, yet the name of Joseph was preserved for him. Who could doubt that his life was the fulfillment of the great promise made to Joseph of old that through his lineage would come that great saving power of the gospel of our Lord and Savior.<br><br>Let us just look briefly at the life of the Prophet Joseph Smith and how that promise was literally fulfilled.<br><br>Few prophets have come from more humble beginnings than those of the Prophet Joseph Smith. He was the fifth child in a family of 11. The rugged, rocky soil of New England had not been good to his family. The climate limited the growing season. During Joseph Smith's early years, his family moved frequently, trying to find fertile soil for a suitable livelihood. They moved from Sharon to Tunbridge, then on to Royalton, Vermont. In 1811 they moved to the small community of West Lebanon, New Hampshire, and began, as his mother said, "to contemplate, with joy and satisfaction, the prosperity which had attended our recent exertions" (Lucy Mack Smith,<i>History of Joseph Smith</i>[Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1958], p. 51). But typhoid fever came to West Lebanon in a terrible epidemic. The epidemic swept through the upper Connecticut valley and left 6,000 people dead. One by one the Smith children fell ill. It was then that Joseph had the illness and accompanying complications that eventually required surgery. The Lord again showed his hand by providing one of the few surgeons who could perform the delicate operation that saved Joseph's life and prepared him for the future that was ahead.<br><br>Many illnesses left the Smith family destitute, and they had to move again, this time to Norwich, Vermont. Here the Smith family began to farm and attempt to wrest a livelihood out of the difficult Vermont soil. Crops failed three years in a row, prompting the father to again look for a place where he could provide for his family. He heard of land in upstate New York that had promise. He took what resources he had to pay off his debts and left his family and went on to New York to explore the possibility of moving his family there. Once again we see the hand of the Lord in guiding them to the proper destination where great events in Church history would take place. It was in this location that the family settled down and the remarkable events occurred that brought forth the restoration of the gospel.<br><br>Out of this hard, difficult beginning, Joseph Smith developed a great reliance on the Lord, trusting in him to gain the exceptional spiritual strength needed so that he could be used by the Lord to organize his church again on the earth. To organize the work to begin this dispensation, the Lord needed a pure spirit, unlearned in the things of the world. He had to have one who could be taught by the ministration of angels. There was no earthly teacher equipped to do this training. The would-be prophet had to be truly sensitive to the Spirit, a quick learner, and a young man of exceedingly great faith--faith enough to approach the Lord after being impressed by reading James 1:5, which reads, "If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him."<br><br>This inspired the young man. He took courage and went into a grove of trees and there asked God to give him the wisdom he was seeking. The great, humble petition of this simple young man brought forth a remarkable change in the thinking of mankind toward the very nature of God. It was the beginning of a whole series of events that occurred in Joseph's young life. Carefully taught by messengers from on high, he had the great privilege of bringing forth the Book of Mormon, and through miraculous means it was translated and made available to the peoples of the world--another witness for our Lord and Savior on the earth to eliminate the great confusion that was developing among religious sects, even about the very basics of the gospel. He was the first elder and was called to be the instrument of the Lord to effect the restoration of the Church of Jesus Christ again on earth.<br><br>The prophet's life was all too short, but the contribution he made will last into the eternities. His life was taken from him by a cruel mob on the 27th day of June of 1844. He had fulfilled the prophecy. Joseph, son of Joseph, as had been prophesied in the scriptures, had brought forth the remarkable work in these, the latter days. Thus we see how the Lord has fulfilled his promise to Abraham's seed. (See<i>Church History in the Fulness of Times</i>[Salt Lake City: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 1989], pp. 20–27.)<br><br>The name we have been given is special because it blesses us with a heritage by which we can receive the great promise of the Lord to his children, even the gift of life eternal. It has always been of profound interest to me that the first lesson taught to the Prophet Joseph Smith by Moroni was the absolute necessity of families being sealed together. That message was recorded in Doctrine and Covenants 2:<br><br><i>Behold, I will reveal unto you the Priesthood, by the hand of Elijah the prophet, before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord.</i><br><br><i>And he shall plant in the hearts of the children the promises made to the fathers, and the hearts of the children shall turn to their fathers.</i><br><br><i>If it were not so, the whole earth would be utterly wasted at his coming.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 2:1–3]<br><br>The purpose of Elijah's mission was the restoration of the sealing power to bind on earth that which will be bound in the eternities to come, thus making operative on earth the ability to perform the ordinances of the gospel for both the living and the dead. This made it possible for the eternal linking of families together.<br><br>I have always marveled how the Spirit of Elijah works on men and women when they understand the blessings of an eternal unit. It even spreads to those who do not understand this doctrine. Genealogy, they tell me, has become the number-one hobby in the nation. The Spirit of Elijah almost becomes a contagion among the people as it moves to unite family units together. Look at the wide acceptance of PBS and the number of stations carrying the program<i>Ancestors</i>that was produced here at Brigham Young University. In the<i>Encyclopedia of Mormonism</i>we find an explanation:<br><br><i>When Latter-day Saints speak of the spirit of Elijah . . . , they mean at least two things. First, the promise of salvation made to the fathers has been renewed to the modern Church. . . . Second, the hearts of men and women have extensively turned to their fathers, as is evident in the dramatic growth in the number of genealogical societies, libraries, and individual genealogical or family history research organizations throughout much of the world. . . .</i><br><br><i>For members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, the spirit of Elijah is the spirit of family kinship and unity. It is the spirit that motivates the concern to search out ancestral family members through family history; and, on their behalf, to perform proxy baptisms, temple endowments, and sealing ordinances (</i>HC<i>6:252). This is seen as fulfillment of the prophecy of Malachi that in the last days Elijah "will turn the heart . . . of the fathers to the children, and the heart of the children to their fathers" (Mal. 4:5–6).</i>[<i>Encyclopedia of Mormonism,</i>vol. 2 (New York: Macmillan, 1992), pp. 451–52; s.v. "Elijah" and "Elijah, Spirit of"]<br><br>As we celebrate the 150th anniversary of the arrival of the Mormon pioneers after they struggled over the plains from Winter Quarters to the Salt Lake Valley, it is only natural that our thoughts are turned to the history of our families and the sacrifices they made to embrace the gospel of our Lord and Savior. In 1966 the Church announced a priesthood genealogy program and counseled members in this way:<br><br><i>The family books of remembrance in Latter-day Saint homes today should rate in importance second only to the standard works. These family records are supplements to the scriptures, aiding in teaching the gospel of Jesus Christ to the posterity of faithful members of the Church. A knowledge of the written testimonies and spiritual experiences of family members and of the proved genealogies of the fathers serves to bind the hearts of the children to their fathers and helps them to understand the doctrines that pertain to the exaltation of the family. . . .</i><br><br><i>Every faithful family should be diligently compiling a book of remembrance. In it should be found the story of the family, especially the story of its spiritual life, written by inspiration. It should also contain a genealogy of the family so that the children may have an opportunity to acquire knowledge of their fathers.</i>["Genealogy: The Book of Remembrance,"<i>Improvement Era</i>69, no. 4 (April 1966): 294–95]<br><br>In addition, President Spencer W. Kimball taught about the personal benefit of keeping a book of remembrance. He said:<br><br><i>Keeping journals reminds us of blessings. Those who keep a book of remembrance are more likely to keep the Lord in remembrance in their daily lives. Journals are a way of counting our blessings and of leaving an inventory of these blessings for our posterity.</i>[<i>TSWK,</i>p. 349]<br><br>As I have studied the history of my family and have learned how much they sacrificed for the gospel, I have grown to appreciate the value of a good name. It has built within me a greater desire to do what I can do to bring honor to this good family name. It has also impressed upon me the responsibility I have to future generations. If I were to bring dishonor to the name, and if our family continues to grow as it has in the past generations, that influence could cause many to fall away, thus limiting their eternal blessings.<br><br>In Proverbs we find that "a good name is rather to be chosen than great riches, and loving favour rather than silver and gold" (Proverbs 22:1).<br><br>We cannot isolate ourselves from those around us. Our good name can be a special valued asset worth more than the riches of the world.<br><br>In the Lord's grand design for his children, he placed families as a centerpiece of his organizational structure. The scriptures always have their beginning in a family setting. In the Old Testament we have the story of Adam and Eve. The New Testament begins with the genealogy of our Savior. The Book of Mormon's first lines are "I, Nephi, having been born of goodly parents." Near the beginning of the Doctrine and Covenants is an excerpt from Moroni's visit to Joseph Smith reminding us of the visitation of Elijah the prophet (D&amp;amp;C 2). In the Pearl of Great Price, again, is told the story of our first earthly parents.<br><br>Your good name connects you with your past family history. Your righteous living, your example, your teachings, and your worthwhile service will bless numerous people with your vision. It is almost impossible to comprehend the number. May the Lord bless you with a greater understanding of his great plan of happiness and your special role in it. I add my witness to the many who have stood in this place over many years that families are important. Your name is special. It is recorded in the histories of our Father in Heaven, and how you value that, how you treat it, will literally affect generations to come. God bless you with the vision that is yours of who you are and the great privilege that is yours to belong to the Church of Jesus Christ.<br><br>God lives and Jesus is the Christ, the Savior of the world. We are part of that great plan that he has laid out for us for our eternal glory. This is my witness to you in the name of our Lord and Savior, even Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>L.

<h1>039;s Invitation: &quot;Come Unto Me&quot; - Jeffrey R. Holland - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I am honored and privileged to be invited to address you tonight. I am very conscious that your speaker last month was President Gordon B. Hinckley. I am not sure how any of us are supposed to follow him and his marvelous prophetic messages, but if you will promise not to hiss, boo, stalk out, or otherwise show your displeasure, I will do my best. I do ask for your faith and prayers tonight, that the Spirit of the Lord will be unrestrained and with us in great abundance. Our instruction and edification, as the scripture says, is to come "from above." I pray for and await that heavenly guidance even as you do.<br><br>May I say how pleased Sister Holland and I are with the concept of a Churchwide fireside that reaches out to all of the college-age and young-adult audience of the Church, not only in the U.S. and Canada but almost literally around the world. Right after our marriage it was our career decision and good fortune to sign on with the Church Educational System and--one way or another--spend the next 24 years of our lives with you. We were still doing that in 1989 when I was called to full-time service as a General Authority. This is my first opportunity since that call to speak in this setting to a CES audience we have known so well and have loved for so long.<br><br>I am particularly grateful for this beautiful choral rendition provided by the institute choir from Snow College. That beautiful number, one of my very favorite pieces of devotional music, provides not only the Spirit but also the text for my brief message to you tonight. The source for this wonderful selection is the eleventh chapter of Matthew, verses 28–30.<br><br><i>Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.</i><br><br><i>Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls.</i><br><br><i>For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.</i><br><br>That is my basic message to each of you tonight, wherever you live, whatever your joys or sorrows, however young or old you may be, at whatever point you may find yourself in this mortal journey of ours. Some of you know what you want to be and where you want to go with your lives, and some of you don't. Some of you seem to have so many blessings and so many wonderful choices ahead of you. Others of you feel, for a time and for whatever reason, less fortunate and with fewer attractive paths lying immediately ahead.<br><br>But whoever you are and wherever you find yourself as you seek your way in life, I offer you tonight "the way ... and the life" (John 14:6). Wherever else you think you may be going, I ask you to "come unto him" as the imperative first step in getting there, in finding your individual happiness and strength and success.<br><br>When Andrew and Philip first heard Christ speak, they were so moved, so spellbound that they followed him as he left the crowd. Sensing that he was being pursued, Christ turned and asked the two men, "What seek ye?" (John 1:38). Other translations render that simply "What do you want?"<br><br>They answered, "Where dwellest thou?" or "Where do you live?"<br><br>And Christ said, "Come and see." Just a short time later he formally called Peter and others of the new apostles with the same spirit of invitation, "Come, follow me" (see Matthew 4:19).<br><br>It seems to me that the essence of our lives is distilled down to these two brief elements in these opening scenes of the Savior's mortal ministry. One element is the question, to every one of us, "What seek ye? What do you want?" The second is his answer as to how to get that. Whoever we are, and whatever our problems, his response is always the same, forever: "Come unto me." Come see what I do and how I spend my time. Learn of me, follow me, and in the process I will give you answers to your prayers and rest to your souls.<br><br>My beloved young friends, I know of no other way for you to succeed or to be happy or to be safe. I know of no other way for you to be able to carry your burdens or find what Jacob called "that happiness which is prepared for the saints" (2 Nephi 9:43). That is why we make solemn covenants based on Christ's atoning sacrifice, and that is why we take upon us his name. In as many ways as possible, both figuratively and literally, we try to take upon us his identity. We seek out his teachings and retell his miracles. We send latter-day witnesses, including prophets, apostles, and missionaries, around the world to declare his message. We call ourselves his children, and we testify that he is the only source of eternal life. We plead for him to swing open the gates of heaven in our behalf and trust everlastingly that he will, based upon our faithfulness.<br><br>My desire for you tonight is to have more straightforward experience with the Savior's life and teachings. Perhaps sometimes we come to Christ too obliquely, focusing on structure or methods or elements of Church administration. Those are important and, like the tithes of mint and anise and cummin Christ spoke of, should be observed--but not without attention to the weightier matters of the kingdom, first and foremost of which is a personal spiritual relationship with deity, including the Savior, whose kingdom this is.<br><br>The Prophet Joseph Smith taught in the<i>Lectures on Faith</i>that it was necessary to have "an acquaintance" (that's his phrase) with the divine attributes of the Father and the Son in order to have faith in them. Specifically he said that unless we believe Christ to be "merciful and gracious, slow to anger, long-suffering and full of goodness," that unless we can rely on these unchanging attributes, we would never have the faith necessary to claim the blessings of heaven. If we could not count on "the excellency of ... character" (that is also his phrase) maintained by the Savior and his willingness and ability to "forgive iniquity, transgression, and sin," we would be, he said, "in constant doubt of salvation." But because the Father and the Son are unchangeably "full of goodness" then, in the words of the Prophet, such knowledge "does away [with] doubt, and makes faith exceedingly strong" (<i>Lectures on Faith</i>3:19–20).<br><h2><b>Lay Down Your Burden</b></h2><br>I don't know what things may be troubling you personally tonight, but, even knowing how terrific you are and how faithfully you are living, I would be surprised if someone somewhere weren't troubled by a transgression or the temptation of transgression. To you, wherever you may be, I say, Come unto him and lay down your burden. Let him lift the load. Let him give peace to your soul. Nothing in this world is more burdensome than sin. It is the heaviest cross men and women ever bear. And while I believe you to be the greatest generation of young adults ever to live in this Church, nevertheless the world around you is an increasingly hostile and sinful place. Occasionally that splashes onto us, and perhaps, in the case of a few of you, it may be nearly drowning you.<br><br>To anyone struggling under the burden of sin, we say again with the Prophet Joseph that God has "a forgiving disposition" (<i>Lectures on Faith</i>3:20). You can change. You can be helped. You can be made whole--whatever the problem. All he asks is that you<i>walk away from the darkness and come into the light,</i>his light, with meekness and lowliness of heart. That is at the heart of the gospel. That is the very center of our message. That is the beauty of redemption. Christ has "borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows," Isaiah declared, "and with his stripes we are healed"--if we want to be (Isaiah 53:4–5; Mosiah 14:4–5).<br><br>For anyone out there seeking the courage to repent and change, I remind you that the Church is not a monastery for the isolation of perfect people. It is more like a hospital provided for those who wish to get well. Do whatever you have to do to come into the fold and be blessed. For some of you that is simply to live with greater faith, to believe more. For some of you it does mean to repent: Right here. Tonight. For some of you (I<i>hope</i>there are investigators out there. There better be!) it means to be baptized and come into the body and fellowship of Christ. For virtually all of us it means to live more by the promptings and promises of the Holy Ghost and to "press forward with a steadfastness in Christ, having a perfect brightness of hope, and a love of God and of all men."<br><br>"This is the way," Nephi said--there is that word again--"and there is none other way ... whereby man [or woman] can be saved in the kingdom of God" (2 Nephi 31:20–21).<br><br>This reliance upon the forgiving, long-suffering, merciful nature of God was taught from before the very foundation of the world. It was always to give us hope and help, a reason to progress and improve, an incentive to lay down our burdens and take up our salvation. May I be bold enough to suggest that it is impossible for anyone who really knows God to doubt his willingness to receive us with open arms in a divine embrace if we will but "come unto him." There certainly can and will be plenty of external difficulties in life. Nevertheless the soul that comes unto Christ dwells within a personal fortress, a veritable palace of perfect peace. "Whoso hearkeneth unto me," Jehovah says, "shall dwell safely, and shall be quiet from fear of evil" (Proverbs 1:33).<br><br>That is exactly what Paul said to the Corinthians. Trying to help them keep their chin up--and the Corinthians had a lot to be grim about--he wrote:<br><br><i>Blessed be God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies, and the God of all comfort;</i><br><br><i>Who comforteth us in all our tribulation, that we may be able to comfort them which are in any trouble, by the comfort wherewith we ourselves are comforted of God.</i>[2 Corinthians 1:3–4]<br><br>Jesus taught the same thing to the Nephites, who also lived in a difficult world. "For the mountains shall depart and the hills be removed," he said, "but my kindness shall not depart from thee, neither shall the covenant of my peace be removed [from thee]" (3 Nephi 22:10; see also verses 13–14). I love that. The hills and the mountains may disappear. The seas and oceans may dry up completely. The least likely things in the world may happen, but "my kindness shall not depart from thee, neither shall<i>the covenant of my peace</i>be removed [from thee]" (emphasis added). After all, he has, he reminds us, "graven thee upon the palms of my hands" (1 Nephi 21:16). Considering the incomprehensible cost of the Crucifixion, Christ is not going to turn his back on us now.<br><h2><b>Peace to Our Souls</b></h2><br>The Lord has probably spoken enough such "comforting words" to supply the whole universe, it would seem, and yet we see all around us unhappy Latter-day Saints, worried Latter-day Saints, and gloomy Latter-day Saints into whose troubled hearts not one of these innumerable consoling words seems to be allowed to enter. In fact, I think some of us must have that remnant of Puritan heritage still with us that says it is somehow wrong to be comforted or helped, that we are supposed to be miserable about something.<br><br>Consider, for example, the Savior's benediction upon his disciples even as he moved toward the pain and agony of Gethsemane and Calvary. On that very night, the night of the greatest suffering the world has ever known or ever will know, he said, "Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you. ... Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid" (John 14:27).<br><br>I submit to you that may be one of the Savior's commandments that is, even in the hearts of otherwise faithful Latter-day Saints, almost universally disobeyed; and yet I wonder whether our resistance to this invitation could be any more grievous to the Lord's merciful heart. I can tell you this as a parent: As concerned as I would be if somewhere in their lives one of my children were seriously troubled or unhappy or disobedient, nevertheless I would be infinitely more devastated if I felt that at such a time that child could not trust me to help, or should feel his or her interest were unimportant to me or unsafe in my care. In that same spirit, I am convinced that none of us can appreciate how deeply it wounds the loving heart of the Savior of the world when he finds that his people do not feel confident in his care or secure in his hands or trust in his commandments.<br><br>Just because God is God, just because Christ is Christ, they cannot do other than care for us and bless us and help us if we will but come unto them, approaching their throne of grace in meekness and lowliness of heart. They can't help but bless us. They have to. It is their nature. That is why Joseph Smith gave those lectures on faith, so we would understand the nature of godliness and in the process have enough confidence to come unto Christ and find peace to our souls. There is not a single loophole or curveball or open trench to fall into for the man or woman who walks the path that Christ walks. When he says, "Come, follow me" (Luke 18:22), he means that he knows where the quicksand is and where the thorns are and the best way to handle the slippery slope near the summit of our personal mountains. He knows it all, and he knows the way. He is the way.<br><br>Listen to this wonderful passage from President George Q. Cannon teaching precisely this very doctrine:<br><br><i>No matter how serious the trial, how deep the distress, how great the affliction,</i>[God]<i>will never desert us. He never has, and He never will. He cannot do it.</i>It is not His character [to do so].<i>He is an unchangeable being; the same yesterday, the same today, and He will be the same throughout the eternal ages to come. We have found that God. We have made Him our friend, by obeying His Gospel; and He will stand by us. We may pass through the fiery furnace; we may pass through deep waters; but we shall not be consumed nor overwhelmed. We shall emerge from all these trials and difficulties the better and purer for them, if we only trust in our God and keep His commandments.</i>["Freedom of the Saints," in<i>Collected Discourses,</i>comp. and ed. Brian H. Stuy, 5 vols. (Burbank, California: B.H.S. Publishing, 1987–92), 2:185; emphasis added]<br><br>Once we have come unto Christ and found the miracle of his "covenant of peace," I think we are under obligation to help others do so, just as Paul said in that verse to the Corinthians--to live as much like he lived as we possibly can and to do as much of what he did in order that others may walk in this same peace and have this same reassurance.<br><h2><b>Heal One Another</b></h2><br>Much of the comfort we have sung and spoken of tonight comes from the Savior's power to heal--heal the wounds of life or of sorrow or, where necessary, of transgression. Having wanted that<i>for</i>you tonight, that is one thing I would now ask<i>from</i>you tonight--healing, healing for others, healing for those you love and, yes, perhaps especially for those you don't. The people around us need a lot of help, and I think the Lord expects us to join in that effort. I think that is what he meant when he said, "Come; see what I do and watch how I spend my time."<br><br>Following my call to the Quorum of the Twelve, I read all of the standard works again, with special concentration on anything said or done by the Savior. Inasmuch as I couldn't sleep, I seemed to have more than the usual amount of time and privacy to consider these great teachings. As I put somewhat new and often tear-filled eyes to the scriptures, I saw perhaps for the first time the majesty of Christ's healing influence--probably because I was needing so much of that myself. As the Savior's ministry in the New Testament began, Matthew records:<br><br><i>And Jesus went about all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing all manner of sickness and all manner of disease among the people.</i><br><br><i>And his fame went throughout all Syria: and they brought unto him all sick people that were taken with divers diseases and torments, and those which were possessed with devils, and those which were lunatick, and those that had the palsy; and he healed them.</i>[Matthew 4:23–24]<br><br>Then, following the Sermon on the Mount, in rapid succession, he heals a leper, the servant of a centurion, Peter's mother-in-law, and<br><br><i>many that were possessed with devils ..., and healed all that were sick:</i><br><br><i>That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the prophet, saying, Himself took our infirmities, and bare</i>our<i>sicknesses.</i>[Matthew 8:16–17; emphasis added]<br><br>This is then followed in equally rapid fashion by the casting out of the devils near Gadarene, the healing of a man with palsy, the miracle of the woman diseased 12 years with an issue of blood, the raising of a young woman from the dead, the sight returned to the eyes of two blind men, and speech returned to one who was dumb.<br><br>With all of this work lying before him, Jesus caps off this almost nonstop scriptural sequence with these verses, which every missionary has heard in responding to his or her call:<br><br><i>But when he saw the multitudes, he was moved with compassion on them, because they fainted, and were scattered abroad, as sheep having no shepherd.</i><br><br><i>Then saith he unto his disciples, The harvest truly is plenteous, but the labourers are few;</i><br><br><i>Pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest, that he will send forth labourers into his harvest.</i>[Matthew 9:36–38]<br><br>We all know that wonderful call for more labourers into the work of the harvest refers primarily to teaching and testifying. It is a wonderful missionary scripture. But I wish to suggest tonight that in context it surely is a call to heal one another as well. Jesus certainly did his missionary work, and he did that first. But as he went about preaching and teaching, he bound up all manner of wounds in the process. The verse summarizing all of this, coming just before the calling of the twelve apostles and their charge to do likewise, says:<br><br><i>And Jesus went about all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every sickness and every disease among the people.</i>[Matthew 9:35]<br><br>Most of the healing I am speaking of tonight is not necessarily that of administering to the physically sick, though we surely should be ready and worthy to either request or give such a blessing at a moment's notice according to the order of the priesthood. No, what I am speaking of tonight are those rending, wrenching illnesses of the soul that need to be healed but may be quite personal--some burden held deep inside, some weariness that is not always particularly obvious to the rest of the world. Here in the shadow of the 21st century we are more often to face slightly more metaphysical sicknesses than those biblical ills of old like leprosy and consumption.<br><br>On the example of the Savior himself and his call to his apostles, and with the need for peace and comfort ringing in our ears, I ask you to be a healer, be a helper, be someone who joins in the work of Christ in lifting burdens, in making the load lighter, in making things better. Isn't that the phrase we used to use as children when we had a bump or a bruise? Didn't we say to Mom or Dad, "Make it better." Well, lots of people on your right hand and on your left are carrying bumps and bruises that they hope will be healed and made whole. Someone sitting within reasonable proximity to you tonight is carrying a spiritual or physical or emotional burden of some sort or some other affliction drawn from life's catalog of a thousand kinds of sorrow. In the spirit of Christ's first invitation to Philip and Andrew and then to Peter and the whole of his twelve apostles, jump into this work. Help people. Heal old wounds and try to make things better.<br><br>I don't know about you, but in my experience I hardly know of a hymn that caught on in the Church more readily than did "Lord, I Would Follow Thee," written by Susan Evans McCloud and my BYU friend of years, K. Newell Dayley. Don't we all respond to these lines:<br><br><i>Savior, may I learn to love thee,</i><br><i>Walk the path that thou hast shown,</i><br><i>Pause to help and lift another,</i><br><i>Finding strength beyond my own.</i><br><i>Savior, may I learn to love thee--</i><br><i>Lord, I would follow thee.</i><br>...<br><i>I would be my brother's keeper;</i><br><i>I would learn the healer's art.</i><br><i>To the wounded and the weary</i><br><i>I would show a gentle heart.</i><br><i>I would be my brother's keeper--</i><br><i>Lord, I would follow thee.</i><br>[<i>Hymns,</i>1985, no. 220]<br><br>Often we can, usually unwittingly, be quite insensitive to the circumstances and difficulties of those around us. We all have problems, and ultimately each individual has to take responsibility for his or her own happiness. None of us is so free of difficulty ourselves or so endowed with time and money that we can do nothing but tend "the wounded and the weary." Nevertheless, in looking to the Savior's life for an example, I suspect we can probably find a way to do a little more of that than we do.<br><br>Since I have talked a little earlier tonight about repentance, let me repent a bit myself--or at least do the confessing part and hope even now there is a way for me to make some restitution where that is still possible. My confession is that I wish I could go back to my youth and there have another chance to reach out to those who, at the time, didn't fall very solidly onto my radar scope. We are so vulnerable in our youth. (And I certainly consider you in your youth. In fact, you look younger to me every year of my life!) We want to feel included and important, to have the feeling we matter to others. In your years people deserve to have true friendships--the real value of which, like our health, may never be realized until we face life without them. I think that my problem was not that I had too few friends but almost too many--maybe more friends than anyone I know. But it is the associations I didn't have, the friends I didn't reach that cause me some pain now all these years later.<br><br>Let me cite just one case, which will be guilt enough for tonight. In 1979 we held in St. George our 20-year class reunion for Dixie High School. We had great high school years filled with state football and basketball championships and a host of other "hometown, USA" memories. My life was straight out of<i>Happy Days.</i>I was Richie Cunningham before Ron Howard was Richie Cunningham. We even had our own Fonzie--black leather jacket and all. Anyway, an effort was made to find current addresses for the entire class and get everyone to the reunion.<br><br>In the midst of all that fun, I remember the terribly painful letter written by one very bright--but, in her childhood, somewhat overweight and less than popular--young woman who wrote something like this:<br><br><i>Congratulations to all of us for having survived long enough to have a 20-year class reunion. I hope everyone has a wonderful time. But don't reserve a place for me. I have, in fact, spent most of those 20 years trying to forget the painful moments of our school days together. Now that I am nearly over those feelings of loneliness and shattered self-esteem, I cannot bring myself to see all of the class and run the risk of remembering all of that again. Have a good time and forgive me. It is my problem, not yours. Maybe I can come at the 30-year mark.</i><br><br>(Which, I am very happy to report, she did.) But she was terribly wrong about one thing--it was our problem, and we knew it.<br><br>I have wept for her--my friend--and other friends like her in our youth for whom I and a lot of others obviously were<i>not</i>masters of "the healer's art." We simply were not the Savior's agents or disciples that he intended a group of young people to be. I cannot help but wonder what I might have done to watch out a little more for the ones not included, to make sure the gesture of a friendly word or a listening ear or a little low-cost casual talk and shared time might have reached far enough to include those hanging on the outer edge of the social circle, and in some cases barely hanging on at all.<br><br>Jesus said in the culmination of his most remarkable sermon ever:<br><br><i>For if ye love them which love you, what reward have ye? do not even the publicans the same?</i><br><br><i>And if ye salute your brethren only, what do ye more than others? do not even the publicans so?</i>[Matthew 5:46–47]<br><br>It is with some apostolic sorrow that I acknowledge I have never known what it is like not to have a date when everyone else had one, nor to be painfully shy, nor to be chosen last for basketball, nor to be truly poor, nor to face the memories and emotions of a broken home--nor any one of a hundred other things I know many in this audience have had to contend with in the past or are contending with right now. In acknowledging that, I make an appeal for us to reach beyond our own contentment, to move out of our own comfort and companion zone, to reach those who may not always be so easy to reach.<br><br>If we do less, what distinguishes us from the biblical publican? I might not have been able to heal all the wounds of those I met in my young adult years--your years--but I can't help think that if I had tried even harder to be more of a healer, more of a helper, a little less focused on myself, and a little more centered on others, some days in the lives of those God placed in my path would have been much better. "I have called you friends," the Savior said in one of his highest compliments to his disciples (John 15:15). Therefore, "love one another, as I have loved you" (verse 12). That harvest is great and the laborers are few.<br><h2><b>Christ Watches over Us</b></h2><br>One last piece of counsel regarding coming to Christ. It comes from an unusual incident in the life of the Savior that holds a lesson for us all. It was after Jesus had performed the miracle of feeding the five thousand from five loaves of bread and two fishes. (By the way, let me pause here to say, Don't worry about Christ running out of ability to help you. His grace<i>is</i>sufficient. That is the spiritual, eternal lesson of the feeding of the five thousand.) After Jesus had fed the multitude, he sent them away and put his disciples into a fishing boat to cross over to the other side of the Sea of Galilee. He then "went up into a mountain apart to pray" (Matthew 14:23).<br><br>We aren't told all of the circumstances of the disciples as they set out in their boat, but it was toward evening, and certainly it was a night of storm. The winds must have been ferocious from the start. Because of the winds, these men probably never even raised the sails but labored only with the oars--and labor it would have been. We know this because by the time of "the fourth watch of the night" (Matthew 14:25)--that is somewhere between three and six in the morning--they had gone only a few miles. By then the ship was caught up in a truly violent storm, a storm like those that can still sweep down on the Sea of Galilee to this day.<br><br>But, as always, Christ was watching over them. He<i>always</i>does, remember? Seeing their difficulty, the Savior simply took the most direct approach to their boat, striding out across the waves to help them, walking on the water as surely as he had walked upon the land. In their moment of great extremity, the disciples looked and saw in the darkness this wonder in a fluttering robe coming toward them on the ridges of the sea. They cried out in terror at the sight, thinking that it was a phantom upon the waves. Then, through the storm and darkness--when the ocean seems so great and little boats seem so small--there came the ultimate and reassuring voice of peace from their Master. "It is I," he said, "be not afraid" (verse 27).<br><br>This scriptural account reminds us that the first step in coming to Christ--or his coming to us--may fill us with something very much like sheer terror. It shouldn't, but it sometimes does. One of the grand ironies of the gospel is that the very source of help and safety being offered us is the thing from which we may, in our mortal shortsightedness, flee. For whatever the reason, I have seen investigators run from baptism, I have seen elders run from a mission call, I have seen sweethearts run from marriage, and I have seen young couples run from the fear of families and the future. Too often too many of us run from the very things that will bless us and save us and soothe us. Too often we see gospel commitments and commandments as something to be feared and forsaken.<br><br>Let me quote the marvelous James E. Talmage on this matter:<br><br><i>Into every adult human life come experiences like unto the battling of the storm-tossed voyagers with contrary winds and threatening seas; ofttimes the night of struggle and danger is far advanced before succor appears; and then, too frequently the saving aid is mistaken for a greater terror.</i>[But,]<i>as came unto</i>[these disciples]<i>in the midst of the turbulent waters, so comes to all who toil in faith, the voice of the Deliverer--"It is I; be not afraid."</i>[<i>Jesus the Christ,</i>3d ed. (Salt Lake City: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 1916), p. 337]<br><br>Brother Talmage used there the word<i>succor.</i>Do you know its meaning? It is used often in the scriptures to describe Christ's care for and attention to us. It means literally "to run to." What a magnificent way to describe the Savior's urgent effort in our behalf. Even as he calls us to come to him and follow him, he is unfailingly running to help us.<br><br>Finally recognizing the Master that night, Peter exclaimed, "Lord, if it be thou, bid me come unto thee on the water."<br><br>And Christ's answer to him was as it<i>always</i>is, to all of us: "Come," he said.<br><br>Instantly, as was his nature, Peter sprang over the vessel's side and into the troubled waves. While his eyes were fixed upon the Lord the wind could toss his hair and the spray could drench his robes, but all was well--he was coming to Christ. Only when his faith and his focus wavered, only when he removed his glance from the Master to see the furious waves and the black gulf beneath him, only then did he begin to sink. In fear he cried out, "Lord, save me" (Matthew 14:28–30).<br><br>In some disappointment the "Master of ocean and earth and skies" (see "Master, the Tempest Is Raging,"<i>Hymns,</i>1985, no. 105) stretched out his hand and grasped the drowning disciple with the gentle rebuke "O thou of little faith, wherefore didst thou doubt?" (Matthew 14:31). (See also Frederic W. Farrar,<i>The Life of Christ</i>[Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1994], pp. 310–13.)<br><br>Jesus is the Christ, the Son of the living God. This is his true and living Church. He wishes us to come unto him, to follow him, to be comforted by him. Then he wishes us to give comfort to others. However halting our steps are toward him--though they shouldn't be halting at all--his steps are never halting toward us. May we have enough faith to accept the goodness of God and the mercy of his Only Begotten Son. May we come unto him and his gospel and be healed. And may we do more to heal others in the process. When the storms of life make this difficult, may we<i>still</i>follow his bidding to "come," keeping our eye fixed on him forever and single to his glory. In doing so we too will walk triumphantly over the swelling waves of life's difficulties and remain unterrified amid any rising winds of despair.<br><br>I pray we will hear this very night that sweet utterance from the Savior of the world: "Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden. ... And ye shall find rest unto your souls" (Matthew 11:28–29). "Be of good cheer; it is I; be not afraid" (Matthew 14:27). I pray this for you and for those you can help, in the sacred name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Jeffrey R.

<br>
<br>
Some of you may be wondering what it would be like to stand here at a podium where prophets, apostles, presidents of the United States, a prime minister of England, Nobel Prize winners, university presidents, and many learned men and women have spoken--particularly some of you who may feel you are not quite as qualified as those who have occupied this place. As the least-qualified devotional speaker in the history of BYU, let me describe the feeling.<br><br>I last felt this way in August 1966, when I was taking prelim exams in economics at the University of Chicago. The purpose of the exams was to ascertain whether or not one could continue on in the doctoral program and whether or not there would be a fellowship for the next year. It was well known that about half of the class failed the exam each time. Fortunately you could take these two four-hour exams over again in six months if you failed, but the exams were a terrifying experience. The stench of fear of failure and feelings of inadequacy were all about me as I took those exams. So, try to recall how you felt when taking the exam for which you were the least prepared. That is the feeling I have here at this podium when I think of the wonderful messages and ideas that have been expressed here. Your faith and prayers are needed today as never before at a devotional if we are to make valuable use of this time.<br><br>I want to start by taking us back to the beginning of mortality here on earth. When introducing Adam into the Garden, the Lord God said:<br><br><i>Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat,</i><br><br><i>But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it, nevertheless, thou mayest choose for thyself, for it is given unto thee; but, remember that I forbid it, for in the day thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.</i>[Moses 3:16–17]<br><br>This is a remarkable verse of scripture. An omnipotent God forbids the eating of the fruit that carries a consequence of death. Yet he binds himself to allow Adam and Eve to choose for themselves. Their choice, freely made, brought mortality and the need for a Savior and his example of unbounded love and sacrifice. Clearly, agency--the capacity to choose, to make moral distinctions--was a central part of the nature of Adam and Eve and an essential part of our Heavenly Father's plan. Today I would like to examine a few of the many facets of agency.<br><br>We know that agency played a crucial role in the War in Heaven in which Satan presented a plan to "redeem" all of God's children at the price of agency and the glory of God. In Moses 4:3–4, Heavenly Father indicates that agency was a premortal gift of supreme importance.<br><br><i>Wherefore, because that Satan rebelled against me, and sought to destroy the agency of man, which I, the Lord God, had given him, and also, that I should give unto him mine own power; by the power of mine Only Begotten, I caused that he should be cast down;</i><br><br><i>And he became Satan, yea, even the devil, the father of all lies.</i>[Moses 4:3–4]<br><br>If agency is of such importance that a loving Father would preserve it at such cost, then we should try to understand the implications of agency. Have you ever thought about the wonder of the gift of agency--this rare ability to make choices between good and evil that sets us apart from God's other creations? Volcanos do not have the power to choose when to erupt in order to minimize death and destruction. Asteroids don't change their course in order to steer clear of the earth. Grizzly bears are not waking up from winter hibernation telling themselves that this is the year they are going to quit eating those tender young elk calves. Crabgrass doesn't repent and vow to stop growing in people's backyards. The rest of God's creations were created to be controlled by their nature and to be unaware of good and evil and the need for moral distinctions. But we as humans are different. We have been given this wonderful capacity to decide that something is right or wrong and to change our actions. This ability to distinguish good from evil and to make choices accordingly is an attribute for which we should be grateful each and every day. Agency is essential to the plan of salvation and eternal life.<br><br>Agency, however, does not always make life easy or fulfilling. Agency conveys responsibility. Remember when you first were on your own at college. (Most of the faculty can't remember that far back. Please share your experience with any faculty that happen to be sitting near you.) Remember the delicious feeling of freedom you had as a new freshman--you could stay up till all hours of the night, get up when you wanted, wear what you wanted. (Yes, I know the Honor Code does reduce that feeling a little bit, but your roommate is unlikely to say, "You aren't going out looking like that, are you?") Remember when it first sunk in that you didn't have to go to class. The teacher wasn't taking roll, nor was anyone calling your parents to report your absence. You had absolute freedom of choice.<br><br>Then came your first midterms, 20 chapters to read before class on Wednesday, papers due, three-hour finals, and so forth. Gradually it dawned on you that freedom means responsibility or accountability. Agency means risk--risk that is absolutely necessary to bring eternal life, but nevertheless risk. The use of agency often results in pain, suffering, sin, evil, and even eternal damnation. Furthermore, agency implies accountability or consequences. When God gave us agency, we were also given responsibility for our actions. There is a delightful but somewhat strange verse in the Book of Mormon that summarizes this basic principle--2 Nephi 10:23:<br><br><i>Therefore, cheer up your hearts, and remember that ye are free to act for yourselves--to choose the way of everlasting death or the way of eternal life</i>.<br><br>(Jacob had a nice sense of humor using "cheer up your hearts" and "everlasting death" in the same sentence.)<br><br>So here we are--free to choose good or evil, to progress or to fail, to repent or to gain salvation. There is deep within us the will to be free, the desire to choose for ourselves. We see that will in action in little children as they struggle to "do it themselves." (When our son, Jeremy, who will graduate from BYU this April, was small, we used to respect his agency by asking him whether he wanted to go to bed now or in five minutes. It made him happy because it affirmed his agency.) We see it in whole nations or peoples who rise up and risk their lives for more freedom.<br><br>Yet there is also within us the desire to escape the consequences of those choices, to evade the responsibility, to find the explanation for our wickedness in some place other than in our own choices. That is, we often deny agency. The adversary plays off this all-too-human tendency to seduce us into believing that we do not really have agency and, therefore, we are not responsible for our moral choices. In this century Satan has been extraordinarily successful in convincing us that moral choice is an illusion. He has successfully convinced many people that the gift that God has given us, the gift that Satan wanted to take away from us to have all God's glory and power, does not exist. Satan's hostility to agency predates creation--his campaign against agency started in the Garden of Eden, and he has been hard at work ever since with remarkable success. Let me quote President Hinckley on this issue:<br><br><i>The war goes on. It is waged across the world over the issues of agency and compulsion. It is waged by an army of missionaries over the issues of truth and error. It is waged in our own lives, day in and day out, in our homes, in our work, in our school associations; it is waged over questions of love and respect, of loyalty and fidelity, of obedience and integrity. We are all involved in it.</i>["The War We Are Winning,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 1986, p. 45; quoted by Spencer J. Condie,<i>Your Agency: Handle with Care</i>(Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1996), pp. 61–62]<br><br>We need to understand what is at stake here and the tactics of the opposing force.<br><br>Adam and Eve were told that they could freely choose whether or not to eat the fruit of the tree of good and evil. They were then told the consequences of that choice--mortality. Satan tempted Eve by assuring her that there would not be negative consequences from her choice. "Ye shall not surely die; . . . ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil" (Moses 4:10–11). Notice that there was truth embedded in a terrible lie. Eating the fruit did increase their knowledge, but it also brought death.<br><br>The lie was typical of falsehoods about agency in that Eve was assured that there would not be costs or negative consequences associated with this choice--only pleasure or benefits. Such a lie is always seductive because that is what we want. We ache to believe that the path we want to pursue for the moment will be a path without any pain or suffering for us or even for anyone else. We want to choose that which tempts us but want no responsibility for the consequences.<br><br>Notice also how both Adam and Eve tried to shift responsibility for their choice. Eve mentioned that the serpent had beguiled her. The explanation that "the devil made me do it" has been a convenient rationalization through the ages. Although it was true that Satan lied and deceived her, he did not have the power to compel her to eat--she chose. Adam's response may have been even worse, for he began a long tradition men have followed with enthusiasm ever since. He tried to blame his wife, saying that she had given him the fruit. "Now see what you made me do" must be one of the more pathetic phrases that slips out of our mouths from time to time.<br><br>But soon Satan's lie was exposed as Adam and Eve experienced the real consequences of their choice, consequences we're still experiencing today: the earth is no longer generous, we eat by the sweat of our brow, there is pain and sorrow in childbearing and mortality, and, worst of all, we are separated from God. I hasten to add that wonderful things came with this choice--the opportunity for life here on earth for each of us with the possibility of eternal life, the love of Heavenly Father manifested through his Only Begotten Son, and the love and majesty of our Savior. But today I want to emphasize the adversary's response to agency and the human ambivalence about agency.<br><br>The essential elements of our condition--the ability to choose; opposition in the form of confusion, ignorance, and temptation; good or bad consequences from the exercise of our agency; and, finally, the tendency we all share either to deny that we have agency or to want the painful consequences of it removed--are the same for us as for Adam and Eve. And the adversary constantly refines his techniques to tempt us. In the 20th century the forces and ideas that reduce our faith in agency are very strong. Once again partial truths are used to deceive.<br><br>As our knowledge has grown in both the biological and social sciences, we have discovered many relationships between our behavior and particular individual characteristics or general social conditions. As scholars, we look for associations between specific characteristics and particular behaviors across large groups of people. For example: What biological, psychological, or family characteristics are associated with criminal behavior? We often find such associations and develop models of human behavior. For example, we economists discovered long ago the astounding result that an increase in the price of something reduces the amount people buy. And we have made a good living off this observation ever since. Every day scholars are publishing articles documenting the association between characteristics and behavior. The press loves to report and we love to hear about research that we can interpret as relieving us from responsibility for our actions.<br><br>Whenever geneticists find a link between some aspect of behavior and our genes, the media quickly brings that association to our attention. Then we can blame our parents or fate and excuse ourselves. If you were to look back over the past three decades with the explosion of knowledge in genetics, you would find countless news stories associating genetic inheritance with almost all general classes of behavior--criminal activity, sexuality, mood swings, rationality, intelligence, aggressiveness, and so on. For example, research in the 1960s and 1970s suggested that males with an extra Y chromosome were more likely to commit crimes or to suffer from emotional conditions associated with violent behavior. Magazines and newspapers were talking about the "crime gene." If you looked carefully at the reports, you found that more than 96 percent of males with the extra Y chromosome lived their lives without any of the reported difficulties. Furthermore, the extra Y chromosome could only account for a very small part of criminal activity. But we are attracted to such stories because they suggest that individuals are relieved of responsibility for their acts; meanwhile, scientists hold out the hope that genetic engineering will fix everything.<br><br>These seductive ideas that call agency into question always combine some truth and some error. Social or biological forces do influence our behavior. If we exchange a Y chromosome for one of the X chromosomes, changing a baby from a girl to a boy, there are all kinds of behavior changes. The Y chromosome can't ask for directions or lower lids in bathrooms, can't resist changing TV channels unless distracted by a sports program, and quickly reverts to an uncivilized state unless closely monitored. X chromosomes generally can't explain the infield-fly rule, but they believe hairstyles should be changed frequently and would quickly decorate their cell if imprisoned. Before you send President Bateman those letters complaining about my gender bias, let me reemphasize that these stereotypes are not destiny. There are men who choose to ask directions. It is humiliating, but they do it. My wife can testify that she has through years of patient work changed one or two of my Y-chromosome habits. Leaving aside the fun, gender does create some differences, but our agency is still intact; gender is not an excuse for any type of inappropriate or sinful behavior.<br><br>Just as biologists were documenting the effects of genetic inheritance on our behavior, social scientists were documenting the influence of family background and social conditions upon it. Sociologists measured the effect of poverty, divorce, racism, and bigotry on the social problems of society. Psychologists and psychiatrists inquired into the effect of the subconscious on our conscious behavior, looked at the effects of parents and family background on behavior, and pushed forward our understanding of the biology of the brain.<br><br>The translation of sound scholarship to the popular press often lost context and perspective and became the simplistic message people wanted to hear--our behavior was not under our control. Some popular therapists assured people that it was unhealthy to repress their desires, that the important thing to do was to discover who you are and fulfill yourself. To free us from guilt and sin, some intellectuals suggested that good and evil didn't necessarily exist or, at least if they did exist, good and evil were not within us but external. Individuals simply had preferences or different lifestyles. We should all be respectful of each individual's pursuit of happiness. Choices that still seemed questionable--such as becoming a heroin addict or an alcoholic or perhaps eating a two-pound box of chocolates in a single sitting--were treated as diseases or addictions rather than as vices. The commandments became passé.<br><br>For at least the last half of this century, there has been a debate between those scholars who argued for nature (genetics and biological influences) as the important determinant of our behavior and those who argued for nurture (family background and social conditions) as the key influence upon us. Agency was left to the side. Politics in both practice and theory contributed to this widespread perception that individuals were simply pawns in the grip of larger forces. Blame for social problems was often directed toward big institutions such as corporations, schools, universities, and labor unions or toward large impersonal economic forces. Politicians pursued votes by assuring the voters that they were not individually responsible for their plight and by presenting surefire government programs to fix social ills. Tolerance became the supreme virtue. It was as if we were all on a pleasure cruise together. We should all get along and have a good time and be polite and accepting of whatever others did.<br><br>Before society holds a party to celebrate our lack of responsibility for what we do, we should understand what we really know and don't know about the effects of nature and nurture on our lives. The studies done by scholars are directed toward isolating some effect that will be significant for a large group of people. This measured effect is an average influence with a great deal of variation around that average. For example, someone raised in a single-parent home may have a somewhat lower probability of obtaining a college degree. But many, many people raised in such an environment do obtain college degrees. Alcoholism may be linked to family background or even a certain genotype, but the links do not account for much of the alcoholism we see. There is enormous variation in individual behavior that goes completely unaccounted for by scientists, even those employing the most sophisticated techniques. A serious look at their research tells us that agency is still alive and well.<br><br>Let me give an economic example. An increase in the price of macaroni and cheese mixes at the grocery store will cause a drop in sales because people will buy less on average. However, should you follow individual shoppers around the grocery store, you would have virtually no success in predicting their purchases. Some would not buy macaroni and cheese mixes at all because they hate them. Some would buy fewer. Some, such as some returned missionaries, might buy more because it may be the only food they recognize outside the bakery. To my knowledge, nothing discovered by either natural scientists or social scientists offers convincing evidence that our agency does not exist or is severely limited.<br><br>Please don't misunderstand me. The advances in knowledge of human behavior are worthwhile. They add to our understanding of ourselves and others. Our genes do have an effect on our disposition and on our personality. The way we were raised is very important in determining our attitudes and behavior. Big institutions do have great power compared to single individuals. But in each case when individuals or groups want to excuse behavior or make it seem acceptable to violate the commandments of God, they exploit these partial truths to eliminate individual responsibility for our actions.<br><br>Let me now turn to the other side and examine the implications of the fact that our behavior is influenced by outside forces. Just as we err when we become convinced that we do not have agency, we commit an error when we assume that all of the good aspects of our life are due to the superior way in which we have used our agency. We need to remember that other important forces beyond the control of the individual--such as genetics, family background, social conditions, and even luck--do have an effect on the behavior of individuals. The gospel and the teachings of the Savior warn us to be sympathetic toward others.<br><br>We are admonished not to judge--at least not to judge unrighteously. I suspect that righteous judgment refers to the necessary judgments of priesthood authority to aid repentance and to protect the Church. Duly authorized civil judges exercise righteous judgment when they facilitate the rule of law. But judgment is not for the rest of us. We do not have the capacity to judge because any individual's behavior includes influences other than agency. Only the Perfect Judge is able to separate the role of agency from other factors. We should be very hesitant and aware of our inadequacies whenever we are tempted to judge others. Further, we should be quick to forgive for these same reasons. Pride in any of our own accomplishments from accumulation of wealth to athletic prowess to even observation of the commandments should be replaced with gratefulness that we have been so blessed, as well as with an awareness of the good external influences that have affected our lives.<br><br>The gospel clearly teaches us that family background, ethnic group, genetics, and so on are not destiny. There are dozens of verses of scripture that refer to our power to choose, the power of agency. We are not locked into a straitjacket of influences beyond our control that determines everything we do. We make moral choices. We are responsible and will be held accountable for those choices.<br><br>Consider a few scriptural examples. We know that the sins of one generation do have an effect upon the next generation. Mosiah 13:13 gives just such an example. But verse 14 says that those who repent and keep the commandments will receive God's mercy. Verses 13 and 14 together show agency as well as influences that interact with agency. We also know that the attitudes of the descendants of Lehi and Sariah or the progeny of the half brothers Esau and Jacob were influenced by the antagonisms of the past. Indeed, hatred may be handed down from generation to generation. But that hatred is, in part, chosen and need not be. Many descendants of Laman and Lemuel were converted to the gospel and lived lives of devotion to God and his commandments. Many Nephites rejected the gospel and joined the enemies of their people. A Lamanite named Samuel was a great prophet sent to call the descendants of Nephi to repentance. Prophets in the Old Testament came from all kinds of backgrounds. One of the greatest examples of family devotion in the scriptures involves Ruth and Naomi, a daughter-in-law and a mother-in-law who, according to conventional wisdom, should have been antagonists. Instead, Ruth declared, "Whither thou goest, I will go; and where thou lodgest, I will lodge: thy people shall be my people, and thy God my God" (Ruth 1:16). Ruth chose to go with Naomi back to Bethlehem to take care of Naomi. She eventually married Boaz and began a family that became the royal house of David, into which was born the Savior of the World.<br><br>The Savior taught us in one of his most familiar stories that social conditions are not destiny. When asked who was our neighbor, Christ gave us the story of the Good Samaritan. My brother Rulon suggested that by focusing on the hypocrisy of the priest and Levite, we may be overlooking one of the great truths in this wonderful story. The three people who encountered the man who was injured by thieves were a priest, a Levite, and a Samaritan. At the time of Christ, priests who officiated at the altar in the temple were drawn from four extended families held in high regard by the people. Levites assisted these priests in the temple and were also well respected by society. Like Jews, Samaritans thought of themselves as worshipers of Jehovah and claimed a share in the task of rebuilding the temple. Because the Jews rejected the Samaritans, the two groups became estranged to the point that the Samaritans built a rival temple.<br><br>If social scientists had been given the problem of predicting who would help the injured person, they would have begun their work by applying for a grant from the National Science Foundation. They would then probably have created a theory of helping based on perceived social distance with the hypothesis that the antagonisms between Jews and Samaritans would create the most social distance, and hence they would be less likely to help. Or they might have created a theory based on social classes and would need to know the incomes of the priest, Levite, and Samaritan. After all this theorizing, they would take a survey to measure attitudes of priests, Levites, and Samaritans toward helping typical Jews. Then the social scientists would have reported back the probabilities that a randomly selected person from each of three groups--priests, Levites, and Samaritans--would help the injured Jew. Then<i>Newsweek</i>or<i>Time</i>would do a cover story on charitable impulses, highlighting the antagonism between Samaritans and Jews.<br><br>This clearly was not the approach of the Savior. In this story the Savior displayed no interest in group tendencies and refused to define<i>neighbor</i>by such characteristics. Instead, he taught us that we are all brothers and sisters, that any of us, regardless of our own background and that of others in need, may choose to help those in distress. He taught us that<i>neighbor</i>is defined by what we do, not by who we are. The Samaritan, priest, and Levite had agency to help or not help the injured man; each of the three made a choice freely.<br><br>Although the Savior and the gospel emphasize our agency and our responsibility, the adversary emphasizes the reasons we are not responsible for our actions. Satan combines partial truths with falsehoods to make us content and at ease with our sins. He wants us to accept our nature and our behavior. He wants us to believe that change is impossible, that those who preach right and wrong are simply intolerant bigots who don't understand the modern world. If Satan can convince us that we do not have agency, we become as if we do not and he has won.<br><br>But if we step back for a moment and think of the world without agency, we can appreciate the crucial role it plays in the plan of salvation and in our view of life. Imagine a world in which each of us is programmed like a computer to respond according to external conditions, with no power to make moral choices. Many people see the world in terms that are almost that stark. Consider this quotation from an influential contemporary philosopher reflecting the loss of faith in God, truth, and morality:<br><br><i>Once upon a time we felt a need to worship something which lay beyond the visible world. Beginning in the seventeenth century we tried to substitute a love of truth for a love of God, treating the world described by science as a quasi divinity. Beginning at the end of the eighteenth century we tried to substitute a love of ourselves for a love of scientific truth, a worship of our own deep spiritual or poetic nature, treated as one more quasi divinity. . . .</i><br><br>[And now we have arrived at]<i>the point where we no longer worship</i>anything,<i>where we treat</i>nothing<i>as quasi divinity, where we treat</i>everything--<i>our language, our conscience, our community--as a product of time and chance.</i>[Richard Rorty,<i>Contingency, Irony, and Solidarity</i>(Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1989), p. 22; emphasis in original]<br><br>In this type of world there are no real heroes, simply individuals who are programmed to act in ways that we somewhat admire. In this world we might find someone or something interesting but not worthy of emulation because we cannot change. This is not the world I know. Let me briefly recount the life of Maggie Nichols Comer. African-American, she was born in Woodland, Mississippi, to a sharecropping family that had lived on in Mississippi after the end of slavery. Her father died when she was five years old. Her mother then married a man who was physically abusive to his wife and children and who kept them from school whenever it was possible for them to earn the slightest bit of money. At 16 Maggie ran away from home and migrated to East Chicago, Indiana. She worked as a domestic and eventually married Hugh Comer. With the help of her husband, who was often sick, she raised five children of her own as well as a stepdaughter. She was determined that her children would receive the opportunities that education could provide. She worked very hard, often at two or three jobs, to give her children opportunities. Her husband died of emphysema when her children were in high school. Still she did not let any obstacle deter her from helping her children to achieve all that was possible.<br><br>Let me give you a couple of examples of her tenacity. One of her sons who was attending Indiana University needed to take a course in the summer to be on track for his program, but the family did not have sufficient money to finance the education. Maggie Comer called Indiana University and asked to speak to the president. When the operator told her she couldn't just call up and speak to the president of the university, Maggie simply insisted that she had to--and she eventually did obtain financial aid for her son. Once her son Charles had mistakenly received a "pink slip" from school indicating poor work. While driving down a four-lane highway connecting East Chicago to Chicago, she decided to discuss the matter with Charles. Here is her son James' account of this conversation:<br><br><i>She said, "You can do better than that!"</i><br><br><i>He knew that there must be a mistake but he said, "No, I can't."</i><br><br><i>"You can!"</i><br><br><i>"I can't."</i><br><br><i>"You can!"</i><br><br><i>"I can't."</i><br><br><i>Finally Mom got so frustrated she stopped the car in the middle of the street and said, "You can!!!"</i><br><br><i>Mom was not the best driver in the world. . . . I was always a bit nervous when we got in the car. . . . But this was more than that. We were stopped in the middle of Columbus Drive, the busiest street in town--right in front of the main fire station. Cars were whizzing by and I could imagine that at any second the fire engines would roar out of the station. I was terrified! I could have choked Charles. Tell her you can and get us out of here, I thought to myself!</i>[James P. Comer,<i>Maggie's American Dream</i>(New York: New American Library, 1988), p. 111]<br><br>It turned out that the pink slip was a mistake. There were only two black children in Charles' class, and the pink slip was meant for the other boy.<br><br>Maggie Comer raised five children, all of whom graduated from college and received advanced degrees. She taught them right from wrong. She taught them that they were responsible for their choices. All successfully pursued their professions with distinction and raised families of their own. Her son James, who tells her story in his book, is the Maurice Falk Professor of Psychiatry and associate dean at the Yale Medical School.<br><br>If you wish to believe that an undereducated black woman named Maggie Comer was programmed to use up her life in service to her children and many others, you may. I see her as a heroine who understood the principle of agency. Here is her statement in her own words.<br><br><i>Even as a little barefoot girl back in the country, I had this dream. I had this gift from inside to want something. I thought to myself that if this one could do it and that one could do it, I could do it. And when I couldn't go on, I said my children would do it. People would say black folks can't do this and can't do that--I wouldn't have any of it. Sure, I could see it was harder for black people, but I just wanted a chance. That's what your father used to say, "Just give my people a chance!"</i>[<i>Maggie's American Dream,</i>pp. 227–28]<br><br>To come a little closer to home, I do not, for one minute, believe that Rex and Janet Lee were simply programmed to meet the challenge of Rex's cancer with extraordinary courage, grace, and faith. I see them as heroes. Nor do I believe that George W. Grant, C. Allen Huntington, and David Patton Kimball were simply programmed by age 18 to spend that stormswept day in early November 1856 carrying members of the Martin Handcart Company across the 100-foot-wide Sweetwater River. They and the many others who helped these poor stranded pioneers were heroes choosing to face life-threatening conditions to rescue people they had never met.<br><br>Without agency, love would be the result of conditioning or genetics and would be trivialized. Agency, on the other hand, gives love meaning and power beyond any force we know. The profound love demonstrated by the Savior in Gethsemane moves us to love him and take upon us his name because it was a gift he chose to give to us. From Luke 22:42 we understand that Christ had his agency and could have chosen not to endure the awful pain and suffering of the Atonement. Instead he chose to yield his will to that of the Father and perform the supreme example of righteous use of agency that the world has ever or will ever know. A world without agency would be a world without progress, without joy, without love, without meaning. That is why a world without agency would be a satanic world.<br><br>Agency is inextricably tied to repentance. Without agency we would not sin, nor could we repent. Again, imagine the satanic world in which there is no agency, no choices, no consequences, no progress, no change in us. Think of all the things about yourself that you would like to change. Without agency, all of those characteristics would be fixed. We would only change because the forces acting upon us had changed. We would, like the rest of God's creation, "be acted upon" rather than act for ourselves (see 2 Nephi 2:26). Whenever we tried to improve, we would be like Sisyphus, the king of Corinth in Greek mythology. Sisyphus was consigned by the gods to spend eternity pushing a rock to the top of the hill only to have it roll down again. Without agency, all of our frailties and sins would be like the rock of Sisyphus. We might try to change our nature, desires, or behavior but without success.<br><br>Instead of being like Sisyphus, however, we have this divine gift allowing us to change, to become aware of a sin or mistake we are making, to repent, and to be happy. We can change our desires and actions because we want to bring ourselves into alignment with the perfect model that the Savior has lived for us. Those things that make us or others unhappy can be changed through the great gifts of agency, the Atonement, and the capacity to repent. Rather than seeing repentance as something negative, we should see it as the culmination of the two great gifts that a loving Father has given us--moral agency and the Atonement. With these gifts we can perform a miracle, an act of cocreation. We can change ourselves into a different and better person. We should celebrate that miracle by using our agency every day to walk with the Savior and use the Atonement to re-create ourselves to be more and more like him.<br><br>I leave you my witness that there is within each of us a gift from God we can use to choose either good or evil. Do not be tempted by ideas or rationalizations that suggest you do not have agency and are not responsible. This gift is both wonderful and fearful. It allows us to reach unimaginable heights or the most abject depths by our own desires and acts. May the Lord bless each of us that we may use our agency to bless and improve our own lives as well as the lives of others. I pray for this blessing in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Clayne L.

<h1>Light” - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
President Bateman, colleagues, students, friends, and family, I appreciate the privilege that has been extended to me to talk with you for a few minutes this morning. I feel humbled by this assignment and pray that I might share a thought or two with you, especially as university students, that will be of some value and that the Spirit of the Lord might convey to you the feelings of my heart should I be unable to express them adequately.<br><br>I would like to thank the Spanish Choir for sharing their talents here today and for the beautiful music they have provided. I would also like to thank all of you who are in attendance, especially my family members, who never fail to support me.<br><br>Some of the most valuable programs in which the students in the Department of Spanish and Portuguese participate are those that take them abroad and allow them to learn to appreciate the values of other cultures. I have directed several such programs and am at the present time working with small groups of student interns who are dedicating a semester of their time to teaching literacy in rural Mexico. I am grateful to be able to take part in these programs and witness the growth and development of the students as well as those with whom they work. I too have grown as a result of this experience.<br><br>One of the counsels that we repeat many times to students who are preparing to travel abroad is to "travel light," and I am aware of the grammatical incorrectness of the phrase. I would appreciate any suggestions as to how to say it better, but, in the meantime, because of my lack of eloquence I have chosen this awkward phrase as the theme of my remarks.<br><br>We remind Study Abroad groups time and again that wherever they go they will be responsible for carrying their own luggage. Not only that, but on the journey they will acquire souvenirs and gifts, and they must plan for those extra items. If they want to be able not only to endure to the end but to enjoy the trip along the way, they must look ahead and "travel light."<br><br>That is what I am suggesting today for all of us in our travels, whether they be through the university or through life. I would counsel that we plan ahead right now and repack a few items, leaving behind the unnecessary ones that can overload us and make the trip less pleasant than it might be otherwise.<br><br>It might be well to examine our mind, heart, body, and soul, just to be sure that we are not carrying excess baggage. I am not advocating light-mindedness but <i>do</i>encourage all to travel with a mind uncluttered by such things as unclean thoughts, untruths, and negative attitudes. I meet far too many students who have developed a negative image of themselves or of others, who have forgotten for some reason that we were all created by our Heavenly Father and that he doesn't turn out inferior products--that we are his children and he loves us! I would have you all look in the mirror each morning and remind yourselves who you really are and how precious you are to your Heavenly Father. I often say to my grandchildren, "Have you ever seen an angel?"<br><br>They used to say, when they were young and innocent, "No, I've never seen an angel."<br><br>So I'd get out the little compact mirror in my purse and show it to them and say, "Now you have."<br><br>That's what we should think about when we look at ourselves.<br><br>Another checkpoint or area of caution for excess baggage of the mind is our focus: if we concentrate not on the riches of the world or success according to public opinion but on<i>eternal</i>treasures and success--those souvenirs that are of true value--we will find ourselves considerably unburdened on our journey.<br><br>And, while we are at it, let's lighten our hearts. A heart is light when it is focused on the light of Christ. Charity is the backpack that we should carry with us wherever we go. Charity is evidence of a heart that is overflowing with love and respect for family, friends, neighbors, and for all humankind, as well as for God. If we open our hearts to receive the love of God and of others, we are in harmony with natural beauty and truth; we recognize the voice of the Spirit and are able to acknowledge that presence through testimony and humble prayer. We are thus able to appreciate and express gratitude for the world around us.<br><br>We should lighten not only our hearts but also our bodies. I am not referring to physical weight--as I hope that is not a factor--but rather to our acquiring a lighter step as we are buoyed up by the hope offered in the gospel that results from obedience to the commandments of the Lord. A body is light that does not carry the burden of moral sin or uncleanliness; it is one that bears the yoke of the Lord. He has admonished us, "Take my yoke upon you . . . : and ye shall find rest unto your souls. For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light" (Matthew 11:29–30).<br><br>I would finally like to advocate the unburdening of our souls. If we are to realize our full potential in life, it is vital that the soul not be laden with regrets, mourning, or doubts. I've received a few letters from students, sometimes three or four years after they have graduated, confessing to having used notes or turning in someone else's paper. The letters usually end something like this: "Sister Meléndez, you're going to hate me for this, but I just couldn't carry it around any longer." Could I possibly hate a student for something like this? Never! But I do suffer with them, and I pray that they have now found peace of mind. Believe me, a grade of 75 percent weighs a lot less than a 95 percent grade that is not earned honestly.<br><br>We must learn to accept adversity with faith in the Lord and with hope in the future if our soul is to sing in the knowledge of eternal life. We must look forward to the day in which our spirit will reunite with the Father and rejoice in his eternal presence.<br><br>When we participate fully in the covenants we have made with the Lord, we can lay the burdens of our soul on him, grateful for the Atonement and striving to stay on the path that has been signaled for us.<br><br>These, then, are some of the areas where we can leave behind some heavy carry-ons for which we might otherwise have to pay extra tariffs. Another area of concern, however, is<i>how</i>to unburden ourselves. Of course, at my age, as you might expect, I have a few suggestions there as well!<br><br>We must never lose sight of the oft-mentioned, time-tested, guaranteed, number-one solutions to life's problems--which are prayer and the study of the scriptures. These are both invaluable tools in working toward this promise: "Ask, and it shall be given unto you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you" (3 Nephi 14:7). The promise is valid now, just as it has always been. God will answer our prayers. He has answered mine in spite of all my weaknesses, and I know he hears me and cares about me.<br><br>As for scripture study, I'm sure that you are as aware as I am of its value. We can find answers in the standard works. The Lord has given us these books to help us in our daily lives, and he will direct us and inspire us as we approach them--and him--in that knowledge. They apply to each of us--now, today, and always.<br><br>But we can also put forth personal effort to get rid of excess baggage. We can actually purge our minds of unwanted material. If you have negative feelings toward another, for example, release them. Let them dissolve or fly away--just see how it makes you feel, even about yourself. This is not just rhetoric. Dr. Madison Sowell, my esteemed colleague, recently treated the subject of forgiveness with great eloquence and humility, and I personally have experienced its benefits. It isn't even hard to do! Try it; you'll like it!<br><br>Mrs. Myrlie Evers-Williams spoke just over a month ago from this pulpit about the damage that hate can do to a person ("Positive Ways of Producing Change Within the System," forum address delivered at the Marriott Center, 25 February 1997). The person who hates is only corroding his own inner self. The object of the hatred may suffer for a time, but once that person feels secure in the fact that the prejudice or misunderstanding is not of their making, then only the hater is hurt by those emotions that cannot come from a divine source. Let it go.<br><br>President Spencer W. Kimball said:<br><br><i>Why does the Lord ask you to love your enemies and to return good for evil? That</i>you<i>might have the benefit of it. It does not injure him so much when you hate a person . . . , but the hate and the bitterness canker your unforgiving heart.</i>[<i>TSWK,</i>p. 103; emphasis in original]<br><br>There is no better way to learn love, tolerance, and respect for others than by living in another culture. Missionaries testify to this every day. Our programs here at BYU that offer opportunities to live in foreign cultures while touring, studying, or serving are outstanding, and I recommend them to anyone who does not fully recognize that truly we are all equal in the sight of the Lord.<br><br>Once you have learned to love others, you will also gain new respect for yourself. Self-deprecation is devastating. Whether lack of self-esteem comes from personal failure in a task or from being put down by others, the most important thing to remember is that we are loved unconditionally by our Heavenly Father.<br><br>He views your failures much as we as instructors do--not as steps backward but rather as steps forward in the learning process. I have asked my students on more than one occasion not to expect me to remember their grades. Of course, in the past five or six years I have had to ask them not to expect me to remember their<i>names</i>either!<br><br>Although I seldom forget a face, I now remember the names of my junior high school students from the '70s better than I do my BYU students from a year ago. "Senior citizenship" is like that. At any rate, when I see former students, I see A's shining on their foreheads. I am often surprised when one comments in a surprisingly loving tone that mine was the most difficult class they ever had and that in fact they got a C! I am always sorry to record a C grade for a class-A person, but it is the teacher's job to record and average<i>scores,</i>not character. I hope never to make a student feel that he is less than great as a person, for I do not recall a single one of them over a period of more than 20 years that I did not truly love.<br><br>I am not an adherent of the current philosophy that focuses on self-gratification and on blaming others for our shortcomings. I believe in accountability. But I know that if we are going to be able to love our neighbors as ourselves, we need to practice self-respect rather than self-effacement. Although we need to be humbly teachable and open to self-improvement, we must also pause from time to time to take stock of our own strengths. While striving to overcome our weaknesses, we must build on those strengths in order to be able to support and encourage others. This is a serious weakness of my own, and I would that I could help others to avoid it.<br><br>I am planning to improve in this area after retirement--along with a long list of other things I plan to improve on after retirement. So I am now hoping for extreme longevity in order to be able to realize all these projects!<br><br>We can also rid our minds of excess baggage by focusing on goals. I have often counseled students to follow the career that they truly want. I personally know too many people who are highly successful in a material sense but, although they have tried to come to terms with the situation, are unhappy with a career choice or with the area in which they have chosen to live. Sometimes they are caught in an unbearable marriage or family situation, or they simply seem "lost," with no direction in their lives.<br><br>To them I would say, "Back up." This is not an easy thing to do, as those who have trouble like I do with parallel parking will testify! But my advice is:<br><br>Pursue the field where your heart really lies--perhaps as a hobby or an avocation if you are truly "locked into" a career situation.<br><br>Move to where you really want to raise your family.<br><br>Get professional help and talk to friends, family, and Church leaders.<br><br>And, above all, turn to the Lord for comfort--and for counsel and inspiration.<br><br>You<i>will</i>find yourself. You'll be surprised at how you will come to the light and at how weightless you will feel when you make a decision based on inspiration. The bottom line is, "Travel light." No one should go through life carrying the burden of an impossibly unhappy situation. There are solutions.<br><br>Raymundo Hernandez Gil, an international student, submitted the following thought, which sounds much better in Spanish:<br><br><i>It is almost impossible to carry my own cross; the secret of lightening it is this: when, forgetting my own cross, with a positive attitude I help others carry theirs.</i>["Frases para cultivar la excelencia," unpublished manuscript]<br><br>This is a choice we can make that will further help us to be happy in spite of the trials that come to us or the situations in which we find ourselves.<br><br>I am thankful for children who lighten my burden, who light up my life, and who have made the right choices. As parents we recognized that they had great potential. We have called their attention to the fact that, with teachers as parents, they had had to live on very little all their lives. Indeed, the only thing that they had enjoyed in abundance was love; everything else was lacking to some degree, and we suggested subtly that they might consider professions that would provide a more comfortable existence for their families. However, happily, they all made their own decisions: three became professional teachers, and all five take every opportunity that is presented to instruct others--often with no remuneration at all. They are all happy, successful, marvelous parents who are bringing up the world's most beautiful, talented, and intelligent children in gospel-oriented homes--and I<i>never</i>resort to hyperbole!<br><br>An important unburdening came into my own life largely as the result of a battle with cancer several years ago. Because of an extremely heavy work schedule, I really didn't have time to pay much attention to the tumor. On the day that I had surgery I asked that it be done early in the morning under a local anaesthetic (my surgeon was marvelous and did that for me) so that I could teach a class here at 12:00, another at 2:00, and catch a plane at 4:00 to Texas because I had to give a paper at a conference. But, besides all that, the realization that I might be approaching the end of my earthly journey made me take stock of all the wonderful blessings that I had received, principally that I had been able to be with my children through schooling, missions, temple marriages, and other major events in their lives. I had even been able to enjoy several grandchildren. My own father had passed away when I was 10 years old, so I could really appreciate these wonderful gifts from Heavenly Father, and the feelings of regret, fear, anger, or depression that are normal under those circumstances simply were not there. They were washed away in a flood of gratitude that let my spirit say "Thy will be done" and really mean it. Since then, I am able to consider each goal that my children reach, each trial that they overcome, each joy I share with them, and each new baby that arrives in the family an enormous bonus, and I only pray that I might deserve these extra years that I have been granted.<br><br>A less personal example might be in order now, regarding this journey through life. Our student interns travel to Mexico with the literacy program that was established in 1992 by our beloved colleague Ted Lyon, who is currently serving as mission president in Osorno, Chile. These students learn through living in villages without electricity, running water, or sewage systems that the simpler life is, the fuller it becomes. They have seen family togetherness as a necessary element for survival; simple activities that while fulfilling personal, family, and village needs tie whole communities together; and total well-being and contentment without a single CD, a computer, or even a television set. They have watched people cured by herbs and other natural elements, often without the intervention of medical personnel as we know them. They have experienced the relativity of time of day: where a wristwatch is an impediment, where people depend on their own bodies to know when to eat and sleep and on the sun to know when to arise, when to go to class, when to plant, and when to reap. They have seen total dependence on the weather for sustenance, and they have witnessed great faith in God and gratefulness for life itself, for often that is practically all there is!<br><br>This is traveling at its lightest in a material sense. These students learn gratitude, humility, and sincerity and experience the giving and receiving of true brotherly love. They all return home with a resolve to travel lighter. I only wish every student could have the opportunity to participate in such a program.<br><br>I would like to close with a quote from the Huehuetlatolli, a collection of wise counsels that the Aztec senior citizens would give to the young people at different stages of their lives in pre-Columbian Mesoamerica. The following quote, translated from the Aztec by my mentor, Dr. Charles E. Dibble, expresses somewhat how I feel today:<br><br><i>Behold, with this my words come to an end. Guard them with your hearts. Place them in the chambers of your hearts. Inscribe them in your hearts. Not many, not numerous are the words. . . . Here, in some manner, are just two words worthy of being guarded. . . .</i><br><br><i>The first word is to enter near to . . . unto our lord . . . the master. . . . Give him all thy heart, thy body. Let thy feet go not astray. . . .</i><br><br><i>The second word is to live in peace with others. . . . May all people have thy esteem, thy respect. Do not offend one because of something. . . . Show mercy; for our lord is watching thee. . . . Just live; already thou art guided. . . .</i><br><br><i>Briefly, this is . . . my duty to you. Perhaps somewhere you will reflect; perhaps you will ignore it. Already you know that I have complied with my duty.</i>[Fray Bernardino de Sahagún,<i>Florentine Codex,</i>Book 6, trans. Charles E. Dibble and Arthur J. O. Anderson (Santa Fe, New Mexico: School of American Research, 1969), pp. 91–92]<br><br>May the Lord bless you and keep you. May he help you as you lighten your burdens and your journey becomes more pleasant. And may you know the joy of helping others along the way. I love the Lord and the gospel that he has restored to us through the Prophet Joseph Smith. I love the scriptures that help us to understand the divine will of the Father. I love and support with all my heart the men whom the Lord has chosen to lead us in these latter days. I want my family and friends and my colleagues and students to know that I truly love you, and I wish you happiness and eternal joy through him in whose name I pray, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Gloria S.

<h1>o Love God and Our Neighbors - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I appreciated the opening prayer offered by Matt Jensen. I'm going to let you in on a little secret--Matt had a special reason this morning to pray for the Spirit to be here today. You see, Matt did much of the research for my remarks. And so he is really hoping that this will go well. A couple of days ago, I asked Vice President Jim Gordon for some advice on giving this talk. This morning as I came into the Marriott Center, he handed me this folded note on which he had provided important advice. On the front of the note, as you can see if you are close enough, is written one word:<i>Socrates.</i>When I opened the note I read his sound counsel: "Socrates gave long speeches-dev. Socrates was poisoned by his friends."<br><br>I will try not to overstay my welcome at the podium today, although I will admit that the attorney in me regrets there is no one to whom I can bill this time!<br><br>I feel a burden of responsibility this morning to speak of things that will be useful to you. I am aware that this is the last devotional of the semester. By now many students are in the beginning stages of the awful realization that there is more to be done than can possibly be accomplished by the end of the semester. So I understand that you may be a bit distracted just now. But for the next few minutes I hope we can focus together on our Savior; on his profound love for, and unfailing patience with, each one of us; and on how his teachings and example of love should guide our individual lives.<br><br>Whenever I think of the Savior, I think of the scripture recorded in the Gospel of John:<br><br><i>As the Father hath loved me, so have I loved you: continue ye in my love....</i><br><br><i>These things have I spoken unto you, that my joy might remain in you, and that your joy might be full.</i><br><br><i>This is my commandment, That ye love one another, as I have loved you.</i><br><br><i>Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.</i>[John 15:9–13]<br><br>The promise of this commandment is that by loving others our joy might be full. What a profound insight. When you truly love another person, both you and the loved one are blessed.<br><br>Actually, we know from our own experience that this promise is a reality.<br><br>Loving others, then, is much, much more than a suggestion. It is not given to us as an option. The heart and soul of the gospel of Jesus Christ is love--love of God and love of mankind. I worry that we treat this commandment as one of those that must have been meant for someone else to heed--someone, for example, like an enemy.<br><br>The well-known commandment to love one another speaks to and challenges all of us. And it is learning to love--both God and one another--that ought to take the central place in our efforts to follow the Savior. Those who would truly follow Christ must learn to love in the way Christ intended us to love. "By this," he said, "shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to another" (John 13:35).<br><br>It is through learning to love others that we not only keep the commandment but build the foundation upon which obedience to every other of God's commandments is fundamentally rooted, and love is the cornerstone around which every other virtue in our lives is built.<br><br>It is a relatively easy thing, of course, to love those who love us, who are kind to us, and who are like us. This familiar scripture teaches that the commandment to love one another comes with no such limitation: "For if ye love them which love you, what reward have ye? do not even the publicans the same?" (Matthew 5:46).<br><br>Elder David B. Haight taught:<br><br><i>Besides loving God, we are commanded to do what to many is a more difficult commandment--to love all, even enemies, and to go beyond the barriers of race or class or family relationships....</i><br><br><i>... Are we not commanded to cultivate genuine fellowship and even a kinship with every human being on earth? Whom would you bar from your circle? We might deny ourselves a nearness to our Savior because of our prejudices of neighborhood or possessions or race--attitudes that Christ would surely condemn. Love has no boundary, no limitation of good will.</i>["Love All,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 1982, pp. 10–11]<br><br>God does not love us because we are particularly lovable; he does not love us only if we keep his commandments; he does not love us because we are just like him. Our Father in Heaven loves us in spite of our weaknesses, our sins, and our failures to be kind to one another. In spite of who we are or what we have done, I believe that for our Heavenly Father, even those among us who are viewed as unlovable are loved by him. God wants to pour out his love on us. And in fact he has done so by providing for us the Savior, whose ultimate sacrifice made possible the opportunity for every person to return to the celestial home and to be with him for all eternity: "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life" (John 3:16).<br><br>Having a Christlike love requires more than a pleasant response to those who enter into our lives. God's love requires reaching out to others and enfolding them in our hearts and lives.<br><br>Mother Teresa, the Catholic nun who has spent her life in the slums of Calcutta helping the poorest of the poor--the lepers and abandoned children--said, "Love each other with a clean heart. ... [The poor] are not hungry for bread; they are hungry for love" ("Grads Hear Noted Nun,"<i>Salt Lake Tribune,</i>31 May 1982, p. A-4, quoted in Haight, "Love All," p. 12).<br><br>I recently learned of a student at BYU who came to Provo from an eastern European country to work on a second graduate degree. He had been a student at one of the most prestigious universities in Europe. That university had provided a scholarship to cover his costs while he studied here. But he was not like a typical BYU student. He dressed somewhat differently--at least by our standards. He is not a member of the Church. He speaks fluent and beautiful English with a discernible accent that our linguists could trace to his home country. Two weeks ago this student was asked by a fellow student how he felt about his stay at BYU.<br><br>He said, "For the most part, I have hated it! For the entire three months of my stay I have been lonely. I have felt depressed and homesick--like a loner. I have made no friends."<br><br>How can this be? I wondered. Especially here at BYU, where we are committed followers of the Savior. A majority of us have experienced living in other lands and know the loneliness one can feel in that situation. I wondered what could have been done to make his stay here more enjoyable. I wondered, too, what report he will give about BYU, our church, and our lifestyle when he returns to his homeland. I admit that I wondered if any classmate had done anything to make him feel accepted, valued, and loved. I wondered how many of us who had come into contact with this student from a foreign land had remembered the Savior's direction:<br><br><i>But the stranger that dwelleth with you shall be unto you as one born among you, and thou shalt love him as thyself; for ye were strangers in the land of Egypt: I am the Lord your God.</i>[Leviticus 19:34]<br><br>Living with godlike love demands that we come to really feel that all people are within our circle of loved ones and that we feel a responsibility toward them.<br><br>This principle was taught by the Savior in an excellent example of the Socratic teaching method in common use in law schools today. A certain lawyer asked the Savior what he should do to inherit eternal life. The Savior answered with a question:<br><br><i>What is written in the law? how readest thou?</i><br><br><i>And he</i>[the lawyer]<i>answering said, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all they strength, and with all thy mind; and thy neighbour as thyself.</i><br><br><i>And he</i>[Jesus]<i>said unto him, Thou hast answered right: this do, and thou shalt live.</i>[Luke 10:25–28]<br><br>The follow-up question from the lawyer was, "And who is my neighbour?" (v. 29).<br><br>The Savior responded with the parable of the Good Samaritan. The Samaritans were looked down upon by the Jews. The priest and the Levite--both of whom were Jews--should have come to the aid of the unfortunate man but did not. It was the despised Samaritan who braved the social barriers of that day and showed when he cared for the stricken man the love Christ was expecting. After telling the story, Christ then gave this command: "Go, and do thou likewise" (Luke 10:37).<br><br>I fear there are too many among us whose behaviors toward others reveal that, in their own way, they (like the lawyer in Jesus' day) are still asking: "Who is my neighbor?" A good lawyer would object to a witness being asked the same question again and again in a trial by saying, "Asked and answered." Indeed, the question has been asked and answered. But, unfortunately, even some members of the Church who clearly ought to know better have not incorporated this important teaching into their personal, everyday lives.<br><br>As in Christ's time, the message of the gospel is there for all people. Despite the passage of centuries the gospel message has not changed. It was offered then, just like it is now, to anyone who was willing to listen. As the apostle Peter said, "I perceive that God is no respecter of persons: But in every nation he that feareth him, and worketh righteousness, is accepted with him" (Acts 10:34–35).<br><br>This statement by Peter is the essence of the gospel we preach and ought to live--namely, the inclusion of all people. The teachings and blessings of Christ are not limited to certain groups or nationalities.<br><br>Despite this regular declaration of our beliefs, the Church and its members are too often criticized for their overall intolerance of other faiths, or lifestyles, and an attitude of exclusion and superiority. In a 1992 press release the Church acknowledged its concern over this matter. The statement said:<br><br><i>We reaffirm the longstanding concern of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints for the well-being and intrinsic worth of all people. Latter-day Saints believe that "God is no respecter of persons: But in every nation he that feareth him, and worketh righteousness, is accepted with him." (Acts 10:34–35.)</i><br><br><i>All men and women are children of God. It is morally wrong for any person or group to deny anyone his or her inalienable dignity on the tragic and abhorrent theory of racial or cultural superiority.</i><br><br><i>We call upon all people everywhere to recommit themselves to the time-honored ideals of tolerance and mutual respect. We sincerely believe that as we acknowledge one another with consideration and compassion we will discover that we can all peacefully coexist despite our deepest differences.</i>["Church Exhorts Ethnic, Religious Tolerance,"<i>Church News,</i>24 October 1992, p. 4]<br><br>Our obligation to love requires us to distinguish the sin from the sinner and to love all men. Jesus made this clear when he taught the Nephites after his resurrection:<br><br><i>Nevertheless, ye shall not cast him out of your synagogues, or your places of worship, for unto such shall ye continue to minister; for ye know not but what they will return and repent, and come unto me with full purpose of heart, and I shall heal them; and ye shall be the means of bringing salvation unto them.</i>[3 Nephi 18:32]<br><br>I remember vividly, even today, a scene I witnessed nearly 20 years ago in the foyer of the church where I was the bishop. In those days we had a large group of young adults in the ward. This was before our resident stakes had single-adult wards. It was a Sunday before sacrament meeting. A dozen or so of our young adults were gathered in the foyer visiting about an outing they had scheduled for the following week. Their enthusiasm for the event was evident from the animated way they were talking about their plans. Everyone was deeply involved in the discussion. Then a young woman, about the age of those in the group, came rather timidly into the foyer. Although a member of the ward, she was not a regular attender--in fact, she rarely came. She was not blessed with gifts and graces that made her fit easily anywhere. Most of the time she seemed hostile and unpleasant. Although she was known to the group, she had no friends. She lived a lifestyle that was different and, in many respects, contrary to the commandments. And everyone knew it--or thought they knew it. Then it happened. One of the young men, who was a natural and charismatic leader, saw her come in. He excused himself from the group, walked over to the young lady, put an arm around her, and exclaimed how glad he was to see her. Would she sit with him in the meeting, and would she go with the group on their exciting excursion that week? She replied yes, and yes. A new friendship was begun. It would have been easy--even natural--for him to ignore her or to offer only a polite nod or hello. But he did what all of us should do. He extended himself to her in an offering of friendship.<br><br>Elder David B. Haight observed the truth that "God accomplishes His purposes heart to heart" ("Love All," p. 12).<br><br>Unfortunately, feelings of loneliness are not peculiar to the young man from eastern Europe I spoke of, nor are feelings of alienation limited to an occasional person like the young woman in my ward who just didn't fit in. Campus Church leaders are constantly trying to help students who are depressed, homesick, or lonely. Here, among us, there should be a welcome for everyone. The message of the Messiah was a message of inclusion. There should be no reason for people here to feel left out, lonely, unappreciated, or unloved.<br><br>In one of his first statements to the public after becoming the prophet and president of the Church, President Howard W. Hunter said:<br><br><i>I would invite all members of the Church to live with ever more attention to the life and example of the Lord Jesus Christ, especially the love and hope and compassion He displayed.</i><br><br><i>I pray that we might treat each other with more kindness, more courtesy, more humility and patience and forgiveness.</i>[Press conference of 6 June 1994, in Jay M. Todd, "President Howard W. Hunter,"<i>Ensign,</i>July 1994, p. 4]<br><br>What a powerful invitation--and reminder!<br><br>About two weeks ago, our third son, who recently moved to Chicago for employment, was diagnosed with a serious illness. Although he is doing well now, and the prognosis is good, I can tell you that the distance between Chicago and Provo never seemed so great as it did in those first several days while our family came to grips with the reality and implications of this unwelcome situation. This event reminded me forcefully of the common experience of all people who have loved ones in distant places. I dare to speculate that every person here at some time, now or in the past, has or has had a loved one in special need. It might be a concern about health or family or perhaps about one who is not being faithful to covenants and is wandering from the gospel. It might be a brother or sister, a parent or child or other loved one somewhere in the Church--perhaps in the East or in a western state--for whom you have prayed that kind of pleading prayer that seeks for a miraculous intervention or for special attention from someone. And we pray that a roommate, priesthood leader, home teacher, visiting teacher, or neighbor--or anyone there where our loved one is--will see in them the nobility and worth that we see. We pray that there is someone who will care enough to love them with a special attentive and healing love. I'm confident most of you have had such an experience.<br><br>And just as you pray or have prayed for your loved one somewhere in the Church today, a parent or brother or sister or child prays that their loved one who lives here among us will be recognized for the potential and nobility that they possess. They pray that someone here will love them and assist in a gentle way to nurture the Spirit of our Heavenly Father in their loved one's life. My dear brothers and sisters, I believe that you and I have got to try harder to be the answers to the prayers of thousands of parents that their son or daughter, who is away from home and is here among us, will be accepted, looked out for, and loved.<br><br>Yes, we are our brother's keeper. We have been called to love all of God's children. Let us pledge anew our commitment to our Savior and to his flock. Let us help our Heavenly Father by being the instrument through which the prayers for loved ones are answered.<br><br><i>Remember the worth of souls is great in the sight of God;</i><br><br><i>For, behold, the Lord your Redeemer suffered death in the flesh; wherefore he suffered the pain of all men, that all men might repent and come unto him.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 18:10–11]<br><br>There are three principle elements that need to find places in our hearts and in our acts if we are to become successful in loving others with a Christlike love. These three keys, if learned and applied, will open the door to your heart and to the hearts of others. They are not new. They are found in the familiar words of our Savior, whose love was a perfect love. The three keys are:<i>judge not, forgive freely,</i>and<i>serve generously.</i><br><br>First,<i>judge not.</i>Because you and I can never really know all there is to know of others' life experiences and circumstances, and because we do not have a perfect scale of judgment with which to weigh others' acts, habits, reactions, or behavior, it is inappropriate for us to make judgments about others. It is impossible for any person who has faults to presume to be in a position to judge others. The Savior taught this lesson many times--once in the familiar account of the woman taken in adultery: "He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her" (John 8:7).<br><br>A second teaching of this principle is given in the Sermon on the Mount.<br><br><i>For with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged: and with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again.</i><br><br><i>And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye, but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye?</i>[Matthew 7:2–3]<br><br>I can't resist telling a story many of you will quickly be able to relate to, which perhaps helps make the point. It seems a son was not measuring up to his father's expectations for him. There were the constant problems of the messy bedroom, too much television, and not enough study being done. The son's grades were not as good as the father wanted them to be. And besides, household chores were often undone or poorly done. The father was disappointed, and, of course--like most of us--he wanted to deliver the kind of message to his son that would<i>make</i>him change. Finally, in exasperation the father said, "Son, do you have any idea what Abraham Lincoln was doing at your age?"<br><br>The son thought for only a moment and then replied, "No, Dad, I don't know what Abraham Lincoln was doing at my age, but I do know what he was doing at your age."<br><br>Another reason why we should not judge others, I believe, is because many of the differences among people are the result of the fact that our Heavenly Father did not equip us equally with gifts and graces before sending us off to our earth life.<br><br>In the Doctrine and Covenants we are told:<br><br><i>For all have not every gift given unto them; for there are many gifts, and to every man is given a gift by the Spirit of God.</i><br><br><i>To some is given one, and to some is given another, that all may be profited thereby.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 46:11–12]<br><br>It is well for each of us to remember this scripture. It clearly teaches that Heavenly Father intentionally made us individually unique so that<i>all</i>could be blessed by<i>each.</i>That we are each different in our abilities and interests and development obviously cannot justify a determination that one is superior or inferior to another. That we are different, but neither superior nor inferior, tells us something about the way we ought to appreciate each other. The fact is, it is precisely because we<i>are</i>each different that there is so much that is good and interesting and wonderful about others for us to discover and then to appreciate and eventually become personally enriched and blessed. If we do not seek to learn from others, we are missing much that is good and wonderful.<br><br>When I set apart a missionary, especially those going to foreign lands or into different cultures and races, often I am moved to advise the missionary that he or she is going on a mission to learn as well as to teach. By learning about the culture, history, and ways of the people the missionary meets, the missionary will be richly blessed personally and will come to love the people more quickly and more completely--and the Spirit will then be more likely to be received by those the missionary comes into contact with.<br><br>Learning to appreciate rather than judge others, especially those who are different from ourselves, is often difficult because of a tendency in many of us to believe that our ways are the "right" ways. Because of a perceived advantage of gender, race, culture, religion, education, physical stature, appearance, or mental quickness, we may feel we are superior to others.<br><br>That some people have a perception of their superiority over others reminds me of the children's story of<i>The Sneetches,</i>written by Dr. Seuss. You may recall the simple story of the Star-Belly Sneetches who, because of the stars on their bellies, felt far superior to those who did not carry this obvious mark of distinction. In Dr. Seuss' words:<br><br><i>Because they had stars, all the Star-Belly Sneetches<br>Would brag, "We're the best kind of Sneetch on the beaches."<br>With their snoots in the air, they would sniff and they'd snort<br>"We'll have nothing to do with the Plain-Belly sort!"<br>And whenever they met some, when they were out walking,<br>They'd hike right on past them without even talking.</i><br><br>Such treatment, as you can imagine, was not enjoyed by those with plain bellies. After hearing about the plight of the Plain-Belly bunch, Sylvester McMonkey McBean, the so-called "Fix-it-Up Chappie," came into town with a machine that would give Plain-Belly Sneetches a star upon their stomachs. Of course this did not sit well with those who had previously enjoyed having the exclusive star. In fact, this same businessman, after giving everyone a star, began to operate a machine that would remove stars, thus maintaining the shallow distinction. It was not too long before it was impossible to tell if a Sneetch had been star-bellied or plain-bellied to begin with. At this point the two groups could no longer afford to continue their attempt to keep themselves separated from the others. In addition, a change began to come over them. In fact, they realized how ridiculous their actions had been. Again using the words of Dr. Seuss:<br><br><i>I'm quite happy to say<br>That the Sneetches got really quite smart on that day,<br>The day they decided that Sneetches are Sneetches<br>And no kind of Sneetch is the best on the beaches.<br>That day, all the Sneetches forgot about stars<br>And whether they had one, or not, upon thars.</i><br><br>[Dr. Seuss,<i>The Sneetches and Other Stories</i>(New York: Random House, 1961), pp. 2–25]<br><br>This story has a message for each of us. As we come to BYU from all over the world, we each bring our own stars or items we think are "in vogue" or somehow especially desirable. This is fine, but we must remember that our roommates, classmates, and every other person has his or her own stars as well. I hope each of us will learn to look past the external characteristics that so often are used to justify our classification of people. In other words, we need to take the time to get to know some plain-bellied types. As you become more loving and tolerant of others, your circle of friends will grow, you will expand your horizon, and you will change your perspective of the world along the way. You will be greatly blessed, and so will your new friends.<br><br>There is a passage in the Book of Mormon, in 3 Nephi, that I want to draw special attention to this morning because I have felt particularly vulnerable to the warning taught in the account. Within a few years after the Savior's birth, all of the people living among the Nephites, which included many Lamanites, came to know that Christ had come. They repented of their sins, preached the gospel to the prisoners they had taken in the war against the Gadianton robbers, and set free those prisoners who covenanted to keep the peace. The Nephite leaders, Gidgiddoni and Lachoneus, had brought great peace in the land. The scripture tells us, "There was nothing in all the land to hinder the people from prospering continually, except they should fall into transgression" (3 Nephi 6:5). And they did prosper. But within a very short time "there began to be some disputings among the people" (3 Nephi 6:10).<br><br><i>And the people began to be distinguished by ranks, according to their riches and their</i>chances for learning;<i>yea, some were ignorant because of their poverty, and others did receive great learning because of their riches.</i>[3 Nephi 6:12; emphasis added]<br><br>I believe this account is a warning to those of us who have been blessed to have received an education. We ought never to suppose that our "learning" entitles us to special rank or privilege.<br><br>The second key to learning to live with Christlike love is to<i>forgive freely.</i>The principle of forgiveness and its relation to love was clearly taught by the Savior in the familiar passages from the Sermon on the Mount found in Matthew. I suggest you take a close look at the sermon again and consider how much of it is devoted to teaching about the principle of forgiveness. Ask yourself why this is so. My estimate is that nearly one-half of that great sermon speaks of some element of forgiveness.<br><br><i>Resist not evil: but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also.</i><br><br><i>And if any man will sue thee at the law, and take away thy coat, let him have thy cloke also.</i><br><br><i>And whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile, go with him twain....</i><br><br><i>Ye have heard that it hath been said, Thou shalt love thy neighbour, and hate thine enemy.</i><br><br><i>But I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you.</i>[Matthew 5:39–41, 43–44]<br><br>The apostle Peter asked the Savior how often he should forgive one who sinned against him: "Till seven times?"<br><br>The Savior replied: "I say not unto thee, Until seven times: but, Until seventy times seven" (Matthew 18:21–22).<br><br>Learning to forgive those who have offended or in some manner caused injury may be the most important key to living with real Christlike love: "Then said Jesus, Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do" (Luke 23:34).<br><br>The final key is to<i>serve generously.</i>I believe we learn best to love by serving. The author C. S. Lewis, in his book<i>Mere Christianity,</i>provides an insight to this key:<br><br><i>Do not waste time bothering whether you "love" your neighbour; act as if you did. As soon as we do this we find one of the great secrets. When you are behaving as if you loved someone, you will presently come to love him. If you injure someone you dislike, you will find yourself disliking him more. If you do him a good turn, you will find yourself disliking him less. ... But whenever we do good to another self, just because it is a self, made (like us) by God, and desiring its own happiness as we desire ours, we shall have learned to love it a little more or, at least, to dislike it less.</i>[C. S. Lewis,<i>Mere Christianity</i>(New York: Macmillan Publishing Company, 1952), pp. 116–17]<br><br>Any returned missionary can testify that their love for the people they worked with on their mission was primarily the product of serving them. Elder Marvin J. Ashton taught, "What we serve we learn to love" ("We Serve That Which We Love,"<i>Ensign,</i>May 1981, p. 24). And to quote once again from Elder David B. Haight:<br><br><i>Love is a gift of God, and as we obey His laws and genuinely learn to serve others, we develop God's love in our lives....</i><br><br><i>Someone has written, "Love is a verb." It requires doing--not just saying and thinking. The test is in what one does, how one acts, for love is conveyed in word and deed.</i>["Love All," p. 12]<br><br>I will conclude with the profound teachings of the prophets Moroni and Mormon:<br><br><i>And again, behold I say unto you that he cannot have faith and hope, save he shall be meek, and lowly of heart.</i><br><br><i>If so, his faith and hope is vain, for none is acceptable before God, save the meek and lowly in heart; and if a man be meek and lowly in heart, and confesses by the power of the Holy Ghost that Jesus is the Christ, he must needs have charity; for if he have not charity he is nothing; wherefore he must needs have charity.</i><br><br><i>And charity suffereth long, and is kind, and envieth not, and is not puffed up, seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked, thinketh no evil, and rejoiceth not in iniquity but rejoiceth in the truth, beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things.</i><br><br><i>Wherefore, my beloved brethren, if ye have not charity, ye are nothing, for charity never faileth. Wherefore, cleave unto charity, which is the greatest of all, for all things must fail--</i><br><br><i>But charity is the pure love of Christ, and it endureth forever; and whoso is found possessed of it at the last day, it shall be well with him.</i><br><br><i>Wherefore, my beloved brethren, pray unto the Father with all the energy of heart, that ye may be filled with this love, which he hath bestowed upon all who are true followers of his Son, Jesus Christ; that ye may become the sons of God; that when he shall appear we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is; that we may have this hope; that we may be purified even as he is pure.</i>[Moroni 7:43–48]<br><br>From Christlike love comes all that is good. With it every commandment becomes easier to live and our lives become enriched by the abundance of others who teach and influence us. Only love will bring peace to the earth. I testify that as we learn to judge not, to forgive freely, and to serve generously, we will become more tolerant, and eventually we will come to have the gift of charity bestowed upon us by our Heavenly Father. That we may so do is my prayer in the holy name of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>H. Reese Hansen was a professor of law and the dean of the J.

<h1> Learn: How to Organize According to God’s Laws - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
The entrance to our campus is signified by three inspiring mottos: "The glory of God is intelligence"; "The world is our campus"; and "Enter to learn; Go forth to serve." In contemplating the injunction "Enter to learn; Go forth to serve," I am intrigued by the proposition that our students should "enter to learn<i>how to</i>go forth to serve<i>more effectively</i>." This modification makes explicit the relationship between what we learn and how well we serve. It also clarifies our responsibility as members of the BYU academic community to not only motivate our graduates to serve willingly but to also increase their capability to serve effectively.<br><br>A key for what our students need to learn in order to serve more effectively is found in D&amp;amp;C 51:15: "And thus I grant unto this people a privilege of organizing themselves according to my laws." Since coming to BYU three years ago, I have welcomed the opportunity to explore in my organizational behavior classes and in my work at the Center for the Study of Values in Organizations scriptural clues regarding God's organizing laws.<br><br>I have chosen to address this subject in a BYU devotional because I believe that our potential to realize our unique educational mission is predicated upon our ability to organize our activities and relationships according to God's laws, and to provide opportunities for our students to learn these organizing laws from our thoughtful instruction and our compelling example. Demonstration is superior to exposition as a teaching tool, and there should be no better opportunity for LDS members to observe the effective implementation of God's laws of organizing than at BYU. In that regard, it is instructive to note that the word<i>university</i>originally meant a community, which in its normative sense connotes a supportive, invigorating, and ennobling learning environment.<br><br>Stated succinctly, my thesis is that President Bateman's charge to transform BYU from a "university in Zion" into a "Zion university" has as much to do with implementing God's laws for organizing our offices, our committees, our work crews, our wards, our dormitories, and our athletic teams as with integrating sacred and secular learning in our classrooms.<br><br>To provide a common point of reference for my remarks, I'd like to begin by relating an experience taken from Joseph Smith's diary. During the second week of December 1835, the Prophet spent several evenings participating in a debate at the home of his brother, William, in Kirtland, Ohio. The subject of the debate was whether it was necessary for God to reveal himself to man in order for us to experience happiness. Joseph spoke in favor of the proposition--his intimate understanding of the subject and his forceful nature undoubtedly contributed to his side winning the debate.<br><br>At the conclusion of this activity, the future of the debate series was discussed. Joseph urged the group to disband, fearing, in his words, "that it would not result in good" (Dean C. Jessee, comp. and ed.,<i>The Personal Writings of Joseph Smith</i>(Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1984), p. 105). William opposed this position and became very angry. He refused to allow his brother Hyrum to express his opinion on the subject, invoking his right as the owner of the home to manage the discussion as he saw fit. William's frustrations grew to the point that, according to the Prophet, he "used violence upon my person" (Jessee,<i>Personal Writings,</i>p. 106).<br><br>A few days later Joseph described this event and its effects:<br><br><i>I left</i>[his]<i>house with feelings that were indescribable. The scenery had changed</i>[along with]<i>all those expectations that I had cherished, when going to</i>[his]<i>house, of brotherly kindness, charity, forbearance and natural affection, that in duty binds us not to make each other offenders for a word.</i><br><br><i>. . . With marks of violence heaped upon me by a brother . . . I returned home, not able to sit down, or rise up, without help, but through the blessings of God I am now better.</i>[p. 114; text modernized]<br><br>This experience was equally troubling to William, as reflected in the following letter he sent Joseph: "Brother Joseph--Though I do not know but [if] I have forfeited all right and title to the word<i>brother,</i>in consequence of what I have done." He then requested a release from his apostleship, because "then I would not . . . bring so much disgrace upon the cause, when I fell into temptation [because of my] passions" (pp. 110–11; spelling corrected).<br><br>From the Prophet's entry in his journal two weeks later, on the morning of January 1, 1836, it is evident that, although his physical wounds had healed, his emotional scars were still very painful.<br><br><i>Notwithstanding the gratitude that fills my heart</i>[in reflecting on]<i>the past year, and the multiplied blessings that have crowned our heads, my heart is pained within me because of the difficulty that exists in my father's family. The Devil has made a violent attack on Brother William and Brother Calvin, and the powers of darkness . . . cast a gloomy shade over the minds of my brothers and sisters, which prevents them from seeing things as they really are. The powers of earth and hell seem combined to overthrow us and the church by causing a division in the family. Indeed, the adversary is bringing into requisition all his subtlety to prevent the Saints from being endowed, by causing division among the 12, also among the 70, and bickerings and jealousies among the Elders and official members of the church. . . .</i><br><br><i>But I am determined that nothing on my part shall be lacking to . . . amicably . . . settle all family difficulties on this day, that the ensuing year . . . may be spent in righteousness before God.</i>[p. 121; text modernized]<br><br>Later that day, Joseph's father, uncle, brothers Hyrum and William, and Martin Harris attended a meeting in the Prophet's home. According to Joseph's account, his father opened with prayer, and then<br><br><i>expressed his feelings . . . with all the sympathy of a father whose feelings were wounded deeply on . . . account of the difficulty that</i>[existed]<i>in the family. And while he addressed us the spirit of God rested down upon us in mighty power, and our hearts were melted. Brother William made a humble confession and asked my forgiveness for the abuse he had offered me, and wherein I had been out of the way I asked his forgiveness. The spirit of confession and forgiveness was mutual among us all, and we covenanted with each other . . . to strive from hence forward to build each other up in righteousness in all things and</i>[to]<i>not listen to evil reports concerning each other, but</i>[to]<i>go to each other with our grievances in the spirit of meekness and be reconciled, and thereby promote our own happiness and the happiness of our family and, in short, the happiness and well-being of all.</i>[p. 122; text modernized]<br><br>This story illustrates what I believe to be three of God's core organizing processes--sanctification, edification, and unification--which work together to harmonize individual, interpersonal, and group spiritual development. None of these processes can operate independent of the others. We cannot become personally sanctified if we are not edifying others, and God's process of unification naturally emerges out of the edifying actions of sanctified individuals.<br><br>It is clear that when Joseph and William were out of sorts with one another, they were out of touch with the Lord. Furthermore, as their rancor impaired their motivation and ability to serve each other, their usefulness as servants of the Lord was diminished. William's confession letter suggests that although he had been ordained an apostle, he was still struggling to subdue his violent temper--and this lack of self-control made it difficult for him to edify others. Fearing that his lack of personal sanctification would foster disharmony and disunity among Church leaders and members, he requested a release from his church leadership responsibilities. Joseph's journal entries reflect similar concerns about the adversary's use of adversity to create disharmony in the Smith family. He despaired that the darkness and gloom of persecution were causing his siblings to lose sight of their spiritual goals, which prevented them from "seeing things as they really are." He was also concerned that jealousies and bickerings among Church members were delaying plans for their receiving the endowment, which is an essential step in the process of becoming one with God. It is instructive that the Spirit returned, and Joseph's despair about the effect of this incident on the spiritual welfare of his family and the Church dissipated when he and his brother forgave each other and promised to reconcile their differences directly, to not listen to evil reports about each other, and to edify each other in all circumstances.<br><br>Based on my study of these three organizing laws, I am convinced that if we enter BYU to learn how to become more sanctified, edified, and unified, we will go forth to serve more willingly and more effectively.<br><br>Actually, my daughter Shauna got me thinking about this proposition several years ago, when we lived in Illinois. After each of her semesters at BYU I would ask her what significant lessons she had learned that term. Generally, she reported on her inspiring teachers, her interesting courses, her caring ward leaders, or her challenging part-time job. But one of her answers broke this pattern. She said, "The most valuable thing I learned this term was how to be charitable, and I learned that lesson from my roommate. She has established for me a model of service and compassion that has changed my life." Two weeks ago my daughter graduated from BYU. As a parent I appreciate the outstanding education she received. I'm especially grateful for how her BYU experience, including her association with an inspiring group of friends and roommates, prepared her for a life of willing and effective service.<br><br>To better understand how all of our students can have an equally enriched learning experience, I propose that we examine each of these three key organizing processes separately and then explore their critical interdependencies.<br><br><i>To sanctify</i>means to make sacred and holy through purification. It is an intensely personal development process, as reflected in the prophet Helaman's description of his sanctified Saints.<br><br><i>Nevertheless they did fast and pray oft, and did wax stronger and stronger in their humility, and firmer and firmer in the faith of Christ, unto the filling their souls with joy and consolation, yea, even to the purifying and the sanctification of their hearts, which sanctification cometh because of their yielding their hearts unto God.</i>[Helaman 3:35]<br><br>The process of sanctification both requires and permits purifying catalytic exchanges with the Lord, as characterized in the following instructions for organizing the School of the Prophets.<br><br><i>And I give unto you, who are the first laborers in this last kingdom, a commandment that you assemble yourselves together, and organize yourselves, and prepare yourselves, and sanctify yourselves; yea, purify your hearts, and cleanse your hands and your feet before me,</i>that I may make you clean. [D&amp;amp;C 88:74; emphasis added]<br><br><i>To edify</i>means to build up, especially in regards to moral development. Edification is what we do for others that supports and enables their personal sanctification process. The Lord has counseled:<br><br><i>He that preacheth and he that receiveth</i>[according to the Spirit of truth],<i>understand one another, and both are edified and rejoice together.</i><br><br><i>And that which doth not edify is not of God, and is darkness.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 50:23–24]<br><br>As the Saints prepared to leave Nauvoo 150 years ago this spring, the Lord gave Brigham Young a set of specific instructions for organizing their journey, recorded in section 136 of the Doctrine and Covenants. Verses 23 and 24 read:<br><br><i>Cease to contend one with another; cease to speak evil one of another.</i><br><br><i>Cease drunkenness; and let your words tend to edifying one another.</i><br><br><i>To unify</i>means to bring together into one, to organize properly. The importance of unity is reflected in the Lord's admonition "If ye are not one ye are not mine" (D&amp;amp;C 38:27). Hugh Nibley helps us better understand the relationship between God's laws of organizing and God's directive to become one:<br><br><i>God's forces organize, while Satan tries to disorganize. The natural state of order is one of disorder. Therefore, God's influence is necessary to achieve order and unity. Unity means to harmonize with something or someone. We are the most united when we are in harmony with God.</i>[Personal Notes]<br><br>In a recent general conference address, Elder Dallin Oaks expressed similar views. He first quoted Brigham Young: "The difference between God and the Devil is that God creates and organizes, while the whole study of the Devil is to destroy" (<i>DBY,</i>p. 69). Elder Oaks then offered this counsel, "Whatever builds people up serves the cause of the Master, and whatever tears people down serves the cause of the adversary. We support one cause or the other every day, by our patronage" ("Powerful Ideas,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 1995, pp. 26–27).<br><br>In reviewing the BYU foundation documents, it is clear that the processes of sanctification, edification, and unification are central to the mission of BYU. At his inauguration, President Dallin H. Oaks stated:<br><br><i>Our reason for</i>being<i>is to be a university. But our reason for</i>being a university<i>is to encourage and prepare young men and women to rise to their full spiritual potential as sons and daughters of God.</i>["Inaugural Response," 12 November 1971, p. 18; emphasis in original]<br><br>During the same inauguration, then Commissioner Neal A. Maxwell declared, "Brigham Young University seeks to improve and 'sanctify' itself for the sake of others--not for the praise of the world, but to serve the world better" ("Inaugural Greeting," 12 November 1971, p. 1).<br><br>At my first annual university conference as a new faculty member, Todd Britsch, who was serving as academic vice president, helped me understand that the mission of BYU is broader and more important than what an outsider might conclude from observing our day-to-day campus routines. He said:<br><br><i>I have a deep desire for</i>[Brigham Young University]<i>to be excellent, for everything about it to be exemplary. But as I have been forced by circumstances to think beyond football victories, academic prizes, important publications, or brilliant lectures, I have returned to the conviction that for BYU to be excellent, it must first be good. That is, that we will never maintain or improve any important standard of academic achievement if we do not first attain the Lord's standards of virtue. . . . I am convinced that our value as a university is dependent on our capacity to live together in charity.</i>[Todd A. Britsch, "<a href="https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/todd-a-britsch_excellence-charity-university/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Excellence, Charity, and the University</a>," 1994 Annual University Conference, pp. 19–20]<br><br>To help us attain the Lord's standards of virtue so that we can improve our standards of academic achievement, let us now turn our attention to three lawlike propositions that illustrate the necessary interdependence between sanctification, edification, and unification. The first of these is,<i>The edification of others is an essential requirement for personal sanctification.</i>In other words, to become good we must do good.<br><br>If I understand correctly the plan of spiritual development outlined in section 93 of the Doctrine and Covenants, it involves the use of grace as both a process and an outcome. In verses 12 and 13 of section 93, John the Revelator tells us that Christ progressed from "grace to grace" by receiving "grace for grace." I take that to mean that Christ progressed from a lower state of perfection to a higher state of perfection through the process of receiving grace from God according to the grace Christ extended to others. Using our terminology, this interpretation indicates that our level of sanctification is directly related to our willingness to edify others by extending our grace to them, and, just as important, by graciously receiving grace from them.<br><br>A definition of grace that I learned as a student is "Doing something for someone else that they can't do for themselves and that they don't entirely merit." What is it that others at BYU need from us that they can't provide for themselves and for which they are not completely deserving? Roommates, shop clerks, teachers, security officers, coaches, administrators, and ward leaders need precisely the same things from us that we need from God and for which we are undeserving--including forgiveness for offense, overlooking the indiscretions inherent in immaturity, encouragement during periods of despair, and the motivation and power to transform weaknesses into strengths.<br><br>Last year I was asked to teach the core organizational behavior course in our Executive MBA Program. One evening, toward the end of the term, one of my students blurted out, "I am frustrated by my constant inability to implement the good ideas I'm learning in this program because I have a boss who is over the hill, out of touch, defensive, and unsupportive of change. Would you please tell me how to solve this problem?"<br><br>I can't remember the first time I was asked this type of question by a participant in a management seminar or course, but I will always remember the first time it came up in a BYU class, because I was startled by my response.<br><br>At the University of Illinois I was asked this question so often that I actually developed a set of rehearsed answers, centered around the image of "fencing in the dinosaurs." Half joking, I told my students that they would probably have to wait for a meteor to hit their organization before they would be permanently rid of all their "dinosaur managers," but in the meantime they could construct barriers around them to keep them from sabotaging organizational change initiatives.<br><br>In contrast, my response to this question as a BYU professor was quite different. I said something like, "Have you considered how your boss feels? Here is a person who once was competent, energetic, and successful. But now the changes he once enthusiastically promoted have doubled back on him, and he feels alone, scared, and defensive. Keeping in mind important personal and organizational objectives, why don't you prayerfully consider the acts of charity that might restore your boss's faith and hope." I express appreciation for the learning environment at BYU that prompted this uncharacteristic but edifying response.<br><br>The second of the three lawlike propositions is,<i>Personal sanctification is a necessary condition for the edification of others.</i>In other words, we must be good in order to do good. Soon after the organization of the Church, the Lord instructed Oliver Cowdery in the proper discharge of his role as counselor and colleague to Joseph Smith. This instruction established a pattern for creating edifying relationships, even with those who have faults and weaknesses.<br><br><i>Therefore be diligent; stand by my servant Joseph, faithfully, in whatsoever difficult circumstances he may be for the word's sake.</i><br><br><i>Admonish him in his faults, and also receive admonition of him. Be patient; be sober; be temperate; have patience, faith, hope and charity.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 6:18–19]<br><br>The definition of<i>admonition</i>is "counsel, advice, or caution; a gentle reproof or warning; to urge to duty, to remind of an obligation." Compare the tone of this definition with the definition of<i>criticism:</i>"The act of passing severe judgment; censure; faultfinding."<br><br>William and Joseph Smith were fortunate to have a righteous and sensitive counselor--their father. Who knows how much longer their disharmony would have lasted or how much more damage to their relationship and to the purposes of the Lord might have occurred if their father had not taken the initiative to organize the process of reconciliation. I don't think it is by chance that Father Smith was the one who offered the opening prayer at their meeting, or that he counseled and admonished a prophet and an apostle to remember their duty as brothers rather than chastising them for their immature behavior as his sons. Because this counselor was in tune with the Spirit, the Spirit was present when hearts were ready to change in response to admonition and counsel.<br><br>As I contemplated Father Smith's key role in this story, I was drawn to one of the classic talks on this subject given by my colleague Bonner Ritchie in a 1991 <a href="https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/j-bonner-ritchie_taking-sweet-counsel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BYU devotional</a>. He used as his text Psalms 55:14: "We took sweet counsel together, and walked unto the house of God in company." There are three noteworthy elements in this instructive verse. First, the operating verb<i>take</i>suggests that we should focus more on receiving and listening to counsel than on giving and enforcing counsel. Second, the instruction includes the modifier<i>sweet,</i>lest we are tempted to construe this verse to justify the use of harsh, critical counsel. Third, we are taught that the goal of sweet counsel should not be to advance our own self-interest but to encourage and prepare us to walk into the house of God in company.<br><br>In reflecting on how difficult it is as a scholar to resist the temptation to believe that because I am deemed wise I need not hearken to God's counsel (2 Nephi 9:28) and I am qualified to "seek to counsel in [my] own ways" (D&amp;amp;C 56:14), I have concluded that the best thing I can do to edify my students is to sanctify their teacher.<br><br>We now turn to the final proposition:<i>The goal of unification with others is made possible through a combination of personal sanctification and interpersonal edification.</i>One of the few descriptions we have of a Zion society is recorded in 4 Nephi. You have all read the account of this blessed people who lived together in righteous harmony for two centuries. One of the most telling characteristics of this society was, according to verse 17, the fact that "neither were there Lamanites, nor any manner of -ites; but they were in one, the children of Christ, and heirs to the kingdom of God." I take this to mean that, as a result of their transcendent state of unity with God and his teachings, the Saints achieved an almost incomprehensible oneness with each other, exemplified by their lack of social distinctions, referred to here as "-ites."<br><br>I assume that although the Nephites "had all things in common," some of their families were still larger than others, some adults were single and others were married, some were raised in a rural culture and others were raised in large cities, some lived in large houses and some lived in small houses, some wore traditional clothing and others preferred more modern attire, some could read and write and others could not, some were beautiful and others were homely, and some could trace their lineage back to Nephi and others were new converts, but, as a result of their superior level of spiritual conversion and personal maturity, members of this Zion community chose to ignore these differences--because they saw no need for distinctions.<br><br>A difference is something that you observe; a distinction is something that you make. Distinctions are commonly used to include and to exclude, for the purpose of creating status and privilege. Because there was no more desire for personal advantage left in the hearts of these sanctified Saints, they saw no need to affix nonedifying labels to their neighbors, and hence there were no "manner of -ites; but they were in one, the children of Christ, and heirs to the kingdom of God."<br><br>Recently I have had several conversations with students and staff on campus that have helped me better understand the need to eliminate one of the most divisive and pernicious ite-like distinctions that divides most universities--the difference between faculty and staff. Are you aware that nearly a third of our students work part-time on campus and that the majority of them work under the supervision of one full-time staff member for 10 to 20 hours a week? I sought out this information regarding the scope of student employment on campus after learning about a number of life-changing experiences centered around a student employment relationship.<br><br>The story of Joe, a freshman from a broken home and impoverished circumstances, is illustrative. After weeks of struggling with classes that assumed a level of understanding far surpassing his academic preparation, on top of working 20 hours a week and worrying about how to promote reconciliation among his disaffected and dispersed family members, his stressful circumstances finally overpowered his will to succeed. Late one night this frightened and distraught member of our community made a desperate call for help to the one person he felt would be willing to listen and to care--his custodial supervisor. Fortunately he received the reassurance and counsel he needed and expected and was able to complete the semester.<br><br>Since hearing about many similar experiences, I am both amused and disturbed by my arrogant presumption that BYU was organized for the primary purpose of providing an opportunity for the<i>faculty</i>to influence the lives of our students. As I enter the Tanner Building early in the morning and observe our custodial student employees completing their work shifts, I am sobered by the realization that their work supervisor has in many cases already had more personal contßact with them than they will have with any other full-time BYU employee for the rest of the day. Although I am familiar with an equally inspiring set of stories about the impact of caring faculty, I now realize that having a PhD or a faculty office is a difference that warrants no distinction on a campus that is dedicated to preparing its graduates for a life of continuous personal development characterized by effective relationships, righteous living, and dedicated service.<br><br>Paul Cox, dean of General Education and Honors, recently shared with me an experience that exemplifies how well and how routinely the BYU faculty, staff, administration, and the board of trustees work together to model God's laws of organizing. Last October one of our students, Mary Frances Marsden, graduated magna cum laude with University Honors under highly unusual circumstances.<br><br>A year and a half ago, Mary's mission to Spain was cut short by a recurrence of melanoma cancer. Although the doctors gave her little hope of living more than a few months, she was determined to complete her college degree. It is difficult enough to complete an honors undergraduate program at BYU or to undergo aggressive cancer treatments, but to intermingle these activities requires supreme personal commitment and a dedicated, loving support network of friends, roommates, ward members, and faculty. It was apparently not uncommon for her to leave a class in a mad dash for the rest room, where she would in the privacy of a bathroom stall suffer the painful effects of her medical condition and its treatment.<br><br>After learning more about Mary, I can understand why Paul expresses such fondness and admiration for this young lady who had worked as his research assistant and had become an "adopted" member of his family. In early October Paul learned from Mary's oncologist that she had been admitted to the University of Utah hospital, probably for the last time. When Paul found out that she was only a few credits short of graduating, he requested permission from the administration to hold a special graduation ceremony at Mary's hospital.<br><br>Elder Henry Eyring, commissioner of the Church Educational System, not only endorsed the proposal but requested the privilege of being the commencement speaker. As representatives of the faculty and administration entered the hospital chapel in their academic robes, they barely had room to squeeze in among the overflowing group of campus and ward friends. Those in attendance recall Mary's profound insights and tender feelings as she spoke to them from the perspective of a person approaching the chasm between time and eternity and sensing the myth of discontinuity giving way to the certainty of continuity. They also recall how Elder Eyring spoke lovingly and intimately of Mary's integrity and courage in completing with highest honors the requirements for her college degree and her mortal life. Mary Frances Marsden's funeral was held less than one month after her BYU graduation.<br><br>This unusually caring response to an unusual set of challenges should inspire us all to contribute more time and more thought to our common goal of becoming a sanctified, edified, and unified academic community. It is important to remember that offense is a necessary and inevitable component of our mortal experience, including our time at BYU. In fact, given the complexity of values embedded in our mission, the potential for offense may be higher at BYU than at other universities. However, given the richness of the counsel contained in our scriptures, including the words of our living prophets, we are also better prepared to respond to provocation in a constructive, edifying manner.<br><br>To that end I propose that we make a commitment to organize and govern ourselves according to the principles contained in the covenant entered into by Joseph and William Smith on New Year's Day, 1836. These include:<br><br>1. Build each other up in righteousness in all things.<br><br>2. Do not listen to evil reports concerning each other.<br><br>3. Go to each other with our grievances in the spirit of meekness and reconciliation.<br><br>As reflected in the experience of Joseph and William Smith, I testify that acting in accordance with God's laws of organizing enables us to sanctify ourselves, to edify others, and to unify all. I further testify that these three organizing processes compose a matched set--the effectiveness of each requires the efficacy of the others.<br><br>In conclusion, as the Saints gathered in Jackson County, Missouri, in 1831, they were issued the difficult challenge of organizing a Zion community. The Lord's instructions for guiding the process included this counsel: "Men should be anxiously engaged in a good cause . . . of their own free will . . . and bring to pass much righteousness" (D&amp;amp;C 58:27). Contemporary members of the BYU community have been invited by our leaders to engage in an equally difficult and good cause--namely, organizing ourselves in such a manner that we will transform a "university in Zion" into a "Zion university." To guide our communal efforts to bring to pass much righteousness at BYU, as we pass by the signboards at the entrance of our campus each day, I invite all of us to consider how we might "enter to learn how to go forth to serve more willingly and more effectively." I pray that the Lord's spirit will inspire and direct this important developmental process, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>David A.

<h1>venant Toward the Promised Land: Section 136 as a Latter-Day Type - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
A couple of months ago, my older sister, Margo, serving as Young Women president in her ward in Cape Town, South Africa, expressed frustration that she could find no way to help her young women see the meaning in "Faith in Every Footstep." In fact, she said, "I am tired of these American stories, these pioneers who died a hundred years ago and with whom I can find no connection." I knew exactly what she meant.<br><br>As a child of relatively new convert parents in Cape Town, South Africa, I was bewildered to encounter American pioneers. After all, we had pioneers of our own--the Voortrekkers: Afrikaner men and women who left the English colony of Cape Town. They wanted to escape British tyranny, speak their own language, and worship their own God. I was fully aware of my Voortrekker heritage--but my pioneer heritage in the Church was, I assumed, sadly lacking. All I had were two parents who, by joining the Church in the 1950s, had branded themselves to the outside world. In their devotion to this new religion, they had saved for eight years, eventually selling my father's prized cherry-red, 1940 MG roadster to fund what they thought would be a once-in-a-lifetime journey to the London Temple to be sealed to their four children. And there I was singing "America the Beautiful" in honor of some American pioneer day in the Mowbray chapel on a 1970s Wednesday afternoon 20 kilometers from the tip of Africa. I had no idea what I was doing.<br><br>Of what significance were these American pioneers? Why did Sister Cartwright insist on making us dress up in Voortrekker clothing and push wheelbarrows around the Church parking lot in the middle of a winter July rainstorm? (Wheelbarrows were the closest we could come to a little red wagon. We had no idea what the lesson manual meant by those.)<br><br>As of February 1996, the majority of our Church members live outside the United States. Like me, they do not have a direct link to the pioneer heritage. I cannot even claim one by marriage--Kevin's pioneer heritage includes his father's 1960 journey across the plains of America in a car whose tires were so bald they should have traveled only one block, not three thousand miles from the Bronx, New York. That young 1960 pioneer came of Puerto Rican heritage, raised on a diet of New York Yankees, Broadway shows, and playing hooky at Coney Island. That pioneer who made his solitary journey is now the gentle grandfather of my two very wild children. In marrying Kevin, I assumed his pioneer journey as part of my individual heritage--no Young, Smith, Call, or Snow in our combined family journals.<br><br>What then is the significance of the 1847 exodus from Nauvoo to the millions like me who have no pioneer blood? There are two ways to look at these stories:<br><br>1. First, we can see in the intensely personal accounts guides and mentors. I am moved by the stories of sacrifice, of hope in the face of great sorrow, of obedience when staring at seeming impossibilities. These stories serve as individual mentors for my personal challenges.<br><br>2. We can view these accounts in their broad strokes and patterns as types from the beginnings of our religious and cultural heritage that tell us as a people how to act if we will reenact the literal journey in our spiritual lives.<br><br>It is in discussing this second approach that I wish to convey to my sister and her young women--and all others like them and me across the world--the great significance of that long-ago pioneer journey to the mountain valleys of Utah.<br><br>Collectively, to the Church membership as a whole, this pioneer journey can serve as our mythic root back to the creation of Zion. It can explain to us who we are, how we came to be, and how we must journey through this life if we are to reach or establish Zion in our hearts. We are literally the spiritual posterity of those early pioneers. Their actual journey to a Utah valley to physically establish Zion is the model on which we must base our spiritual journey with "the pure in heart" (D&amp;amp;C 97:21).<br><h2><b>Preparing for the Journey</b></h2><br>In the dedication of the Mount Timpanogos Temple, and again this last general conference, Elder Faust told the story of his great-grandparents, who, on the eve of leaving Nauvoo, were in the group of Saints who thronged the temple hoping to receive their temple covenants. Brigham Young was about to leave in his wagon, but his heart was softened, and he kept the temple open into the morning hours so that the Saints would have an opportunity to leave on the westward trek under the protection of temple covenants.<br><br>Why were these covenants so important? Because, with the making of the covenants in the endowment session, the Saints lost their image of themselves as individuals and began to see the world as the Lord sees it. As they made the covenants to sacrifice for the Lord, to love their fellow Saints, to remain chaste and pure before God, and to covenant all they had for the building of the kingdom of God, they left behind the typically American myth of realization that now pervades much of the Western world: Horatio Alger, Daniel Boone, Davy Crockett--the bushwhackers who travel off the beaten path to accolades and praise. After the temple covenants, the pioneers were able to see through new eyes, the eyes of God. Their vision became God's vision, and their walk became the walk of God. They were then disciples of Christ, children of Abraham, part of the family of God--irrevocably tied together by divine relationships.<br><br>It is fitting that such covenants were made before the westward journey. And it is fitting that we make such covenants before we embark on our spiritual journey toward Zion. Why? Because when the Saints joined the wagon train, they did so with ambivalent feelings. After months of preparation in which parlors were turned into paint shops for wagons and women preserved all they could for the journey, the exodus still came as a heart-wrenching surprise. (See Bathsheba Wilson Bigler Smith, autobiography, microfilm of manuscript, Church Archives, quoted in Jill Mulvay Derr, Janath Russell Cannon, and Maureen Ursenbach Beecher,<i>Women of Covenant: The Story of Relief Society</i>[Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Company, 1992], p. 64.) They were leaving behind their lives and much they loved: their sacred temple, their homes and businesses, even their lands and crops in the fields. Yet they knew, and had decided jointly, that, as a people, they were moving to a suitable valley in the West in which they could build another temple of God and live according to his covenants and statutes. They were to start anew with a new organization modeled after the patriarchal family, under a contract with God, willing to go wherever his appointed leaders directed (see Derr, Cannon, and Beecher,<i>Women of Covenant,</i>p. 65).<br><br>In much the same manner, when we make covenants in the temple, we leave behind our old lives. We covenant to forsake our selfishness, our profanities, our egos, and our covetousness, and we consecrate all that we have for the building up of the kingdom of Zion, which Zion is not a physical place in the tops of the mountains but a knowledge of the gospel and the resurrected Christ in the hearts of our fellow travelers. Significantly, this temple covenant, I believe, is not meant to be a continuum of our lives; it is not meant to mesh nicely with the old order. I believe it comes to us like Christ came: with a sword to divide everything asunder, to change life as we know it to life as God wants it to be (see Matthew 10:34–39).<br><br>To those who had not prepared in heart and soul, the command to begin the westward trek was stunning. In fact, some of the Saints were left behind for a season so that they could better prepare (see D&amp;amp;C 136:6). However, for those who do these things with a pure heart, the command is clear--not without real fear or sorrow--but full of the Spirit and thus joyful to the soul.<br><br>Why is this particular concept of journeying under covenant so powerful?<br><br>First, I believe the journey of the soul is inevitable. We will journey whether we want to or not. Dennis Rasmussen, in<i>The Lord's Question,</i>says we are moving either away from God or toward him (<i>The Lord's Question</i>[Provo, Utah: Keter Foundation, 1985], p. 4). We are never stationary. It seems then that the natural motion of the soul is to journey. If we wish to journey toward the promised land and kneel before our Maker, we must journey under his covenant made in sacred places before our fellow Saints and witnesses.<br><br>Second, journeying under covenant acts as an antidote for the rampant materialism and I-centeredness of our generation. I recently moderated a session of a symposium in which members of the Church bemoaned the fact that the Church didn't offer them a comfortable place in which to explore their own peculiar identity. Their rallying cry seemed to be, "The Church is just not sensitive to our needs." I have also heard those--myself among them--who wish to be entertained for 90 minutes on the Sabbath groan at the lack of stimulation in local sacrament meetings.<br><br>Recently one of my honors students tried to justify the acquisition of great wealth. He kept insisting, "I should be able to keep all the Lord has given me through my work and my righteousness." I tried to persuade him to change the terms of the equation: Not whether I should be able to keep everything, but whether the Lord will want to keep me after all I have given. In the dedication of the Mount Timpanogos Temple, I heard anew these phrases: "The temple is ready. Lord, please accept this, our offering." I suddenly realized that in the temple<i>we</i>become the offering. We ask not "What does the Church have to offer me?" but "What do I have to offer the Lord, 'the people of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and those who journey with them'?" (D&amp;amp;C 136:2). With that reorientation, the sacrifices required on the trail toward Zion assume a different dimension. Significantly, only in the temple can we commit to this orientation toward our community and our God and prepare ourselves for the journey.<br><h2><b>Journeying under Covenant</b></h2><br>What are the features of this particular journey? What life are we living when we journey under covenant toward the promised land?<br><br><i>1. Saints under covenant must be devoted to the concept of journeying, not destination.</i>The ultimate covenant under which the Saints journeyed is simply expressed in D&amp;amp;C 136:4: "And this shall be our covenant--that we will walk in all the ordinances of the Lord." Note the covenant is not that they will walk in the Lord's ordinances until they reach Zion. There is no mention of destination when we walk in the way of the Lord's ordinances.<br><br>In the revelation of 1847, the journey and not the destination seems to be more significant. The Lord does not offer advice on how to settle the Salt Lake Valley; rather, he reminds the Saints they are under covenant to him and to each other. His statutes govern behavior on the trail, not settlement in Zion. He actually consoles them with "Zion shall be redeemed in mine own due time" (v. 18), as if to remind them that he will take care of Zion and their enemies (see verse 30); their responsibility is to take care of each other.<br><br>Significantly, the Lord's time, not human diligence, governs the creation of Zion. Thus we find in section 136 another antidote to a modern malaise--this time to the prevailing mind-set that life is a series of tasks to be completed as quickly as possible. Similarly, when we view our spiritual journey as a set of hurdles, we concentrate on jumping cleanly and crossing the tape first--we want to be the first to see the angel Moroni as we round the bend in Emigration Canyon. So we attend the temple every month, we cross-stitch the Proclamation on Families on a fridge magnet, and we read at least one verse of scripture before our head hits the pillow so that our planner will have all those boxes neatly checked. In our zeal we fail to realize that we are judged not on whether we reach the Salt Lake Valley but on whether we wore ourselves out in the effort to bring ourselves and all for whom we are responsible as far along the trail as possible.<br><br>Patience Loader was 20 years old when she and her family left Council Bluffs three weeks behind schedule as part of the Martin Handcart Company. She wrote movingly of the sacrifice by those of the party to make sure that at least some of their families would reach Zion. In particular she described a Brother Blair who had been one of Queen Victoria's "life guards" in London before his conversion and immigration:<br><br><i>He had a wife and four small children. He made a cover for his cart and he put his four children on the cart. He pulled his cart alone. His wife helped by pushing behind the cart. Poor man. He was so weak and waurn down that he fell down several times that day but still he kept his dear little children on the cart all day. This poor man had so much love for his wife and children that instead of eating his mosael of food himself he would give it to his children. Poor man. He pulled the cart as long as he could then he died and his poor wife and children had to do the best thay could without him. . . . The poor children got frozen. Some parts of there bodys was all sores but thay all got in to Salt L</i>[ake]<i>City alive.</i>[Kenneth W. Godfrey, Audrey M. Godfrey, and Jill Mulvay Derr,<i>Women's Voices: An Untold History of the Latter-day Saints, 1830–1900</i>(Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Company, 1982), p. 231; original spelling and punctuation preserved]<br><br>Ultimately, that we physically arrive at our destination is insignificant. In a last journal entry on April 5, 1847, before she left Nauvoo, Patty Bartlett Sessions wrote: "We start for the mountains or a resting place and leave Winter Quarters" (Godfrey, Godfrey, and Derr,<i>Women's Voices,</i>p. 198). She recognized that, at 52 years of age, she might not complete the journey to Zion. However, the Lord promised the 1847 Saints before they had even taken a step, "You have received my kingdom" (v. 41). Now what does that mean? Perhaps that the kingdom of God is not so much a valley in the Rocky Mountains as a state of spiritual readiness and sacrifice, and that once we have committed our lives through temple covenants to the Lord we have the kingdom of God within us.<br><br>To maintain that spiritual commitment is perhaps the reason for being "tried in all things" (v. 31). We cannot stay in our Nauvoo forever: we must wade the Mississippi River, join the wagon train, and begin the journey. Ultimately though, this covenant journey is about willingness and worthiness to enter the kingdom of God. President Hunter, in his short ministry as prophet, clarified for us the worth of the temple recommend by asking all to make themselves worthy to hold one. Our recommend is not a hall pass to a particular temple. It is a symbol of our willingness and worthiness to make and live by the covenants of God, whether we live in Provo and may attend the temple at our discretion or in Nairobi, where we might never have the chance, in this life, to make those temple covenants.<br><br>In May of 1847, little Peter Weston Maughan was born to Mary Ann Weston and Peter Maughan, English immigrants living in Wisconsin Territory. Later, in 1850, his parents buried him in a dry-goods box somewhere along the Mormon Trail--a trail described by President Hinckley as "a trail of tragedy, a trail of faith, a trail of devotion, a trail of consecration, even the consecration of life itself" (from an address delivered near Riverton, Wyoming, 15 August 1992, quoted in Dell Van Orden, "'Second Rescue' of Handcart Pioneers,"<i>Church News,</i>22 August 1992, p. 3). He had fallen from the wagon seat and been crushed by the wagon wheels. His mother had already lost her first husband from injuries he sustained in a mob beating in England (see Godfrey, Godfrey, and Derr,<i>Women's Voices,</i>p. 37–38). (They had opened their home to preaching by Willard Richards and Wilford Woodruff, much to the consternation of their neighbors.) His mother wrote the following in her life history about little Peter:<br><br><i>We buried him on a little hill on the North side of the road. The grave was consecrated and then they laid him to rest. Some one had made a nice headboard, with his name printed on, also his age and date of death. This was all we could do, and many prayers were offered to our heavenly Father, that he might rest in peace and not be disturbed by wolves. We turned away in sorrow and grief.</i>["Journal of Mary Ann Weston Maughan,"<i>Our Pioneer Heritage,</i>comp. Kate B. Carter, vol. 2 (Salt Lake City: Daughters of Utah Pioneers, 1959), p. 377]<br><br>His parents consecrated his grave to God and then turned their faces again toward Zion. Peter's small body lies as a testament that he was willing and worthy to make the journey to Zion and that he gave all he had, even his life, for the building up of the kingdom of God. I cannot help but think of the last verse of "Come, Come, Ye Saints":<br><br><i>And should we die before our journey's through,<br>Happy day! All is well!<br>We then are free from toil and sorrow, too;<br>With the just we shall dwell!<br>But if our lives are spared again<br>To see the Saints their rest obtain,<br>Oh, how we'll make this chorus swell--<br>All is well! All is well!</i><br>[<i>Hymns,</i>1985, no. 30]<br><br><i>2. Saints under covenant travel in companies organized and led by the Lord.</i>The pioneer Saints were organized into companies with a covenant and promise to keep all the commandments and statutes of God (see D&amp;amp;C 136:2). They pledged to each other to travel together as a company under the leadership of "a president and his two counselors . . . under the direction of the Twelve Apostles" (v. 3), the Lord's appointed. Once these significant covenants had been made, the Saints' sole responsibility was to use "all [their] influence and property" (v. 10) to bring their company to Zion and to do so "with a pure heart, in all faithfulness" (v. 11). The revelation refers to the individual Saints in two places: in verse 10, where the individual is told to use "all his influence and property" for the benefit of "this people," and in verses 20–30, where individuals are counseled how to act toward their fellow travelers. All the further responsibilities are described as follows: "Let [the companies] go to with their might" (v. 6), and verses 7 through 9 all start with "Let each company."<br><br>Interestingly, the Lord calls the Saints of 1847 "this people" (v. 10). There is no division into the worthy or unworthy, into blessed or more righteous. He embraces all Saints with "this people." According to the divine vision of equality, each company had their own "captains" (v. 3), their own "poor . . . widows . . . fatherless" (v. 8)--all equally deserving of a place in the wagon train. The needy members of each company were the touchstone by which the company would be judged. The pioneer Saints' treatment of the widows, poor, and fatherless would be either their justification or condemnation: For "the cries of the widow and the fatherless come . . . up into the ears of the Lord against [the] people" (v. 8) who do not care for them.<br><br>Brigham Young, Jr., in a 1901 conference address, described the conditions on the trail that reinforce the notion of divine equality:<br><br><i>Day after day those who were in the rear part of the train thought they were doing well if they could camp where the head of the train had camped the previous day. If they made in one day a journey of three miles, they thought they were doing excellently, because they had to bridge the streams, and over every swamp they had to build corduroy bridges. I never will forget them. They were like the lives of the Latter-day Saints. We have to journey sometimes in water up to our necks, where we can hardly keep our mouths above the surface. So it was at that time.</i>[Brigham Young, Jr.,<i>CR,</i>November 1901, p. 77]<br><br>In the pioneer journey as in life, some will be at the head of the wagon train and some will be at the rear. Although the stakes might not seem or actually be fair, no status is attached to our position in the train. All travelers must complete their own journey and cross the rivers with "mouths [hardly] above the surface." However, it is precisely because the stakes on our journeys are not even, or even fair for that matter, that the second great commandment becomes so important: "Love thy neighbour as thyself" (Matthew 22:39).<br><br>Consequently, in our modern journey we may not indulge in the recess game of picking sides according to talent and ability or picking wards and acquaintances according to socioeconomic levels or reputation. We can only pledge allegiance to the company to which the Lord has assigned us. We cannot discard those who would weigh us down or lessen our chance of what we perceive to be a speedy, prestigious arrival in Zion. (Here we find again the mistaken notion of Zion as an ultimate destination.) Once we are under covenant, we may not travel alone, even if we think that by staying with the group we lessen our own chances of success.<br><br>Thirteen-year-old Mary Goble Pay traveled with her family in an ox wagon. They were assigned to stay with the Martin and Willie handcart companies to offer assistance if necessary (Mary Goble Pay, "Death Strikes the Handcart Company," in Richard H. Cracroft and Neal E. Lambert,<i>A Believing People: Literature of the Latter-day Saints</i>[Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1979], pp. 105–7). An ox wagon could outtravel a handcart. Had the Goble family traveled at their own pace, they probably would not have lost their six-week-old daughter who "died for want of nourishment" and was "buried at the last crossing of the Sweet Water [River]." They might not have lost their teenage son, who was as "well as he ever was when he went to bed. In the morning he was dead." They might not have lost their mother, who died "between the Little and Big Mountain" on the day they entered the valley. "She was 43 years old." Mary wrote later: "We had orders not to pass the handcart companies. We had to keep close to them to help them if we could." Like Mary, we will never arrive in Zion--even if we are physically standing on the corner block of Temple Square--if those for whom we are responsible do not arrive with us.<br><br>Do I ever arrive at my destination? I do--only my individual arrival means nothing if I have not helped those who follow after me to also reach Zion. Zion is where the Saints have gathered together; I cannot inhabit Zion all by myself. Even the language that we use so naturally--"I'm a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints"--is rife with reminders of our interconnectedness. When we become members, we are inextricably linked with all the other members of this spiritual body.<br><br>We are sometimes tempted to separate ourselves from the group--mostly when we lose our focus of the temple covenants. We begin to think the ways of the world more significant than the ways of the Lord. However, the Lord warns those individuals who<br><br><i>have strayed from mine ordinances, and have broken mine everlasting covenant;</i><br><br><i>They seek not the Lord to establish his righteousness, but every man walketh in his own way, and after the image of his own god.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 1:15–16]<br><br>Those "who will not hear the voice of the Lord . . . shall be cut off from among the people" (v. 14). Their destination is not the promised land of the celestial kingdom but a forever wandering in the wilderness.<br><br><i>3. We reveal our commitment to our covenants by the way we accept chastisement.</i>With no regard to position, the Lord will chastise those who disobey the covenants of the company. Brigham Young brought charges of insubordination and dissension against Parley P. Pratt and Bishop George P. Miller, who had been appointed leaders over three particular companies. Although Pratt felt their intentions were honorable, he conceded Bishop Miller had been unnecessarily harsh in his treatment of the companies on the trail, thus making their journey more difficult than it might have been (see<i>PPP,</i>1980, pp. 341–42). The Lord makes this consequence clear: when we cause the burdens of those to whom we are yoked to be heavier, we will be chastised. And "he that will not bear chastisement is not worthy of my kingdom" (D&amp;amp;C 136:31). In addition, when we seek to elevate ourselves above our fellow Saints, our "folly shall be made manifest" (v. 19). Bishop Miller later left the Church as a result of that chastisement, confirming the Lord's pronouncement that "those who will not endure chastening, but deny me, cannot be sanctified" (D&amp;amp;C 101:5).<br><br><i>4. The sole purpose of the journey is to gather</i>all<i>Saints to Zion.</i>We must be devoted to all journeys--past, present, and future--whether we know the travelers or not. As long as there are others on the trail, or those who<i>might</i>travel with us, our stewardship is not over. As part of our covenant, we ensure that the route is negotiable and possible for all; we realize that we cannot be saved without our kindred dead, without our husband or wife, without our children, without our parents, without our neighbors. The success of our journey is contingent upon their completing theirs.<br><br>This far-reaching perspective is evident in the Lord's commandments to the Saints preparing to leave Winter Quarters. In preparation for the trek, the Lord commanded a vanguard of "able-bodied and expert men, to take teams, seeds, and farming utensils, to go as pioneers to prepare for putting in spring crops" (D&amp;amp;C 136:7). That way, when more Saints arrived along the trail, there would be food for them to eat. Those who were to "remain behind this season" were to "prepare houses, and fields for raising grain" (v. 9). Apparently even those who could not yet make the journey with the rest of the company were still that company's responsibility. For the Saints had covenanted in the Nauvoo Temple:<br><br><i>We</i>[will]<i>"never cease our exertions, by all the means and influence within our reach, till all the Saints who were obliged to leave Nauvoo should be located at some gathering place of the Saints."</i>["Second General Epistle" (12 October 1849), in James R. Clark, comp.,<i>Messages of the First Presidency of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints,</i>vol. 2 (Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1965), p. 34]<br><br>Without that willingness to covenant all they had and were, these people could not enter Zion. Under commandment were all the Saints' might and money for the betterment of the whole body of the people. They were to work at backbreaking planting and house building for those who were to come after them. In other words, what they sowed they did not reap--they could not reap. They had to move forward from the site of their labors trusting that those preceding them had done so as well.<br><br><i>5. This journey is not for the purpose of acquisition or accumulation. We take only what we can carry or what we can pull; we take sufficient.</i>This concern for those who would come after them was also evident in the way the Saints settled the land of the Salt Lake Valley. The original party of 148 people decided no property would be bought; each family would be given property according to their needs. The first pioneers did not take all the land and make a profit selling it to those who would come later. There was also "no private ownership of the streams, and only dead timber [c]ould be used for fuel" (Joseph Fielding Smith,<i>Essentials in Church History</i>[Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Company, 1979], p. 372). Those resources vital to the sustaining of the first community and later communities were kept as common property.<br><br>The covenant these pioneer people made before the trek was still valid when they arrived in the valley. Brigham Young urged the Saints, "Let every man cultivate his own lot and set out every kind of fruit and shade tree and beautify the city" (Smith,<i>Essentials,</i>p. 374). Each family would assume the role of gardener, of Adam and Eve, figuratively speaking, in erecting and beautifying Zion.<i>Zion</i>did not mean a collection of individual houses of Zion but described a city with citizens committed to the sustenance of each fellow citizen. This was not a venture to gain land and property. It was a venture to establish peace and the true worship of God among the Saints.<br><br>We can consider ourselves to be like Adam and Eve in this journey: We work, labor, and rejoice to "be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth" (Genesis 1:28) and to have joy in our posterity. When we move away from the appropriation of Adam and Eve of the resources of the earth, we change our types and start to function under the type of Adam and Eve's child: Cain. It is fitting that, as in life, the Lord would juxtapose two very different attitudes toward the earth in the children of the first parents. Cain's thirst for ownership and for praise led to the spilling of the first blood. We follow Cain's example when we disregard the admonition to earn our bread by the sweat of our face (see Genesis 3:19), attempting instead to gain from the labor of others. We become like Cain when we seek, recklessly, the praise of our superiors and "seek to build up [ourselves]" (D&amp;amp;C 136:19) no matter what the cost. We become like Cain when we lose sight of our goal--which is to establish a place of peace in which to worship God--and instead wish to lay up riches on earth. The Lord reminds us that "the laborer in Zion shall labor for Zion; for if they labor for money they shall perish" (2 Nephi 26:31). Thus, if we are to reach this promised land, we are to be the Adams and Eves and not the Cains of the world.<br><br><i>6. Saints under covenant are the Lord's stewards.</i>The Saints were advised: "Be diligent in preserving what thou hast, that thou mayest be a wise steward; for [what thou hast] is the free gift of the Lord thy God, and thou art his steward" (D&amp;amp;C 136:27). The steward was, in ancient times, the keeper of the house, whose duty it was to see that<i>all</i>were admitted and fed. He was under contract to obey his master, was appointed by his master to take care of part of the master's household, and was expected to render an account of his dealings with the master's possessions. Our master has told us: "It is not given that one man should possess that which is above another" (D&amp;amp;C 49:20). Thus, as part of the covenant journey, we become responsible to use all that we have been given to aid fellow travelers--i.e., we act as stewards over the blessings of God, dispensing judiciously and wisely as directed by the Lord of the house, who is the only owner of things.<br><br>If we view ourselves as stewards, we--and all with which we have been blessed--are under covenant to the Father. We realize that we live in his house and must obey his wishes regarding that particular part of the kingdom in which we function: husband, wife, wealthy man, daughter, father, mother, sister, bishop, visiting teacher, poor woman. To disobey the wishes of the Master is to be an unfaithful servant. We cannot decide who will be the recipient of the riches of this earth; in fact, Brigham Young clarified for the early Saints those for whom they acted as stewards: "Preserve all you can, that you may have abundance to bless your friends and your enemies" (<i>JD</i>14:44 [8 May 1870]). We can only seek to know the will of the Father and dispense judiciously of ourselves, our influence, and property accordingly.<br><br><i>7. The covenant journey may be one of merriment, sorrow, deprivation, and plenty.</i>The nature of the trail demands that it be so. The Saints were to go to the tops of the Rockies. There was no higher nor more isolated place in continental America. We also travel toward a most high and holy place. We might be required to freeze in the winter, lose our children and companions to starvation, crawl on our hands and knees, and pick cow dung off the trail for heat. We may lose fingers, toes, entire limbs, even our body before the journey is over. Yet through our mortal sorrows, we "call on the Lord [our] God with supplication, that [our] souls may be joyful" (D&amp;amp;C 136:29). At other times we might be "merry, prais[ing] the Lord with singing, with music, with dancing, and with a prayer of praise and thanksgiving" (v. 28). These vagaries are the nature of the journey when we travel to the high places. Christ reminds us: "[The Father] maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust" (Matthew 5:45). Yet if we will humble ourselves in the midst of afflictions, "the Lord [our] God shall lead [us] by the hand, and give [us] answer to [our] prayers" (D&amp;amp;C 112:10).<br><br>Echoing the Lord's promises, Patience Loader described the last days of her handcart journey to Salt Lake City:<br><br><i>We got up and prepared our bone soup for breakfast. We did not get but very little meat as the bone had been picked the night before and we did not have only the half of asmall biscute as we only was having four oz. of flour aday. . . . This we eat with thankfull hearts and we allways as[k] God to bless to our use and that it would strengthen our bodys day by day so that we could performe our dutys. And I can testefie that our heavenly Father heard and answerd our prayers and we was blessed with health and strength day by day to endure the severe trials we had to pass through on that terrable journey before we got to Salt Lake City. We know that if God had not been with us that our strength would have failed us and our bodys would have been left on the plains. . . . I can truthfully say that we never fealt to murmer at the hardships we was passing through. I can say we put our trust in God and he heard and answered our prayers and brought us through to the valleys.</i>[Godfrey, Godfrey, and Derr,<i>Women's Voices,</i>p. 238; original spelling and punctuation preserved]<br><br><i>8. This covenant journey may seem repetitious and unending.</i>Shortly after arriving in the Salt Lake Valley, Brigham Young sent Saints to settle first the valleys to the south and the east: Utah and Heber counties. Some of those families would be called yet again to settle the Iron Mission in the Red Hills outside Cedar City (see Wallace Stegner,<i>Mormon Country</i>[Lincoln, Nebraska: Nebraska University Press, 1978], p. 68). Some were sent to find a route for the wagon trains through the canyon country of southern Utah. Some families settled area after area in the same pattern 10 to 15 years apart. We may be asked in our journeys to Zion to repeat what we have already done: teach the CTRs for the fifth time; lead the Relief Society music for another seven years; serve another leadership mission to a country where the Church members are just beginning their journey. We will be asked, by the Lord or by the Lord's servants (see D&amp;amp;C 1:38), to "teach this, [his] will, to the saints, that they may be ready to go to a land of peace" (D&amp;amp;C 136:16).<br><br>For the benefit of those who follow behind us, we repeat again the vital truths concerning "the Word and Will of the Lord" (D&amp;amp;C 136:1). Simultaneously, our own souls may be recommitted as we "remember how merciful the Lord hath been unto the children of men" (Moroni 10:3). We experience again a mighty change of heart as we remember "the captivity of [our] fathers . . . [the Lord's] mercy and longsuffering towards them" and remember that the Lord has delivered their and our souls from hell, waking us "out of a deep sleep . . . unto God" (Alma 5:6–7). However, this change of heart will only be ours if we are diligent, on those seemingly dreary stretches of trail, in keeping all the commandments (see D&amp;amp;C 136:42).<br><h2><b>Conclusion</b></h2><br>So what do I find in this pioneer journey that helps me identify with the early Saints? I find something that can help all of us in enduring to the end.<br><br>I realize that my awe and reverence and sometimes disbelief--these people were too much, too unbelievable--is perhaps a result of my reluctance to admit that I, too, am capable of such devotion, such sacrifice, and such commitment to the kingdom of God. Nelson Mandela, in his inauguration address as the president of South Africa in 1994, urged his fellow citizens to remember their divine destiny:<br><br><i>Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure. It is our light, not our darkness, that most frightens us. We ask ourselves who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented, and fabulous? Actually, who are you not to be? You are a child of God. Your playing small doesn't serve the world.</i>[Quoted in J. Bonner Ritchie, "Learning to Teach, Teaching to Learn,"<i>Brigham Young Magazine,</i>August 1996, p. 34]<br><br>I learn that while I may physically be in Zion, actually in that sacred valley toward which those first Saints traveled, I must make my own spiritual exodus from Nauvoo. I learn that I am under covenant to fashion from the barren wilderness of Utah or my soul a place in which I can worship the Almighty God. I realize I must see this land and this life as the Lord sees it, bringing my individual vision to match the vision of the Lord. I must bend my individual will toward the community conscience, replacing the individualistic word<i>right</i>with the communal term<i>responsibility.</i>I learn I am merely a steward and gardener--not owner, not proprietor, not merchant--and I learn that this earth is given not for private ownership but for communal reward. Most important, I learn that I travel, in convoy and under covenant, toward a promised land. And in the royal courts on high, I will be home: along with those who made that first journey to Zion; beside those who traveled on bald tires across America; with those who made the trip to London in a second-class cabin with four children; and in the presence of those whose bodies, large and small, lie buried in holy ground along the trail--all patterns for me to follow.<br><br>It is my prayer that we live worthy to be gathered in the presence of those who first showed us how to establish Zion, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Tessa Meyer Santiago was an instructor of English at BYU when this devotional address was given on 13 May 1997.</i><br><br><i>© Brigham Young University. All rights reserved.</i>

<h1>orship of the Book of Mormon - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I am grateful for the invitation to tell you about a variety of important research projects related to the Book of Mormon. Scholars from many disciplines at BYU and elsewhere are turning their academic expertise to studies of the Book of Mormon that are expanding our appreciation for this great book and the prophetic messages it contains.<br><br>Although my primary teaching responsibilities during my 27 years at BYU have revolved around courses in legal and political philosophy, I have frequently enjoyed the opportunity to teach Book of Mormon classes as well. After years of rereading and teaching this book, I began to collect insights that developed into research interests and eventually published articles and books.<br><br>Enthused by this involvement and by the research of numerous other scholars, I accepted an invitation from the Religious Studies Center at BYU to edit a volume of papers by different scholars that would address the question of Book of Mormon authorship. That book was first published in 1982, and a new printing was released last year by FARMS (the Foundation for Ancient Research and Mormon Studies).<br><br>Over the subsequent 15 years many new studies have been completed, and earlier ones have been significantly updated. As a result, a second volume of studies on Book of Mormon authorship will be released within a month, providing the occasion for my presentation today. Most of the studies I will describe today are reported in detail in one or the other of these two books.<br><br>Since the early 1970s there has been a dramatic increase in general interest in the Book of Mormon, particularly among Latter-day Saints. In less than two weeks there will be a conference on Ancient Scriptures in the Restoration sponsored by FARMS and the Smith Institute for Church History at BYU. At that time I will present a wide variety of evidence to show that the LDS community is reading and writing much more about the Book of Mormon in recent decades than ever before. The Book of Mormon is playing a greatly expanded role in Church education, in Sunday School curricula, in missionary work, and in Church speaking and instruction generally. Even more important, understanding and appreciation for the divine origin and mission of this restored scripture is much clearer and stronger among Church members than ever before.<br><br>Many Book of Mormon research projects have implications for the continuing issues surrounding the authorship of the Book of Mormon. Most Latter-day Saints are aware of a minor industry in certain religious circles in the United States devoted to refuting Mormonism and to criticizing the Book of Mormon.<br><br>It may be of interest to you to hear what two young evangelical scholars recently told their own colleagues in comparing evangelical criticisms to the research published by faithful LDS scholars in recent years. In a paper that they hope to publish in a major theological journal, they pointed out that certain evangelical beliefs about Mormons are nothing more than myths or wishful thinking. For example, their research categorically refutes the following three myths that evangelicals frequently tell each other about Mormons:<br><br>Myth #1: There are no traditional (faithful) Mormon scholars with training in academic disciplines related to biblical studies or religion.<br><br>Myth #2: Mormons who seriously study biblical languages, theology, and philosophy abandon belief in the historicity of the Book of Mormon and Joseph Smith's prophethood.<br><br>Myth #3: Mormonism is crumbling because liberal Mormons have shaken the foundations of LDS belief.<br><br>These same evangelical scholars then went on to draw several conclusions from their study of the debate between Mormons and evangelicals, much of which focuses on the Book of Mormon:<br><br>Conclusion #1: There are many qualified Mormon scholars.<br><br>Conclusion #2: Mormon scholars and apologists have answered most of the evangelical criticisms.<br><br>Conclusion #3: There are no evangelical books that interact responsibly with contemporary LDS scholarly and apologetic writings.<br><br>Conclusion #4: At the scholarly level, evangelicals are losing the debate with the Mormons.<br><br>Conclusion #5: Evangelicals involved in the counterculture (anti-Mormon) movement lack the skills and training necessary to answer Mormon scholarly apologetic.<br><br>They went on to explain, and I quote:<br><br><i>Having read an immense amount of the scholarly literature published by LDS intellectuals; having read a great deal of apologetic material produced by the Foundation for Ancient Research and Mormon Studies (FARMS); and having read or examined most evangelical works on Mormonism, we feel that we are justified in our conclusions.</i>[Unpublished manuscript in the author's possession]<br><br>In the time allotted to me today, I would like to cite a small selection of examples of the kind of work that LDS scholars have been doing, particularly with respect to the authorship question. In the process, I hope you will gain a new appreciation for the great complexity of the Book of Mormon, for the mounting evidences of its truly ancient origins, and for the creative work being done by faithful LDS scholars here and elsewhere.<br><br>In his recent study of the Book of Mormon translation process, Richard L. Bushman, professor of history at Columbia University, presents the details and evidence from the perspective of the original participants, including Joseph and Emma Smith, Oliver Cowdery, and other scribes and family members. Without referring directly to critical accounts, Bushman shows why alternative explanations of this process do not work and why the story told by the original participants should be taken seriously.<br><br>Joseph Smith and his scribes ground out seven to nine pages of translated text each day for about 63 days. All accounts agree that Joseph never paused to review even the previous page or sentence, and he used no notes, books, or other reference materials. Joseph and his scribes clearly realized that they could never have produced such a book on their own. The words were given to Joseph one line at a time through divine power and the medium of interpretive instruments like the seerstone, much like we today might read lines off a computer screen. For any mortal to dictate a 500-page book in this way, off the top of his head, would inevitably lead to wandering, repetition, contradiction, non sequiturs, and pointlessness. But the Book of Mormon has none of these failings. It is full of themes and stories, characters and events, and accumulating points and teachings that reward repeated rereading. The internal complexity and consistency of the resulting book is itself strong evidence that it could not have originated with Joseph and his scribes working in this manner.<br><br>Richard L. Anderson, professor emeritus of ancient scripture at BYU, continues his historical investigations of the 11 men who were witnesses of the plates from which the Book of Mormon was translated. In spite of the fact that most of them eventually had serious differences with Joseph Smith or even left the Church, all maintained the veracity of their original witness of the truth of the Book of Mormon and its divine origins.<br><br>One dramatic incident gives us the essence of their experience. David Whitmer was one of the Three Witnesses who disagreed with the way the Church was going, and he settled down permanently in Missouri, letting the Saints go their way to Nauvoo and then on to Utah. He once became deeply annoyed by persistent rumors that he had recanted his witness. Desperate for a means of quelling these false rumors, he purchased advertising space and published a proclamation in numerous newspapers, even as far away as Chicago. In this proclamation, he reaffirmed the original experience of seeing the plates as shown to him by an angel and of hearing the voice of God commanding him to bear public witness of the same. In spite of every incentive to recant this witness, neither Whitmer nor any of the other 10 witnesses ever did modify their original story. They rather chose to maintain their testimonies firmly to the end of their lives.<br><br>Royal Skousen, professor of English at BYU, has been studying the original manuscript of the Book of Mormon and related documents for several years. After minute examination of these manuscripts with all their corrections and other physical features, Skousen finds the eyewitness accounts of the translation process to be wholly credible and precise in their details.<br><br>As Joseph dictated without the aid of notes, papers, or even the plates themselves, relying solely on the Urim and Thummim or the seerstone, the scribes carefully recorded every word. The manuscript shows that Joseph dictated word groups of the same length rather than sentences. This may explain why the original manuscript had no punctuation. Joseph would spell out strange names the first time they occurred, and the scribes would correct them in-line if they had misspelled them. But then they would sometimes revert to misspelled versions when those names occurred again in the dictation. Many errors were caught when scribes read each transcribed line back to Joseph. If it was wrong, he would dictate the line again, and the scribe would make appropriate corrections above the line. Once it was recorded correctly, the line would disappear in the stone, and the next line would appear. This translation process, as described by the participants and substantiated by Skousen's examination of the original manuscript, did not seem to allow Joseph Smith much freedom in word choice. The Book of Mormon was not an ordinary translation.<br><br>The complicated production of the Book of Mormon, from its original writing by Nephi, Mormon, Moroni, and others to its most recent editings and printings, is a human process that has been well described. Although errors may have been introduced with every step, many of these can be identified and corrected. But because so much of the original manuscript has been permanently lost, many of these errors may never be identified. Once Professor Skousen completes and publishes his critical text, we may have the closest text possible to what Joseph Smith actually dictated to his scribes in 1829.<br><br>For the last half century, Hugh W. Nibley, now emeritus professor of ancient scripture at BYU, has been launching a barrage of insights into the complexities inherent in the text of the Book of Mormon, complexities that could not conceivably have been produced by Joseph Smith or his contemporaries, given the character of the translation process. Nibley pioneered what we might call the "argument from complexity." Melvin J. Thorne, executive editor for FARMS, has developed a helpful analysis of this argument and sets forth a number of examples in the forthcoming authorship volume. Other examples that have impressed me in my teaching of the book include:<br><br>• The book has three independent dating systems that are maintained accurately throughout. Different writers tracked time from the time Lehi left Jerusalem, from the initiation of the reign of the judges, or from the day the sign was given for the birth of Jesus Christ. Yet no confusion results, and dating sequences can always be reconstructed precisely.<br><br>• The Book of Mormon contains a complex system of religious teachings. These are presented in unique ways by different prophets in their own times and contexts. Lehi reports a vision of the tree of life. Nephi presents the gospel of Jesus Christ in conjunction with the vision of Christ's baptism. Jacob reports Zenos' allegory of the olive tree. Benjamin gives a great temple sermon. Alma teaches that the word of God is a seed that must be planted and nourished. Jesus gives the Nephites a modified version of his Sermon on the Mount. Each of these enrich understanding of the basic teachings; they never confuse them or contradict one another.<br><br>• The book's authors refer to a huge and complex set of source materials, including official records, sermons, letters, journals, monument inscriptions, church records, and ancient Israelite scriptures not known today. Yet these writers always manage to maintain a consistent relationship between the sources and the final text.<br><br>• Subtle and complex political traditions evolve early in the text and surface in a variety of forms in later sections, always plausibly and consistently. The complaints Laman and Lemuel raise against Nephi in their earliest murmuring evolve into a national ideology that is still being invoked 500 years later to justify Lamanite efforts to subjugate their Nephite brethren.<br><br>• The book describes various ebbs and flows of ethnic interaction without ever losing track of even the most minor groups.<br><br>• Hundreds of individual characters and place names are successfully introduced and tracked coherently.<br><br>• The geographical data provided in the text is diverse and complex, yet when carefully analyzed turns out to make perfect sense and to match an identifiable portion of Mesoamerica quite well.<br><br>Because much of the research we are describing can be used to defend the Book of Mormon against its critics, scholars interested in these polemics have occasionally gathered up some of these studies and recast them as refutations of criticisms. Daniel C. Peterson, professor of Arabic literature at BYU, has proved to be a master of Book of Mormon apologetics. He frequently takes the time to respond in detail to the seemingly endless stream of criticism coming from the more visible anti-Mormon sources. His effectiveness should not be underestimated. In addition to the evangelical response quoted at the beginning of this talk, we have a firsthand report that one of his most vocal targets recently told a small East Coast audience that it was no longer profitable to pursue these debates about the Book of Mormon and that Book of Mormon critics might do better by moving on to other things.<br><br>In one of his most recent forays, Peterson responded to the recurring ridicule that has been heaped on the Book of Mormon for prophesying that Jesus would be born in "the land of Jerusalem," without mentioning Bethlehem. In response, Brother Peterson and his associates have documented beyond any doubt that in ancient Israel, the term<i>land</i>was often used to indicate the rural area and villages associated with a larger city with the same name. Bethlehem is only five miles from Jerusalem and would certainly fall in its economic sphere as a smaller village at the time Christ was born. Furthermore, scholars have actually found ancient textual references to Bethlehem "in the land of Jerusalem."<br><br>Most thoughtful readers of the Book of Mormon have probably wondered at the large numbers of people that the text describes as having descended from the two or three dozen original settlers in the Lehite colony. Anti-Mormon critics of the book have seized on this as intuitively valid evidence for the book's fraudulence. James E. Smith, one of the chief architects of the Cambridge model, which is used widely by professional demographers for estimating historical populations, points out that population studies fail badly when they rely on intuition. In those cases where historical records can be most trusted, support is provided for this much less intuitive model of population growth and decline. Applying the Cambridge model to the Book of Mormon accounts, Smith finds the numbers reported in the text to be on the high end of what would be predicted scientifically but still within the range of plausibility. Relaxing any of his perhaps unduly conservative assumptions would move Book of Mormon numbers closer to the middle of the expected range. Most important, if the Nephites or Lamanites had absorbed any other unmentioned indigenous populations, the numbers reported in the text cease to be at all problematic.<br><br>One of the more perplexing aspects of the Book of Mormon has always been its emphasis on warfare. William J. Hamblin, associate professor of history at BYU, organized a scholarly symposium in which each participant focused on limited aspects of Book of Mormon warfare. The volume produced by that group demonstrated that in dozens of dimensions the assumptions and complex details of Book of Mormon warfare form patterns that are consistent with ancient as opposed to modern warfare, and specifically ancient Mesoamerican warfare. The text supports the idea that warfare was seasonal, suggesting a climate divided into wet and dry seasons. The histories suggest the possibility that, like many other ancient civilizations, the Nephites had a military caste whose role was to provide military leadership and knowledge of strategy and logistics. Most of the weapons mentioned in the Book of Mormon can be matched with ancient Mesoamerican implements of war. But Joseph Smith and his contemporaries could not have been expected to be aware of any of these features of ancient warfare.<br><br>In an important contribution to the first authorship volume, Wilfred C. Griggs, professor of ancient scripture at BYU, pointed out that over the centuries the scholarly world has developed an arsenal of effective tools for exposing forgeries claiming falsely to be ancient texts. Yet in all the literature attacking the Book of Mormon, its critics do not use these standard tools. The reason, Griggs suggests, is that every reasonable attempt to evaluate the Book of Mormon as an ancient text has so far yielded positive rather than negative results.<br><br>As a particular example, Griggs focuses on the Book of Mormon's account of the tree of life. Here is a dramatic and imaginative image, advanced boldly as an explanation for God's relationship to men here and hereafter. Is it modern or ancient? Griggs shows how this typology shows up in many forms in the ancient Near East, and especially in Egypt, in a time frame suggesting possible connections with Lehi. In many similar passages the Book of Mormon has all the earmarks of an ancient book and only appears modern on more superficial readings.<br><br>The Book of Mormon presents a very different problem for Joseph's detractors than does the First Vision. Visions are easy to deny. They have no secondary witnesses, nor do they leave obvious historical artifacts that require explanation. But the 1830 Book of Mormon contained 590 pages of text, the most important kind of evidence historians can find. The book exists; it must be explained--even explained away--if Joseph's prophetic powers are to be discounted. And so the critics have tried a variety of alternative explanations, which Louis C. Midgley, BYU professor emeritus of political science, ably surveys.<br><br>The first critics agreed with Joseph--he obviously was not the kind of man who could have written such a book. So they looked around for someone who could have done it. Sidney Rigdon and Solomon Spaulding were early candidates, but neither can be plausibly defended as the book's author. They were not even in the neighborhood. Later critics invoked epilepsy and other forms of psychological abnormality to explain Joseph's seemingly miraculous achievement--without noticing that there is no evidence for such abnormalities in Joseph's life. Nor are there any documented examples of such abnormalities ever contributing to the writing of such a complex book.<br><br>Some critics assumed that Joseph was a conscious fraud, but even this fails to explain how this highly complex work could have been produced by a man with so little knowledge of the world and its literature.<br><br>In 1945 Fawn M. Brodie attempted a supposedly gentler explanation, arguing that although Joseph's religious career began fraudulently, he gradually came to believe his own lies. Brodie was trying to make plain what many liberal Mormons were saying less publicly. But this did not solve any problems for the critics, and it provoked the young Hugh Nibley and others to do the scholarly work that exposed the weaknesses of her logic and evidence.<br><br>More recently a few historians who have trouble accepting Joseph's account--mostly because they do not believe in angels who can bring gold plates--have argued for some kind of middle ground that would accept the religious value of the Book of Mormon but explain its origins as a product of 19th-century frontier culture. Midgley chronicles, evaluates, and criticizes all these approaches, documenting their meanderings, contradictions, and other shortcomings. He notes the recurring cycles in these explanations and their failure to take into account most of the recent research on the text of the Book of Mormon itself. He concludes that none of these alternative theories of Book of Mormon origins accounts for the facts of the case nearly as well as the original account given by Joseph Smith and the other witnesses.<br><br>Among the clearest internal evidences of the Book of Mormon's ancient origins are the large number of characteristically Hebrew literary structures. John W. Welch, professor of law at BYU, first discovered the chiastic features of the text as a missionary in the 1960s. In a series of publications, he has developed the study of chiasmus as a structural device found in the Book of Mormon, the Bible, and in other ancient literature of Middle Eastern origins. Chiasmus is one of the more complex forms of parallelism and is distinctive in that the repeated forms occur in reverse order. In summarizing the evidentiary value of chiasmus today, Welch finds it stands stronger than ever as clear evidence of a tradition of writing that understood and valued this particular literary structure for its aesthetics and its power to communicate at multiple levels simultaneously. There is no better explanation for the extensive occurrence of high-quality chiasms in the Book of Mormon than its ancient origins in a biblical tradition. At the time the Book of Mormon was published, no living scholar knew about chiasmus or knew that any book claiming ancient Hebrew origins should contain examples of this literary device. It was only later in the 19th century that biblical chiasmus was fully recognized and described to the scholarly world.<br><br>Jack Welch has completed many other Book of Mormon studies that could be described in this kind of presentation. He may well be the most productive Book of Mormon researcher of recent decades. For example, he has documented the presence of many forms and elements of ancient Near Eastern law in the Book of Mormon text.<br><br>Welch has also demonstrated a striking set of parallels between the Narrative of Zosimus, an early Christian text with earlier Hebrew origins, and Lehi's account in the Book of Mormon. Although no one has been able to explain what the connection between these documents might be, the clear suggestion is that their origins must be of equally ancient date.<br><br>Several years ago Donald W. Parry produced<i>The Book of Mormon Text Reformatted According to Parallelistic Patterns,</i>showing Book of Mormon readers how extensive the use of parallelisms are in that text. Parry has identified Book of Mormon examples of most biblical forms of parallelism. In the forthcoming authorship volume he documents three specific parallelistic patterns in their Book of Mormon exemplifications--climactic forms, synonymous parallelisms, and alternating parallel lines. Parry provides helpful explanations of these poetic and rhetorical structures, which are richly illustrated with clear examples from the text of the Book of Mormon.<br><br>Parry points to the simple example of climactic parallelism that occurs in Mormon 9:12–13. Notice as I read this how four key words or phrases are repeated, creating parallelistic structures, and the whole passage progresses quickly to a climax, starting with the Creation and ending with man's return to the presence of the Lord:<br><br>Behold, he created<br><br>(1)<i>Adam,</i>and by<br><br><i>Adam</i>came<br><br>(2)<i>the fall of man.</i>And because of<br><br><i>the fall of man</i>came<br><br>(3)<i>Jesus Christ,</i>even the Father and the Son; and because of<br><br><i>Jesus Christ</i>came the<br><br>(4)<i>redemption of man.</i>And because of the<br><br><i>redemption of man,</i>which came by Jesus Christ,<br><br>they are brought back into his presence.<br><br>Not only does the recognition of parallelistic structures enrich our reading of the Book of Mormon, it also constitutes one more impressive challenge to Book of Mormon critics. In addition to explaining how Joseph Smith could have written the book, they now must explain how he could have silently introduced such beautiful examples of Hebrew poetic structures.<br><br>John A. Tvedtnes recently offered an original analysis of another impressive Book of Mormon complexity. Taking his cue from Paul's conversion accounts as related variously in several New Testament passages, Tvedtnes focuses on Alma's accounts of his own conversion experience and its retellings in different Book of Mormon contexts. Through careful analysis of each of these passages, Tvedtnes shows us the rich emotional content of Alma's memory, as well as the doctrinal implications Alma has drawn from the experience and how these recurred to him and developed in each retelling. Building on this analysis, Tvedtnes is also able to show that each of these passages is actually being quoted by Mormon from the original record, rather than being reported in third-person format. Finally, Tvedtnes details the ways in which each of the retellings is unique and yet helpfully elaborates the others with additional information. Taken as a whole, they are consistent, different in detail, and highly reinforcing of one another. Given the translation process, this is again a seemingly impossible achievement if Joseph or anyone besides Alma himself was composing these widely separated passages.<br><br>In the 1982 authorship volume, Wayne A. Larsen and Alvin C. Rencher, BYU professors of statistics, presented the first comprehensive statistical wordprint study of the Book of Mormon. Using computerized text and powerful statistical techniques, they were able to establish that the different sections of the Book of Mormon were authored by different people and that none was authored by Joseph Smith, Sidney Rigdon, Oliver Cowdery, or other 19th-century candidates put forth by Book of Mormon critics.<br><br>Applied physicist John L. Hilton and five of his fellow scientists in the Bay Area (three of them non-LDS) repeated that study using a wholly different and more conservative form of wordprinting analysis. Again, different authors were detected, and none corresponded to the 19th-century candidates. Also, in retirement as an adjunct professor of statistics at BYU, Hilton has used his techniques to identify anonymous writings of the 17th-century philosopher Thomas Hobbes to show which of Francis Bacon's works were authored chiefly by his staff of secretaries. Hilton even used these same techniques to help the FBI identify possible authors of the Unabomber's Manifesto.<br><br>Geographical speculations have fascinated Book of Mormon readers from the earliest years. If the book is a true ancient record, the Nephites lived somewhere in real time and space and in a real historical and cultural context. The history of Book of Mormon studies has always featured vigorous efforts to identify that geographical and cultural context during Nephite times (600 b.c.–421 c.e.). Two distinct geographical contexts are featured in the Nephite portion of the record. The first is the journey from Jerusalem across the Arabian peninsula. The second is the promised land itself, where Lehi's descendants dwelled for a thousand years. I will deal with these in reverse order.<br><br>John L. Sorenson has identified and collected more than 70 competing geographical theories that have been advanced for Nephite lands. His own careful analysis has shown us that, although the text itself presents an internally coherent and consistent geography, many of the assumptions Mormons and others have made about that geography since 1830 cannot be correct. For example, his careful analysis of the text shows us that the entire Nephite saga played out in a limited area probably less than 500 miles in diameter. Further, the usual LDS assumption that the New York hill where Moroni buried the gold plates was the same as the Book of Mormon's Hill Cumorah, where Mormon had his great records repository, doesn't work very well. The text shows that Mormon's Hill Cumorah was only a few hundred miles from Zarahemla. And Moroni had custody of the plates for 36 years after he fled from the conquering Lamanites at Cumorah before he buried them in New York. Anti-Mormons have complained vigorously against Sorenson's limited geography and want to insist that Latter-day Saints are officially committed to other traditional theories--which are much easier for them to refute.<br><br>The most useful critique of the many geographies that have been advanced for Nephite lands was offered some years ago by John Clark, professor of anthropology at BYU. Clark prepared several maps to demonstrate the basic relationships existing between certain Book of Mormon sites that any geography based on the text must exhibit. Anyone attempting to solve the geographical puzzle must minimally meet the criteria that Clark has summarized from the text itself. To ignore these, as most such theories do to one extent or another, is to fail to fully accept the text.<br><br>Although there has been less scholarly discussion of the journey of Lehi's company through the Arabian peninsula, we may now be much more confident of knowing approximate or even precise locations where some Book of Mormon events occurred there. Warren P. Aston, an Australian travel agent, and various associates over the last decade have used the text of the Book of Mormon and the historical and scientific knowledge available for that part of the world to identify sites that seem to fit completely and uniquely with those described in 1 Nephi.<br><br>Following an old suggestion from Ross Christensen, Aston has demonstrated that the Book of Mormon Nahom, where Ishmael was buried and the company turned due east, corresponds quite naturally with modern Nehem, the only site in the Middle East bearing this name. Aston has demonstrated that this name has been associated with that area for at least 1,500 years. It is located very close to the main junction of ancient frankincense trails in northern Yemen, where those trails veer to the east. Though this site was never a city, it features large numbers of ancient burials that go back to the time of Lehi and beyond.<br><br>Equally tantalizing is the textual description of Bountiful, the seashore site where Lehi's party camped three or more years while building the ship on which they crossed the Pacific Ocean. The text mentions almost a dozen facts about that area, most of which seemed impossible, given the early 19th-century understanding of the Arabian coastline.<br><br>Again, Aston has identified one site on the southern coastline of Oman that appears to meet all of the textual requirements for Bountiful. Wadi Sayq lies almost due east from Nehem. It is accessible from the inland plateau, but only after passing through a long and rugged wilderness. It is naturally fertile, being watered liberally five months of the year by monsoons that come off the Indian Ocean and park on its shore, penetrating a mile or so up the wadi. This area once featured forests with trees suitable for building ships, as is demonstrated by the shipbuilding reputation of the ancient Omani seafarers. Readily available iron has been located in small deposits within the area, which the Lord could have shown Nephi so he could obtain metal to make tools.<br><br>The site features an obvious mountain or mount. Nephi twice mentions the mount where he frequently resorted to pray. Water from natural springs is available year-round. Until this century there was an inlet suitable for launching ocean craft. It was used in Islamic times as a small port, as is evidenced by its Arabic name, Khor Kharfot (or Port Fort). This inlet and others on this coastline have been blocked by the beach since the rivers of Oman dried up sometime within the last century.<br><br>At the west end of the beach are the ruins of about eight small buildings and a surrounding wall that are estimated to date to the first or second millennium b.c. These ancient dwellings were positioned immediately above 200-foot cliffs, from which a troublesome brother could readily be thrown to his death in the rocks and waves below. No other site on this coastline meets all these criteria. Book of Mormon critics have long insisted that no site ever would. Only someone who had been to this unique place in ancient times could have described it in such precise detail as did Nephi in 1 Nephi 17.<br><br>The kinds of evidences that I have reviewed here represent only a small fraction of the research results coming forth from a large number of scholars. This sampling should be adequate to show that the most reasonable explanation for the Book of Mormon is that it is just what it claims to be. It is a record of Hebrew émigrés who left Jerusalem and found their way to the New World, where their descendants lived for more than a thousand years before losing their tradition of prophecy and record keeping. That evidence should give critics pause, and it should encourage young Latter-day Saints whose testimonies might be fragile or wavering in the face of concerted attacks from anti-Mormons or liberal doubters. Finally, all who have firm testimonies of the veracity of the Book of Mormon know that such knowledge is a gift from God that comes after study and prayer. The scholarly studies can help us in many ways, but they do not establish testimony, which is a form of spiritual knowledge. I want you to know that my testimony of the Book of Mormon is precious to me. I am so grateful for the knowledge that it contains the writings of ancient prophets of God, that its pages contain the gospel of Jesus Christ taught in its plainness, and that its witness of Jesus Christ is true. I am delighted to be able to share that testimony with you. I say this in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Noel B.

<h1>n the Lord with All Thine Heart” - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I had been a missionary in Taiwan less than a month when my companion and I decided to go to the National Palace Museum on preparation day. While waiting at the bus stop, surrounded by a sea of people with black hair and dark eyes, I noticed an older Caucasian woman approach. What immediately caught my attention was that she simply radiated tranquility, serenity, and peace. She came to where my companion and I were standing, recognized from our name tags that we were missionaries, and began to chat.<br><br>The woman told us that she, too, was a missionary. In fact, she and her husband had been missionaries for a small Christian sect most of their lives. We boarded the bus and found seats together so we could continue our conversation. The woman related that she and her husband had been missionaries in mainland China during the Japanese invasion and occupation. They had been captured and held in a prisoner of war camp for five years. She described some of the conditions and their treatment in the camp. To say that those five years were difficult, even horrible, would be an understatement. One of the many stories she recounted was about the year her husband wanted to give her a special gift for Christmas. He took the rubber heel off his shoe and carefully scraped it on a stone until it became a makeshift rubber spatula for her to use in her cooking duties in the camp.<br><br>At the end of a most fascinating bus ride, it was time for us to part company. After describing a five-year ordeal that I could scarcely imagine, this beautiful, serene woman said, "You know, I wouldn't have chosen all of the experiences I've had, but I wouldn't trade any of them now."<br><br>I've thought about that statement often over the years--"I wouldn't have chosen all of the experiences I've had, but I wouldn't trade any of them now"--and I've wondered what allows someone to drink from a bitter cup without becoming bitter.<br><br>I really don't want to catalog all of the bitter cups from which it is possible to drink, but it is probably safe to say that between ill health and accidents, natural disasters, social and interpersonal challenges, family concerns, financial setbacks, disappointments, and unrealized dreams, few people have difficulty identifying an experience they would not have chosen.<br><br>The common denominator in those unsolicited but apparently mandatory experiences is that they are painful--sometimes abominably so. Since humans dislike pain, no mentally stable person actively seeks out painful experiences. Like a child who would gladly trade all of her spinach for more dessert, we would try to subsist on the sweet moments in life--forgoing the more nourishing, if occasionally less pleasing, courses. However, difficulties come into our lives unbidden, and we are left to respond to them.<br><br>So, what differentiates those who emerge from their bitter experiences bitter from those who become better? As I have observed my own life, the lives of others, and the counsel from the scriptures, I believe the key to being bettered--not broken--by our experiences, is trusting the Lord. Proverbs 3:5 counsels us to "trust in the Lord with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding." That is such vital counsel, because our own understanding is so incredibly limited by our mortality. I have to admit that whenever I read in Isaiah "For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, saith the Lord" (55:8), my first reaction is, "Boy, I'll say!" In my less humble moments, I'm quite sure that if the Lord had my unique insights into some situations, he would handle them entirely differently.<br><br>Many times, if I had had the power, I would have happily upset the cosmic applecart to spare myself and others pain. I've seen my sister widowed with three small children at age 27. A serious fall caused my mother brain damage that left her, thankfully, with wits intact but with her independence diminished. I've had friends deal with cancer, the effects of abused childhoods, the infidelity of spouses, and the loss of dreams. And I have wanted to change all of that. But, you see, that's when I'm leaning unto my own understanding and not trusting in the Lord.<br><br>Trust in the Lord leads to a more mature perspective. Implicit in the instruction to lean not unto our own understanding is the possibility that we will never, in this sphere, possess the full perspective of eternity. With trust, however, we may be willing to acknowledge that there<i>is</i>another, more accurate, perspective. Trust allows us to believe that what we're undergoing may, in fact, "give [us] experience, and shall be for [our] good" (D&amp;amp;C 122:7), rather than being detrimental.<br><br>I have come to appreciate this aspect of painful experiences because of the academic setting. As the director of the dietetics program, one of my responsibilities, along with the other dietetics faculty, is to establish the curriculum. We can do this because we are dietitians. We've done what it takes to become dietitians, we have had considerable practice as dietitians, and we constantly keep an eye on what it will take to practice as dietitians in the future. In our curriculum not one course or assignment is included capriciously--everything is carefully calculated to build the knowledge base and skills required to become a successful dietitian.<br><br>Do my students recognize this carefully crafted curriculum and appreciate every opportunity they have to grow and develop? Of course not! Like most students, they wonder what on earth this or that course has to do with anything; they find some assignments far more challenging than they expected and some experiences far more tedious--<i>until</i>they become dietitians. Then I get a surprising number of letters saying how valuable certain courses or exercises proved to be.<br><br>When I dislike one of the required courses in the celestial curriculum, or feel some of the assignments are unfair or too difficult, I remember the author of the curriculum. His stated purpose is "to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man" (Moses 1:39). He, with far more love, wisdom, and perfection than any mortal curriculum planner, crafts the earthly course of study that is calculated to turn us toward him and our heavenly home. From the eternal viewpoint, nothing in the plan is capricious or cruel. It is my limited understanding, not God's, that makes it sometimes seem so. Now we may question the necessity of this assignment or that lesson or wonder about the relevance of various parts of the curriculum. Eventually we, like my students, come to the end of the curriculum; that is, we will live the type of life that God lives. Do you suppose we will then be saying thank-you, acknowledging the value of those very disliked exercises?<br><br>Trust and humility seem very closely related as we accept the Lord's tutelage. Mosiah 3:19 contains some sobering counsel:<br><br><i>For the natural man is an enemy to God, and has been from the fall of Adam, and will be, forever and ever, unless he yields to the enticings of the Holy Spirit, and putteth off the natural man and becometh a saint through the atonement of Christ the Lord, and becometh as a child, submissive, meek, humble, patient, full of love, willing to submit to all things which the Lord seeth fit to inflict upon him, even as a child doth submit to his father.</i><br><br>This tells me that, far from being a passive approach, trust involves very active decision making and the putting off of natural tendencies.<br><br>If we trust the Lord, we can recognize a purpose in our painful, inflicted experiences--even if we don't like them. In the book<i>Simple Abundance,</i>Sarah Ban Breathnach states:<br><br><i>As I look at the roses . . . , I realize that pruning is necessary for complete growth. So, I have come to realize, is a certain amount of pain in our lives. Pain prunes the unessential emotions, ambitions, and illusions, teaching us the lessons we either consciously or unconsciously refuse to be taught by joy. Pain prunes the insignificant details that distract us from what is really important.</i>[Sarah Ban Breathnach,<i>Simple Abundance: A Daybook of Comfort and Joy</i>(New York: Warner Books, Inc., 1995), June 29]<br><br>What is really important, of course, are those virtues necessary to reenter God's presence. Elder Neal A. Maxwell spoke about acquiring virtues in a fireside address given at BYU in March 1991. Using another academic analogy, he said:<br><br><i>Given the tremendous importance of these virtues now and in the world to come, should we be surprised if, to hasten the process, the Lord gives us, individually, the relevant and necessary clinical experiences? We do not usually seek these, however. Yet they seem to come, don't they, even when we do not remember having signed up for a particular course? Sometimes we find ourselves enrolled again in the same course. Apparently we were only auditing before; perhaps this time it can be for credit!</i>["In Him All Things Hold Together,"<i>BYU 1990–91 Devotional and Fireside Speeches</i>(Provo: Brigham Young University, 1991), pp. 106–7]<br><br>Trust in the Lord helps us know that asking "Why me?" in our times of pain is the wrong question. After all, why<i>not</i>me? Instead, we learn to ask, "What wouldst thou have me learn from this?" If we are willing to accept that the Lord's view of what we can become is both loftier and clearer than our own view, we may recognize the compensatory blessings, even prizes, that come with struggles. President Ezra Taft Benson said:<br><br><i>Men and women who turn their lives over to God will discover that He can make a lot more out of their lives than they can. He will deepen their joys, expand their vision, quicken their minds, strengthen their muscles, lift their spirits, multiply their blessings, increase their opportunities, comfort their souls, raise up friends, and pour out peace.</i>[From First Presidency Christmas devotional, 7 December 1986, in "President Benson Suggests Gifts of Service, Obedience to the Savior,"<i>Ensign,</i>March 1987, p. 76]<br><br>In the previously mentioned fireside address, Elder Maxwell stated, "The Lord loves each of us too much to merely let us go on being what we now are, for he knows what we have the possibility to become!" (Maxwell, "In Him All Things," p. 107). Though I sometimes balk and insist that I don't<i>want</i>to be good at whatever a particular experience is teaching me, I have to confess that myriad great blessings in my life have come from totally unwanted experiences. When I stop fussing and start trusting, the blessings come. I even have a greeting card that captures this phenomenon. It says, "You are the answer to my prayers. You're not what I prayed for, exactly, but apparently you're the answer."<br><br>I don't know why some of the lessons are lengthy and some are relatively short, but I do know that our natural tendency is to want the lesson over quickly. The time dimension of trials is strictly mortal. Again, from another perspective, they are "but a small moment" (D&amp;amp;C 121:7). Nonetheless, we are mortal, and time does weigh heavily upon us. You remember the persecution of the people of Alma recorded in Mosiah 24. When Amulon "put tasks upon them, and put taskmasters over them," their afflictions were great, and they began to "cry mightily to God" (verses 9–10). My suspicion is that their prayers dealt, as most of ours would, with removing the burdens from their backs. Instead, the Lord answered their prayers this way:<br><br><i>And I will . . . ease the burdens which are put upon your shoulders, that even you cannot feel them upon your backs, even while you are in bondage; and this will I do that ye may stand as witnesses for me hereafter, and that ye may know of a surety that I, the Lord God, do visit my people in their afflictions.</i><br><br><i>And now it came to pass that the burdens which were laid upon Alma and his brethren were made light; yea, the Lord did strengthen them that they could bear up their burdens with ease, and they did submit cheerfully and with patience to all the will of the Lord.</i>[Mosiah 24:14–15]<br><br>Later, when the people had adequately demonstrated their faith and patience, they were blessed with a truly miraculous escape from their bondage. Thus they fulfilled the intended purpose of standing as witnesses of the Lord's wisdom and succor in time of affliction. The message here is to pray not for a light burden but for a strong back, then bear witness of the strengthening power of the Lord.<br><br>It is easy to overlook the "bearing witness" aspect of trials. I'm not talking about telling and retelling our harrowing tales to any and all who will listen. I mean that we may use the overcoming of our trials and the learning we glean from the process to buoy and help others going through similar experiences. When so moved by the Spirit, we may testify to the grace and power of the Lord in confronting and conquering challenges. Our increased strength, compassion, or insight could be most helpful to someone else. I have frequently been encouraged by the testimony of others--publicly or privately given--when facing my own unwanted experiences. Talking to the woman on the bus in Taiwan so early in my mission helped me keep a lot of the uncomfortable aspects of missionary service in proper perspective.<br><br>Trust in the Lord allows us, at some point, to recognize and appreciate patterns in our lives. Jan Struther wrote<i>Mrs. Miniver</i>as a series of vignettes in the London<i>Times</i>shortly after the outbreak of World War II. The most striking feature of her fictional heroine, Mrs. Miniver, was her ability to cope with her circumstances and find joy in the ordinary. In one vignette, Mrs. Miniver has been going through one of life's dreary cycles, full of accumulated small annoyances. She has an appointment with a friend but is left for a while waiting in his office.<br><br><i>Her gaze wandered to the floor. The hearthrug was an old Khelim strip, threadbare but still glowing. Its border was made up of a row of small lozenges, joined by their acute angles. Beginning on the extreme left, she let her eye run idly along this row, naming the colours to herself as she came to them.</i>Blue, purple, red. Blue, purple, re--<i>but here she was checked, for the second red was different from the first. So she had to begin again.</i>Blue, purple, scarlet. Blue, purple, crimson. Blue, purple, sc--<i>but here was yet a third red, which made the first one look almost orange.</i>Blue, purple, flame,<i>then.</i>Blue, purple, crimson. Blue, purple, scarlet. . . .<br><br>Mrs. Miniver continued her observation:<br><br><i>This, it occurred to her, is one of the things that make life so difficult. The linked experiences of which it is composed appear to you one at a time; it is therefore impossible to gauge their relative significance. In how much detail ought you to notice each one before it slips into the past? Will "red" do, or must you cudgel your brains for a more exact description . . . ? This grief, that joy, this interview, that relationship, this motor-smash, that picnic--can you weigh it up once for all and assign to it a fixed position in your scale of memories, or will you sooner or later be forced to take it out again and reclassify it?</i>[Jan Struther,<i>Mrs. Miniver</i>(New York: Harcourt, Brace and Company, 1942), pp. 222–24; emphasis in original]<br><br>Because we do receive our experiences one at a time, it is often hard to identify the pattern. Frequently one experience or set of circumstances prepares us to deal with a subsequent occurrence. In a beautiful choreography, barely noticed at the time, we gain skills, attitudes, and attributes from both our pleasant and unwanted experiences. These are later put to use in overcoming a new obstacle or in rendering capable service. Because we are in the hands of a very skilled patternmaker, we won't be disappointed with the completed design when we finally see it in its entirety.<br><br>Another blessing that comes from trusting in the Lord is the ability to forgive and let go. Some of our difficult experiences are the result of other people's actions, choices, or conditions. These, whether intentional or not, contribute to our suffering. One of the surest ways to be enveloped in bitterness is to nurture grudges, anger, and resentment--whether directed at other people or at God. Truly trusting the Lord frees us from having to keep score, because the Lord does the only scoring that matters.<br><br>My favorite fictional depiction of the damaging effects of holding onto hurts is Guy de Maupassant's short story "A Piece of String." The story begins on market day, with peasants carrying or leading their wares along the roads leading to Goderville.<br><br><i>Maître Hauchecome, of Breaute, had just arrived at Goderville, and he was directing his steps toward the public square, when he perceived upon the ground a little piece of string. Maître Hauchecome, economical like a true Norman, thought that everything useful ought to be picked up, and he bent painfully, for he suffered from rheumatism. He took the bit of thin cord from the ground and began to roll it carefully when he noticed Maître Malandain, the harness-maker, on the threshold of his door, looking at him. They had heretofore had business together on the subject of a halter, and they were on bad terms, being both good haters. Maître Hauchecome was seized with a sort of shame to be seen thus by his enemy, picking a bit of string out of the dirt. He concealed his "find" quickly under his blouse, then in his trousers' pocket; then he pretended to be still looking on the ground for something which he did not find.</i>[Guy de Maupassant, "A Piece of String,"<i>The Necklace and Other Short Stories</i>(New York: Dover Publications, Inc., 1992), p. 39]<br><br>The events of the market day came to an end, and many of the people were eating supper at an inn when the public crier announced that a man had lost a black pocketbook containing 500 francs and some papers on the road that morning. Soon a police officer came to the inn and asked for Maître Hauchecome. He was taken to the mayor, who told him he was seen that morning picking up the missing pocketbook. Hauchecome was astonished and asked who had seen him--it was Malandain.<br><br>"'Ah, he saw me, the clodhopper, he saw me pick up this string, here. . . .' And rummaging in his pocket he drew out the little piece of string" (p. 41).<br><br>He was not believed, and the news quickly spread. Everywhere he went people teased or chided him about the string. He told and retold his story. He could not sleep. He was "stricken to the heart by the injustice of the suspicion." He told his story some more, "his whole mind given up to the story of the string."<br><br><i>Toward the end of December he took to his bed.</i><br><br><i>He died in the first days of January, and in the delirium of his death struggles he kept claiming his innocence, reiterating:</i><br><br><i>"A piece of string, a piece of string,--look--here it is."</i>[p. 43]<br><br>Contrast that with the story of Joseph. In a rather extreme example of sibling rivalry, Joseph's older brothers sold him to some traveling merchants. They then deceived their father into thinking Joseph had been killed by a wild beast. Meanwhile, the merchants sold Joseph to Potiphar in Egypt. You know the rest of the story. Years later the brothers are sent to Egypt to buy grain because of a famine in their land. After some masquerading, Joseph can no longer restrain himself and reveals his identity to his brothers. He forgives them completely and says:<br><br><i>Be not grieved, nor angry with yourselves, that ye sold me hither: for God did send me before you to preserve life. . . .</i><br><br><i>And God sent me before you to preserve you a posterity in the earth, and to save your lives by a great deliverance.</i>[Genesis 45:5, 7]<br><br>Joseph's trust in the Lord let him see a pattern in his experiences that was probably not evident when he was in the pit waiting to be sold. It also allowed him to hold no ill will and to forgive his brothers freely. Think how the very course of history would have been different if that great progenitor had spent his time harboring resentment and a spirit of revenge. There is no doubt Joseph would rather have been the favored son at home than a slave in Pharaoh's court, but he trusted that good could come from his plight. He rose to a position of power, thereby fulfilling the patternmaker's design in rescuing a nation of his people.<br><br>Trust in the Lord permits one to approach life with a sense of good humor--not to be confused with a good sense of humor. I like how good humor is described in Proverbs: "A merry heart maketh a cheerful countenance. It doeth good like medicine and is a continual feast" (see Proverbs 15:13, 15; 17:22). Good humor lets us take our situation seriously but ourselves lightly. After all, if you can keep your head while all about you are losing theirs, you obviously don't understand the situation!<br><br>I'm not suggesting for a moment that we relish our trials. In the April 1997 general conference, Elder Neal A. Maxwell stated, "There are variations in our trials but no immunities." He then said that with the grace of the Lord individuals do "emerge successfully from their varied and fiery furnaces. . . . Even so, . . . such emerging individuals do not rush to line up in front of another fiery furnace in order to get an extra turn!" ("From Whom All Blessings Flow,"<i>Ensign,</i>May 1997, pp. 11–12).<br><br>We are given the admonition to "be of good cheer" at least 14 times in the scriptures. To be given that counsel in the face of unpleasant circumstances must mean that we have some control over our responses to those circumstances. As Goethe suggested, "In all things it is better to hope than to despair."<br><br>The first time I truly realized how much we control our view of circumstances was while on my mission. One night I was writing in my journal when my companion came into the room. She said, "I just hate to write in my journal."<br><br>Well, to be honest, I don't particularly like the physical act of picking up a pen and writing in my journal, so I thought that's what she was talking about. I replied, "I know what you mean. What don't you like about it?"<br><br>To this she responded, "Nothing good ever happens to me."<br><br>I nearly fell off of my chair. If you have been on a mission or know anyone who has, you know that companions are like conjoined twins all of their waking hours. Nothing happens to one that doesn't happen to the other. I was literally filling my journal with interesting, spiritual, even exciting events, and she, who had witnessed or experienced all of the same events, felt that nothing good ever happened to her. I was astounded, and saddened.<br><br>If negative responses are a habit for you, change the habit. It will be as difficult, but as possible, as changing any other habit. You may not be able to change the direction of the wind, but you surely can adjust your sails. The good-cheer habit doesn't eliminate the unpleasant events from our lives, but it makes us a lot more pleasant to be around while we're going through them. That, in turn, helps others to be more supportive of us.<br><br>Finally, trust in the Lord enables us to fully savor the Savior's sweet redeeming love. His atoning sacrifice involved more than saving us from our sins. Alma 7:11–12 describes part of Christ's mission this way:<br><br><i>And he shall go forth, suffering pains and afflictions and temptations of every kind; and this that the word might be fulfilled which saith he will take upon him the pains and the sicknesses of his people.</i><br><br>Did you hear that? In addition to saving us from death and the damning effects of transgressions, he will take upon him<i>our</i>pains and<i>our</i>sicknesses.<br><br><i>And he will take upon him death, that he may loose the bands of death which bind his people; and he will take upon him their infirmities, that his bowels may be filled with mercy, according to the flesh, that he may know according to the flesh how to succor his people according to their infirmities.</i><br><br>We will never surprise the Lord with a new and improved kind of suffering. Nothing we will ever suffer is unknown to the Lord, who descended below all things that he might lift us up. The bitter heart is impervious to the Lord's tender mercies. The humble, trusting heart can be bathed in the sweet healing balm that only Christ can administer. And that succoring is immediately available; we don't have to wait until the Judgment Day to receive it.<br><br>In Taiwan I observed peaceful tranquility on the face of a woman who had endured much. That same tranquility can be ours if we trust in the Lord. I testify that the healing balm of the Savior will help those who trust him overcome every trial. One day those experiences we wouldn't have chosen will become to us gems of instruction in the pattern of our eternal lives. May we learn to trust, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Nora Kay Nyland was a BYU professor of food science and nutrition when this devotional address was given on 3 June 1997.</i><br><br><i>© Brigham Young University.

<br>
My brothers and sisters, I am both honored and humbled by the invitation to speak to the BYU community in a devotional assembly. I appreciate this opportunity to bear my witness of the divinity of the Lord Jesus Christ and the reality of the restoration of his gospel.<br><br>The 27th of this month will mark the anniversary of the martyrdom of the Prophet of the Restoration. The day will pass quietly, but the impact of his ministry continues to be felt throughout the world. Each member of the Church, as a product of the Restoration, is a benefactor of his sacrifice, and we reverence Joseph Smith for the great work he brought to pass as the Lord's prophet. As John Taylor wrote:<br><br><i>Joseph Smith, the Prophet and Seer of the Lord, has done more, save Jesus only, for the salvation of men in this world, than any other man that ever lived in it. In the short space of twenty years, he has brought forth the Book of Mormon, which he translated by the gift and power of God, and has been the means of publishing it on two continents; has sent the fulness of the everlasting gospel, which it contained, to the four quarters of the earth.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 135:3]<br><br>Relative to the translation of the Book of Mormon, in section 20 of the Doctrine and Covenants, the Lord said:<br><br><i>Commandments were given to Joseph Smith, Jun., who was called of God, and ordained an apostle of Jesus Christ, to be the first elder of this church....</i><br><br><i>And gave unto him commandments which inspired him;</i><br><br><i>And gave him power from on high, by the means which were before prepared, to translate the Book of Mormon;</i><br><br><i>Which contains a record of a fallen people, and the fulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ to the Gentiles and to the Jews also;</i><br><br><i>Which was given by inspiration, and is confirmed to others by the ministering of angels, and is declared unto the world by them--</i><br><br><i>Proving to the world that the holy scriptures are true, and that God does inspire men and call them to his holy work in this age and generation, as well as in generations of old;</i><br><br><i>Thereby showing that he is the same God yesterday, today, and forever.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 20:2, 7–12]<br><br>Included in the introduction to the Book of Mormon is this statement by Joseph Smith:<br><br><i>I told the brethren that the Book of Mormon was the most correct of any book on earth, and the keystone of our religion, and a man would get nearer to God by abiding by its precepts, than by any other book.</i>[Book of Mormon, Introduction; also<i>HC</i>4:461]<br><br>In my own reading of this "most correct book," I have been impressed with the understanding and great strength of the prophets of Book of Mormon times. I have many heroes who come from the ranks of these prophetic authors. One time, at a missionary zone conference, I was discussing the various Book of Mormon prophets and commented that as they came to the close of their ministries, "they gave it their best shot."<br><br>For the remainder of my remarks, I would like to examine some of these "best shots" given to us by means of the translation of this marvelous book by Joseph Smith. I cannot be exhaustive, of course, and may miss citing some of your favorite passages.<br><br>It is interesting that for years the Book of Mormon was introduced by missionaries to their investigators with little more than a reference to Moroni's promise. Currently, reading passages from the Book of Mormon is standard practice, and this book has become one of the great missionary tools of the Church.<br><br>We speak often about the gospel of Jesus Christ and how it provides meaning to our lives. Nephi had a clear vision of the plan of salvation and the doctrine of Christ and felt an urgency to ensure that his audience did not have a fragmentary understanding. He wrote:<br><br><i>And now I, Nephi, make an end of my prophesying unto you, my beloved brethren. And I cannot write but a few things, which I know must surely come to pass....</i><br><br><i>Wherefore, the things which I have written sufficeth me, save it be a few words which I must speak concerning the doctrine of Christ; wherefore, I shall speak unto you plainly, according to the plainness of my prophesying.</i>[2 Nephi 31:1–2]<br><br>In the next verses Nephi details the doctrine or gospel of Christ in plainness five times. In one version he wrote:<br><br><i>Wherefore, my beloved brethren, can we follow Jesus save we shall be willing to keep the commandments of the Father?</i><br><br><i>And the Father said: Repent ye, repent ye, and be baptized in the name of my Beloved Son.</i><br><br><i>And also, the voice of the Son came unto me, saying: He that is baptized in my name, to him will the Father give the Holy Ghost, like unto me; wherefore, follow me, and do the things which ye have seen me do.</i><br><br><i>Wherefore, my beloved brethren, I know that if ye shall follow the Son, with full purpose of heart, acting no hypocrisy and no deception before God, but with real intent, repenting of your sins, witnessing unto the Father that ye are willing to take upon you the name of Christ, by baptism--yea, by following your Lord and your Savior down into the water, according to his word, behold, then shall ye receive the Holy Ghost; yea, then cometh the baptism of fire and of the Holy Ghost.</i>[2 Nephi 31:10–13]<br><br>He states further:<br><br><i>And now, my beloved brethren, I know by this that unless a man shall endure to the end, in following the example of the Son of the living God, he cannot be saved....</i><br><br><i>And now, behold, my beloved brethren, this is the way; and there is none other way nor name given under heaven whereby man can be saved in the kingdom of God. And now, behold, this is the doctrine of Christ, and the only and true doctrine of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.</i>[2 Nephi 31:16, 21]<br><br>The doctrine of Christ in its simplicity is to be baptized by water and by fire and the Holy Ghost and to endure to the end. Nephi clearly wanted us to understand the importance of following Christ into the waters of baptism that we may be cleansed by the baptism of fire and of the Holy Ghost. Concerning enduring to the end, Elder Hartman Rector, Jr., while touring our mission, said that enduring to the end has three dimensions: (1) repent continually; (2) forgive others; and (3) be nice. Because of a busy schedule, we didn't have the opportunity to discuss what being nice entails, and I can only speculate what it might be, but I assume that being nice encompasses all of the commandments. Perhaps it is as the Lord has counseled us to be: loving, gentle, meek, long-suffering, and free of hypocrisy and guile.<br><br>Missionaries frequently encounter contacts who say, "I've heard about your 'Mormon Bible.' As far as I am concerned, the Holy Bible is the only true word of God, and you can't tell me anything that will change my mind." As Nephi was concluding his ministry, he anticipated that there would be resistance to an acceptance of any "new" scripture and recorded the words of the Lord in this manner:<br><br><i>And because my words shall hiss forth--many of the Gentiles shall say: A Bible! A Bible! We have got a Bible, and there cannot be any more Bible....</i><br><br><i>Thou fool, that shall say: A Bible, we have got a Bible, and we need no more Bible. Have ye obtained a Bible save it were by the Jews?</i><br><br><i>Know ye not that there are more nations than one? Know ye not that I, the Lord your God, have created all men, and that I remember those who are upon the isles of the sea; and that I rule in the heavens above and in the earth beneath; and I bring forth my word unto the children of men, yea, even upon all the nations of the earth?</i><br><br><i>Wherefore murmur ye, because that ye shall receive more of my word? Know ye not that the testimony of two nations is a witness unto you that I am God, that I remember one nation like unto another? Wherefore, I speak the same words unto one nation like unto another....</i><br><br><i>And I do this that I may prove unto many that I am the same yesterday, today, and forever.</i>[2 Nephi 29:3, 6–9]<br><br>It was brought to my attention by a missionary that an application for employment at a large firm in one of the major cities of the mission had this question: "Do you believe in any scripture other than the Holy Bible?" A yes answer was the kiss of death as far as being hired by that firm. One who has a witness of the restoration of the gospel asks: "Why is it so difficult for so many to set aside their unfounded prejudices and misunderstandings and cleave to the word of the Lord?" We shall yet see additional scripture to enlarge our understanding of spiritual things as the Lord makes his word available to us. In compiling the Articles of Faith, Joseph Smith wrote: "[God] will yet reveal many great and important things pertaining to the Kingdom of God" (Articles of Faith 1:9). As the Lord sees fit to open the sealed portion of the Book of Mormon, what great scriptural adventure lies ahead of us?<br><br>The word<i>scripture</i>refers to writings recognized by the Church as sacred and inspired, revealed under the influence of the Holy Ghost. In closing out the writings of his father Mormon, Moroni was not to be misunderstood:<br><br><i>And again I speak unto you who deny the revelations of God, and say that they are done away, that there are no revelations, nor prophecies, nor gifts, nor healing, nor speaking with tongues, and the interpretation of tongues;</i><br><br><i>Behold I say unto you, he that denieth these things knoweth not the gospel of Christ; yea, he has not read the scriptures; if so, he does not understand them.</i><br><br><i>For do we not read that God is the same yesterday, today, and forever, and in him there is no variableness neither shadow of changing?</i>[Mormon 9:7–9]<br><br>That God is the same yesterday, today, and forever is a recurrent theme in the Book of Mormon and in other scripture as well. I have selected these passages from Nephi and Moroni--prophets who appeared both early and late in the Book of Mormon--to indicate that the teachings of these brethren were internally consistent and in tune with the mind of the Lord. Of course we expect consistency, since Alma, speaking to Corianton, tells us that with any inconsistency in the plan of salvation, God would cease to be God. Alma continues:<br><br><i>But God ceaseth not to be God, and mercy claimeth the penitent, and mercy cometh because of the atonement; and the atonement bringeth to pass the resurrection of the dead; and the resurrection of the dead bringeth back men into the presence of God; and thus they are restored into his presence, to be judged according to their works, according to the law and justice.</i><br><br><i>For behold, justice exerciseth all his demands, and also mercy claimeth all which is her own; and thus, none but the truly penitent are saved.</i><br><br><i>What, do ye suppose that mercy can rob justice? I say unto you, Nay; not one whit. If so, God would cease to be God.</i><br><br><i>And thus God bringeth about his great and eternal purposes, which were prepared from the foundation of the world. And thus cometh about the salvation and the redemption of men, and also their destruction and misery.</i>[Alma 42:23–26]<br><br>It is impressive that Alma had a great depth of understanding of the Atonement and the Resurrection and the plan of salvation.<br><br>It was Alma whose great missionary zeal boiled over when he said:<br><br><i>O that I were an angel, and could have the wish of mine heart, that I might go forth and speak with the trump of God, with a voice to shake the earth, and cry repentance unto every people!</i><br><br><i>Yea, I would declare unto every soul, as with the voice of thunder, repentance and the plan of redemption, that they should repent and come unto our God, that there might not be more sorrow upon all the face of the earth.</i><br><br><i>But behold, I am a man, and do sin in my wish; for I ought to be content with the things which the Lord hath allotted unto me.</i><br><br>Then, in a reflective moment, he goes on:<br><br><i>Why should I desire that I were an angel, that I could speak unto all the ends of the earth?</i><br><br><i>For behold, the Lord doth grant unto all nations, of their own nation and tongue, to teach his word, yea, in wisdom, all that he seeth fit that they should have; therefore we see that the Lord doth counsel in wisdom, according to that which is just and true.</i>[Alma 29:1–3, 7–8]<br><br>Alma has had his wish fulfilled. His words now flood the earth in many languages!<br><br>Few have been converted to the gospel in the same manner as Alma. Yet we can profit by his account of his conversion as he described it to his son Helaman. In particular, his account can lead us through the steps of repentance. He still had a vivid recollection of the events of his conversion but was troubled by his sins no longer. Alma related the story of his conversion by stating:<br><br><i>I was racked with eternal torment, for my soul was harrowed up to the greatest degree and racked with all my sins.</i><br><br><i>Yea, I did remember all my sins and iniquities, for which I was tormented with the pains of hell; yea, I saw that I had rebelled against my God, and that I had not kept his holy commandments.</i><br><br><i>... That the very thought of coming into the presence of my God did rack my soul with inexpressible horror.</i>[Alma 36:12–14]<br><br>While he was in this state, he remembered hearing something his father had said concerning the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ to atone for the sins of the world.<br><br><i>Now, as my mind caught hold upon this thought, I cried within my heart: O Jesus, thou Son of God, have mercy on me, who am in the gall of bitterness, and am encircled about by the everlasting chains of death.</i><br><br><i>And now, behold, when I thought this, I could remember my pains no more; yea, I was harrowed up by the memory of my sins no more.</i><br><br><i>And oh, what joy, and what marvelous light I did behold; yea, my soul was filled with joy as exceeding as was my pain!</i>[Alma 36:18–20]<br><br>After manifesting to the people that he had been "born of God," he said:<br><br><i>Yea, and from that time even until now, I have labored without ceasing, that I might bring souls unto repentance; that I might bring them to taste of the exceeding joy of which I did taste; that they might also be born of God, and be filled with the Holy Ghost.</i><br><br><i>Yea, and now behold, O my son, the Lord doth give me exceedingly great joy in the fruit of my labors.</i>[Alma 36:23–25]<br><br>We see that Alma went through a spiritual awakening that carried him from a glimpse of what it might be like in outer darkness to the joy of committing one's life to continual service to the Lord.<br><br>When interviewing missionaries at the end of their missionary service, I asked: "What has impressed you most about serving a mission?"<br><br>Most often the response would be: "The change I saw in those who had accepted the gospel."<br><br>Like the various dispositions of the seeds described in the parable of the sower, many would believe but not commit to baptism. But those who committed and were baptized did display remarkable changes. And those missionaries who patiently carried their investigators through the discussions and to the waters of baptism were firsthand observers of these changes--and there were lasting impressions. That we can repent and bring ourselves into full fellowship with the Lord is a tremendous gift, a necessary step in becoming one with God.<br><br>Another convert who made a radical change of heart in Alma's time was Zeezrom. Zeezrom "was a man who was expert in the devices of the devil, that he might destroy that which was good" (Alma 11:21). Zeezrom found himself in a cross fire between Amulek and Alma, and, after a period of purification not unlike Alma's, he joined the Church, became a missionary to the Zoramites, and was seen as a source for good. Aminadab included Zeezrom when he said to the Lamanites, "You must repent ... , even until ye shall have faith in Christ, who was taught unto you by Alma, and Amulek, and Zeezrom" (Helaman 5:41).<br><br>The record of Alma's ministry is rich with gospel insights. The depth and breadth of Alma's understanding is impressive and compelling. I have not mentioned Alma's discourse on faith, but it combines with each of the other principles and ordinances of the gospel Alma discussed in the closing era of his ministry. In so doing he gave his witness to those who would listen that each of these principles and ordinances is fundamental to the gospel of Jesus Christ.<br><br>You will recall that Amulek, one of Alma's missionary companions, gave an inspired discourse on the atonement of Christ to the Zoramites. In confirming Alma's teachings, he said:<br><br><i>And now, behold, I will testify unto you of myself that these things are true. Behold, I say unto you, that I do know that Christ shall come among the children of men, to take upon him the transgressions of his people, and that he shall atone for the sins of the world; for the Lord God hath spoken it.</i>[Alma 34:8]<br><br>It has been of interest to me to note that the word<i>atone,</i>or<i>atonement,</i>has frequent usage in the Book of Mormon but is used only once in the New Testament. Speaking to the Romans, Paul said:<br><br><i>For if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more, being reconciled, we shall be saved by his life.</i><br><br><i>And not only so, but we also joy in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom we have now received the atonement.</i>[Romans 5:10–11]<br><br>That Amulek had a keen awareness of the plan of salvation and the mission of the Lord was apparent when he said: "For it is expedient that an atonement should be made; for according to the great plan of the Eternal God there must be an atonement made, or else all mankind must unavoidably perish" (Alma 34:9). Such spiritual insights do not come without effort but rather from much prayer, fasting, and study in the same manner the sons of Mosiah obtained their understanding. Also, it probably didn't hurt in the least to be the traveling companion of a prophet of God. As the Lord told Oliver Cowdery, there is a pattern for obtaining gospel knowledge, and it is not as if we can plop ourselves down on a rock and wait for a knowledge of the mysteries of God to be showered upon us. Listen to Amulek's description of the Atonement:<br><br><i>For it is expedient that there should be a great and last sacrifice; yea, not a sacrifice of man, neither of beast, neither of any manner of fowl; for it shall not be a human sacrifice; but it must be an infinite and eternal sacrifice.</i>[Alma 34:10]<br><br>No one man can atone for the sins of another, but there must be a great and last sacrifice, and no one less than a god can make this sacrifice. Then, as Amulek indicates, there would be an end to the shedding of blood with the fulfilling of the law of Moses. In Amulek's words:<br><br><i>And behold, this is the whole meaning of the law, every whit pointing to that great and last sacrifice; and that great and last sacrifice will be the Son of God, yea, infinite and eternal.</i>[Alma 34:14]<br><br>It is through the Atonement that mercy can satisfy the demands of justice. One who will exercise faith and will repent becomes the benefactor of the promise of the Atonement. The Lord indicates that he will remember our sins no more if we humble ourselves and repent. What a blessing it is that we can do so, if we do not sin unto death. On the other hand, if we will not exercise faith and will not repent, then we become exposed to the law of justice and must suffer even as Christ. When I read verses 15–20 of section 19 of the Doctrine and Covenants, it is clear to me that the Lord is not playing games. It doesn't sound as if we could "eat, drink, and be merry; have the Lord beat us with a few stripes, and then have him let us enter into his rest" (see 2 Nephi 28:7–8). It is well for us to exercise our agency in a constructive manner and follow all the steps that lead us to eternal life. Amulek had a clear vision of the Atonement.<br><br>Many of the "best shots" recorded in the Book of Mormon come from counsel given from father to son. I have mentioned Alma's discourse to Helaman. He in turn spoke to Shiblon and to Corianton. Shiblon was on track and received far less counsel than did Corianton. Alma proceeded to enlighten Corianton concerning some very fundamental gospel principles about which Corianton had meager understanding. Some of these principles included the absolute necessity of personal purity, the state of the spirit between death and resurrection, the probationary role of this life, and the relationship between spiritual and temporal death. His statement that "wickedness never was happiness" (Alma 41:10) is absolute truth. In Alma's description of the Resurrection, he said:<br><br><i>The soul shall be restored to the body, and the body to the soul; yea, and every limb and joint shall be restored to its body; yea, even a hair of the head shall not be lost; but all things shall be restored to their proper and perfect frame.</i>[Alma 40:23]<br><br>Some of us take great comfort in this description of the Resurrection!<br><br>Others giving counsel to their sons at the close of their ministry include Lehi to his sons and the sons of Ishmael; Helaman to his sons Nephi and Lehi; and Mormon to Moroni. One can imagine the bittersweet feelings that Lehi had as he was preparing to lay down his tabernacle of clay. The knowledge that his eldest sons along with the sons of Ishmael had a bleak future brought great sorrow. On the other hand, the righteousness of Sam, Nephi, Jacob, Joseph, and Zoram brought satisfaction and joy. Lehi instructed the former group to "rebel no more against your brother" (2 Nephi 1:24) and told them that if they would pay heed to the voice of Nephi, they would not perish (verse 28). Lehi took this occasion to speak to them about the agency of man:<br><br><i>For it must needs be, that there is an opposition in all things. If not so ... , righteousness could not be brought to pass, neither wickedness, neither holiness nor misery, neither good nor bad.</i>[2 Nephi 2:11]<br><br>He also told them that God "gave unto man that he should act for himself" (2 Nephi 2:16). He instructed his progeny about the fall of Adam and his connection to Joseph of old, and he prophesied that a seer by the name of Joseph would be raised in the latter days. In spite of all the training, chastening, and spiritual experiences of Laman and Lemuel, they were unresponsive. One can see how the adversary can canker the souls of men until they are past feeling. Nephi was shooting rifle shots when he indicated that Satan leads us carefully down to hell. To become past feeling is not a process that occurs in a day; it is a slow, progressive process. One can wonder whether Laman and Lemuel were ever in tune with the Spirit; rather, they had their "hearts ... set so much upon the things of this world, and aspire[d] to the honors of men," as the Lord puts it (D&amp;amp;C 121:35), that they were frankly unable to respond to the "still small voice."<br><br>Helaman's sons Nephi and Lehi--like Jacob, the brother of Nephi--received their "errand from the Lord" and became stellar missionaries. Nephi vacated the judgment seat and, with his brother Lehi, preached the word of God the remainder of his days. In Helaman 5 there are many references to the instructions they received from their father Helaman. It was the desire of Helaman that they should keep the commandments of God and remember who they were--they even bore the names of their first parents who came out of Jerusalem. They were instructed further to remember the words King Benjamin spoke as he concluded his ministry (see Mosiah 2–5), in particular:<br><br><i>Remember that there is no other way nor means whereby man can be saved, only through the atoning blood of Jesus Christ, who shall come; yea, remember that he cometh to redeem the world.</i>[Helaman 5:9]<br><br>It was Helaman's witness that the Lord should surely come not to redeem mankind<i>in</i>their sins, but to redeem them<i>from</i>their sins. As the record details, Helaman spoke many things to his sons that are both written and unwritten. Nephi and Lehi realized great success and had many miraculous experiences. Their father had trained them well. These words of Helaman gave them the strength to stand steadfast in the face of adversity and to exemplify their convictions:<br><br><i>And now, my sons, remember, remember that it is upon the rock of our Redeemer, who is Christ, the Son of God, that ye must build your foundation; that when the devil shall send forth his mighty winds, yea, his shafts in the whirlwind, yea, when all his hail and his mighty storm shall beat upon you, it shall have no power over you to drag you down to the gulf of misery and endless wo, because of the rock upon which ye are built, which is a sure foundation, a foundation whereon if men build they cannot fall.</i>[Helaman 5:12]<br><br>There is one other father and son combination that I wish to mention--that of Mormon and Moroni. Mormon must have been an exceptional youth "at ten years of age" to be singled out by Ammaron to be given the future charge of the sacred records when he was "about twenty and four years old" (Mormon 1:2–3). Wickedness was rampant, and the great Nephite civilization was in decline, "tak[ing] happiness in sin" (Mormon 2:13). Knowing full well the destiny of his people, Mormon preached to them anyway. But he preached in vain. He even refused for a time to lead their armies, although he had previously done so with success. Day by day Mormon could see the numbers of Nephites becoming fewer and fewer. Knowing the end was coming, he hid the sacred records in the hill Cumorah. Watching the carnage that was being entailed on his loved ones, he reported:<br><br><i>My soul was rent with anguish, because of the slain of my people, and I cried:</i><br><br><i>O ye fair ones, how could ye have departed from the ways of the Lord! O ye fair ones, how could ye have rejected that Jesus, who stood with open arms to receive you!</i>[Mormon 6:16–17]<br><br>Mormon's record was finished by Moroni. Mormon had been killed, and Moroni remained alone to chronicle the destruction of his people. In closing his father's record, Moroni wrote with the strength of his conviction about the coming forth of the Book of Mormon. He said that if there are any faults in the book, they are the faults of men, and he testified that God is a God of miracles and that he had prepared a way for the translation of the Nephite writings--through a modern prophet, as we know.<br><br>Following the abridgment of the book of Ether, Moroni had "not as yet perished," and he wrote a "few more things" (Moroni 1:passim). The entire book of Moroni is his "best shot." He describes the manner in which ordinances are to be carried out; details the accepting of new members into the Church; and gives a profound discourse on faith, hope, and charity. Charity, according to Moroni is the "pure love of Christ, and it endureth forever; and whoso is found possessed of it at the last day, it shall be well with him" (Moroni 7:47). In the closing chapters of his writings, Moroni cites counsel he has received from his father, Mormon. He quotes from letters written by his father, including this father's blessing:<br><br><i>May the grace of God the Father, whose throne is high in the heavens, and our Lord Jesus Christ, who sitteth on the right hand of his power, until all things shall become subject unto him, be, and abide with you forever.</i>[Moroni 9:26]<br><br>In his final chapter, Moroni indicates that he will seal up the records after he has given a few words of exhortation. He exhorts us to gain a witness of the Book of Mormon; to not deny the gifts of God; to remember that God is the same yesterday, today, and forever; and to hold fast to these things. It is his final exhortation that I wish to detail. He begins:<br><br><i>And again I would exhort you that ye would come unto Christ, and lay hold upon every good gift, and touch not the evil gift, nor the unclean thing....</i><br><br><i>Yea, come unto Christ, and be perfected in him, and deny yourselves of all ungodliness; and if ye shall deny yourselves of all ungodliness, and love God with all your might, mind and strength, then is his grace sufficient for you, that by his grace ye may be perfect in Christ; and if by the grace of God ye are perfect in Christ, ye can in nowise deny the power of God.</i><br><br><i>And again, if ye by the grace of God are perfect in Christ, and deny not his power, then are ye sanctified in Christ by the grace of God, through the shedding of the blood of Christ, which is in the covenant of the Father unto the remission of your sins, that ye become holy, without spot.</i>[Moroni 10:30, 32–33]<br><br>I wish to return to the description of the Book of Mormon given in section 20 of the Doctrine and Covenants, where we read that the book is a record of a fallen people. A fallen people is a dead people, a lost civilization--a people who would not embrace the gospel of Jesus Christ and as a consequence lost their heritage. Although the Nephite people perished, the writings of great prophets who labored in their midst remain. In their final counsel they gave to us a clear picture of the fullness of the gospel. The translation of their writings by a modern prophet gives us a witness that God does speak to men in this day and age as he did in days of old. What a blessing it is to have the writings of these servants of the living God to enlarge our understanding of the gospel of Jesus Christ.<br><br>My brothers and sisters, I know that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of the living God. I know for a surety that the Book of Mormon is the word of God, translated through the power of God by a living prophet. I know that the gospel has been restored in its entirety and that there has been a succession of prophets who have held and do now hold the keys of the priesthood for the administration of all the ordinances leading to eternal life. I sustain President Hinckley as a prophet, seer, and revelator with all of my heart and am grateful for the strength of his leadership. This Church is true. It is my prayer that we may heed the counsel of the prophets, both past and present, and that we may become holy, without spot, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Donovan Fleming was a BYU professor of psychology and an adjunct professor of religious education when this devotional address was given on 17 June 1997.</i><br><br><i>© Brigham Young University.

<h1> Times Seven” - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I am honored and deeply humbled to address you today. I pray that I may be a servant through whom our Lord's words can flow. I seek that spirit identified in 2 Nephi 32:3, that spirit which empowers the speech of angels, even the Holy Ghost. I pray that that same spirit might flow from my words to your hearts and that together we will be edified and our testimonies nurtured.<br><br>In my work as a marriage and family therapist, I often see people who are searching for a transformation of their heart. How is your heart today? Is it a warm heart filled with the fruits of the Spirit? An aching heart? A broken heart? A grieving heart? A distracted heart? Are you so caught up in your thoughts and actions that it is difficult to feel? Do you have an overburdened heart? Are you so burdened by feelings that it is difficult to think?<br><br>Do you have a weary heart? Are you wishing that somehow, someway you could escape from your current condition? Or is yours a fluttering heart? Are you filled with the thrill of romantic love? Do you have an overflowing heart? A loving heart? Or could it possibly be a repentant heart? A giving heart? A forgiving heart?<br><br>Sometime ago a wife sat with her husband in my office. He had been unfaithful and had submitted himself to the loving influence of Church discipline. I had seen them several times, and the damage to the "heart" of their relationship was slowly healing. He had made much progress with help from his bishop and stake president, and their relationship was perhaps better than it had been in a long time. With tears running down her cheeks, she looked deeply into my eyes and asked, "I know I need to forgive, but how do I do it? My heart does not seem to let go. I think I can learn to forgive my husband, but I feel damaged as though I can never possibly forgive the other woman."<br><br>I gave an inadequate, inconsequential answer to her question, but her words have remained in my mind and surfaced on many different occasions since that time: "I know I need to forgive, but how do I do it?" She needed a transformation of her heart, and she wanted it to be immediate. Her husband wanted badly to be forgiven. She felt that she had made some progress, but when she slipped, he became upset. For him he was either forgiven or not, and it was difficult for him to see that she was making considerable progress on a continuum toward being more forgiving.<br><br>In one of his interactions with the Pharisees, Jesus accused them of ignoring the weightier matters of the law--judgment, mercy, and faith. Are you taking good care of your heart, especially with the natural healers of mercy and faith? Do you take daily doses of mercy and faith to guard your heart from damage?<br><br>During a discussion about conflict and offense in personal relationships, Peter asked Jesus:<br><br><i>How oft shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? till seven times?</i><br><br><i>Jesus saith unto him, I say not unto thee, Until seven times: but Until seventy times seven.</i>[Matthew 18:21–22]<br><br>Did he really mean seventy times seven, or 490 times? I am sure that Peter thought seven times was gracious, a generous outpouring of his heart and his patience to even consider forgiving seven times. But Christ's answer was seventy times more than what Peter had offered.<br><br>Then our older brother, the Firstborn of our Heavenly Father, told his disciples a story. It was time for a king to settle the accounts of those in his kingdom. One person owed the king a great deal of money--ten thousand talents. He had no means to pay, and so he was ordered to sell all that he had, and then he along with his wife and children were to be sold into slavery to pay their debt. As you and I might have done, he pleaded for mercy.<br><br>Can you imagine what you might have said, on your knees, your heart pounding with fear, begging for the freedom of your wife and your children?<br><br>Whatever this debtor said, the king's heart was moved with compassion. The pleading words of a father and husband softly invaded the heart of the king, and it was transformed. He forgave the debt.<br><br>This man and his family were free. Yet he would later be guilty of what psychologists call the "attribution error." When we are hurt, it is our natural tendency to assume that the offender intended to commit an offense against us, and so we blame them and their character. But when it comes to us, we attribute our shortcomings and our actions, which others may experience as hurtful, to some situation or circumstance outside of us. We should not be blamed, we cry. It is circumstance. So it was with this forgiven debtor.<br><br>You know the rest of the story. When another owed him money, a merciful heart eluded him, and he administered the law of justice and cast his fellowservant into prison until he would pay the debt. And as you know, when his lord discovered it, he was angry and administered the same fate to the man, once forgiven, who had become unforgiving.<br><br>Jesus summarized with a message to all of us: "So likewise shall my heavenly Father do also unto you, if ye from your hearts forgive not every one his brother their trespasses" (Matthew 18:35).<br><br>The scriptures are replete with similar verses. Consider these, for example:<br><br><i>And when ye stand praying, forgive, if ye have ought against any: that your Father also which is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses.</i><br><br><i>But if ye do not forgive, neither will your Father which is in heaven forgive your trespasses.</i>[Mark 11:25–26]<br><br><i>For, if ye forgive men their trespasses your heavenly Father will also forgive you;</i><br><br><i>But if ye forgive not men their trespasses neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.</i>[3 Nephi 13:14–15]<br><br><i>And ye ought to say in your hearts--let God judge between me and thee, and reward thee according to thy deeds.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 64:11]<br><br>Jesus proposed a culture that would not be limited by ethnic, religious, political, or economic conditions. In his culture, our relationships with each other are regulated by our continual recognition of God's forgiving love for each of us. His is a radical proposal in which our desires to live out our forgiven-ness form the basic foundation of our interpersonal relationships (see McCullough, M. E., Sandage, S. J., and Worthington, E. L.,<i>To Forgive Is Human: How to Put Your Past in the Past</i>[Downers Grove, Illinois: InterVarsity Press, 1997], p. 18).<br><br>Are you forgiven? In a faraway garden a long time ago, drops of blood oozed from every pore of our elder brother. His heart was a pained heart, full of burden for our mistakes, offenses, and, yes, even our pain and heartache. His heart hurt so much that he pleaded that the bitterness of the cup might be removed. His was a merciful heart, a heart that went beyond justice to recover you and me.<br><br>As you witness our Savior and what he was willing to suffer for us--as you watch the cruelty forced upon him, one so undeserving of such treatment in his utter innocence and total purity--does your own heart overflow with sorrow and love and gratitude for him? (See Carson, C.,<i>Forgiveness: The Healing Gift We Give Ourselves</i>[Provo: Carson, 1995].) He invites us to partake of his love and the healing power of his atonement. Have you accepted his offering, his great gift? And if so, does it enervate every cell of your heart? Or have you rejected his invitation to carry your burdens, to take away your pain, and to allow yourself to partake of his peace?<br><br>Have you examined lately your principles governing your important relationships? Are you extending your forgiven-ness to your relationships with roommates? To your marriage partner? To your children? To your parents? Is yours a merciful, forgiving heart? Is yours a giving heart, especially to those close to you, rather than a critical or judging heart?<br><br>In today's world there are some, perhaps too many, who see evil and sin as relative or nonexistent. These people encourage us to be tolerant of diverse lifestyles and tempt us to make tolerance the basis of relationships rather than forgiveness.<br><br>In an address to the Twelve in 1839, the Prophet Joseph Smith encouraged:<br><br><i>Ever keep in exercise the principle of mercy, and be ready to forgive our brother on the first intimations of repentance, and asking forgiveness; and should we even forgive our brother, or even our enemy, before he repent or ask forgiveness, our heavenly Father would be equally merciful unto us.</i>[<i>Teachings,</i>p. 155]<br><br>In addressing the Relief Society, Joseph taught:<br><br><i>The nearer we get to our heavenly Father, the more we are disposed to look with compassion on perishing souls; we feel that we want to take them upon our shoulders, and cast their sins behind our backs. ... If you would have God have mercy on you, have mercy on one another.</i>[<i>Teachings,</i>p. 241]<br><h2><b>What Is Forgiveness?</b></h2><br>What does forgiveness mean? Does forgiving mean that we forget the offense? No. Yet the adage "Forgive and forget" is frequently heard in our culture. In fact, it may be that our beliefs about forgetting sometimes get in the way of forgiving. Daniel Wegner, a psychologist, has conducted research on persistent thought. He had undergraduate students imagine a white bear. Then he told them to try not to think about the white bear. Each time they thought of the white bear, they were to ring a bell. The more students tried not to think about the bear, the more they rang the bell (see Wegner, D.,<i>White Bears and Other Unwanted Thoughts: Suppression, Obsession, and the Psychology of Mental Control</i>[New York: Guilford, 1994]). Have you tried to put some unwanted event out of your mind, only to find that your thoughts were even more filled with the event? It is possible that over time our memory of a hurtful event may fade, but it is not necessary for us to lose our memory of an event to transform our hearts to forgiveness.<br><br>But forgiveness means that we are able to put the offense in broad perspective with the rest of our life. Certainly all of us are much more than simply someone who has been hurt. There are many more events in our lives than hurtful ones. When we become forgiving, we are not obsessed with thinking about the offense all the time. Yes, we can remember it, but we are not obsessed with it, and it does not consume our emotional energy. Thoughts and feelings about it do not distract us from doing other important things. It means we do not spend time harboring fantasies of revenge, wishing another would suffer as much as we have. It means that we escape from becoming a cynic about the world and our relationships. It means that we become less focused on blame and judgment and more focused on transforming our own heart. Forgiveness means that we develop a mature understanding of what happened and leave punishment and judgment to a wise Heavenly Father.<br><br>Is forgiving more for the other person or for ourselves? Developing a forgiving heart will do far more for you than it ever will for the person who has hurt you. It is a gift you give yourself.<br><br>Are we required to forgive even mean, bad people who may never repent and may never come asking for forgiveness from us? Are we required to forgive even those who have knowingly sinned and in the process wounded our heart, our very soul? What if a person who has wronged me never comes to beg? If forgiving is more a gift we give ourselves rather than for the other person, the answer is yes, we are required to do all of this--for ourselves if for no one else. In D&amp;amp;C 64:10 the message is clear: "Of you it is required to forgive all men."<br><h2><b>Forgiving Is Necessary, Especially in Families</b></h2><br>It is impossible for family members to live together without occasionally hurting each other. During our married life I have given my wife numerous opportunities to develop forgiveness. I have given so many opportunities that she has an enlarged heart, one crammed full of forgiving.<br><br>According to the First Presidency's "Proclamation on the Family" to the world, forgiveness is one of the principles upon which happy marriages and families can be built. I have seen the results of unmerciful hearts in my clinical practice. Oh, if we would learn to be the first to seek forgiveness with our marriage partner! In my experience, focusing on others' actions clouds our ability to transform our heart. It is easier to blame and judge than it is to work on major heart surgery. We often think the responsibility for such healing rests with the other person. He holds my heart in his hands, she says, and until he apologizes or pays for what he has done, I cannot free my heart from his grip. Is your heart captive in such a way to someone else?<br><br>Being quick to apologize, saying "I'm sorry," and transforming our angry hearts to forgiving hearts overflowing with a mind-set of our own forgiven-ness are balms to open wounds. I determined early in our married life to use apology liberally, and my heart has thrived because of my decision. Through a forgiving temperament you make the Atonement a daily, even hourly, commitment in your relationships. Your own forgiven-ness permits you to forgive.<br><br>I have seen divorced persons struggle to get balance in their minds and hearts. They often find thoughts of bitterness and unforgiving occupying too much space in their minds. The anger and blame have pressed themselves into every crevice of their hearts, leaving little room for more healing feelings.<br><br>I have seen adult children who find that their pain, a consequence of imperfect parents, takes over their lives. Of course parents are imperfect, even when they try to do their best.<br><br>This last year my teenage daughter registered for several AP and honors courses. At the end of a particularly difficult term, as she faced finals week and was under maximum stress, I asked one morning what I could do to help her. She replied that she needed to finish a sculpture, a covered bowl in the shape of a turtle, later after school. I could help by soaking the turtle in water so that the clay would be more pliable when she came home from school. She left for school, and I proceeded to unwrap the turtle dish. I filled the sink with water and submerged the turtle. My daughter had told me to let it soak for a few minutes. I determined that 10 minutes would be good and went about other business. I lost track of time, eventually realized my error, and returned to the bathroom sink. I reached into the water with both hands, and, as I removed them, the shapeless turtle dripped through my fingers and disappeared back into the water. In wanting to help, I had made things far worse. How would I explain this when my daughter came home? Would this be one of those events that would damage her for life? Would she look back on her high school years and remember nothing but how her father murdered the clay turtle by drowning it in the sink? You see, I believe our greatest fear as parents is that our children might in some way be like us. I wasn't sure that I would handle this situation particularly well if the sides were reversed.<br><br>When my daughter arrived home from school, I was anxiously waiting. I had practiced many speeches in my mind. Some of them were more filled with admissions of responsibility than others. I started by telling her that I had something awful to tell her. When she heard about the demise of the turtle, she smiled and simply said, "Dad, you really owe me one for this." She is by nature forgiving, and my imperfections had once again failed to damage her too much.<br><br>Elder Jeffrey R. Holland once described a painful situation in his family:<br><br><i>Early in our married life my young family and I were laboring through graduate school at a university in New England. Pat was the Relief Society president in our ward, and I was serving in our stake presidency. I was going to school full-time and teaching half-time. We had two small children then, with little money and lots of pressures.</i><br><br><i>One evening I came home from long hours at school, feeling the proverbial weight of the world on my shoulders. Everything seemed to be especially demanding and discouraging and dark. I wondered if the dawn would ever come. Then, as I walked into our small student apartment, there was an unusual silence in the room.</i><br><br><i>"What's the trouble?" I asked.</i><br><br><i>"Matthew has something he wants to tell you," Pat said.</i><br><br><i>"Matt, what do you have to tell me?" He was quietly playing with his toys in the corner of the room, trying very hard not to hear me. "Matt," I said a little louder, "do you have something to tell me?"</i><br><br><i>He stopped playing, but for a moment he didn't look up. Then two enormous, tear-filled brown eyes turned toward me, and with the pain only a five-year-old can know, he said, "I didn't mind Mommy tonight, and I spoke back to her." With that he burst into tears, and his entire body shook with grief. A childish indiscretion had been noted, a painful confession had been offered, the growth of a five-year-old was continuing, and loving reconciliation could have been wonderfully underway.</i><br><br><i>Everything might have been just terrific--except for me. If you can imagine such an idiotic thing, I lost my temper. It wasn't that I lost it with Matt--it was with a hundred and one other things on my mind. But he didn't know that, and I wasn't disciplined enough to admit it. He got the whole load of bricks.</i><br><br><i>I told him how disappointed I was and how much more I thought I could have expected from him. I sounded like the parental pygmy I was. Then I did what I had never done before in his life: I told him that he was to go straight to bed and that I would not be in to say his prayers with him or to tell him a bedtime story. Muffling his sobs, he obediently went to his bedside, where he knelt--alone--to say his prayers. Then he stained his little pillow with tears his father should have been wiping away.</i><br><br><i>If you think the silence upon my arrival was heavy, you should have felt it now. Pat did not say a word. She didn't have to. I felt terrible!</i><br><br><i>Later, as we knelt by our own bed, my feeble prayer for blessings upon my family fell back on my ears with a horrible, hollow ring. I wanted to get up off my knees right then and go to Matt and ask his forgiveness, but he was long since peacefully asleep.</i><br><br><i>My own relief was not so soon coming, but finally I fell asleep and began to dream, which I seldom do. I dreamed Matt and I were packing two cars for a move. For some reason his mother and baby sister were not present. As we finished I turned to him and said, "Okay, Matt, you drive one car and I'll drive the other."</i><br><br><i>This five-year-old very obediently crawled up on the seat and tried to grasp the massive steering wheel. I walked over to the other car and started the motor. As I began to pull away, I looked to see how my son was doing. He was trying--oh, how he was trying. He tried to reach the pedals, but he couldn't. He was also turning knobs and pushing buttons, trying to start the motor. He could scarcely be seen over the dashboard, but there staring out at me again were those same immense, tear-filled, beautiful brown eyes. As I pulled away, he cried out, "Daddy, don't leave me. I don't know how to do it. I'm too little." And I drove away.</i><br><br><i>A short time later, driving down that desert road in my dream, I suddenly realized in one stark, horrifying moment what I had done. I slammed my car to a stop, threw open the door, and started to run as fast as I could. I left car, keys, belongings, and all--and I ran. The pavement was so hot it burned my feet, and tears blinded my straining effort to see this child somewhere on the horizon. I kept running, praying, pleading to be forgiven and to find my boy safe and secure.</i><br><br><i>As I rounded a curve, nearly ready to drop from physical and emotional exhaustion, I saw the unfamiliar car I had left Matt to drive. It was pulled carefully off to the side of the road, and he was laughing and playing nearby. An older man was with him, playing and responding to his games. Matt saw me and cried out something like, "Hi, Dad. We're having fun." Obviously he had already forgiven and forgotten my terrible transgression against him.</i><br><br><i>But I dreaded the older man's gaze, which followed my every move. I tried to say "Thank you," but his eyes were filled with sorrow and disappointment. I muttered an awkward apology and the stranger said simply, "You should not have left him alone to do this difficult thing. It would not have been asked of you."</i><br><br><i>With that, the dream ended, and I shot upright in bed. My pillow was stained, whether with perspiration or tears I do not know. I threw off the covers and ran to the little metal camp cot that was my son's bed. There on my knees and through my tears I cradled him in my arms and spoke to him while he slept. I told him that every dad makes mistakes but that they don't mean to. I told him it wasn't his fault I had had a bad day. I told him that when boys are five or fifteen, dads sometimes forget and think they are fifty. I told him that I wanted him to be a small boy for a long, long time, because all too soon he would grow up and be a man and wouldn't be playing on the floor with his toys when I came home. I told him that I loved him and his mother and his sister more than anything in the world, and that whatever challenges we had in life, we would face them together. I told him that never again would I withhold my affection or my forgiveness from him, and never, I prayed, would he withhold them from me. I told him I was honored to be his father and that I would try with all my heart to be worthy of such a great responsibility.</i>[Jeffrey R. Holland and Patricia T. Holland,<i>On Earth as It Is in Heaven</i>(Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Company, 1989), pp. 165–68]<br><br>All parents are blessed when they have forgiving children.<br><br>I have seen parents who had difficulty forgiving themselves because they felt they had to be perfect. This belief made it difficult for them to ever say they were sorry to their children. They always had to be right, more knowledgeable, more grown-up. Such beliefs can constrain parents from seeking forgiveness from their children and from forgiving themselves.<br><br>I have seen survivors of emotional, physical, and sexual abuse struggle with the doctrine of forgiveness. They often feel that if they were to forgive, it would let the offender off the hook or would minimize the hurt and damage. Yet they fail to realize that transforming their heart to a forgiving heart is a gift they give themselves. It will do far more for them than it will ever do for their offender.<br><h2><b>So How Do I Forgive?</b></h2><br>I have noticed that I may be able to explain the doctrine of forgiveness and forgiving, but when I am on the highway and offended by another driver, I often act like Attila the Hun. Is it likewise difficult for you to eliminate blame and judgment from your relationships with your roommates, your spouse, your parents, or even your children? Do you find yourself saying, "They'll get theirs," and then fantasizing about possible punishments they might receive? Perhaps you even hope to be able to do the punishing to hurt another as much as they have hurt you. So how do we make this comprehensive change of heart called forgiving?<br><br>First, you must work to put the Atonement into the very cells of your heart so that your sense of your own forgiven-ness, his plea for you by name, is ever present.<br><br>You will only be able to do so with much sincere prayer.<br><br>If anyone ever had more reason to be bitter, it was the Prophet Joseph Smith. Yet his heart was forgiving. Prior to the dedication of the Kirtland Temple, William Smith, the Prophet's brother and a member of the Twelve, had been embittered. He had said vicious and vile things against his brother in public. His was a distracted, vengeful heart, and he had even physically attacked his brother Joseph and beat him with his fists. The Smith parents and other children were deeply pained. The Prophet described this time as Satan trying to divide his family and to thwart the work and the building of the Kirtland Temple.<br><br>Yet in the midst of all of this, Daniel Tyler, a member of the Church, recorded in his journal this description of the Prophet Joseph:<br><br><i>At the time William Smith and others rebelled against the Prophet at Kirtland, I attended a meeting "on the flats" where Joseph presided. Entering the school house a little before the meeting opened and gazing upon the man of God, I perceived sadness in his countenance and tears trickling down his cheeks. A few moments later a hymn was sung and he opened the meeting by prayer. Instead of facing the audience, however, he turned his back and bowed upon his knees, facing the wall. This, I suppose, was done to hide his sorrow and tears.</i><br><br><i>I had heard men and women pray--especially the former--from the most ignorant, both as to letters and intellect, to the most learned and eloquent. But never until then had I heard a man address his Maker as though He was present listening as a kind father would listen to the sorrows of a dutiful child. Joseph was at that time unlearned, but that prayer, which was to a considerable extent in behalf of those who accused him of having gone astray and fallen into sin, was that the Lord would forgive them and open their eyes that they might see aright. That prayer, I say, to my humble mind, partook of the learning and eloquence of heaven. There was no ostentation, no raising of the voice as by enthusiasm, but a plain conversational tone, as a man would address a present friend. It appeared to me as though, in case the veil were taken away, I could see the Lord standing facing His humblest of all servants I had ever seen. It was the crowning of all the prayers I ever heard.</i>[Hyrum L. Andrus and Helen Mae Andrus,<i>They Knew the Prophet</i>(Salt Lake City, UT: Bookcraft, 1974), pp. 51–52]<br><br>Our attitude in prayer will help transform our grieving, angry hearts into forgiving hearts.<br><br>A third thing you can do is to develop more empathy for others in your life, especially for those who have hurt and offended you. In each of us is a child of God. Have you found yours? And are you nurturing this child to grow into godhood? We greatly improve our ability to forgive by improving our ability to understand others' circumstances, their feelings, their situation--in short, to empathize with them. Studies have shown that when people learn to be more empathetic with others, they automatically develop more forgiving temperaments. Likewise, marital partners who have more empathy for each other are more forgiving, more committed, report more trust, and are happier.<br><br>A couple once counseled with a priesthood leader. The wife's heart was weary, and she was tired of trying to keep their marriage alive. She blamed her husband for most of the lesions on her heart. The inspired leader responded, "If you could see him as he will be in his perfected state, you would give all the energy of your heart to be with him."<br><br>On several occasions different mothers have recounted a similar story to me. They were all survivors of sexual abuse. Forgiveness was a struggle for each of them. Then someone in their family was accused of abusing another--usually the accused was one of their children. Can you imagine what happens to a mother's insides when her child is so accused, especially when she has personally suffered at the hands of a similar transgressor? Yet all of these women have told me that eventually they were able to see their own transgressors in a new light--children of God who had made a terrible mistake but who someday may repent and receive God's forgiveness. Such transformation had allowed them to sacrifice fantasies of revenge and turn judgment over to God. They permitted Christ's blood to surround their pain and cleanse their hearts with peace.<br><br>Enlarging our vision and interest about those who offend us can help us develop greater empathy. Consider someone who has recently offended you. Who is their mother? Do they have a family? Have they ever grieved over the loss of a loved one? What has been disappointing to them about their life? Do they like themselves? Where is the child of God in them? Can Christ's blood cleanse them as it can me? Forgiveness is a relational stance in which we accept the inherent worth of another person even after judging their actions to be wrong (see McCullough et al., p. 27).<br><br>Another thing you can do is to watch your storytelling about an offensive event. In retelling a story about how we have been offended, we can tell it in such a way that we either push pain, anger, and grief deeper into the cells of our heart or we free ourselves. When someone has hurt us, it seems obvious who needs to do the changing. Yet we seldom focus on our need to purify and transform our hearts so that they can be whole, open, and alive to goodness. Don't let the negative storytelling consume your relationships with others. Our own moral behavior, such as holding our tongue when we feel like gossiping about someone who has hurt us, can lead to a deeper moral understanding. Don't put energy into unforgiveness; rather put it into transforming your heart.<br><br>Social scientists have described how reasoning about forgiveness develops (see Enright, R. D., Gassin, E. A., and Wu, C. R., "Forgiveness: A Developmental View,"<i>Journal of Moral Education</i>21 [1992]: 99–114). At early developmental stages of reasoning, children develop "revengeful forgiveness." At this stage we reason that an offender must be punished to the degree of pain her or his offense has caused. As we get older we progress to reasoning that sounds something like, "I feel guilty because an offender offers restitution, so I feel I must forgive them." This is called "restitutional forgiveness." Some of us may use "expectational forgiveness." We forgive because society, parents, and religion expect us to offer forgiveness. However, the most mature form of reasoning is "forgiveness as love." In this highest form of reasoning about forgiveness, we value others because we know in our minds and feel in our hearts that they have inherent worth as children of God. In this state we can value them even when they are selfish and inconsiderate--yes, even when they hurt us immensely. The heart-cleansing scrub of the Atonement permits us to envision them eventually transformed as people of repentance and even light.<br><br>Let me turn to perhaps the most difficult of struggles with forgiveness--forgiving ourselves. Some of us have bought into Satan's ploy that whatever we have done has made us unworthy forever. We tell ourselves that we don't deserve any good thing to happen to us because we are bad, flawed at the very core, polluted in some way beyond hope. Some of you continue to feel this way even after extensive confession and work with ecclesiastical leaders. The principles of transforming your heart are the same.<br><br>• You must put the Atonement into the cells of your heart.<br><br>• Sincere prayer will be an important ongoing balm.<br><br>• You must develop empathy for yourself. Has it ever occurred to you that good people repent because they have made a mistake? Yes, they feel guilty because they have violated a standard that is important. Guilt can be healthy if it helps us change our behavior. But if we use shame instead of guilt to see ourselves as bad people, we may change our behavior--but does the change of behavior matter if we still feel bad, shamed at the core? When you repent it is important to get in touch with the inherent goodness inside of you--that child of God in you seeking for more attention.<br><br>• You must be careful of the stories you tell yourself in your mind about what you have done. You are not a bad person. You are a good person who has made a mistake and can change.<br><br>Transformation does not usually happen all at once. Forgiveness can take time, and it may be helpful to think of the process of forgiving on a continuum with unforgiveness at one extreme and forgiving at the other.<br><br>A forgiving heart will bless you in a number of ways. Research shows that people who are forgiving have better emotional and physical health, and their relationships with people are much more satisfying. Remember, you need a forgiving heart for yourself more than for your offender.<br><br>On a cross in Calvary, your brother and my brother hung in agony. His heart was full of physical pain. Yet he was transformed. He looked upon his offenders and said, "Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do" (Luke 23:34). My testimony is that he lives, and I pray you will allow the chemistry of his blood to encircle your heart and transform your forgiven-ness to forgiving as a foundation for all of your relationships. I say this in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>James M.

<h1> Is Better Than Sacrifice” - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Isn't this great! What a marvelous campus and community the Lord has provided us with through the dedication and faithfulness of his Saints. Indeed, this great campus is built upon the foundation of those who labored in the vineyards of the world. What a tremendous responsibility we have as an academic community to provide the best spiritual and academic education possible. As scholars in the Lord's university, what wonderful academic freedom we have to teach revealed truths and principles as part of our intellectual experiences and professional knowledge. How much our students miss when we fail to encapsulate intellectual and spiritual growth within our scholarly areas. Where else can we so completely fill the children of God with wonderment and truths? Where else can we challenge those who will shape the future of mortal existence with the ability to think clearly, to think precisely, and to understand the nature and beauty of our existence? What an opportunity we have of showing these young scholars who come to Brigham Young University that intellectualism is about recognizing kernels of truth, and then using that truth as a matter of inquiry in understanding and improving our existence.<br><br>Science, philosophy, and politics may not permit us in an imperfect world to use revealed truth as a means of supporting a theoretical foundation, yet we can use revealed truth to seek ways in which we may establish such theories. Today science, as well as most areas, is troubled with falsifications, deceptions, and lies. Sports are plagued with selfishness, and commerce is plagued with profiteering. Isaiah was so clear when he wrote: "Yea, they are greedy dogs which can never have enough, and they are shepherds that cannot understand: they all look to their own way, every one for his gain, from his quarter" (Isaiah 56:11).<br><br>Our quarter is the Lord's quarter--not that of our professional peers nor of sports idols nor of the boardrooms of industry. It is the Lord's quarter. As professors and students at Brigham Young University, we have a tremendous obligation to keep that reality in the foremost center of our ideology and teaching. When we fail to do this, when we fail to be guided and obedient to correct principles, we lead ourselves, and frequently others, to failure. Truth is exacting. It is unchanging. If we understand that principle we can contribute to both the Lord's plan and to society. If we accept that principle we can move forward in great strides, accomplishing much. But if we "kick against the pricks" (Acts 9:5), our energy becomes dispersed and we lose that momentum, ending up with a distorted and unclear view. As Christ taught, we fall amongst the thorns and are "choked with cares and riches and pleasures of this life, and bring no fruit to perfection" (Luke 8:14).<br><br>Robert A. Millikan, a noted and highly decorated physicist who spent much of his life bringing science and society together, wrote in 1922: "The salvation of the world is to be found in the cultivation of science together with the cultivation of a belief in the reality of moral and spiritual values" (Robert A. Millikan, "Address of Acceptance of the Norman Bridge Laboratory of Physics,"<i>Science</i>55, no. 1422 (31March 1922), p.332).<br><br>Yet in our universities we frequently see theantithesis of Millikan's observation. When Iwas a faculty member at the University of California, Irvine, the student newspaper published an editorial written by one of the student editors. The student editor was expounding on how to have a day off from thepressures of examinations for the cost of a single matinee theater ticket. In the editorial hestated how to avoid getting caught between showings in a multiscreen theater. Placed in proper context, he was teaching how to steal.<br><br>Is one's integrity and standing before the Lord worth the price of a movie theater ticket? Is honesty so complicated that it is based upon one's perceived needs or entitlement? I wonder how this story might have been different if a professor had taught in the classroom gospel principles that we are permitted and expected to teach in our classrooms. Or if another student had recognized such flaws in a friend's character and had the courage to teach correct principles? The media is filled daily with such examples of dishonesty from those we entrust with power. How easy we confuse good for evil and evil for good. How quick we are to blame others for our actions or the consequences that our actions bring. Cassius, in the opening act of<i>Julius Caesar,</i>is talking to Brutus and says:<br><br><i>Men at some time are masters of their fates:<br>The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars,<br>But in ourselves, that we are underlings.</i><br>[William Shakespeare,<i>Julius Caesar,</i>act 1, scene 2, lines 138–40]<br><br>We have been given a sacred trust at Brigham Young University as a learning community. We must not violate that trust but honor and build upon it.<br><br>As a bishop of a Brigham Young University student ward, I had a long and soul-searching conversation with a young freshman student who could only see one focused purpose for being at this campus. Religious education and spiritual growth were not part of that focus--nor were the expectations of conduct he had agreed to upon accepting his scholarship and admittance to BYU. He was now faced with the necessity of leaving the university. I was told I was responsible for destroying his chance at greater honors and awards. This was the whole of his life! His order of conduct away from Brigham Young University was no business of mine, of the Church, nor of the university. He signed the Honor Code because he was "forced" to, or he would not be able to attend BYU and accomplish his goals. Although perhaps not at a conscious level, deceptions and "small lies" were to him an appropriate means to accomplish his goals. It happens subtly over a period of time until lies and deceptions are part of us. It becomes not only acceptable, but an automated approach to obtaining what we think we deserve. This same message is delivered within the entertainment media. How often is the audience led to sympathize with a bad deed done by a hero who is portraying evil for good: a police officer breaking the law to catch or inflict punishment on the villains or an adulterous situation where we are led to think it is moral because of some "special circumstance." Doing the wrong thing for the right reason is still wrong. From my perspective such action is divisive and is part of the "secret combination" whose evil is discussed in the Book of Mormon. Elder Packer noted:<br><br><i>We want our children and their children to know that the choice of life is not between fame and obscurity, nor is the choice between wealth and poverty. The choice is between good and evil, and that is a very different matter indeed.</i>[Boyd K. Packer, "The Choice,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 1980, p. 21]<br><br>The action I had to take regarding the intentional and continued conduct of this student was difficult. Somewhere there had been a failure to properly nurture this young man's spirit and guide him to the same successes using gospel principles. Excuses may give us a false sense of righteousness, but they will not change the outcome. Truth, moral principles, and God's commandments are constant. Our obedience to these must be exacting.<br><br>Specific revelation was given to Joseph Smith on November 1, 1831, in Hiram, Ohio:<br><br><i>What I the Lord have spoken, I have spoken, and I excuse not myself; and though the heavens and the earth pass away, my word shall not pass away, but shall all be fulfilled, whether by mine own voice or by the voice of my servants, it is the same.</i><br><br><i>For behold, and lo, the Lord is God, and the Spirit beareth record, and the record is true, and the truth abideth forever and ever.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 1:38–39]<br><br>Saul was to be anointed by Samuel to be king over all Israel. However, Saul had disobeyed the Lord and had made a sacrifice of the spoils of war even though the Lord had commanded that they be destroyed. Samuel then taught Saul a difficult lesson:<br><br><i>And Samuel said, Hath the Lord as great delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of the Lord? Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of rams.</i><br><br><i>For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry. Because thou hast rejected the word of the Lord, he hath also rejected thee from being king.</i>[1 Samuel 15:22–23]<br><br>Saul replied to Samuel with words that are all too familiar: "I have sinned: for I have transgressed the commandment of the Lord, and thy words: because I feared the people, and obeyed their voice" (1 Samuel 15:24). What he feared of the people was imposed by the Lord. Individual accountability and responsibility are key factors in our ability to return to the presence of the Father. Quoting from the second article of faith: "We believe that men will be punished for their own sins, and not for Adam's transgression."<br><br>Today the unwillingness to accept individual responsibility and accountability is endemic throughout our society. There is a lack of constancy and commitment to honor, correct principles, and righteous values. It seems that truth no longer needs to be based on fundamental principles. Instead, much of society confuses "what is" with what it wants it to be. Fiction and fantasy are confused with actuality and reality. More succinctly, the prophet Isaiah said: "Woe unto them that call evil good, and good evil; that put darkness for light, and light for darkness; that put bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter!" (Isaiah 5:20).<br><br>Nigel Calder writes in<i>Einstein's Universe</i>that people have mistakenly held that Einstein proved that all things were relative. This was far from what Einstein meant. Einstein had considered calling his work the "invariance theory." Calder writes:<br><br><i>He</i>[Einstein]<i>discovered what was "absolute" and reliable</i>despite<i>the apparent confusions, illusions and contradictions produced by relative motions or the action of gravity. The chief merit of the name "relativity" is in reminding us that a scientist is unavoidably a participant in the system he is studying.</i>[Nigel Calder,<i>Einstein's Universe</i>(New York: Wings Books, 1982) p. 2; emphasis in original]<br><br>Thus, so are we in our relationship with the Lord. The laws, commandments, and ordinances of God are the invariant. Our relation to them is the variant. Any thought of our relativity to his will is because of where we stand spiritually. Obedience and accountability are not related to our perceptions or our needs. We are completely and independently accountable for our actions: "For whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all" (James 2:10).<br><br>Glenn Seaborg, an internationally award-winning chemist, wrote, circa 1972, that in an ecological system, as one observes various levels and stages of development, it is not always possible to reconstruct a higher level of development based on what is present in the lower developed system. This is because there are interactions that occur during the transition process that are lost to observation, and hence become unknowns. That is, the result is not always the sum of the observed events. What we think we see or hear may not be what is real.<br><br>In my laboratory on campus about a year ago, we completed a series of experiments. In these experiments the participant was shown a videotape of a young female college student saying the sounds /ba/ or /ga/. Sometimes the visual portion would be /ba/ and the auditory portion would be /ga/. What was seen was not heard, and what was heard was not seen. The participant in the beginning did not know when this incongruity would happen. The result was that the presentation would either be reported as hearing /ga/ or neither of the sounds. This persisted even later in the experiment when we told the participant what the audio portion would be. They could not identify the correct audio portion. This confusion could not be corrected even when the truth was told to the participant. [A videotape demonstration of this phenomenon was used during the presentation of this devotional.]<br><br>There are many other examples using our senses that show similar incongruities. Many of these are well known and used to confuse and manipulate us--not just for the purposes of entertainment but to sell products or convince us something is true or occurring when it is only a partial truth. I am convinced that Satan and those who would do us harm--physical, financial, emotional, and spiritual--are masters of partial truths. Partial truths are most effective because they confuse the individual into accepting the part that is the lie or the deception. This is especially true when what we want is not consistent with the laws and commandments of the gospel and when the Spirit speaks against those desires. We are so carefully educated that only what we observe, or can logically account for through extrapolations of our observations, is true. Therefore the Spirit is dulled in us, and we pretend that what is not, is, and what is, is not. In C. S. Lewis' book<i>The Screwtape Letters,</i>a senior devil writing to his nephew, a junior devil, gives this advice:<br><br>[People]<i>find it all but impossible to believe in the unfamiliar while the familiar is before their eyes. . . . But the best of all is to let him read no science but to give him a grand general idea that he knows it all and that everything he happens to have picked up in casual talk and reading is "the results of modern investigation." Do remember you are there to fuddle him.</i>[C. S. Lewis,<i>The Screwtape Letters</i>(London: Found Paperbacks, 1982) p. 13]<br><br>The actual principle is more fully illustrated and taught in the book of Moses. As you recall, God had revealed himself to Moses and instructed Moses. God withdrew from the presence of Moses, and Moses fell to the earth. After "many hours" Moses' strength returned, and Moses spoke to himself, saying:<br><br><i>Now, for this cause I know that man is nothing, which thing I never had supposed.</i><br><br><i>But now mine own eyes have beheld God; but not my natural, but my spiritual eyes.</i>[Moses 1:10–11]<br><br>If I could have attached a device to your wrist that would let you feel the sounds I spoke of earlier, and if you had been carefully taught, through repetition, what the sounds felt like, there would have been no confusion. The addition of that third sense would have validated the auditory portion of the experiment. So is it with the Spirit. If we let the Spirit validate our thoughts, our actions, and our emotions, they, too, will not become confused. It is our "spiritual eyes" we must trust more than our desires. Our ability to listen to the Spirit and to be obedient to the laws and commandments of God is refined by repetition and adherence to those principles. Once the principle is well seated and learned, then all other decisions become easy; even when they are uncomfortable or appear difficult. Unfortunately we can become so focused on our own desires that we miss the guiding principles. One might say we cannot even recognize ourselves.<br><br>Last December I was in Lyon, France, for a small conference. I was out late one evening with a colleague and his wife. Throughout the evening we competed to see who would pay for the subway tickets as we traveled to various places. We were ready to return to our hotels, and, having lost the competition thus far, I was determined to at least win once. Of course my colleague was intent on me not winning. As we were rushing to the Metro station, I quickly spotted a shortcut to my left. As I hurriedly raced down the stairs to the opening, I came face-to-face with a man coming out of the entrance area I was about to enter. My colleague was fast following suit and was about to cut me off when he, too, encountered a second individual coming out of the same entrance. Both of us, being polite, stepped back to let each of our new encounters pass us by. My encounter also quickly stepped back. As I started forward, so did my encounter. This same scenario was going on with my colleague. I once again stepped back and excused myself, suggesting my encounter proceed. Evidently both myself and my encounter were involved in some type of nonexistent extrasensory communication. He made exactly the same movements at the same moment as I did. All of a sudden I heard laughter coming from my colleague, and I assumed he had succeeded in getting through the entrance. Since I now was very frustrated, and extremely narrowly focused, I decided to move forward and continue. As I did thus, so my encounter moved forward. I began to laugh--after all, we were both trying to be polite. I extended my hand toward his shoulder as a sign of friendship. So did he. As I moved to touch his shoulder, our eyes met for the first time, and I momentarily thought how familiar he looked. Upon touching his shoulder I realized the problem. I had run into myself. My colleague had run into himself. While we were making fools of ourselves in front of a large mirror, his wife quietly entered the Metro in a normal fashion and bought the tickets. A few days later we found ourselves at the same Metro station, and I had a picture taken. After all, it is important to document our stupidity for our posterity.<br><br>Shortly after the resurrection of Christ, two of his disciples were walking to Emmaus and talking of the events that had just transpired. As you recall, the resurrected Christ appeared quietly and began walking with them (see Luke 24:15). Christ inquired as to what their conversation was about and why they were so sad. They responded by saying how astonished and somewhat confused they were about the events of the past few days--especially when Christ's body was not found in the sepulchre. Christ rebuked them and then taught them:<br><br><i>And beginning at Moses and all the prophets, heexpounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself.</i><br><br><i>And they drew nigh unto the village, whither they went: and he made as though he would have gone further.</i><br><br><i>But they constrained him, saying, Abide with us: for it is toward evening, and the day is far spent. And he went in to tarry with them.</i><br><br><i>And it came to pass, as he sat at meat with them, he took bread, and blessed it, and brake, and gave to them.</i><br><br><i>And their eyes were opened, and they knew him; and he vanished out of their sight.</i><br><br><i>And they said one to another, Did not our heart burn within us, while he talked with us by the way, and while he opened to us the scriptures?</i>[Luke 24:27–32]<br><br>As Moses recounts, "Mine own eyes have beheld God; but not my natural, but my spiritual eyes" (Moses 1:11).<br><br>Oftentimes we forget that we cannot have everything, that decisions narrow our focus and become a compass toward our future. We not only include certain activities, certain thoughts, or certain actions when we make decisions, but we also exclude many options. Indeed, we set a course of action whose outcome we have tried to predict and whose outcome will have certain results. It is never perfect or exact. It is always an approximation to the desired outcome, with some unknown consequence.<br><br>In Bernard Shaw's<i>Saint Joan,</i>the chaplain enters after just witnessing the burning of Joan of Arc. He realizes he was manipulated and used, thus causing this good person's death at the stake. The chaplain enters from the courtyard, where her execution has just occurred:<br><br><i>I let them do it. If I had known, I would have torn her from their hands. You don't know: you haven't seen: it is so easy to talk when you don't know. You madden yourself with words: you</i>[condemn]<i>yourself because it feels grand. . . . But when it is brought home to you; when you see the thing you have done; when it is blinding your eyes, stifling your nostrils, tearing your heart. . . . Take away this sight from me! . . . Deliver me from this fire that is consuming me.</i>[George Bernard Shaw,<i>Saint Joan,</i>scene VI]<br><br>In 1988 I concluded more than 10 years of service to the Hill Cumorah Pageant as a technical director responsible for lighting. It was an experience that is hard to relate, but it had a profound effect on my life and on my family. My wife made great sacrifices as I would leave for six to seven weeks each summer and establish residence in Palmyra, New York. Frequently I would take one of our five children. During that time we would talk of the early days of the Church, visit the Sacred Grove, and speak of the Lord. Each year we would hear the story of the Book of Mormon recounted 30 to 40 times. My children became knowledgeable and enjoyed telling the stories and scenes portrayed in the pageant. At home we would discuss current events and how they related to principles and examples found within the Book of Mormon. Frequently in their early years they would act out their favorite scenes. Both my wife and I knew that such service was no sacrifice.<br><br>Let me tell you about an incident that happened a few years prior to my release. One of the members in Rochester, New York, was a chemist working with Eastman Kodak. He had taken many pictures of the pageant over the years, and one of the professional photographers at Kodak had seen some of his work. The photographer was most impressed and offered to photograph the pageant using some extremely large equipment. Arrangements were made, and the pictures were to be completed following one of the regular performances. As occasionally would happen, the local farmers were blessed with a light drizzle--actually it was more of a mist. It had been one of those days that dispel the rumor that it never rains during the pageant--a rumor that is a little wet.<br><br>Upon our arrival the next year, the picture, which spanned a wall about 6–8 feet high and 15–18 feet long, was in a room within the visitors' center. We were ushered in for the unveiling of the print. Needless to say, it was overwhelming. The photographer had captured all of the spirit and beauty of the final yearning scene. I was most excited because my oldest daughter had been with me that year and was onstage just right of the center of the picture. As I was looking at this impressive picture, I suddenly became very quiet and somewhat withdrawn. There were approximately 600 cast members in the pageant that year. I noticed a problem with the third or fourth cast member from the end in the lower right side of the picture. One cast member wanted to be in the picture, wanted to be warm, dry, and comfortable, and did not want to stay in his wet costume. It was evident from the picture that he had changed into some jeans and a long-sleeve shirt and had slipped a light brown trash bag, in which he had torn holes for his head and arms, over his jeans. He also wanted to be seen in the picture and placed himself directly in front of a light. He wanted it all. Obedience and adherence to instructions were not as important as his emotional needs. Kodak had intended to use this picture in a publication as well as in an extremely large display. The picture was now useless--costly in both time and money. Eastman Kodak was gracious enough to repeat the process the following year.<br><br>The Lord does not require us to understand, nor perhaps to initially agree: The Lord requires us to obey. "To obey is better than sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of rams" (1Samuel 15:22). As Christ has said: "If ye love me, keep my commandments" (John 14:15).<br><br>Karl Popper, an acclaimed philosopher, once concluded that man knows a great deal and that man's ignorance is "sobering and boundless" (David Miller,<i>Popper Selections</i>[New Jersey: Princeton University Press, 1985], epigraph). There is much I do not know. There is much I am ignorant in my knowledge about. However, I do know that God does live; that Jesus Christ is the Savior of mankind, the Son of God; that through him we may become like him; and that our sins "shall be as white as snow" (Isaiah 1:18).<br><br>I know and bear witness that Gordon B. Hinckley is a prophet of God and stands as the president of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. I solemnize that he is not only president, prophet, seer, and revelator, but he holds all the keys and rights of the priesthood. I testify that Thomas Monson and James Faust are prophets, seers, and revelators, as well as are the members of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. I testify that their interest is tonot only show us the way to return to our Father in Heaven, but also to guide us through the tumultuous elements of our mortal existence. I know that we can never fail if we follow exactly and precisely the counsel of those who have been chosen by God, through revelation, as our leaders. As the Lord has said, "Whether by mine own voice or by the voice of my servants, it is the same" (D&amp;amp;C 1:38).<br><br>I testify these things are true. I pray the Lord's richest blessings on all. I pray for peace in your hearts and your souls. I pray that you may have the strength and courage to always do the right thing, to make the right choices, and to be obedient to the laws and commandments of God. I pray for your safety and happiness now and forever, in the name of Jesus Christ, our Savior.

<h1>ities: Faith, Opposition, and Friends - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Good morning, my brothers and sisters. Thank you for being here today. I pray that we may share some insights that will lift and encourage our spirits and help us in our pursuit of excellence. My message is based on a statement made by Elder Jeffrey R. Holland back in the fall of 1981, when he stated: "The opportunity of a lifetime has to be taken in the lifetime of the opportunity" ("Virtus et Veritas," in<i>BYU 1981–82 Fireside and Devotional Speeches</i>[Provo: Brigham Young University, 1982], p. 12). This morning let us look at opportunity in light of faith, opposition, and friendly support.<br><h2><b>Faith</b></h2><br>Some opportunities in our lives may take place over time. Some opportunities occur in a moment suddenly with a phone call, an interview with a member of the bishopric or stake presidency, or a similar means of invitation. Nearly all of these opportunities require one degree or another of our faith and personal convictions. Such an opportunity came unexpectedly to me a while back.<br><br>One morning a very dear friend of mine called me long distance and told me that she was scheduled to go to Perth, Australia, to deliver two hour-and-a-half keynote addresses and present a half-day workshop for a national conference. People would be attending the conference from all over Australia. Her assignment did not surprise me, considering her eminence and position. Then she said, "Sally, I can't go. I am scheduled for surgery on my back, and my doctor has told me that it would be altogether too dangerous for me to travel at this time. Will you go and cover for me?"<br><br>As you can imagine, this suggestion put me into a mild shock. I had enough sense to ask, "When are you scheduled to go?"<br><br>"Tomorrow," she said.<br><br>Experience has taught me that major decisions in life should generally not be made spontaneously, so I told her I would call her back in an hour. I sat for a few minutes and simply shook. Then I told my husband and counseled with him about it; I consulted the Lord about it; and then I called my department chair, for this was the end of winter semester, and though all classes were over, we were just going into final exams.<br><br>My department chair said, "Go ahead and do it."<br><br>Since I had made commitments relative to BYU graduation exercises, I called my dean and told him about this opportunity. "Go do it," he counseled.<br><br>Amazingly, I felt spiritually at peace about the task, and so I called my friend and said: "Tell me again about the timing on this Australian commitment."<br><br>"Well," she admitted, "I did agree to give some smaller workshops in Sydney prior to the national conference in Perth. The conference itself is in four days."<br><br>So I told her to call her friends in Sydney and tell them that she would come visit them when she was able to; I would take care of the national conference.<br><br>From the time I agreed to take care of the conference, a spiritual cloak of support and peace came over me. From that time on everything moved with smoothness and incredible efficiency. My husband informed me that I had a valid visa for Australia and my passport was current, both of which were essential for my speedy departure.<br><br>For the Australian conference my friend had prepared to give one keynote address on the topic of brain research, and I knew that where I was concerned that topic had to change, but all the other topics could be presented as scheduled. It was fortunate that I had already either taught classes, written articles, or given presentations on the keynote and workshop topics, and I just needed to change their orientation and focus a little.<br><br>It did not take long for me to discover that I was in fact on the Lord's errand. Unexpectedly faith-promoting experiences occurred for me throughout that short week. Let me briefly share two of the more profound occurrences. When I arrived in Perth, I was met by a colleague who took me to the lovely room that was provided for me. He asked if I might like to go out to the college and look over the auditorium where I would be speaking. I thought it a splendid suggestion. We drove quite a way out to the campus, and when we arrived at the building in which the main plenary sessions would be given, I found to my delight that they would be held in the chapel of the college. A custodian met us at the door and let us in. The podium and stand of the large chapel were in the center of the far wall, and on either side of the podium were windows floor to ceiling overlooking a beautiful lake and lovely trees. This was an amazing and inspiring setting. My host invited me to step up to the podium so that we could check out the audiovisual equipment. On the podium was one of the largest Bibles that I have ever seen, opened and inviting.<br><br>"Read something, and let's check out the sound system," he said.<br><br>I looked down at the Bible and read the first verse that came to my sight: "But covet earnestly the best gifts: and yet shew I unto you a more excellent way" (1 Corinthians 12:31).<br><br>I was stunned. I looked at my host and wondered if earlier in the morning he had deliberately opened the Bible to that page containing a scripture that was the essence of my message there in Perth, but he had no way of knowing what I would read, and the room had been locked when we arrived.<br><br>The next day when I delivered my first keynote address, there was a heckler in the audience. The local people knew about him and anticipated his behavior, but I did not. He was a brilliant and gifted but undisciplined maverick. He kept asking questions that challenged the validity of my remarks. Atone point he said, "What makes you think there is any such thing as gifts or giftedness?"<br><br>Immediately the incident from the day before came to mind and was so fresh in my thinking that I cited the scripture and told him that the scriptures verified the existence of gifts and our responsibilities relative to these gifts. The heckler remained silent for the rest of the session. Afterward it occurred to me that ordinarily I would never have dared to bring in scriptures or direct religious dialogue at a national conference. At lunch I was cornered by some people who asked me how I dared to mix the spiritual with the academic, and I told them that I genuinely believed there was nothing that was not basically spiritual.<br><br>Another profound incident occurred when my hosts told me that a picture had been requested by the local newspaper. They wanted to take my picture with a gifted child. "Fine," I said. "This should be easy, for probably any child will do for the picture."<br><br>"Not so," they said. "We need a gifted child; wait and see what happens." I told them to locate the child, and I would cooperate as requested. Later they called and told me that they had a gifted five-year-old boy scheduled, and he would be there in the morning for a photo session. As I was thinking of this meeting, I wondered what I might give this small boy as a gift from America. As a general practice I take a few things with me that can be used as thank-you or friendship gifts. I had brought with me three small jars of Bear Lake raspberry jam and a couple of beautiful calendars. I did not think any of these items would necessarily appeal to a five-year-old boy. Then I reflected back to my hurried departure from home when I had cleaned out my purse and replaced only those items that I felt were needed on the trip. At the last minute I had included an item that could serve as a gift for this little boy.<br><br>In the morning the little boy came with his mother. There were also two people from the newspaper. One interviewed the mother while the other one came with me across the street with the small boy. We sat down on a bench by a beautiful river with black swans nearby. While the photographer took pictures, this small boy told me about the orbiting procedures of spaceships as he showed me the book he was reading. At a quiet time I told this little boy that I had brought him a magic ring from America.<br><br>"Magic? Is it really magic?" he asked.<br><br>I told him that it was not magic as most people think of magic, but that it could do magical things for him. We put the ring on his finger, and I asked him to identify the letters on the ring. He did so, and I told him what the letters represented. "Whenever you have an important decision to make, look down at your ring, and it will remind you to "Choose the Right" and to base your decisions on important principles."<br><br>He was entranced with his ring and could not take his eyes off it. When we returned to meet with his mother, he ran up and told her about his ring. "Oh, my," I thought, "his mother could be quite upset over this."<br><br>But the mother listened intently to her son and then turned to me and, with gratitude showing in her eyes, simply said, "Thank you." Somewhere in Perth, Australia, is a small and very gifted little boy with a Primary CTR ring.<br><br>My week was filled with these amazing experiences, and once again I was taught the importance of faith and prayer. When you are in partnership with the Lord you can accomplish wonders far beyond your acknowledged abilities. You are, however, expected to do your part: to exercise faith, self-discipline, and courage. I cannot emphasize enough the value of taking advantage of worthy opportunities for growth and preparation as they come to you so that you may be in a position to take advantage of later opportunities. Had I not consented to participate in prior challenging tasks, I would not have been even remotely prepared to accept this amazing opportunity in Perth, Australia.<br><br>Faith, testimony, and accumulated good experiences are important for personal growth. You may wonder why you are called upon to do certain things. You, too, need to pray your way through requirements and opportunities. You may have opportunities placed before you that require a great deal of courage and faith. My counsel is: It is worth whatever sacrifice is needed. Go ahead and accept that Church calling. If the Spirit confirms it, take advantage of that personal or professional opportunity. To grow we must reach, stretch, and take necessary risks. Let the Lord be your partner in all your righteous endeavors, and he will support and sustain you. And be of good faith and courage. Trust in the Lord, even in the face of opposition and trial. We never know the role of opposition in our development and growth.<br><h2><b>Opposition</b></h2><br>Opposition reminds me of a favorite parable that has influenced my life profoundly over the years. It will be an old friend to some of you and perhaps a new friend to others. This is Brother James E. Talmage speaking:<br><br><i>Sometimes I find myself under obligations of work requiring quiet and seclusion such as neither my comfortable office nor the cozy study at home insures. My favorite retreat is an upper room in the tower of a large building, well removed from the noise and confusion of the city streets. The room is somewhat difficult of access, and relatively secure against human intrusion. Therein I have spent many peaceful and busy hours with books and pens.</i><br><br><i>I am not always without visitors, however, especially in summertime; for, when I sit with windows open, flying insects occasionally find entrance and share the place with me. These self-invited guests are not unwelcome. Many a time I have laid down the pen, and, forgetful of my theme, have watched with interest the activities of these winged visitants, with an afterthought that the time so spent had not been wasted, for, is it not true, that even a butterfly, a beetle, or a bee, may be a bearer of lessons to the receptive student?</i><br><br><i>A wild bee from the neighboring hills once flew into the room; and at intervals during an hour or more I caught the pleasing hum of its flight. The little creature realized that it was a prisoner, yet all its efforts to find the exit through the partly opened casement failed. When ready to close up the room and leave, I threw the window wide, and tried at first to guide and then to drive the bee to liberty and safety, knowing well that if left in the room it would die as other insects there entrapped had perished in the dry atmosphere of the enclosure. The more I tried to drive it out, the more determinedly did it oppose and resist my efforts. Its erstwhile peaceful hum developed into an angry roar; its darting flight became hostile and threatening.</i><br><br><i>Then it caught me off my guard and stung my hand--the hand that would have guided it to freedom. At last it alighted on a pendant attached to the ceiling, beyond my reach of help or injury. The sharp pain of its unkind sting aroused in me rather pity than anger. I knew the inevitable penalty of its mistaken opposition and defiance; and I had to leave the creature to its fate. Three days later I returned to the room and found the dried, lifeless body of the bee on the writing table. It had paid for its stubbornness with its life.</i><br><br><i>To the bee's short-sightedness and selfish misunderstanding I was a foe, a persistent persecutor, a mortal enemy bent on its destruction; while in truth I was its friend, offering it ransom of the life it had put in forfeit through its own error, striving to redeem it, in spite of itself, from the prison-house of death and restore it to the outer air of liberty.</i><br><br><i>Are we so much wiser than the bee that no analogy lies between its unwise course and our lives? We are prone to contend, sometimes with vehemence and anger, against the adversity which after all may be the manifestation of superior wisdom and loving care, directed against our temporary comfort for our permanent blessing. In the tribulations and sufferings of mortality there is a divine ministry which only the godless soul can wholly fail to discern. . . . Disappointment, sorrow, and affliction may be the expression of an all-wise Father's kindness.</i><br><br><i>Consider the lesson of the unwise bee!</i>["The Parable of the Unwise Bee,"<i>The Parables of James E. Talmage,</i>comp. Albert L. Zobell, Jr. (Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Company, 1973), pp. 29–31]<br><br>How often do we fight against opposition and misjudge the trials of our lives? Might this not be a wise Father in Heaven or mentor, teacher, or friend trying to help guide us to freedom, success, and perhaps life itself? Again we need to exercise our faith and prayers:<br><br><i>Trust in the Lord with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding.</i><br><br><i>In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths.</i>[Proverbs 3:5–6]<br><br>I believe this scriptural counsel with all my heart. I also believe that there is wonderful power waiting behind us spiritually to help us to be successful. I hope I never forget the quote I saw one day on a bulletin board in the Provo Temple: "The power behind you is far stronger than any opposition before you."<br><br>And, related to this, I believe another quote that was taught to me years ago: "Life is full of wonderful opportunities brilliantly disguised as insolvable problems."<br><h2><b>Friendly Support</b></h2><br>There are amazing support systems and incredible people available and ready to help us solve our problems and to help us take advantage of our opportunities. Let's consider a few resources on our BYU campus alone that serve us so well.<br><br>I think of Wayne Peterson of the Department of Physics and Astronomy who has devoted hours of his professional and personal life preparing wonderful visual examples of physics principles so that you and I can be taught by the physics faculty through visual and auditory means. This is very important to the learning styles of those many of us who appreciate more than the printed page.<br><br>Dr. Campbell Gray, Herman Du Toit, Ellen Powley, and other professionals associated with the BYU Museum of Art are devoting their time to provide inspiring and aesthetic experiences for us in the areas of the fine arts. If you listen to their dreams for you, you will be amazed at the opportunities the museum provides now and will in the future. I hope you take advantage of these wonderful exhibits. The Masada and the Dead Sea Scrolls exhibits are there now.<br><br>You could hear similar altruistic objectives from Duane Smith and Doug Cox at the Monte L. Bean Life Science Museum. They are putting in a sesquicentennial exhibit so that we can focus on the animals the pioneers may have known. This will be another good exhibit to visit. I am sure similar encouraging goals have been established by others of the museums on campus. We have some great museums.<br><br>Amazing opportunities are made available to us in the Harris Fine Arts Center. Sometime back I came over to campus to attend a theatrical production and was aware that there were three drama productions, two major musical concerts, an art exhibit, and a TV telecast in the Harris Fine Arts Center simultaneously. There were three film showings and two dance productions taking place that evening elsewhere on campus. How often do we take advantage of the splendid cultural opportunities in our area?<br><br>Are we consciously aware of the amazing people and invaluable services being rendered in our behalf in the Administration Building? Admissions, Registration, Records, Financial Services, Employment, University Police, Graduation Evaluation, Academic Advisement, Scholarships, Purchasing, Travel Services, Benefits, School Relations, Job/Career Placement, Public Communications, and others are located in that building. All the people in these areas are working hard to be mentors and to provide support services for you.<br><br>The Ernest L. Wilkinson Center offers another amazing set of resources with the Bookstore, Dining Services, Multicultural Services, Scheduling, Student Service Association, Campus Craft, Cougar Creations,<i>Daily Universe</i>offices, barbershop, and post office. I have sincerely appreciated Alex Hunter and the team at Catering and in the Skyroom, as well as the staff at the Games Center, ID Center, Information Center, Varsity Theatre, Outdoors Unlimited, Off-Campus Housing, and the Lost and Found.<br><br>The Harold B. Lee Library provides an amazing set of resources for us, too. There are more than 50 categories of services available. It has been my experience that each of these services are rendered with expertise and courtesy.<br><br>Under the capable leadership of Ron J. Clark, the wonderful people in Public Affairs and Guest Relations provide hospitality to special visitors, give campus tours, and correlate special events, commencement, the president's hosting activities, and the United Way. If you have not taken the campus tour, you are missing a real treat. When you have a guest on campus, schedule your time so you can go on the tour with them.<br><br>In the University Press Building are support staff who oversee all copy centers on campus, print 99 percent of the packets for classes and some of the textbooks, and in general take care of the university's printing needs. They are a great team.<br><br>We should be very grateful how Media Services enriches our lives and supports our learning. Films, videos, and tapes are delivered to our classrooms with efficiency and quiet service. I for one have appreciated Julie Cloward, Keven Williamson, Glenda Judy, Marlae Rindlisbacher, and others of their colleagues who have gone out of their way to help me with audiovisual needs over the years.<br><br>Most recently we have been developing a CD-ROM with an amazing team of gifted technicians under Curt Fawson's leadership at the Instructional Technology Center. This has been a wonderful new growing opportunity for me. I had no idea of the potential for CD-interactive learning packages. You, too, have access to this instructional technology to help you solve teaching and visual resource needs.<br><br>In our David O. McKay School of Education we have remarkable people in support services. Our Education Advisement Center personnel have been wise and wonderful over the years in helping students as they initiate and progress in their undergraduate academic programs. This is likely true across campus in the various advisement centers. I hope you take advantage of this capable assistance.<br><br>As faculty in the School of Education we have been blessed with wonderful resource people to help us in our scholarly productivity: Sharon Black, our very wise editor; Steve Burton, our knowledgeable CSR (Computing Support Representative); Dr. Adrian VanMondfrans, who established the Undergraduate Research Trainees Program; Helen Hoopes in our Learning Resource Center; and Julie Cloward in our Media Services. I don't know what we would do without this team of specialists.<br><br>We could mention innumerable other colleges and services on this campus: for example, Don Kopp in Motor Pool or Lynn Sorenson and Russ Osguthorpe at the Faculty Center, professionals at the Alumni House, Harman Continuing Education Building, Health Center, Faculty Center, Snell Building, Clyde Building, Richards Building, Smith Fieldhouse, and many others--all providing a means of support in the fulfilling of our opportunities.<br><br>Wherever we live we need to identify and take advantage of the wonderful resources and the amazing people working in them. How many resources are available in your life to help you take advantage of your opportunities? And how strong is your faith to follow through with these opportunities?<br><br>Remember, the Lord has counseled us: "Wherefore, be of good cheer, and do not fear, for I the Lord am with you, and will stand by you" (D&amp;amp;C 68:6).<br><br>In closing, I'll read what Richard L. Evans wisely counseled:<br><br><i>That we shall move quickly or that we shall perform spectacularly is not of first importance--but that we shall move surely and safely from moment to moment, from hour to hour, and from day to day, is the procedure for all who would reach their highest possibilities, for after the portals of this life open and close behind us, we shall still have ourselves to live with, and our performance to account for.</i>[Richard L. Evans, "M.I.A. Theme,"<i>Improvement Era,</i>September 1947, p. 604]<br><br>I pray that we may have sufficient faith in the Lord, courage of our convictions, self-discipline, and trust to take advantage of our opportunities as they come. May we appreciate and be humble enough to cooperate with the wonderful people around us who are available and willing to help us. May we take advantage of the opportunities of our lives in the lifetime of those opportunities is my prayer in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Sally M.

<h1>ng Journeys: Then and Now - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Yesterday morning I awoke in a comfortable bed and breakfast establishment in Cambridge, England. I was some 6,000 miles away from Utah. My one-day journey home required a taxi ride to the Cambridge train station, a short train ride into and through London, and another train ride south to Gatwick Airport. After checking my luggage, which would be handled by others for me, I boarded a modern jet airliner. After about 13 hours of flying in a temperature-controlled environment, I was back in Utah. With the exception of making a few connections and watching for ever-present pickpockets, my major concerns related to choosing my food and beverage and what movie to watch or music to listen to. I chose to read most of the journey, with the convenience of a modern bathroom close by and a telephone easily available if I wished to communicate with loved ones anywhere in the world.<br><br>If your travel experiences are anything like mine, it is very hard to compare or relate our modern journeys with those of the early Mormon pioneers. It is true that I covered the same distance and even the same general route, but at 550 miles per hour it was a long way from the dozen or so miles traveled in a whole day in a jolting, dusty covered wagon. But my journey of some 17 total hours, most of which was at seven miles above the earth, cannot be compared to those of our pioneer ancestors, whose trek to the Salt Lake Valley from England took about six months.<br><br>Then, too, so few members of the Church today have ancestors who crossed the plains before 1869, when the transcontinental railroad was completed and the journey became much easier. And with more of the membership increasingly non-American, such an identification becomes more problematical. Members in Hungary or Tahiti probably have little connection with handcarts or buffalo chips. Is it the physical distances covered and the endurance of the accompanying hardships that define a pioneering experience? If so, how are we of the modern Church to relate more personally to the pioneer sesquicentennial? Does making our own soap and candles make us pioneers? What are the enduring lessons for all of us?<br><h2><b>Overview of Mormon Migration</b></h2><br>Even before the first wagons pulled out of Nauvoo in February 1846, more than 4,000 English converts had gathered to western Illinois. Traveling from Liverpool to New Orleans and then up the Mississippi River, they had responded to the message of Mormon missionaries that required baptism and confirmation as well as a physical movement to the American Zion. Gathering out of the world was signified by their baptism and membership in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. And gathering to be where the Lord's prophet and his people were was as much a part of conversion as was baptism. Both worked together to require new members to create a community of the faithful who, in time, would establish a latter-day Zion. Wherever the Mormons gathered, they built communities wherein Saints could be made. This was what Joseph Smith had in mind when he taught that we "ought to have the building up of Zion as our greatest object" (<i>Teachings,</i>p.160).<br><br>Following the deaths of Joseph and Hyrum Smith in June 1844, increased pressure was placed on Church leaders to abandon Nauvoo. Escalating violence led to the decision during the winter of 1845–46 to move west. In fact,Brigham Young had ordered the establishment of 25 companies of 100 wagons each in October 1845, thus planning one massive 2,500-wagon caravan for the spring of 1846. Although Mormon leaders anticipated a springtime departure,the first wagons left Nauvoo on February 4, 1846, beginning the 265-mile trek across Iowa to their "Winter Quarters." The move across Iowa involved a number of groupings: (1) from March to June Brigham Young led about 3,000 people; (2) in the spring, about 10,000 members left Nauvoo; and (3) in the fall about 700 of the poorest members were forced from Nauvoo. About 16,000 members would make the Iowa crossing between 1846 and 1853.<sup>1</sup>It was in the crossing of Iowa that the early members became pioneers. Short though the distance seems, it was hard going, very challenging, and tragic for many families. William Clayton's pioneering anthem "Come, Come, Ye Saints" (<i>Hymns,</i>1985, no. 30) is a powerful reminder of this part of our early history.<sup>2</sup><br><br>The Latter-day Saints would establish about 100 communities in the Missouri River Valley, mostly on the eastern side of the river across from present-day Omaha, Nebraska. Winter Quarters was laid out on the west side of the river, and it was modeled with some variation after the plat of the city of Zion that Joseph Smith had sent to the Saints in Jackson County, Missouri, in 1833. On the eastern side of the river, Kanesville would serve as the quasi-headquarters and outfitting point of the Mormon migration from 1847 to 1852, especially after Winter Quarters was abandoned in 1848. It was in this area that the Mormon Battalion was enlisted for service in the Mexican-American War in 1846. It was in the Kanesville Tabernacle that Brigham Young was sustained in 1847 as the second president of the Church. The community also established a newspaper,<i>The Frontier Guardian,</i>published by the apostle Orson Hyde. During this period Mormon Indian policy was more fully implemented. After the Mormons left, the community was renamed Council Bluffs. The full story of this part of our history has yet to be told.<br><br>In April 1847 the pioneer company whose arrival in the Salt Lake Valley we are celebrating this month left Winter Quarters for the Great Basin. Led by Brigham Young and organized according to the principles spelled out in D&amp;amp;C 136, the company's journey has been well documented by such records as those kept by Thomas Bullock, William Clayton, and Orson Pratt. But it was not a typical pioneer company: it was 98 percent male, whereas most all subsequent companies were 51 percent male. It was, by later standards, an older group: where the first company's average age was 32, the average age of the other 1847 companies was 21.<sup>3</sup>But the original company was exactly that: a pioneering company whose observations, decisions, and subsequent leadership would set the pattern for those who followed.<sup>4</sup><br><br>A great many did. There were about 224 overland companies of Mormon emigrants from 1847 to 1868, containing about 62,000 people. When this number is considered with the 226 companies involved in ocean crossings during the same period,we clearly had a large number of pioneering journeys. We ought not just concentrate on the overland crossings: one woman said that she would rather cross the Great Plains 10 times rather than cross the Atlantic Ocean once!<br><br>A large number of contemporary and reminiscent accounts of Mormon pioneering treks have survived. Much more time and literature has been devoted to the physical trek itself, and we have reminders of it almost everywhere we look this month. My point today is that the physical journey was only the outward and thus more easily measured manifestation of the pioneer experience. But I would suggest that the journey was a symbol of something deeper, and it is that part of the pioneering journey we can more easily relate to. Today I would like to consider other perspectives on the pioneer experience.<br><h2><b>Journey as Exodus</b></h2><br>Whereas we tend to think of Brigham Young as the Mormon Moses, it is even more appropriate to see Joseph Smith as the Moses of Latter-day Israel. This is true in his role as a lawgiver and revealer of scripture. But he was also a leader of people and a community builder.<br><br>It is increasingly recognized just how pervasive the world of the Old Testament was in early Mormonism. The Book of Mormon and its people came directly out of this world, and many of its themes are more clearly understood within this context. Consider such examples as the early Mormon emphasis on such topics as prophets, patriarchs, temples, tabernacles, and plural marriage--to only mention the most obvious. The appearance in the Kirtland Temple in 1836 of prophets of ancient Israel who delivered priesthood keys to Joseph and his associates also serves to remind us of the intimate relationship Mormons have with the ancient Israelites (see D&amp;amp;C 110).<br><br>One of the key themes in the Book of Mormon is that of<i>exodus:</i>the departure of groups into the wilderness under divine commandment and guidance.<sup>5</sup>Thus the departure of Lehi and his family from Jerusalem and Nephi's own departure from his rebellious brothers were conscious imitations of Israel's earlier flight into the wilderness where they could be free from persecution to establish a righteous society. Of course the journey into the wilderness was a conscious rejection of the world they left behind;but it was also a journey during which they could develop into more righteous followers of God.<br><br>Although the followers of Laman and Lemuel could never believe Jerusalem was a wicked place, Nephi's followers rejoiced in their journeyings in the wilderness. The Lord led the people out of the land of Jerusalem "that I might raise up unto me a righteous branch" (Jacob 2:25), and Jacob described his people therefore being "a lonesome and a solemn people,wanderers" (Jacob 7:26). Alma reminds his people that "because of our being wanderers in a strange land; therefore, we are thus highly favored" (Alma 13:23). Wandering and being blessed went together. Biblical scholars suggest that the word<i>habri,</i>which we translate as "Hebrew,"literally means "wanderer or outsider." Thus Abraham, the Father of the Faithful, was a wanderer. And Paul suggested in his first-centuryEpistle to the Hebrews that they were "strangers and pilgrims on the earth" seeking a better country or a heavenly city (see Hebrews 11:13–16).<br><br>Enoch was the ultimate model of the wanderer who gathered a righteous people together and then eventually obtained this heavenly city. Joseph Smith, whose code name in the early sections of the Doctrine and Covenants was Enoch, consciously sought the same for his people. The early Mormon quest to establish the city of Zion was directly related to this scriptural heritage. In an early revelation (7 March 1831), the Enoch story was presented anew:<br><br><i>And even so I have sent mine everlasting covenant into the world, to be a light to the world, and to be a standard for my people, and for the Gentiles to seek to it, and to be a messenger before my face to prepare the way before me.</i><br><br><i>Wherefore, come ye unto it, and with him that cometh I will reason as with men in days of old, and I will show unto you my strong reasoning.</i><br><br><i>Wherefore, hearken ye together and let me show unto you even my wisdom--the wisdom of him whom ye say is the God of Enoch, and his brethren.</i><br><br><i>Who were separated from the earth, and were received unto myself--a city reserved until a day of righteousness shall come--a day which was sought for by all holy men, and they found it not because of wickedness and abominations;</i><br><br><i>And confessed they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth;</i><br><br><i>But obtained a promise that they should find it and see it in their flesh.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 45:9–14]<br><br>Much of the early Mormon experience was focused on establishing a latter-day Zion.<sup>6</sup>The first Camp of Israel, which was also called Zion's Camp, was an organized attempt of early leaders to recover Church property in their appointed Zion in Jackson County, Missouri, from which early members had been forcefully expelled. The some 205 individuals were organized in Kirtland, Ohio, after the organization of ancient Israel, into companies of 100s, 50s, and 10s by Joseph Smith.<sup>7</sup>He led the march personally and sought to instruct those members about their priesthood duties. Brigham Young, appointed as a captain of 10 on this 1834 trek, recalled later in his life that it was then he first learned how to lead Israel:<br><br><i>I have travelled with Joseph a thousand miles</i>[as]<i>he has led the Camp of Israel. I have watched him and observed every thing he said or did . . . for the town of Kirtland I would not give the knowledge I got from Joseph on this Journey; and then you may take the State of Ohio and the United States, and I would not give that knowledge for them. It has done me good . . . and this was the starting point of my knowing how to lead Israel.</i><sup>8</sup><br><br>He also recalled that "this was the first time [the Church] had ever travelled in the capacity of a large company, and it was my first experience in that mode of travelling" (<i>JD</i>10:20 [6 October 1862]). Although many returned to Kirtland, Ohio, with negative perceptions of the march, Brigham Young saw the prophetic nature of the experience. He surely saw the continued meaning of such an organization when the Church was again organized into companies of 100s, 50s, and 10s in 1838 in Far West, northern Missouri.<sup>9</sup>Such an organization was used in the Iowa crossing as well, and there ought to have been little question that when President Young turned to the matter of organizing the Mormon exodus from Winter Quarters in 1847 that the same organization for "their journeyings" would be given to the Saints.<br><br><i>The Word and Will of the Lord concerning the Camp of Israel in their journeyings to the West:</i><br><br><i>Let all the people of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and those who journey with them, be organized into companies, with a covenant and promise to keep all the commandments and statutes of the Lord our God.</i><br><br><i>Let the companies be organized with captains of hundreds, captains of fifties, and captains of tens, with a president and his two counselors at their head, under the direction of the Twelve Apostles.</i><br><br><i>And this shall be our covenant--that we will walk in all the ordinances of the Lord.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 136:1–4]<br><br>Although it is true that the Mormons were forced to move west, they understood that their hegira involved more. Brigham Young recalled in 1856:<br><br><i>I said, upon natural principles, that this people had to go to a country that the Gentiles do not desire. . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . This people can only gain strength upon the principle of fleeing to a country where the wicked will not live.</i><sup>10</sup><br><br>As a people called to wander, in the early Latter-day Saint self-understanding this was seen to be at the heart of the mortal experience. As in ancient Israel, the Mormon exodus would create a community of people with shared experiences and memories. The consistent Mormon practice of naming their settlements, both on the trail and later in Utah, after Old Testament place-names is just another index to their worldview.<br><br>In Mormon thought, then and now, the original exodus was that of Adam and Eve--a fall divinely approved that required them to wander away from their Eden because of their choices. Becoming pilgrims had a divine purpose,but it always reminded them that this "lone and dreary world" was not their home. Here they were strangers until they were worthy and prepared to return to their true home. For them the gospel of Jesus Christ was the way back to the world and the relationships they had lost. But here they could be tested; here they could seek, through their personal experience,for the true and the beautiful in contrast to the false and ugly (cf. Articles of Faith 1:13).<br><br>Their external exodus was also paralleled by their need for an internal pilgrimage. Following their partaking of the forbidden fruit, the first question God asked Adam was, "Where art thou?" (Genesis 3:9). Clearly not just a question of geography, the question was more directed to travelers, as translated in Moses: "Where<i>goest</i>thou?"(Moses 4:15, emphasis added). The need to anchor this wandering in holy places became a consistent theme in scriptural history: the temple was to be the place for learning of our mortal pilgrimage and to make the covenants that give us the knowledge and relationships needed to travel successfully through the wilderness of this fallen world.<sup>11</sup>To travel to the temple, then and now, was to make a personal pilgrimage. To journey was to remember.<br><h2><b>Journey as Remembering</b></h2><br>Jorge Borges, the twentieth-century author, tells the story of a young man he knew in his youth who had suffered a head injury as a result of a fall from a horse.<sup>12</sup>But his injury was unique: instead of amnesia or loss of memory, this individual found that he could not forget anything. As students preparing for exams, you no doubt wish for such a "blessing." But Borges suggests the tragic consequences of this inability to forget: Imagine the experience of seeing a leaf on a tree and being able to remember every other leaf you had ever seen. Imagine then comparing the veins of each leaf with the marbling on the leather binding of a book you had seen earlier in your life and being able to recall how similar this was to the marbling of the countertop of the drugstore at which you used to get your ice-cream sodas. Then imagine seeing the same structuring in the bark of trees you had laid under as a child or in the countless cloud formations you had observed. Then imagine continuing this mode of remembering into hundreds of objects and topics--it would go on without end because you have a perfect memory of everything you have ever seen. Of course such an injury would be tragic--in large measure because such extensive memory treats everything equally. His friend's memory, Borges says, was like a garbage disposal,because all events and experiences were of the same value; hence, there was no basis for choosing or evaluating them. In such a situation we would drown in details, because to think is to forget a difference, and memory must be selective.<br><br>Thus forgetfulness is a blessing! It surely helps keep us sane, and viewed within our theology, it allows us to reveal where our hearts are by what we choose to think about. Where one's treasure is, there is one's heart,we are told (see Matthew 6:21). All knowledge is not of the same value,and if we do not wish to fill our minds with trivia, we must make careful decisions about what we remember. But to forget the really important things is just as dangerous. So what are we to do?<br><br>In our religion, both covenant-making ordinances and the keeping and studying of sacred records are the major means used to "enlarge the memory of this people" (see Alma 37:8). The instituting of the sacrament by the Savior was done during the celebration of the feast of the Passover, the major ritual associated with the Exodus of Israel from Egypt.<sup>13</sup>Such sacred rituals were important for the group memory of Israel--regularly recalling the saving events of their origins. Jesus refocused and recentered the ritual on his own saving acts by using the bread and wine as symbols of his own infinite sacrifice. As acts of remembrance, covenant-making and covenant-renewal ceremonies such as the partaking of the sacrament have remained in the LDS community one of the critical means of sacred memory.<sup>14</sup>The assumption was central: "They did remember his words; and therefore they went forth, keeping the commandments" (Helaman 5:14). One remembered and then acted upon this knowledge. A critical function of the Holy Ghost,we are told, is to bring all important things to our remembrance (see John14:26). The evil one wants us to forget the important things. He is identified with darkness, which comes in the forgetting of sacred things.<br><br>The sacred acts such as those constituting the temple endowment function the same way. The temple itself in LDS thought offers sacred space where the individual is taught divine cosmology and endowed with knowledge and power from on high. By helping us travelers get our bearings on the universe, these covenants are promises to "give life to knowledge," in that they give individuals direction and promises that can enable them to journey through this life righteously and therefore successfully.<sup>15</sup>The experience itself is a strong reminder that we are pilgrims in mortality, exiled from heavenly parents for wise purposes.<br><br>The trip to the temple is itself a type of a pilgrimage to a holy place. Unless we understand this, we will not understand why members living in Nauvoo would work all day on the construction of the temple and then on their wagons for the westward journey through much of the night. Where the one would prepare them for the physical journey, the other was critical for their spiritual journey. In September 1846 Brigham Young encouraged the Saints during trying times: "Let the fire of the covenant which you made in the House of the Lord burn in your hearts."<sup>16</sup>We must not forget that the concern for construction of a temple anchored both ends of the Mormon westward movement. In Nauvoo Brigham Young worked hard to encourage his people to finish the temple, and one of the first things he did upon entering the Salt Lake Valley was to select a site for another temple. Early members like Sarah Rich understood the deeper meaning of all this. She recalled her experiences in Iowa in 1846:<br><br><i>But many were the blessings we had received in the House of the Lord which has caused us joy and comfort in the midst of all our sorrows and enabled us to have faith in God knowing he would guide us and sustain us in the unknown journey that lay before us, for if it had not been for the faith and knowledge that was bestowed upon us in that temple by the influence and help of the Spirit of the Lord our journey would have been like one taking a leap in the dark. To start out on such a journey in the winter as it were, and in our state of poverty it would seem like walking into the jaws of death but we had faith in our heavenly father and we put our trust in him feeling that we were his chosen people and had embraced his gospel and instead of sorrow we felt to rejoice that the day of our deliverance had come.</i><sup>17</sup><br><br>The temple was the key to the Mormon movement west.<sup>18</sup>Its ordinances tied members to God and to each other through various sacred ordinances and their accompanying covenants of obedience, chastity, sacrifice, and consecration. Temple sealings and adoptions help create, in reality,an extended family.<sup>19</sup>Such rituals were at the heart of the creation of the Mormon community; to see the Mormon exodus only in terms of wagons and western trails is to miss what really held us together as a people. Mormons could understand that the early Christians viewed their lives as a pilgrimage on earth. The Greek word<i>paroikia,</i>which literally means"sojourning in a foreign land," came to designate the fundamental unit of the Christian community, the parish. The Mormon ward, first called that in Nauvoo as a district for voting purposes, came to function as a community in motion during the westward movement. We would not build ward houses until after settling in Utah.<br><br>The great hope at Winter Quarters was that in their journeyings they would "walk in all the ordinances of the Lord" (D&amp;amp;C 136:4). Knowing in 1846 that the disorganization and decomposition of the Mormon community was the greatest challenge facing him, Brigham Young testified of these matters in 1864:<br><br><i>What earthly power can gather a people as this people have been gathered,and hold them together as this people have been held together? It was not Joseph, it is not Brigham, nor Heber, nor any of the rest of the Twelve, nor any of the Seventies and High Priests that does this, but it is the Lord God Almighty that holds this people together, and no other power.</i><sup>20</sup><br><h2><b>Journey as Metaphor</b></h2><br>The metaphor of the pilgrim and wanderer has been very strong in the more secular literature of Western culture. Consider such classics as Homer's<i>The Odyssey,</i>Chaucer's<i>The Canterbury Tales,</i>John Bunyan's<i>The Pilgrim's Progress,</i>or even Melville's<i>Moby Dick</i>. Cervantes'<i>Don Quixote</i>reminds us that we can easily identify with a wandering quest for a better life.<sup>21</sup><br><br>The image of the pilgrim is strong in LDS thought. Several hymns in our first hymnbook (1835) used the metaphor (see hymn no. 3, for example). Parley P. Pratt, on November 25, 1837, wrote his wife Mary Ann from New York City:"But still I am doomed for to wander alone, A stranger, a pilgrim far, far from my friends, No more can I ponder the pleasures of home, Till worn out and weary my pilgrimage ends."<sup>22</sup>From Richmond, Missouri,Willard Richards' family wrote to him in England: "We are pilgrims in a strange land, but we must not hang our harness upon the willow while our Heavenly guide gives us light to go by day and night."<sup>23</sup>In her 1847 overland diary, Eliza R. Snow often turned to poetry to express her feelings. On one such evening she wrote, in part:<br><br><i>Beneath the sparkling concave</i><br><i>When stars in millions come</i><br><i>To cheer the pilgrim strangers</i><br><i>And bid us be at home.</i><sup>24</sup><br><br>Thus when Thomas Bullock, who would be an official recorder of Brigham Young's Camp of Israel in 1847, recorded in his journal when leaving Nauvoo in September 1846 that they had "started our pilgrimage,"<sup>25</sup>he expressed a view common with his exiled companions.<br><br>It seems clear that the pilgrimages of the Middle Ages found their inspiration in the earlier pilgrimages of ancient Israel to the temple in Jerusalem. In the pilgrim literature of Western culture, the hero is usually a stranger to this life--really a wanderer between two worlds and never fully "at home" in this world.<sup>26</sup><br><br>Time does not permit a detailed discussion of these matters or how they relate to my theme today. But people who make pilgrimages, journeys, or treks can generally be classified as one of two types: they are either a tourist or a traveler. We all begin as tourists of a sort, but the real pilgrim becomes a traveler.<sup>27</sup>Whereas this posits ideal types and therefore extremes, a side-by-side comparison is useful. Where the tourist seeks insulation from the world, the traveler seeks new worlds; tourists have surface experiences, travelers have in-depth ones; where the tourist seeks the comfortable, the familiar, the "safe" and standardized package tours, the traveler seeks the genuine and authentic experience that sharpens rather than dulls the senses; where the tourist looks for food and lodging like that at home, the traveler opens his/her world to other cultures; where the tourist seeks entertainment and a "good time"and the tour guide does all the work, the traveler understands that it is very unwise and unhealthy to only seek the comfortable world that he/she has left behind. Thus the traveler moves through both space and time, entering into the history and culture of the people being visited. But the tourist only moves through space and is only able to confirm his/her own previous opinions and worldview. For the tourist it is a "safe" experience; for the traveler it is dangerous because the travel experience opens one up to new worlds and awakens or challenges, as it were, one's opinions and worldview. Paradoxically, such an adventure tends to make tourists experts on their experiences because they already knew what they were going to find,and it simply reminds them just how "good" they have it back home. Laman and Lemuel could never stop thinking about the "good" life back in Jerusalem. But for the traveler, such a pilgrimage is a humbling experience as it requires great empathy with all people and it surely increases our love and tolerance for other cultures and people. For the true traveler,understanding has just begun.<br><br>To travel is to open yourself up to the larger world with all of its wonder and mystery. Our prophets remind us that in mortality we are all to be travelers--that our eternal home is not here, or at least not here yet. "Man has wandered far from his Maker," Brigham Young said (<i>JD</i>9:309 [13 July 1862]). He also taught:<br><br><i>We cannot bear the presence of our Father now; and we are placed at a distance to prove whether we will honor these tabernacles, whether we will be obedient and prepare ourselves to live in the glory of the light,privileges, and blessings of celestial beings.</i><sup>28</sup><br><br>We have been warned not to get too comfortable with the world and not to seek the way of ease and materialism. Where the tourist's views are horizontal or focused on the surface, the traveler's are vertical and continue to invite deeper comprehension rather than the common view of things.<br><br>There is much in this analysis that applies to us as students or Church members. Are we tourists in our studies or in our Church membership? Do we seek the safe and easy answers or the routine in our Church callings? Do our studies dull our senses or excite our minds and spirits? Are we hereto learn how to make money or have we begun our own pilgrimage with a higher vision and understanding of our mortal sojourn? From the beginning the evil one has sought to prevent us from making this journey with all of its attendant struggles and challenges. His goal is still the same, and the more comfortable we are with the world, the less likely we are to move into the wilderness of faith and pilgrimage. What will your own pioneering journey be like? It is a fundamental question for you to consider as you are experiencing some of the richest times of your own mortal journeying.<br><h2><b>Conclusion</b></h2><br>Hosea Stout, after his own journey to the Salt Lake Valley in 1848, commented in his diary:<br><br><i>Thus ends this long and tedious journey from the land of our enemies and I feel free and happy that I have escaped from their midst. But there is many a desolate and sandy plain to cross. Many a rugged sage bed to breakthrough. Many a hill and hollow to tug over and many a mountain and canyon to pass, and many frosty nights to endure in mid-summer.</i><sup>29</sup><br><br>Stout seems to understand that his pioneering journeys were not over. He surely saw more than just physical travels ahead as he and the people sought to create a community of Saints in the western wilderness. This is clearly a part of our heritage that all members, throughout the world, can identify with. The call to discipleship consists of active verbs:<i>ask,seek, knock, listen, serve, love.</i>Above all, the call to discipleship is an invitation to join the pilgrimage as we, under sacred covenants, seek a better world. A common theme in the teachings of the prophets of ancient Israel was to remind their people of the covenants they had made--they had stood at the crossroads in their covenant-making ceremonies and had chosen to follow the paths of righteousness. Even in their failure, Jeremiah, a contemporary of Lehi, noted:<br><br><i>Stand at the crossroads and look;</i><br><i>ask for the ancient paths,</i><br><i>ask where the good way is,and walk in it.</i><br><i>and you will find rest for your souls.</i><br>[See Jeremiah 6:16 in<i>Oxford NIV Scofield Study Bible,</i>New International Version (New York: Oxford University Press, 1984), p. 755]<br><br>As God has promised, we do not have to make the journey alone or without inspired guides. He surely was with the early Mormon pioneers, and he continues to be with us of modern Israel. With Nephi, I testify that as we make our own journey through mortality that we have the support of each other in the covenant community and a God that "will also be your light in the wilderness" (1 Nephi 17:13).<br><br><i>David J.

<h1> Takes Faith - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
My brothers and sisters, I am honored to have been invited to address you in this devotional setting today. As you well know, this year we are celebrating the sesquicentennial of the arrival of the Mormon pioneers in the Salt Lake Valley. The high point of this yearlong commemoration will be witnessed this week not only in Salt Lake City and here in Provo, but throughout the Church all over the world. In conjunction with that commemoration, I have been asked to pay tribute today to those faithful pioneers.<br><br>I feel grossly inadequate to pay proper homage to the pioneers, for I am not a very good historian, nor do I have much pioneer ancestry. I'm quite sure there were no Tops among those pioneer companies of the last century. I do, however, have enormous feelings of reverence and respect for their faith, sacrifice, dedication, and perseverance. It is in that spirit of reverence that I desire to speak to you today in their honor, and I pray that the Spirit of the Lord will attend my words and that we may feel, through a thin veil, a special closeness to those faithful Saints of yesteryear.<br><br>Growing up in Idaho I often viewed the 24th of July as merely a Utah holiday. In addition, my father was a convert to the Church, and so I felt little kinship to the pioneers who crossed the plains. It wasn't until I started to study Church history in depth that I learned that Pioneer Day is not just a Utah holiday and that even I as an Idahoan share a pioneer heritage.<br><br>One hundred and fifty years ago this very day--July 22,<i>not</i>July 24--the advance party of pioneers led by Elder Orson Pratt entered the Salt Lake Valley to make preparations for the rest, who would enter the valley two days later. They dammed a stream and planted the first crops in the valley of the Great Salt Lake. Today we celebrate the 150th anniversary of that landmark event--an event often overshadowed by the events of the 24th of July. Today I stand before you to honor that first group--the July 22 advance party. As a proud Idahoan I am eternally grateful that the first crop those pioneers planted in the soil of the Salt Lake Valley was<i>potatoes.</i>Yes, that's right--potatoes. Now I have a special kinship to those pioneers and a very important reason to celebrate this significant sesquicentennial--July 22--the 150th anniversary of the planting of potatoes by those Mormon pioneers. July 22 should be an Idaho state holiday!<br><br>I stand in awe of the faith and fortitude of those early pioneers. I am truly humbled as I read of their sacrifices and sorrows, and I am inspired by their examples of commitment and consecration. But it actually dishonors them to celebrate their accomplishments and yet fail to learn from them.<br><br>After the death of the Prophet Joseph, the Saints were directed by President Brigham Young to redouble their efforts in working on the temple so they could receive the saving ordinances of the gospel therein. These covenants and blessings would be a guiding influence and a strengthening and sustaining power to the Saints as they faced the hardships of their journey. "Let the fire of the covenant which you made in the House of the Lord burn in your hearts," President Brigham Young urged the pioneers ("Journal History of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints," 28 September 1846, p. 5). Those pioneers we honor this sesquicentennial year had a "fire of faith" and a commitment to covenants that led them across the plains to a promised land just as surely as the cloud by day and pillar of fire by night led the ancient Israelites on their journey.<br><br>One such pioneer who was guided by the "fire of the covenant" was Stillman Pond. He and his family were among the last to leave Nauvoo in September 1846. Having already endured much persecution and harassment from the enemies of the Church, the Pond family was ultimately driven from their Nauvoo home at the point of a bayonet. Without adequate preparation for their trek, they were left without proper food, clothing, and shelter. Their trek across Iowa to Winter Quarters was fraught with almost unimaginable suffering and heartache.<br><br>Snow came early to the Iowa territory that year, making travel extremely difficult. Weakened from trudging through the deep snow, Stillman's pregnant wife, Maria, who had already been afflicted with consumption, then contracted malaria. She, along with every member of her family, suffered greatly from this sickness. Bowed down with grief and aching from the pain and fever of malaria, Maria could no longer walk. Amidst these grim circumstances she gave birth to twin boys who were named Joseph and Hyrum. They both died only a few days later. The deaths of these children coming across the plains from Nauvoo to Winter Quarters were only the beginning of the sacrifice and trials of Stillman Pond.<br><br>With all of the members of the Pond family sick with malaria, Stillman, who was unable to walk or even sit up, lay on his stomach in the bed of his wagon. Bracing himself with one arm and extending his other over the dashboard to hold the reins, he drove his team the last 150 miles. On October 16, 1846, they arrived at Winter Quarters. During the winter there the Pond family continued to suffer. In the space of five days, three more children died. A sixth died a few weeks later:<br><br>Laura Jane Pond, age 14, died of "chills and fever" on December 2, 1846.<br>Harriet M. Pond, age 11, died "with chills" on December 4.<br>Abigail A. Pond, age 18, died "with chills" on December 7.<br>Lyman Pond, age 6, died with "chills and fever" on January 15, 1847.<br><br>Having survived the heartache of burying all of her children, the hardships of the trek across Iowa, and the hunger and privations of a long, hard winter, Stillman's beloved wife, Maria, finally succumbed to her sicknesses on May 17 at Winter Quarters. Yet despite all this, Stillman Pond journeyed onward in the pioneer company led by Elder John Taylor, arriving in the Salt Lake Valley in the early fall of 1847. His testimony of the gospel, his faith in the Lord, and the fire of the covenant that burned in his soul gave him the strength to go on. "I am perfectly satisfied with the authorities of the Church," he wrote in February 1846, "and consider it my indispensable duty to give heed to all things." (See Leon Y. Pond and H. Ray Pond, "Stillman Pond: A Biographical Sketch," typescript copy, LDS Historical Department, pp. 4–5.)<br><br>These early pioneers and the thousands upon thousands of others who followed in the months, years, and decades after 1847 were guided and strengthened by their testimonies of the restored gospel and by the sacred covenants they had made with the Lord. Although the circumstances of our lives today are much different than those of the Saints of 150 years ago, the covenants we have made are the same. We, like they, have covenanted to sacrifice all we have for the cause of Christ and to consecrate all of our means, time, and talents--our very hearts and souls--for the building of the kingdom of God on earth. It still takes faith to be true to those covenants! President Harold B. Lee testified:<br><br><i>I bear witness that until a person has been willing to sacrifice all he possesses in the world, not even withholding his own life if it were necessary for the upbuilding of the kingdom, then only can he claim kinship to Him who gave his life that men might be.</i>[<i>CR,</i>October 1965, p. 131]<br><br>Our challenges and tests today may come in different packaging, but giving<i>all</i>you have to the Lord is still<i>all</i>you have. It still takes faith--the same faith of our pioneer forebears--to keep our covenants: to love God with<i>all</i>our heart, might, mind, and strength. It takes the same faith and commitment today to love God more than mammon and to willingly lay our<i>all</i>on the altar. Being a disciple of Christ today still requires the fire of covenant burning in our hearts and guiding us through our own individual wildernesses of life.<br><br>Many of these pioneers not only had walked away from comfortable homes and farms in Nauvoo and had buried babies in shallow graves on the plains, but they had also made other painful sacrifices because of the fire of faith and the commitment to their covenants that burned within their souls. One such was Catherine Spencer. When she joined the Church, her parents became embittered and angry, disowning her and refusing to allow her to ever return to their home or even to correspond with them. During the Saints' final days in Nauvoo, Catherine became extremely ill. Fearing that she would not be able to survive the difficult journey west, her husband Orson Spencer wrote to her parents asking if they would not take her back into their home and nurse her back to health and care for her until Orson could establish a home in the west with the Church. No answer came to this heartfelt plea.<br><br>At last the time arrived for the Spencers to leave Nauvoo. A bed was made for Catherine in Orson's wagon. As they traveled in the miserable conditions of March 1846, Catherine became sicker and increasingly weak. About five days out from Sugar Camp, they encountered a torrential freezing rainstorm that poured down through the canvas that covered their wagon. It was apparent that Catherine was failing fast. At this discouraging moment a messenger with the latest mail that had earlier arrived at Nauvoo found the couple. In his hand was a letter from Catherine's parents. In the letter they expressed no interest in allowing her to come home or in caring for her unless, as they declared, she "renounce her degrading faith, and she can come back, but never until she does." Without a murmur or complaint, the letter was folded up and put away, and Catherine asked Orson to get his Bible and read to her Ruth 1:16:<br><br><i>And Ruth said, Intreat me not to leave thee, or to return from following after thee: for whither thou goest, I will go; and where thou lodgest, I will lodge: thy people shall be my people, and thy God my God.</i><br><br>As Orson finished reading this passage, a calm, peaceful smile spread over Catherine's face as she closed her eyes and lapsed into the quiet sleep of death. (See Nicholas G. Morgan, "And Thus History Was Made,"<i>Improvement Era,</i>July 1940, p. 399.)<br><br>Caroline Hopkins Clark and her husband, John, had joined the Church in Great Britain and responded to the call of the prophet to gather with the Saints in Zion. The journey by ship was marked by unusually cold and wet weather, poor food, and unsanitary living conditions--all accentuated by severe seasickness. Her journal is laced with many comments such as: "Very wet and cold" (2 May 1866). "We remain very sick. Martha hasn't been able to eat anything since she came" (8 May). After several weeks on the sea, they arrived in New York and began the trek by land to Zion. More hardships and heartaches awaited them. Her diary entry for June 14 reads: "Today's journey is a sad one to us, on account of the death of our dear baby. It grieved us much. . . . John stayed behind to bury her." After finally being united with the Saints in the Salt Lake Valley, Caroline sent a record of their journey along with a letter to the family she left behind in England. To the family and friends who thought her crazy to join with the Mormons and follow them to a desert valley on the American frontier, she wrote:<br><br><i>I have no doubt that when my sisters know that I have lost the baby, they will say, that it would not have died if I had stayed home. There is the same good here as there. . . . She was so well the beginning of the journey, but we know she is safe and that if we prove true to the gospel that we have embraced, that we shall have her again with the others at the resurrection. . . .</i><br><br><i>I dare say you would like to know if we have regretted our journeying. As yet we do not regret the time we left England. If we had the privilege to come back we would not accept it.</i>[<i>Voices from the Past: Diaries, Journals, and Autobiographies</i>(Provo: Campus Education Week, 1980), pp. 69–74]<br><br>The Savior declared: "He that loveth father or mother more than me is not worthy of me: and he that loveth son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me" (Matthew 10:37). Thousands upon thousands of other "pioneers" have demonstrated their discipleship by sacrificing friends and family to follow the Lord and join the Church. It still takes that kind of commitment--that fire of faith--to be disciples of Christ. I stand in admiration of and feel the utmost respect for those pioneers--both in the early days of the Restoration and today--who are true to the testimony of the gospel they have received even when they are turned away by their loved ones. My own father is one of those pioneers I honor today. I will be eternally indebted to the fire of faith that led him to join the Church despite much opposition and persecution from his own family.<br><br>Most of us here today have not had to make those kinds of sacrifices. Most of us are here in these favored circumstances<i>because</i>of our families, not<i>in spite of</i>them. But it still takes faith--pioneer-like faith--to be true to our covenants today.<br><br>William Wilson Sterrett was a different kind of pioneer. He was not driven from his home, nor did he suffer with the Saints at Winter Quarters. He was a pioneer, nonetheless, that we honor and can learn from. Full of gold fever and a spirit of adventure, young William arrived in Salt Lake City on his way to seek his fortune in the goldfields of California. It was during his stay in the valley that he was introduced to Mormonism. "During the winter of 1850," William recorded, "I read the Book of Mormon,<i>Voice of Warning,</i>and some other works, and I became convinced of the truth. The Holy Ghost enlightened my mind to the extent that I knew for myself of the truth, that it was of God." Sterrett explained that many Gentiles wintered over in Salt Lake City before venturing onward to California. Many of these Gentiles, in a desire to fit in and benefit from the hospitality of the Saints, joined the Church during the winter. They were known as "Winter Mormons," for in the spring they bade farewell not only to Salt Lake City but also to their professed beliefs in Mormonism. Despite a burning testimony, William Sterrett purposely delayed his baptism until early May. "I held off," he recalled, "not wishing to be called a 'Winter Mormon'" (<i>Voices from the Past,</i>pp. 53–54).<br><br>It still takes faith to not be a "Winter Mormon." It still takes faith, obedience, and commitment "to stand as witnesses of God at all times and in all things, and in all places that ye may be in, even until death" (Mosiah 18:9). It still takes faith and testimony and the fire of the covenant to be true disciples today, not "cultural converts" or "social Saints." It still takes pioneer-like commitment to not only live the gospel in the comforts of "Happy Valley" but also amidst the summer heat of our sinful society--with its many fiery darts. It still takes faith to remain steadfast in Zion--where live "the pure in heart"--when the glittering goldfields of the world beckon us.<br><br>Niels Johnson first heard about the Mormons when his father one day declared to his mother that he had heard the Mormons preach in their village in Denmark. With his breath reeking of liquor, as was often the case, Niels' father informed his wife that he wanted to join the Mormon Church if she was willing. She told him that she would do just about anything if he would quit drinking. He promised he would if she, too, would join the Church. In January 1857 they were both baptized. Niels Johnson's father kept his promise and never touched tobacco or liquor ever again. This remarkable transformation made such a powerful impression upon their family that 11-year-old Niels desired to join with the Mormons as well. In 1862 the Johnson family left their Danish homeland to join with the Saints in Zion. (See<i>History of Bear Lake Pioneers,</i>comps. Edith Parker Haddock and Dorothy Hardy Matthews [Paris, Idaho: Daughters of Utah Pioneers, Bear Lake County, Idaho, 1968], pp. 324–25.) It took faith for the Johnsons to join the Church. It took consecration and sacrifice to leave behind their Danish home and friends and family members to journey to Zion. It took trust in God and hope in Christ as they buried a son at sea. But perhaps in some way even greater than this, it took the fire of faith and commitment to covenant for Brother Johnson to give up drinking and smoking. As Jesus stated, "If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross daily, and follow me" (Luke 9:23).<br><br>It still takes faith today to take up our crosses. To "take up"--"to pick up, hold aloft, and carry proudly"--the cross of Christ requires that we lay down those things that prevent us from faithfully following Christ. The Joseph Smith Translation provides us with this additional insight: "And now for a man to take up his cross, is to<i>deny himself all ungodliness, and every worldly lust,</i>and keep my commandments" (JST Matthew 16:26; emphasis added). Just as it took faith for our pioneer forebears to make their required sacrifices and endure the hardships they faced, it still takes faith today to turn our backs on "all ungodliness" and "every worldly lust." Today we rightfully honor and revere the examples of faith, determination, and commitment exhibited by these early pioneers.<br><br>It may be, however, that they would not want to trade places with us today. They faced enormous physical hardships, persecution, and opposition that tried their faith and challenged their commitment to the very uttermost. Yet we are not exempt from such tests of faith today. President George Q. Cannon declared:<br><br><i>We may wade through sorrow. We may have to endure persecution. We may have to meet with death. We may have to endure imprisonment and many other things that our predecessors had to endure. God may test us in this manner.</i><br><br><i>Every human being that is connected with this work will have to be tested before he can enter into the Celestial Kingdom of our God. He will try us to the uttermost. If we have any spot more tender than another, He will feel after it. He will test all in some way or other.</i><br><br>President Cannon then further testified:<br><br><i>There is one thing certain, every Latter-day Saint who is faithful to the truth and who lives to the ordinary age of man will have all the opportunities of this kind he or she can desire to gain experience and to have his or her zeal, integrity, courage and devotion to the truth fully exhibited.</i>[<i>Gospel Truth,</i>ed. Jerreld L. Newquist (Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Company, 1987), pp. 301–2]<br><br>Today our challenge in taking up the cross does not involve pulling a heavy handcart over plains and mountains through snowstorms and scorching sun. But "the path of modern pioneers is not easy," as Elder Dallin H. Oaks said. "Burdens carried in the heart can be just as heavy as those pulled in a handcart" ("Modern Pioneers,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 1989, p. 66). It still takes faith to pull our handcarts, figuratively speaking, through the sleaze and slime of today's sex-saturated society and not become mired in the mud of immorality. It still takes sacrifice--supreme self-sacrifice--to "deny [ourselves] all ungodliness," when all around us seem to delight in wallowing in this mud. I have often felt that these pioneers we honor and admire will someday likewise honor and admire us--this latter-day generation--if we can endure the wickedness of the world and remain morally clean. Personal purity today requires just as much faith, commitment, and dedicated discipleship as crossing the plains required of those "blessed, honored, pioneer[s]" ("They, the Builders of the Nation,"<i>Hymns,</i>1985, no. 36).<br><br>Unfortunately, there are many among our "Saturday's warriors"--far, far too many--who have become muddied with immorality. When stuck in the mud, the pioneers didn't remain there. They pushed and pulled and tugged and towed until the wagon was steadied and securely on the path again. Today it still takes faith--faith in the cleansing power of Christ--to submit to the Savior through real repentance, as painful as it might be, so our garments may be "washed white through the blood of the Lamb" (see Alma 13:11–13). It took faith on the part of the pioneers to leave home behind and face an uncertain and difficult journey. Today it takes just as much faith and sacrifice to leave our sins behind us and not give up or give in during the demanding journey of repentance. It takes faith to<i>become</i>clean, and it takes faith to<i>stay</i>clean. Alma admonished his son to teach the people to "withstand every temptation of the devil,<i>with their faith on the Lord Jesus Christ"</i>(Alma 37:33; emphasis added). It still takes pioneer-like faith--faith in the Lord Jesus Christ--to be clean today. To do otherwise is to become swallowed up and to perish in the muddy quicksands of sin.<br><br>Ephraim Hanks was one of those early pioneers, but his pioneering continued long after his arrival in the valley. On a fall morning in 1848, President Brigham Young drove to where Ephraim was building an adobe house inside the old fort in Salt Lake City. Looking over the completed foundation, Brigham quizzed Ephraim concerning the thickness of the rock wall.<br><br>"Eight inches," replied Brother Hanks.<br><br>"Tear it down and build it twice that thick," Brigham declared and then promptly drove away before Ephraim could respond. To do as President Young requested would mean hauling in more rock and doing twice as much work as Ephraim thought necessary. Nevertheless, Ephraim widened the foundation to 16 inches, as the prophet had suggested. A month later a heavy rainstorm caused widespread flooding in the valley, resulting in considerable damage. Hanks' reinforced foundation and walls, however, stood firm against this deluge, preventing a possible collapse of the entire structure. Many other homes in the valley were not so fortunate. From this experience Ephraim learned that when the prophet spoke, he would listen.<br><br>Not long after this incident, Ephraim once again received unsolicited counsel from President Young. At a dance in Salt Lake City, Brother Brigham saw Ephraim and told him to go home and shave his face. Ephraim, like most of the men of his day, had worn a beard virtually his entire adult life. His beard extended almost down to his waist. Somewhat puzzled by this strange request, he left the social and rode home, where he shaved off his beard. Ephraim returned to the dance wearing a newly trimmed moustache. When Brigham saw him, he brushed his hand across Ephraim's face and said he had meant a clean shave. Excusing himself a second time, Brother Hanks complied with the prophet's strange command and shaved off the moustache as well. It was perhaps this type of obedience to counsel that prompted President Brigham Young to later say of Ephraim Hanks, "Here was a man always ready to lay down his life for the authorities of the Church as well as for the cause of Zion and her people." (From Richard K. Hanks, "Eph Hanks, Pioneer Scout" [master's thesis, Brigham Young University, 1973], pp. 26–27.)<br><br>It still takes faith--Ephraim Hanks–like faith--to obey the words of the prophets of God. Concerning our relationship with the prophet, in our dispensation the Lord commanded:<br><br><i>Wherefore, meaning the church, thou shalt give heed unto all his words and commandments which he shall give unto you as he receiveth them, walking in all holiness before me;</i><br><br><i>For his word ye shall receive, as if from mine own mouth, in all patience and faith.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 21:4–5]<br><br>It still takes faith, and especially patience, to obey the counsel and direction given by the Lord's anointed servants to us today--particularly when we don't fully understand or agree with the counsel that comes to us. When the counsel of living prophets "steps on our toes" or inconveniences us in some way, it still takes faith not to "pick and choose" those prophetic counsels we will obey and those we will ignore. As Elder Neal A. Maxwell insightfully observed:<br><br><i>Our relationship to living prophets is</i>not<i>one in which their sayings are a smorgasbord from which we may take only that which pleases us. We are to partake of all that is placed before us, including the spinach, and to leave a clean plate!</i>[<i>Things As They Really Are</i>(Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Company, 1978), p. 74; emphasis in original]<br><br>I find it significant that the vast majority of journal entries of these early pioneers did not deal with accounts of the life-threatening experiences or the sacrifices and hardships that we often hear about. Most of the entries dealt with the mundane, even boring, parts of the journey when nothing eventful happened. I have tried to imagine how difficult it must have been to journey through Nebraska and parts of Wyoming--difficult, in part, because day after day, mile after mile, the scenery remained the same. These pioneers could see far off into the horizon, yet every day it looked as if there had been no progress made. Sometimes it's easier to "gird up our loins" when faced with danger and obvious difficulties than to faithfully keep putting one foot in front of the other when it seems like we are making no progress or when the goal still seems so far away. It took faith and perseverance for those Saints to keep plugging along. It still takes faith to "press forward with a steadfastness in Christ" (2 Nephi 31:20) when our own journey does not seem very eventful or exciting. It still takes pioneer-like faith to do the little things: things such as daily prayer and scripture study, fulfilling a Church calling that we may not think is so important or we don't care for much, or getting out of bed early on Sunday morning to attend our meetings when we've been out late--really late--on Saturday night. It still takes faith to keep nurturing a testimony when we don't seem to have any sensational, spiritual experiences. It still takes faith, like that of those early pioneers, to keep plugging along day by day, step by step--doing the best we can in living the gospel and loving the Lord and our fellowmen.<br><br>Just as those pioneers often felt they were making no real progress on their journey, modern pioneer parents sometimes feel like their efforts are having no real effect on their children. It still takes faith and pioneer-like dogged determination to keep holding meaningful family home evenings when the kids seem inattentive or are fighting with each other or are obnoxiously counting the seconds until they can go out with their friends. It still takes faith to not give up on family prayer and scripture study and teaching the gospel to our families. It still takes faith to<i>know</i>that these little things at home can and do and will make big differences someday.<br><br>On Sunday, November 30, 1856, the Saints gathered in the Tabernacle and heard President Brigham Young apprise them of the dire circumstances of the beleaguered emigrants of the Martin Handcart Company, who were suffering on the plains of Wyoming. This group of handcart pioneers had suffered unspeakable hardships and difficulties on their trek to Zion. Hundreds had died from starvation and exposure. "Some you will find with their feet frozen to their ankles," President Young described for the Saints, and "some are frozen to their knees and some have their hands frosted" (<i>Deseret News,</i>10 December 1856, p. 320). Upon hearing of the terrible plight of the Willie and Martin Handcart Companies, many of the men in Salt Lake City risked their own lives to come to the assistance of their suffering brothers and sisters. One of the first to reach them was our friend Ephraim Hanks. Upon reaching the handcart companies, these rescuers were shocked by the pitiful conditions in which they found these suffering Saints. Captain George D. Grant, who headed one of the rescue parties, reported to President Young:<br><br><i>It is not of much use for me to attempt to give a description of the situation of these people, for this you will learn from</i>[others];<i>but you can imagine between five and six hundred men, women and children, worn down by drawing hand carts through snow and mud; fainting by the wayside; falling, chilled by the cold; children crying, their limbs stiffened by cold, their feet bleeding and some of them bare to snow and frost. The sight is almost too much for the stoutest of us;</i>but we go on doing all we can, not doubting nor despairing. [LeRoy R. Hafen and Ann W. Hafen,<i>Handcarts to Zion</i>(Glendale, California: Arthur H. Clark Company, 1960), p. 228; emphasis added]<br><br>Today there are still people suffering on the plains, as it were. We cannot always see their sorrows and hardships. It may not be frostbite, exhaustion, or starvation, as it was then. It may be, however, loneliness, discouragement, and depression. It still takes faith to reach out to those in need, to smile, to be a friend, and to be kind. It still takes faith to do more for those who are silently suffering around us, even as we speak, than periodic token participation in "service projects." Living our religion requires kindness, compassion, and sensitivity to others--living the Golden Rule--just as much as it requires prayer, scripture study, fulfilling a Church calling, or even attending the temple.<br><br>Today the suffering and needs of those around us may not be as visible, but there is as much need today for "rescuers" as there was when the handcart pioneers were freezing at Martin's Cove. There is just as much need today for us to be true to our covenant to "bear one another's burdens, . . . mourn with those that mourn; yea, and comfort those that stand in need of comfort" (Mosiah 18:8–9). It still takes faith to respond to the need to "succor the weak, lift up the hands which hang down, and strengthen the feeble knees" (D&amp;amp;C 81:5). Today it still takes commitment to covenants to leave behind the "ninety and nine" and go out into the wilderness of the world and rescue the one who has lost his or her way--spiritually speaking. It still takes sacrifice to remove the spiritual blinders that often cause us to be so self-absorbed that we are unaware of and insensitive to those around us who outwardly look like they know where they are going and what they are doing but who are lost and wandering in a spiritual fog. It still takes faith and perseverance to search for the prodigal--whether it be a friend or neighbor, a brother or sister, a son or daughter, or even a mom or dad. It still takes faith, hope, and charity to rescue the lost--wherever and whomever they may be--and lovingly wrap them in the warmth of the Savior's love and mercy. When it comes to service, sacrifice, and consecration today, it still takes faith to "walk the walk," not just "talk the talk." It still takes faith to go forth--like the pioneer rescuers on the Wyoming plains--"doing all we can, not doubting nor despairing."<br><br>Just outside Omaha, Nebraska, in the Mormon Pioneer Cemetery stands a monument commemorating the suffering of the Saints at Winter Quarters and honoring the faith and dedication of these Mormon pioneers. These statues portray a grieving father and mother holding each other in their arms looking down at the tiny grave of their child. There were many such graves along the trail--graves of babies, little children, young adults, even mothers and fathers who were laid to rest in often hurriedly dug shallow graves or just beneath the snow when the ground was too frozen to break.<br><br>Caroline and Jedediah Grant buried their four-month-old daughter, Margaret, near the Sweetwater River in Wyoming. With the grief over the loss of her baby weighing heavily on her soul, Caroline's health soon began to decline. Suffering from the effects of cholera, her condition rapidly became critical. The camp fasted and prayed in her behalf, but it was apparent that Sister Grant would not recover. About midnight she rallied a little and called for her husband and daughter. Susan Noble remembered that Caroline looked at her husband, Jedediah, and whispered:<br><br><i>"All is well! All is well! Please take me to the valley--Jeddy. Get Margaret--bring her--to me!" Brother Grant answered tenderly and meaningly as he sobbed with sorrow, "Yes, yes, Caroline. I'll do my best. I'll do my best."</i>[Gene A. Sessions,<i>Mormon Thunder: A Documentary History of Jedediah Morgan Grant</i>(Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 1982), p. 68]<br><br>Jedediah built a coffin, placed the body of his wife in it, and then drove day and night the last 75 miles to the Salt Lake Valley. On September 30, 1847, he buried her a short distance from the pioneer fort then under construction. The next day Jedediah Grant took with him his friend Bates Noble and headed east on his promised mission to retrieve the body of his baby daughter, Margaret, and return her for burial next to her mother. After several days on the trail they arrived in the Sweetwater region where Margaret had been buried. Bates Noble recorded:<br><br><i>Another day or so and we were at the end of our eastward journey. As we intended making it back to Sweet Water for the night, we stopped our rig</i>[near the campsite]<i>where just a month previous a terrible night had been spent</i>[digging a grave]<i>in a driving thunder storm. We now stepped forward, carrying the box and shovels. A few paces from the little grave we stopped hesitatingly, set down our things and stood with eyes fixed before us. Neither tried to speak. An ugly hole replaced the small mound; and so recently had the wolves departed that every sign was fresh before us. I dared not raise my eyes to look at Jedediah. From the way I felt, I could but guess his feelings. Like statues of the wilderness we stood, grown to the spot, each fully realizing that nothing more could be done. After several minutes of silent tears, we quietly withdrew, carrying away again only that which we had brought.</i>[Sessions,<i>Mormon Thunder,</i>p. 69]<br><br>Jedediah Grant could do no more. He had done his best, as he had promised. But now all he had left was his faith and hope in Christ.<br><br>Losing a loved one--whether suddenly by a tragic accident, after a long struggle with a terminal illness, or even by natural causes--is no less painful for us today than it was for those pioneers. It still takes faith when a casket is closed to look forward to a happy reunion someday beyond the veil. It still takes faith in Christ's victory over death and the hope of a glorious resurrection. It still takes hope in Christ's promise that he "shall wipe away all tears from their eyes" (Revelation 7:17).<br><br>Many of these early pioneers arrived in the Salt Lake Valley after the arduous trek only to find that they were not done pioneering yet. Responding to the call of the prophet of God, many once again packed up their wagons and moved to other frontier areas of the Great Basin to establish additional Mormon settlements. Joseph Stanford Smith was called to settle in the Colorado River basin. He had been one of the most active leaders in helping blaze a trail through a treacherous canyon in southern Utah that became known as "Hole-in-the-Rock." On January 26, 1880, Stanford spent the day helping all of the wagons in the company get down through the notch in the rocky canyon. Using ropes and pulleys as well as logs tied to the backs of wagons as a braking system, each wagon was carefully lowered through the rocky crevice and driven to the banks of the river and then ferried across. When word came that all of the wagons were safely down and across the river, Stanford looked for his wagon--but it was nowhere to be found. It was still up at the top of the canyon. It had been moved back while the others were being taken down, and now it had been overlooked. His wife, Arabella, and his children were waiting for him at the top of the canyon.<br><br><i>For a moment Stanford's face flushed with rage. He threw his hat on the ground and stomped it--as was his habit when he was angry.</i><br><br><i>"With me down there helping get their wagons on the raft, I thought some one would bring my wagon down. Drat 'em!"</i><br><br><i>"I've got the horses harnessed and things all packed," Belle breathlessly assured him as they ran toward the wagon.</i><br><br>Stanford unlocked the brakes; checked the team; tied old Nig, the mule, to the back axle as a brake; and cross-locked the wheels with chains.<br><br><i>They walked to the top of the crevice, where hand in hand they looked down--10 feet of loose sand, then a rocky pitch as steep as the roof of a house and barely as wide as the wagon--below that a dizzy chute down to the landing place. . . . It was that first drop of 150 feet that frightened him.</i><br><br><i>"I am afraid we can't make it," he exclaimed.</i><br><br><i>"But we've got to make it," she answered calmly. . . .</i><br><br><i>"If we only had a few men to hold the wagon back we might make it, Belle."</i><br><br><i>"I'll do the holding back," said Belle, "on old Nig's</i><i>lines."</i><br><br>She then busied herself getting the children to a safe place back from the crevice. Three-year-old Roy held the baby, and sister Ada sat in front of them and said a little prayer as Belle kissed each of them and tucked quilts snugly around them. "Don't move, dears. Don't even stand up. As soon as we get the wagon down, Papa will come back for you!"<br><br><i>Stanford braced his legs against the dashboard and they started down through the Hole-in-the-Rock. The first lurch nearly pulled Belle off her feet. She dug her heels in to hold her balance. Old Nig was thrown to his haunches. Arabella raced after him and the wagon holding to the lines with desperate strength. Nig rolled to his side and gave a shrill neigh of terror. . . .</i><br><br>[Belle]<i>lost her balance and went sprawling after old Nig. She was blinded by the sand which streamed after her. She gritted her teeth and hung on to the lines. A jagged rock tore her flesh and hot pain ran up her leg from heel to hip. The wagon struck a huge boulder. The impact jerked her to her feet and flung her against the side of the cliff.</i><br><br>The wagon stopped at the end of the chute. Stanford jumped off the wagon and first noticed the bloodied, bruised, and almost lifeless mule that had been dragged most of the way down. There, holding onto the reins, blood streaming from her leg, and covered from head to foot with dirt, was Arabella. She had been dragged down along with the mule--but she wouldn't let go. She had hung on for all she was worth. Miraculously they made it down and were safe.<br><br><i>"Darling, will you be all right?"</i><br><br><i>"Of course I will. Just leave me here and go as fast as you can for the children."</i><br><br><i>"I'll hurry," he flung over his shoulder and began the steep climb up the incline they had just come down.</i><br><br><i>. . . He slowed down, and looked around. He had driven a wagon down that fearful crevice, and dragged his wife behind. . . . God bless her gallant heart! He kicked the rocks at his feet and with tears streaming down his face lifted his hat in salute to Arabella, his wife.</i>[As told by a grandson, Raymond Smith Jones, in David E. Miller,<i>Hole-in-the-Rock: An Epic in the Colonization of the Great American West</i>(Salt Lake City: University of Utah Press, 1966), pp. 111–14]<br><br>President Harold B. Lee said:<br><br><i>We have some tight places to go before the Lord is through with this church and the world in this dispensation. . . . The power of Satan will increase; we see it in evidence on every hand.</i>[<i>CR,</i>October 1970, p. 152]<br><br>Whether the "tight places" are<i>institutional</i>or<i>individual,</i>it will still take faith and courage to hang on like Arabella Smith. As Lehi and Nephi saw, we are only able to withstand the "mists of darkness" and ignore the scornful mockings from the "great and spacious building" if we will hold fast--"clinging to the rod of iron" (see 1 Nephi 8:19–34, 11:25, 12:17, 15:22–25). The iron rod is the word of God--the scriptures, the gospel, the words of the prophets--but it is also much more. John the Revelator saw in vision the Son of God, whom he described as "clothed with a vesture dipped in blood: and his name is called The Word of God" (Revelation 19:13; see also John 1:1–3, 18). Christ is the iron rod to which we must cling--never loosening our grip, never letting go. Never. For if we will continually hang on to him, he will never let go of us. Never. No, not ever!<br><br>May we demonstrate in our own lives the fire of the covenants that those we honor today so valiantly demonstrated. May we hold onto the iron rod--hanging on with both hands for all we are worth throughout our entire lives--in times of trial and tribulation as well as when life is smooth sailing. It still takes faith to be<br><br><i>True to the faith that our parents have cherished,<br>True to the truth for which martyrs have perished,<br>To God's command,<br>Soul, heart, and hand,<br>Faithful and true we will ever stand.</i><br>["True to the Faith,"<i>Hymns,</i>1985, no. 254]<br><br>May we be filled with such faith today, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Brent L. Top was an associate dean of Religious Education at BYU when this devotional address was given on 22 July 1997.</i><br><br><i>© Brigham Young University.

<h1>Our Individual Path - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Last week, on July 24, we honored the pioneers as we celebrated the 150th anniversary of their arrival in the Salt Lake Valley. "It is now 1997, and the future is ahead," President Hinckley proclaimed last April in general conference. He noted that great things were expected of the pioneers and that great things are now expected of us. He said that we now have "an overwhelming challenge to go on and build the kingdom of God. ... We must grasp the torch and run the race" (Gordon B. Hinckley, "True to the Faith,"<i>Ensign,</i>May 1997, pp. 66–67).<br><br>The path our pioneer mothers and fathers walked was trying, and many lost their lives along the way. They walked with faith and sacrifice as they journeyed to Zion. Their way was difficult, and I hear many of us today question whether we would have survived both physically and spiritually such an arduous journey had we lived then. Once the first Saints arrived in the valley, many followed. Their travels were unique, but the path was marked, the direction known.<br><br>Today I believe that our task is in many ways as arduous as that of the early Saints. The path we walk, however, is not a physical trail broken through frontier lands--it is a personal path that we must each find and follow. Our challenge today is not only to survive the journey but to first find the trail. Elder M. Russell Ballard in April conference explained:<br><br><i>It was hard to walk across a continent to establish a new home in a dry western desert. But who can say if that was any more difficult than is the task of living faithful, righteous lives in today's confusingly sinful world, where the trail is constantly shifting and where divine markers of right and wrong are being replaced by political expediency and diminishing morality. The road we travel today is treacherous, and the scriptures tell us it will continue to be so until the very end.</i>[M. Russell Ballard, "You Have Nothing to Fear from the Journey,"<i>Ensign,</i>May 1997, p. 61]<br><br>We live in a modern, complex society that is continually changing. The society you join as young adults is very different from that of even your parents. Technological advances are overwhelming. My daughters were surprised to learn that I didn't have VCRs, personal computers, CDs, or even microwaves when I was their age--and I'm not that old! The challenges your generation faces are even different from those I experienced as a freshman at BYU almost 20 years ago.<br><br>Reynolds Farley, a professor of sociology at the University of Michigan, in his book<i>The New American Reality,</i>relates:<br><br><i>The 1990 census and many surveys conducted more recently tell us how people are now adapting--some with great success and others not well at all--to the massive social and economic trends that will make the United States in</i>[the year]<i>2000 extremely different from what it was in generations past....</i><br><br><i>Just a little more than a generation ago, in the 1950s, a young white man with a high school education, a strong back, and a dedication to hard work could likely find a good blue-collar job with a prosperous manufacturing firm. ... He knew that if he came to work regularly and pleased his boss, his wages would rise year after year. ... He could afford to marry while he was in his early twenties and could buy a starter home in the suburbs before he reached thirty. Although some women in the high school graduating classes of the 1950s attended college, most did not. Rather, they married before they were old enough to vote. ... Divorces occurred, but they were rare, and women expected that their husbands would remain with them and support them while they stayed at home taking care of the three or even four children they had while they were still in their twenties. Many white women held jobs in that brief interval between the completion of school and marriage, but few did so when they were caring for young children....</i><br><br><i>It is a very different nation in the 1990s. A young man graduating from high school with a dedication to work and a strong back may find an attractive job with good benefits, but the odds are not in his favor. If he is successful in locating work, the job will pay about 25 percent less--adjusted for inflation--than did a similar job twenty years ago. ... A young woman might marry her high school sweetheart right after graduation but, if she does, she knows that their chances for a home in the suburbs and middle-class prosperity are slim unless both of them work full-time and at least one of them gets specialized training in college. Since more than one-half of recent marriages end in divorce, a realistic young married woman must plan for the possibility that, by her thirties, she will be heading her own family with a child or two.</i>[Reynolds Farley,<i>The New American Reality: Who We Are, How We Got Here, Where We Are Going</i>(New York: Russell Sage Foundation, 1996), pp. 1–3]<br><br>Professor Farley remarks that "the nation has never before simultaneously experienced both a fundamental economic restructuring and a basic shift in family life" (Farley,<i>American Reality,</i>p. 354). He explains that young people today have had to adjust to these changes. They stay in school longer to improve their chances for employment, and they typically delay marriage until they are older. In addition, some social and economic changes have opened up greater possibilities for many young people compared to four decades ago. In particular, progress has been made in expanding opportunities for women and minorities (see Farley,<i>American Reality,</i>p. 3).<br><br>These adaptations to change by young people are also reflected in the student body at BYU. At April graduation President Bateman noted that during the 1996–97 academic year almost 8,300 students completed their educations--the largest graduating class yet--an increase of about 2,000 students since the mid-1980s. In particular, President Bateman noted that<br><br><i>the impact on young women has been particularly strong. Although the number of women students at BYU has remained nearly constant during the past decade, approximately 4,000 women will graduate this year in contrast to 2,600 10 years ago--an increase of 60 percent.</i>[Merrill J. Bateman, "An Investment in Education,"<i>Brigham Young Magazine,</i>Summer 1997, p. 3]<br><br>Thus, more women are graduating from BYU than ever before, and more are graduating married. According to statistics from BYU Institutional Studies, during the 1984–85 academic year when I graduated from BYU, 44 percent of the women graduates were married. Ten years later, by the 1994–95 academic year, the percentage had increased to 52 percent. In contrast, over the same 10-year period, the percentage of men who graduated married declined slightly--from 68 percent in 1984–85 to 65 percent in 1994–95. Thus, unlike the pattern of previous decades, young women today are more inclined to finish their educations, even after marriage.<br><br>President Bateman also noted the economic returns of education, stating that "dollars invested in education provide one of the best returns available. A bachelor's degree increases the expected salaries of men and women by some 80 percent" ("An Investment," p. 3; see also NAICU Report, 17 September 1996, Census Data, 1990). Given the decline in men's wages since the 1970s, many women have found it necessary to contribute financially to their families (see Farley,<i>American Reality,</i>pp.335–37). According to 1990 census statistics, families in which both spouses are employed make up almost two-thirds of the households in Utah. Of these families, women provide, on average, 29 percent of the family's income--the median family income being $36,000 (see Marie Cornwall and Louise Degn,<i>Utah Women Considered: What the Numbers Tell Us</i>[Provo: BYU Women's Research Institute, 1995], p. 22; asupplemental guide to the video documentary<i>Utah Women Considered: Changing Lives, Changing Times</i>[Salt Lake City: KUED, 1995]).<br><br>In addition to completing their educations, more women now at BYU are also returned missionaries, compared to past years. For example, in 1985, only 9 percent of the returned missionaries on campus were women, whereas in 1995, 17 percent of the returned missionaries were women--almost double that of 10 years earlier (BYU Institutional Studies statistics).<br><br>As opportunities for education and missionary service have increased for women, men at BYU have also made some noticeable "adjustments." I left BYU in 1986 and returned almost 10 years later in 1995. The most striking difference I see on campus now is not the number of new buildings but the number of male students on campus carrying infants. It is not uncommon these days to see a young father with his infant daughter wrapped in a carrier strapped to his chest walking across campus--such a scene was rare 10 years ago. We have even had discussion in the<i>Daily Universe</i>about putting diaper-changing tables in the men's restrooms! Men on campus today can be seen pushing strollers, taking infants with them to class, and carrying diaper bags alongside their backpacks.<br><br>Kathleen Gerson, a professor of sociology atNew York University, writes in her book<i>NoMan's Land: Men's Changing Commitments to Family and Work:</i><br><br><i>For several decades the spotlight has been on the revolution in women's lives, but now we are beginning to recognize that men's lives, too, are undergoing profound change. While it is clear that most men no longer provide the sole or primary economic support to their families, it is less clear what new patterns of commitment they are developing instead....</i><br><br><i>Today there is no single predominant road to manhood. Men have entered a no man's land, a territory of undefined and shifting allegiances, in which they must negotiate difficult choices between freedom and commitment, privilege and sharing, and dominance and equality.</i>[Kathleen Gerson,<i>No Man's Land: Men's Changing Commitments to Family and Work</i>(New York: BasicBooks, 1993), p. ix]<br><br>Gerson notes the various paths that men now follow: some men today hold to the traditional breadwinner ethic, whereas other men flee the responsibilities of parenthood and marital commitment; still others are more involved in family life, especially child care, than were men in earlier generations (see Gerson,<i>No Man's Land,</i>p. ix). Thus, the choices that you have today are very different, even from choices your parents had a few decades ago. In addition, the complexities of our modern society and the pervasive changes you experience today will only intensify in the future. The course you must navigate is not a wilderness trek like that of the pioneers but an individual path that each of you must blaze, as Elder Ballard noted, in a "confusingly sinful world" ("You Have Nothing to Fear," p. 61).<br><br>So how do you meet these challenges? How do you determine the path you are to follow? How do you fulfill your mortal mission with honor and integrity? With so many choices in an ever-changing world, how do you decide about missions, school, work, family, and church responsibilities? One of my students, after a discussion about the choices young people face today, responded in frustration, "I wish someone would just tell me what to do!"<br><br>Obviously, I can't tell you what to do, but I would like to share some of my thoughts about what I believe is the greatest challenge facing people your age today--that of finding<i>your</i>individual mortal mission. I believe that each of us has a unique and significant mission to fulfill in this life. Elder H. Burke Peterson, in an address to the youth of the Church, said:<br><br><i>Do you think for a moment that Heavenly Father would have sent one of His children to this earth by accident, without the possibility of a significant work to perform?...</i><br><br><i>... You were preserved to come to the earth in this time for a special purpose. Not just a few of you, but all of you. There are things for each of you to do that no one else can do as well as you. If you do not prepare to do them, they will not be done. Your mission is unique and distinctive for you. ... If you will let Him, I testify that our Father in Heaven will walk with you through the journey of life and inspire you to know your special purpose here.</i>[H. Burke Peterson, "Your Life Has a Purpose,"<i>New Era,</i>May 1979, pp. 4–5]<br><br>"If you will let Him"--I believe that is the key to our finding the path we must follow in this life. What is required of us to find our purpose and complete our journey was also required of the early Saints: faith. William Clayton, who wrote the words to "Come, Come, Ye Saints" (<i>Hymns,</i>1985, no. 30), in a letter from Commerce to his friends in Manchester, England, wrote, "If you will be faithful, you have nothing to fear from the journey. The Lord will take care of his saints" (Letter from Commerce, 10 December 1840, William Clayton Collection, LDS Church Archives; punctuation modernized). Faith must be our mainstay, for it will reveal to us the purposes and mysteries that God holds for each of us. It is our faith that will allow us to put our trust in the Lord and know that he will fulfill his promises.<br><br>But if we are going to walk by faith and let the Lord inspire us as to our purpose in life, there are two traps, in particular, that we must avoid. As we reach to take the Lord's hand, we must first let go of two things--our will and our pride. Because of our agency we must choose to subject our will to that of the Father and to give him the glory. As we step out of our boat and onto the water, we must have faith.<br><br>These two traps are interconnected, for we must be willing to let go of our pride to subject ourselves to the will of the Father. These traps ensnare us when we attempt to tell the Lord what we will or will not do. For example, we each are raised in a family and community environment in which we learn particular traditions or roles. Many times, because of the unique culture within which we are raised, we limit the possible paths down which the Lord can direct us by just assuming that we will follow certain roles--thus not considering other possibilities. In this way we tell the Lord what we will or will not do. We must be willing to look beyond our own cultural stereotypes, or our own limited perceptions of the world, to see the opportunities the Lord has for us.<br><br>When Peter was directed by the Lord to take the gospel to the Gentiles, he had to look beyond his cultural biases to understand and fulfill this important mission. The scriptures tell us that Peter went up upon the housetop to pray, and there he had a vision. He saw a sheet let down to the earth on which were all manner of four-footed animals, wild beasts, creeping things, and fowls of the air. And the Lord told Peter to<br><br><i>kill, and eat.</i><br><br><i>But Peter said, Not so, Lord; for I have never eaten any thing that is common or unclean.</i><br><br><i>And the voice spake unto him again the second time, What God hath cleansed, that call not thou common.</i>[Acts 10:13–15]<br><br>After the vision ended, Peter was uncertain as to its meaning. Acting in faith, without a full understanding of the Lord's purposes, Peter followed the Spirit's direction and went to the home of Cornelius, a Gentile. He told Cornelius that it was unlawful for a Jew to keep company with a Gentile but that God had shown him, as he now realized, that he "should not call any man common or unclean" (Acts 10:28). Because of social norms, Peter's first reaction was repulsion of the Lord's request, but his faith allowed him to subject his will to that of the Lord's and fulfill his mission in building the kingdom.<br><br>Like Peter, we also may receive inspiration that seems contrary to our traditions or social norms. I was a teenager in the 1970s and shared certain biases about sister missionaries. I decided early on that I would never go on a mission. It was not until I went to BYU and met other women preparing for missionary service that I realized that my stereotypes were unfounded and that I was limiting my opportunities for growth. As I considered the option of missionary service and prayed for guidance, the Lord confirmed to me that I should go--a decision that continues to bless my life.<br><br>To let the Lord guide us, we first must let go of our biases or false traditions as we conform our will to the Lord's. In addition, we sometimes disregard certain options in life because we question our own ability to succeed--instead of telling the Lord what we will not do, we tell him what we cannot do. At times the Lord can prompt us to follow a certain path, and we must have the faith to overcome our weaknesses and do the Lord's will.<br><br>One of our graduate students in sociology related to me her experience in applying to our PhD program, a story that I share with her permission. Jules said that she was at a point in her life when she was prayerfully considering various options about what to do next. One day, as she was walking across campus, she received the inspiration that she should apply to the sociology PhD program. She was surprised by this because her training and work experience had been in social work, and she had no background in sociology. Despite her doubts, she applied to the program and was accepted; however, she continued to question her ability to succeed.<br><br>During her first year in the graduate program, she sought and received three priesthood blessings regarding her decision. Each time the priesthood mouthpiece confirmed to her that indeed she was doing what the Lord wanted her to do, but she continued to question her ability to succeed in her classes. Finally, after the third blessing, her roommate gave her some wise counsel. Jules said:<br><br><i>I told her that I was having a hard time with statistics again, and expected her to console me, as she had done in the past. I told her about the blessing Ihad received from the bishop a few weeks before.</i><br><br><i>My roommate said, "Don't you trust God?"</i><br><br><i>I replied, "Of course I do."</i><br><br><i>"No, you don't," my roommate responded calmly.</i><br><br><i>"You don't understand," I explained to her, "I trust God; I just don't trust myself."</i><br><br><i>"Then you don't trust God," she responded. "If you trusted God, you would believe him when he says you can do statistics, or anything else in this program."</i><br><br><i>I knew she was right, but now I was faced with a real dilemma. In order to succeed at statistics I had to stop panicking, stop telling myself I couldn't do it, and believe God, who said I could do it. I had to trust in God when I didn't even trust myself. ... Finally I decided that if God was omnipotent, then he knew everything there was to know about statistics, so what better tutor could I have for this subject than God? That was a turning point.</i>[Jules Law, personal journal, March 1997]<br><br>Jules received the comfort and guidance she needed to complete her course work and successfully finish the semester. She continues to work hard in the program, but now with less anxiety. She knows that through hard work she can succeed, because she is doing what the Lord wants her to do and she has faith in him.<br><br>We must trust the Lord and know, as Nephi said, that he gives no command without preparing a way for us to succeed (see 1 Nephi 3:7). The Lord has his own purposes, and they often do not match ours. We must look beyond our personal weaknesses and our biases as we seek and follow his guidance. Be careful about telling the Lord what you will not do or what you cannot do.<br><br>We also must be careful about telling the Lord what we will do. We can become so obsessed with a particular path that we become immobilized and deaf to the promptings of our Father in Heaven's spirit. One example of this that appears occasionally among BYU students is the desire to marry. It is a righteous desire to want to marry, but in some cases individuals can become so obsessed with finding a mate that they ignore the Lord's direction. Some of you may be familiar with the Calvin Grondahl cartoon in his book<i>Freeway to Perfection</i>in which a young woman is sitting on her bed and behind her are three large pieces of paper. The first says, "Daily Goals: 1. Get Married"; the second says, "Weekly Goals: 1. Get Married"; and the third says, "Monthly, Yearly Goals: 1. Get Married!" (see Calvin Grondahl,<i>Freeway to Perfection</i>[Salt Lake City, Utah: Sunstone Foundation, 1978], p.16).<br><br>I recognize that the anxiety over finding a mate begins early in life--it's part of our socialization. My daughter at age five asked me once, "Mom, what happens if there are not enough boys for all the girls to marry when they grow up?"<br><br>I thought, "She's only five, and already she's worried about the sex-ratio imbalance?"<br><br>I could tell she was thinking hard about it. And then her eyes lit up and she said, "I know! If there aren't enough boys for the girls to marry, they can marry wolves!"<br><br>I think she had watched the video of<i>Beauty and the Beast</i>one too many times.<br><br>Because eternal marriage is a righteous desire, it is important to be temple worthy and prepare yourself for the opportunity. But marriage is not something you have complete control over (it does involve another person), so to obsess over it can actually hinder your search for a mate. The Lord will tell you when the time, place, and circumstances are right. He may have other work for you to perform first that will help prepare you to be a better spouse and parent. If we are to let the Lord guide us, we must be open to the potential paths he may direct us down--all according to his timetable, not ours. The opportunity to marry is more likely to come not when you are worrying or obsessing about it, but when you are getting on with other aspects of your life.<br><br>Thus, be careful about telling the Lord what you will do and when. Instead, prepare yourself by living righteously and then let your Father in Heaven reveal to you his purposes as he guides you through the trials and the turbulence of mortal striving. As you openly and prayerfully consider the path you should follow, the Lord will direct you. Elder John H. Groberg related his own experience in choosing his path:<br><br><i>In the past I have tried to figure out whether I should go into business or into teaching or into the arts or whatever. As I have begun to proceed along one path, having more or less gathered what facts I could, I have found that if that decision was wrong or was taking me down the wrong path--not necessarily an evil one, but one that was not right for me--without fail, the Lord has always let me know just this emphatically: "That is wrong; do not go that way. That is not for you!"</i><br><br><i>On the other hand, there may have been two or three ways that I could have gone, any one of which would have been right and would have been in the general area providing the experience and means whereby I could fulfill the mission that the Lord had in mind for me. ... If it is wrong, he will let us know--we will feel it for sure. I am positive of that. So rather than saying, "I will not move until I have this burning in my heart," let us turn it around and say, "I will move unless I feel it is wrong; and if it is wrong, then I will not do it." By eliminating all of these wrong courses, very quickly you will find yourself going in the direction that you ought to be going, and then you can receive the assurance: "Yes,... I am doing what my Father in Heaven wants me to do."</i>[John H. Groberg, "What Is Your Mission?" in<i>Speeches of the Year, 1979</i>(Provo: Brigham Young University Press, 1980), pp.97–98]<br><br>As you take the Lord's hand and walk in faith, you will excel in your righteous undertakings and fulfill your mortal mission with honor and integrity. However, as we experience success in life, we must remember to acknowledge the Lord's hand in all that we have and let go of our pride. President Benson said:<br><br><i>Pride is characterized by "What do I want out of life?" rather than by "What would God have me do with my life?" It is self-will as opposed to God's will. It is the fear of man over the fear of God.</i>[Ezra Taft Benson, "Cleansing the Inner Vessel,"<i>Ensign,</i>May 1986, pp. 6–7]<br><br>As the Lord blesses us with success, we must remember that "unto whom much is given much is required" (D&amp;amp;C 82:3). For example, each of you has been blessed with the opportunity of acquiring higher education. Do you realize that only about 40 percent of college-age persons are enrolled in college in economically affluent countries, and less than 3 percent are enrolled in the poorest countries of the world? (See York W. Bradshaw and Michael Wallace,<i>Global Inequalities</i>[Thousand Oaks, California: Pine Forge Press, 1996], figure 2.8, p.23.) You have access to resources and opportunities that are beyond the reach of the majority of the world's population. Remember, as you earn your degrees and gain prestige in your fields, that it is the Lord's kingdom you are to build, not your own. Center your interest in the Church and remember the Lord's utterance: "Thou shalt have no other gods before me" (Exodus 20:3).<br><br>My children are the ones who humble me and help keep things in perspective. A few months ago we hosted three young women in our home who were finalists for the Hinckley Scholarship. My daughter Mary was helping me set the table and prepare dinner. She wanted to go with me to meet the students and bring them back to our home. As we were leaving she said, "Mom, I'm a little nervous about meeting these students."<br><br>I told her that was okay, because they were probably nervous about meeting us, too.<br><br>"Why?" she asked.<br><br>Well, I explained that they were high school students and that they were probably nervous about meeting a college professor and coming to our home for dinner.<br><br>Mary stopped and said, "Mom! I know you are a professor and everything, but you're my<i>mother--</i>those students will be glad when they see it's you!"<br><br>Take advantage of the opportunities the Lord has given you and do your best--but remember to "praise God, from whom all blessings flow" (<i>Hymns,</i>1985, no. 242). Only in humility, as you let go of your pride, can you give up your will to the Father and take his hand in faith.<i>If you will let him,</i>he will direct your paths.<br><br><i>Be thou humble in thy weakness, and the Lord thy God shall lead thee,<br>Shall lead thee by the hand and give thee answer to thy prayers.<br>Be thou humble in thy pleading, and the Lord thy God shall bless thee,<br>Shall bless thee with a sweet and calm assurance that he cares.</i><br>["Be Thou Humble,"<i>Hymns,</i>1985, no. 130]<br><br>Elder Groberg suggests that we<br><br><i>reaffirm in our lives the importance of at least three things: first, that God, our Father in Heaven, does have a specific mission for all of us to fulfill and perform while we are here upon this earth; second, that we can, here and now in this life, discover what that mission is; and third, that with His help we can fulfill that mission and know and have assurance--here and now in this life--that we are doing that which is pleasing to our Father in Heaven. These are all very important concepts; and they are all true.</i>["What Is Your Mission?" pp. 92–93]<br><br>Remember too that each mission is unique. I had the opportunity as a youth to speak with Sister Ruth Funk, former general Young Women president, at a youth conference. She told me something that has greatly influenced my life. She said that the Lord wants us all to return to him, but not in a straight line. Although we all must keep the commandments and receive the saving ordinances, the individual paths we follow and the decisions we make regarding school, work, family, and so forth will be individual. As Elder H. Burke Peterson said, "There are things for each of you to do that no one else can do as well as you" ("Your Life Has a Purpose," p. 5).<br><br>That is why we should not judge each other. It would do us all good to remember the popular Utah creed stitched as a reminder in a sampler by a convert in 1860: "The Mormon Creed Is to Mind Your Own Business" (Julie Wardell, "Stitch in Time,"<i>The Friend,</i>May 1997, pp. 42–43). We need to support each other, although our paths may be different. Some of you will follow traditional paths, others will be called to blaze new trails. As long as you are doing what the Lord requires of you, "you have nothing to fear from the journey" (William Clayton, Letter from Commerce, 10December 1840).<br><br>One of the greatest examples we have of someone who has humbly sought the Lord's guidance in fulfilling his mortal mission is President Hinckley. Sister Sheri L. Dew, in the preface to her biography of President Hinckley, writes of one of her early meetings with the prophet. She met with him after he had read the first third of the manuscript.<br><br><i>After an uncomfortable pause, ... he began: "I am</i>sick, sick, sick<i>of reading about Gordon Hinckley. There is just too much about Gordon Hinckley in this manuscript." I groped for a response. "Whom did you want me to write about in</i>your<i>biography?" came to mind, but I couldn't think of a respectful way to phrase the question so I remained silent.</i><br><br><i>Then I had my first exposure to a mini-sermon he would repeat at least a dozen times during succeeding months. "Adulation is poison," he said, emphasizing each word. "Adulation has ruined many a good man and woman, and I don't want this book to portray me as something I'm not." I finally replied: "President, I can see that we have just one small problem here. You want me to write a book that says you are just a common, ordinary man." "Well, I am," he interrupted.</i>[Sheri L. Dew,<i>Go Forward with Faith: The Biography of Gordon B. Hinckley</i>(Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Company, 1996), pp. ix–xvi; emphasis in original]<br><br>Sister Dew then explains in the preface that she never found anything "to support his claim that he is a common, ordinary man" (p. x). She notes that by the time he became president of the Church, President Hinckley had served nearly 60 years at Church headquarters. After 38 years of service as a General Authority, and 15 of those years in the First Presidency, his influence in missionary work, temple building, and public affairs is now recognized. President James E. Faust, his second counselor, said that perhaps no man who has become president of the Church has been more extensively or better prepared to lead the Saints than President Hinckley. Sister Dew concludes:<br><br><i>Indeed, there is no hyperbole in stating that President Hinckley has influenced the onward march of the gospel kingdom in a way paralleled by few others. And in the process, he has molded a life worthy of emulation.</i>[Dew,<i>Go Forward,</i>p. xi]<br><br>President Hinckley has lived his life according to one simple maxim: "The only way to get anything done is to get on your knees and ask for the Lord's help, and then get to your feet and go to work" (Dew,<i>Go Forward,</i>p. x). I believe the prophet sees himself as an ordinary man--one who has only done the work the Lord has asked of him the best he could. If only we would go and do the same.<br><br>President Hinckley sees the vision. He is leading the way. He knows that we have a kingdom to build, a message to share, and lives to change--and he is leading the charge. I'm afraid that if we don't get behind him, many of us will be left in the dust. I bear you my witness that Gordon B. Hinckley is a prophet of God and that the Lord speaks to him as fervently, if not more fervently, than he spoke to old Israel. We have a loving Father in Heaven, and as we are guided by him, we will be able to excel in our righteous undertakings and fulfill our mortal missions with honor and integrity.<br><br>As you near the year 2000 and prepare to meet the challenges of the future, please remember Elder Peterson's words: "There are things for each of you to do that no one else can do as well as you. ...<i>If you will let Him,</i>Itestify that our Father in Heaven will walk with you through the journey of life and inspire you to know your ... purpose here" (Peterson, "Your Life Has a Purpose," p. 5; emphasis added). To this testimony I add my own, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Renata Tonks Forste was an assistant professor of sociology at Brigham Young University when this devotional address was given on 29 July 1997.</i><br><br><i>© Brigham Young University.

<h1>Our Spiritual Wells Flowing - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I am delighted to be here today to share some experiences and feelings with each of you. I do appreciate Brother Hurtado's rendition of "I Am a Child of God" and will talk more of that topic later. This is certainly a humbling experience to stand before you and discuss feelings of the heart. It is both an honor and a challenge to speak during this devotional time set aside on our campus to focus on the things of the Spirit. Would each of you say a prayer in your heart that what I have to say will touch you and bring you closer to the Savior.<br><br>I wish to direct my remarks to "keeping our spiritual wells flowing." If each of you does a personal evaluation today, how would you score on a scale of 1 to 10 at living the gospel to the fullest? If you are like me, you have varying successes, depending on the day. It is my goal today to help all of us come closer to our Father in Heaven through living gospel principles.<br><br>There is a story of a man traveling across desert terrain who saw a road that looked as if it would be a shortcut. A posted road sign warned against traveling on it because it had no services available. The man decided to take the road anyway. After a time, in the extreme heat, his car stopped in the middle of the desert. Off in the distance the man thought he saw a grouping of houses, and he hoped that help could be found there. After he had walked for some time, he realized that it was farther than he had anticipated. He kept walking in the hot sun until he reached the ghost town. No one could be found; only a few old buildings survived. In the middle of the town the man saw a water pump. He rushed over and quickly started to pump the old rusty handle to get whatever water was available. Nothing happened. As he looked down, he saw a metal can with a piece of paper in it, bearing scrawled handwriting. The note said there was a bottle of water under a rock nearby, and if all the water was poured into the pump hole the well would flow forth with abundance.<br><br>The man had come to the decisive moment. Should he choose to drink the only water available and not prime the pump, or should he put the water into the pump so the well would flow again? His lack of faith would not allow him to put the water in the well. Instead he drank the last bottle of water and staggered off,hoping that someone would find him and leaving the next person who found the well with no chance for water.<br><br>I feel this is much like the decisions we make daily. We must decide whether we will fill our spiritual wells with things of the Spirit--thereby saving ourselves and others--or draw, draw, draw from our wells, never filling them with more light and knowledge and finally not reaching the spirituality that we could.<br><br>Each of us has our own well to replenish. How do we keep our spiritual wells flowing? It is by building a strong testimony of the Lord Jesus Christ and of our Heavenly Father. Each day should bring opportunities to build upon our existing testimony and to fortify to a greater degree our belief in the Savior, Jesus Christ.<br><br>Our testimony of the gospel is one of our most precious possessions. It will bring us closer to our Savior and guide our thoughts and actions. A testimony is of the utmost importance. In Moroni 10:1–7 we find the formula for receiving a testimony. These scriptures tell how to gain a testimony about the Book of Mormon, but it is a formula that can be followed to build a testimony about any gospel principle. First,<i>read</i>and<i>study</i>about the principle. Second,<i>ponder</i>the ideas in your heart to receive a feeling. Third,<i>put</i>yourself in a frame of mind where you can accept the will of your Father. Fourth,<i>strive</i>for a sincere heart, having real intent and faith in the Lord Jesus Christ. Fifth,<i>ask</i>God in the name of Jesus Christ if the knowledge pondered is true. Sixth,<i>recognize</i>the promptings and feelings manifest to you by the Holy Ghost. Each of us chooses to strengthen our testimonies on a daily basis.<br><br>With regard to individual testimony, President Harold B. Lee said:<br><br><i>The strength of this Church is not to be measured by the amount of money paid as tithing by the faithful members, nor by the total membership of the Church, nor by the number of chapels or temple buildings. The real strength of the Church is to be measured by the individual testimonies to be found in the total membership of the Church.</i>[Mexico City Area Conference, 25–27 August 1972, p.117]<br><br>As a professor in the Department of Dance, I have had many wonderful opportunities for my personal testimony to grow as I have traveled all over the world to share the universal language of dance. It has also been my privilege to see dedicated and humble students at Brigham Young University--who are part of our performing companies--govern their lives with sound gospel principles and shine as a light unto the world. As we tour, we are often hosted by sponsors in each country who have never heard of the gospel of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, but the light that shines from the eyes of our students as they perform on stage always attracts attention and brings questions from our viewers. Why are these students so happy? Why do they seem to be so close as a group and care for each other? Why do they have such a sense of self? Why would they spend their individual time to come to some of these remote places and share their talents? All the answers to these questions are tied to gospel principles.<br><br>The touring program at the university is designed to bring the gospel message to people all across the globe through talents of music, song, and dance. Regarding talent, President Joseph F. Smith said, "Every son and every daughter of God has received some talent, and each will be held to strict account for the use or misuse to which it is put" ("The Returned Missionary,"<i>Juvenile Instructor,</i>15 November 1903, p. 689). We are each responsible to develop our talents and use them to help further the Lord's work. Through the talent of dance, we are able to become closer to others. As these young students tour, they are able to share their testimonies three ways: verbally; by example as they live with these kind people who are their hosts; and artistically as they perform on stage and display their God-given talents. As each of us on the tour shares testimonies and talents, our spirits are also fed by the many Saints and individuals we meet around the world.<br><br>Let me relate such a story. As I was touring with the International Folk Dancers as a performer many years ago, with founder and director Mary Bee Jensen, I stayed in a modest apartment in Sweden with a middle-aged couple with two children. Their home was of humble means, but they radiated a special spirit of love toward us because we were all members of the Church. I had told the sister how much I admired her beautiful old concert piano. She shared with me that they would soon not have the piano. It had been an heirloom in the family from her parents. All her other brothers and sisters had wanted the piano, but her parents had left it to her because she played so beautifully. When I asked why she would soon not have the piano, she said, "We have a buyer for it, and we are going to use the money to go to the Swiss temple to be sealed for time and all eternity and be able for one week to do work for the dead." The value of the temple experience far outweighed the worth of the precious piano for this dear sister. It was a sacrifice for her whole family, but a worthwhile one.<br><br>What a lesson this was for me. I have often thought back to that experience, and I always feel a deep sense of appreciation for the opportunity I have to visit temples all over the world and to go within their hallowed halls. Living here in Provo, we can be to eight temples within two hours' driving time: the Logan, Ogden, Bountiful, Salt Lake, Jordan River, Mount Timpanogos, Provo, and Manti temples. Only the St. George Temple is farther than two hours away. On November 2, 1997, we will have the Vernal Temple dedicated, our tenth temple in Utah. It will service more than 36,000 Saints in the area. What a blessing! The Vernal Temple will be the 51st operating temple of the Church. There will then be 27 temples in the United States and 24 spread throughout the world. We are a "temple-going" people. These temples will help strengthen our testimonies and bring us closer to our ancestors and to God.<br><br>Our prophet, Gordon B. Hinckley, has said:<br><br><i>Each temple built by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints stands as an expression of the testimony of this people that God our Eternal Father lives, that He has a plan for the blessing of His sons and daughters of all generations.</i>["This Peaceful House of God,"<i>Ensign,</i>May 1993, p. 74]<br><br>Last summer as I was touring with the International Folk Dancers on a professional development leave, we all had the experience of meeting with the temple president in Stockholm, Sweden, where the Saints of the Church in 1985 had their temple dedicated. He shared with us the fact that their temple district is very large. They have members come from as far away as Siberia, Russia--five long days of travel from the temple. These visitors have little means, and so the Saints in the area help house and care for them. The temple presidency sets aside the time for the Russian Church members to do work for a week and conduct all sessions in the Russian language. What a unique and wonderful experience for all involved, but what a lot of sacrifice for these dear Saints who travel so far and for those who help host them as guests over long periods of time. Opportunities like these fill their spiritual wells. Surely we who live in this area who are worthy to visit the temple should appreciate more the closeness of our Father's houses, where we can visit frequently and grow in wisdom, light, and truth.<br><br>There are many other ways to build our testimonies and sensitize our spirits: daily prayer, reading and studying the scriptures, attending our Sunday services, reading out of the best books, following the promptings of the Spirit, serving others, striving to be a good example of gospel living, sharing our talents and gifts, attending the many uplifting firesides and devotionals on campus, treating our earthly bodies as temples, and following the counsel of our prophet, Gordon B. Hinckley. These are only just a few principles, but because all of us are so individual, we all need to work on various challenges. One gospel principle may be difficult for one person to follow, and another principle may be more challenging for someone else. The important fact, however, is that we are diligently working to strengthen our testimony in those areas where we would most benefit. If we are to build our testimonies, we cannot do it without the help of the Holy Ghost.<br><br>The Holy Ghost should be our closest companion. He is a member of the Godhead. The Godhead comprises Heavenly Father, Jesus Christ, and the Holy Ghost. They are unified in purpose, but each has an important responsibility concerning the plan of salvation. Our Heavenly Father is our Father and ruler, Christ is our brother and Savior, and the Holy Ghost is the revealer and testifier of all truth. Even though he is a spirit, he has the form and likeness of a man. He can only be in one place at one time, but his influence can be felt everywhere at the same time. Because he has no body, he can dwell in us to help guide and direct us in paths of righteousness. He is our Heavenly Father's messenger and is a sacred gift to us.<br><br>In Moroni 10:5 we read: "And by the power of the Holy Ghost ye may know the truth of all things." What a promise! It is through the Holy Ghost that we know that God lives, that Jesus is the Christ and our Savior, and that the Church has been restored in these latter days. The Holy Ghost helps us to fulfill our divine potential and sanctifies us to prepare to meet God one day. He purifies our hearts so we no longer wish to be partakers of evil. He will be with us only on his terms, however. If we do not strive to obey the commandments of God and keep our thoughts and actions pure, we will not have this wonderful spiritual power to help us. Joseph Fielding Smith said:<br><br><i>When a man has the manifestation from the Holy Ghost, it leaves an indelible impression on his soul, one that is not easily erased. It is Spirit speaking to spirit, and it comes with convincing force. A manifestation of an angel, or even of the Son of God himself, would impress the eye and mind, and eventually become dimmed, but the impressions of the Holy Ghost sink deeper into the soul and are more difficult to erase.</i>[<i>Answers to Gospel Questions,</i>comp. Joseph Fielding Smith, Jr., 5 vols. (Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Company, 1954–56), 2:151]<br><br>The Holy Ghost can temporarily guide a person without that person receiving the "gift of the Holy Ghost," but the guidance will not continue unless one is baptized and confirmed a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and then only if one lives worthily. Having the Holy Ghost as our constant companion brings peace to our hearts and minds and allows us to understand the things of God.<br><br>I remember an incident when the Holy Ghost guided me as I was touring last summer to Scandinavia. The International Folk Dance Ensemble was to give a fireside for our last evening in Finland before we left for Saint Petersburg, Russia, the next morning, where we would end the tour. We always appreciate the opportunity to share our testimonies, both in word and song, with the Saints we meet in the many areas we visit. Earlier that day we had been hosted by the American embassy in Finland. It was a pleasant encounter and an opportunity to let those there know about our beliefs and what we stand for. One of our leaders was carrying all of the tour funds because much money had been transferred to other currency. Inadvertently the black case containing the money was left at a bus stop when all of the group jumped on for a quick transfer that would get us back in time for the fireside.<br><br>It was when we had reached another transfer that the black case was found missing. While the rest of the group went to the chapel, the leader quickly retraced connections, only to find the bag missing. We were all downhearted and worried because the Russian officials would not allow us to finish the tour without our own funding. We sought out a room in the ward house and knelt while a prayer was offered in our behalf. We were indeed a somber group.<br><br>After we left the room, a member of the Church who knew about the loss asked me what we would do. I said without hesitation, "The case will be found and all will be well." I had such a calm feeling. I knew that our Father in Heaven was watching over us. For me, however, this was not a normal response. Losing that much money anywhere in the world would be disastrous.<br><br>We went on to ready ourselves for the fireside as planned, but just as we were about to proceed, a man came to find the leader who had lost the bag. The man reported that a black case had been found and turned into the police, who had seen the USA address and called the American embassy where we had just been hosted. The embassy personnel had called us, knowing where we were expected to be that evening. Two young boys of about 13 or 14 found the bag and turned it in when they saw how much money there was. They might have been afraid that it was gang related. As is customary in Finland, a certain percentage of any money found is due the finders. What a small price the $500 given to the boys was compared to how penniless we would have been. Within a five-hour period, all factors had fallen into place to find and return the money we so badly needed. This truly was a miracle.<br><br>As I said, the Holy Ghost confirmed to my mind throughout this ordeal that all would be well. What a blessing to have the Holy Ghost to guide and lead us daily. He has given me answers and helped calm my spirit many times, such as when we were at checkpoints in Russia and our guides were not allowed to meet us to help with the crossing--yet we cleared in record time; or the time our costumes were held in customs and we had a show that evening and needed the authorities of the country to soften their attitudes and help us--and they did; or the time in South America when a small temple housing unit had to accommodate us for a week because our previous contract had fallen through--but all the right connections were still made. The Holy Ghost helped us in each instance. He is only waiting for us to ask in righteousness and faith for the support we often need.<br><br>To keep our spiritual wells full, we need to give of our waters. The Lord counts on us to be his servants. King Benjamin wrote in Mosiah 2:17, "When ye are in the service of your fellow beings ye are only in the service of your God." Because we are all blessed with so much, especially here in this land of freedom and opportunity, we must make service our trademark. One can feel the spirit of those who continually serve when help is needed. They have a certain love, caring, and spirit about them. I like the way Sister Chieko Okazaki feels about service: "Service is the signature ... of the Savior. ... In nothing do we resemble the Savior more than in serving others" (Chieko Okazaki,<i>Aloha!</i>[Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Company, 1995], pp. 84–85). The Savior was the perfect example of service. His mission was to come to earth to serve others and give his life for us. While he was on the earth he served the ignorant, poor, sinful, and despised. He fed the hungry, healed the sick, raised the dead, and taught the gospel to all who would follow him.<br><br>Even though he was our God, Savior, and Lord of this earth, he always performed acts of humble service. We must follow his example. In service we find ourselves becoming less selfish, more able to love, and having more joy. Our own problems seem less serious, and we are on the road to gaining eternal life. There are many ways to serve others. We can help physically, socially, economically, and spiritually. Throughout our lifetimes, all of us will need help from others. We have often heard it said that it is usually through another person that God meets our needs. We must be his servants.<br><br>What have you done today in the way of service to another? Have you been the Lord's missionary for good? Have you put others' needs above your own? I have found that the more you give to others, the more it all seems to come back in full measure. Sister Okazaki counsels us to concentrate on the joy of service, not on the "job." We need not set unrealistic expectations upon ourselves, but we can find a balance of what we can give. We alone must choose. It is like the story I began with: If we have faith to keep filling our own spiritual wells, we will have the resources and desire to help others to fill theirs.<br><br>I truly believe we come closer to and more like our Savior and Father in Heaven through service. About two years ago the counselor in the stake presidency of the Sunset Heights Stake came to visit me one evening. We had just moved to a small house while our other home was being built, to be completed in March. It was just after Christmas. My daughter had announced that she had accepted a proposal and wished to marry in March. Some of you know well that getting a wedding ready for a bride is no small task. I still needed to prepare a national conference presentation for the last of March and had my regular heavy load as a faculty member for winter semester. The counselor wanted me to serve as the director of a stake dance festival for the youth focused on the Israeli culture. You guessed it--it was at the end of March. I knew a number of Israeli dances that would fit the occasion and felt I could do this calling because of my background, but now was not the time. I had too much to do!<br><br>He told me to think about it. I did for about two minutes, then said, "I'll do my best. I have had too many blessings from to the Lord to shortchange him now." I have never had any calling in the Church that went so smoothly. Leaders were called from all of the wards to help me teach the dances to the youth, others helped with the facilities and equipment, parents and ward members helped with costumes, and the dance festival came off wonderfully. I learned a very important lesson again: the Lord does want us to serve where we are chosen, and he will help those who serve him if they are willing and faithful. I still have young people and leaders mention their fond memories of the festival. I even now draw from this experience to keep my own spiritual well full.<br><br>Sometimes service can actually save the lives and the spirits of others. While I was in Sweden last summer, I had a sister tell me of a story of service she and others had performed for an orphanage in Russia. The story has been written in the book entitled<i>To Rejoice as Women,</i>written by Veronika Ekelund. I would like to tell a very short version.<br><br>When the Relief Society had its sesquicentennial anniversary not long ago, sisters from all over the world were challenged to do significant acts of service for their community. When they found how much the children were in need, the Handen Ward in Stockholm, Sweden, decided to direct their attention to the plight of the poor in a Russian orphanage in Syktyvkar. It was far from Stockholm. To get there from Moscow took 26 hours on a train. Bishop Rydgren approved the project just as long as all ward members participated. They found that the children in the orphanage had to take shifts going to school because they lacked the warm clothing necessary. When the Swedish ward learned this, everyone in the ward wanted to donate warm clothing and any other items that would benefit the children. The response of the Saints was overwhelming. They gave a refrigerator, two sewing machines, clothes, tools, dishes, shoes, skis, ice skates, toys, and more. There was so much that they wondered how they could transport all of the items. The estimated cost of $30,000 was too high for chartering a plane and the drive was too far (about as far as from Salt Lake City to Mexico City). It would also have been dangerous, due to off-limits military regions and bandits who would do anything to gain the goods. It looked as if the project would die after all.<br><br>After much prayer and searching, a friend, Svetlana, was found in Moscow, and the goods were shipped to her in 258 boxes. They needed to be guarded, and as is usually the case, the right forms releasing them to her were not there. After managing to obtain the signed forms, she finally persuaded the customs office to let her take the boxes. Then began the difficult work of transporting the goods by train to Syktyvkar.<br><br>What an ordeal! The Swedish Relief Society president and her husband, Ingrid and Mats, who went with Svetlana, were overjoyed when they saw the 65 children and 15 leaders at the orphanage receive the boxes. Many of the children had no parents, or their parents were ill, mentally disabled, or imprisoned or had abandoned them. The donated items brought great pleasure to all the recipients.<br><br>The children in turn presented a special program of dance, song, and drama. In Russia the arts are an established part of their culture, and this was their way of saying "Thank you." That reunion had brought much happiness. The husband and wife returned to Sweden with loving stories to tell all of the ward. The joy did not stop there, however. The ward decided to bring all the children and leaders to Stockholm for Christmas. What an undertaking! They needed visas, transportation, and special care. All was worked out after much preparation, and the children arrived on December 26. The Saints were able to share their homes and testimonies with their newly found friends. The Spirit brought all closer together. A local hospital donated its services to help 10 of the children with eye exams. They found that two of the children who were wearing glasses didn't need them, and others needed stronger lenses. Some had bleeding sores on the bridges of their noses because of the heavy glasses they had been wearing. What a difference the lightweight glasses made.<br><br>After the children left, there was a great deal of joy. The members knew that the children would be much better off for the experience. Jekaterina, one of the leaders at the orphanage, said upon their return:<br><br><i>When we have dark days here ... and I can assure you, at times it feels like we cannot go on, I gather the children around me and we talk about our friends in Sweden. We talk about all you have done for us, and in particular, the joy that radiates when you smile. We believe that joy comes from your faith. Please, give us your smiles. And your faith.</i>[Veronika Ekelund, "From Nauvoo to Russia: The Reach of Relief Society," in<i>To Rejoice as Women: Talks from the 1994 Women's Conference</i>[Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Company, 1994], p. 175]<br><br>This ward in Sweden did truly perform a miracle, one that will be remembered by many for years to come. Those members are an example to all of us when it comes to unselfish service and filling others' spiritual and physical wells. I requested the opening song today to be "I Am a Child of God," sung in three different languages, because I believe every one of us truly is his child. I am the Sunset Heights Fourth Ward Primary senior chorister at the present time. Last summer, before I left on my Scandinavian tour, I taught the children the song "I Am a Child of God" in English, Spanish, and Russian. They had fun learning it, and I had hoped they would have more of a connection with their international brothers and sisters in the Church. By the end of the teaching time, they had learned the different languages of the song better than I had. I loved to hear them sing the song with much conviction and love.<br><br>I was in for a big surprise while attending a Sunday service in Norway. Our BYU group was with the youth of the ward in a room where a number of the dancers shared their testimonies. I was sitting on the back row next to the wall. Suddenly I heard a faint familiar sound in the room next to me. It was the Primary children singing "I Am a Child of God" in Norwegian. What an unexpected treat for me. It brought tears to my eyes to know that we are truly all children of our Father in Heaven and that he loves us whoever we are.<br><br>The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is an international church. I never would have believed that by this time in my life there would be more members of the Church living outside the United States than within. We may live in Africa, Asia, Europe, or the Americas, but a loving Father in Heaven will never let us stray and has provided a way to return to live with him forever. It is indeed our own choice, one that will affect the eternities.<br><br>I love the hymn we all sang in opening--"Choose the Right" (<i>Hymns,</i>1985, no. 239):<br><br><i>Choose the right when a choice is placed before you.<br>In the right the Holy Spirit guides;<br>And its light is forever shining o'er you,<br>When in the right your heart confides.</i><br><br><i>Choose the right! Let no spirit of digression<br>Overcome you in the evil hour.<br>There's the right and the wrong to ev'ry question;<br>Be safe thru inspiration's pow'r.</i><br><br><i>Choose the right! There is peace in righteous doing.<br>Choose the right! There's safety for the soul.<br>Choose the right in all labors you're pursuing;<br>Let God and heaven be your goal.</i><br><br><i>Choose the right! Choose the right!<br>Let wisdom mark the way before.<br>In its light, choose the right!<br>And God will bless you evermore.</i><br><br>In summary, it is my prayer that we will choose to keep our testimonies growing, follow the promptings of the Holy Ghost, and render service to others.<br><br>I have a firm testimony of the Lord Jesus Christ and my Father in Heaven that I cannot take for granted. I have been blessed greatly because of this knowledge and feel it a wonderful blessing to serve here at this university with all of its opportunities to truly become a follower of our Savior. I know that the Church was restored by Joseph Smith in these the latter days, and I will be ever grateful for the spirit of the Holy Ghost that sustains me and directs my path. We are all children of a loving Father: "God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life (John 3:16). It is my prayer that each of you will fill your wells and keep them flowing to serve others as you try to become more like our Savior, Jesus Christ. I say this in his name. Amen.<br><br><i>Susanne Johnson Davis was a professor and division administrator in the BYU Department of Dance when this devotional address was given on 5 August 1997.</i><br><br><i>© Brigham Young University.

<h1>Happiness - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Through repeated prayers offered in preparation of this message, I have had one objective: that I be led to communicate truths that would significantly help each of you find happiness. I recognize that the great majority I address are faithful sons and daughters of Father in Heaven who strive to obey his commandments--or sincere individuals who want to do so. For that reason I would speak to each of you as though we were in a private conversation where we share our purest feelings, our aspirations, our hopes, and our dreams as two can do when there is mutual trust and a common basis of belief. I encourage you to write the feelings and impressions that come to you. I have prayed that the Spirit confirm to your mind and heart the essence of what I would like to communicate.<br><br>For some time I have known how I wanted to begin this message, yet I have always been very careful not to share sacred experiences without a feeling of authorization to do so. I thought first of merely stating the principles that I learned from one such experience without reference to the specific event. Yet I realized that it would be far more meaningful if I related exactly what occurred. After prayerfully seeking guidance, I feel I can communicate an experience that is sacred to me. It indelibly taught how precious and of inestimable worth is the gospel plan or plan of happiness Heavenly Father has given us. I have seen that plan from a different perspective than ever before in my life, and that has given me greater understanding and appreciation for it. I pray that when we conclude you may feel that same gratitude. May you also resolve to take fuller advantage of the inexpressibly rich opportunities the Lord has given us for true happiness, now and forever.<br><br>Recently I awoke from a most disturbing dream. I ached physically, was saturated with perspiration, and my heart was pounding. Every sense was sharpened. The transition from sleep to wakefulness was imperceptible. I have come to recognize that as an indication of a significant spiritual experience in a dream. I had been taught lessons that would change my life. Although the actual dream was extensive, the key lessons communicated can be summarized by reference to a few specific experiences in the dream.<br><br>In it I found myself in a very different and unknown environment. Everything was strange to me. I could not recognize where I was or any of the individuals who surrounded me. I was anxiously seeking my wife, Jeanene. We had been separated, and I wanted very much to find her. Each individual I encountered said that I would not be able to do that. Repeatedly as I sought in different directions to find her, I was emphatically told to forget her for she would not be found. I was frustrated at every turn. One said, "She is no longer the same individual. There isn't a Jeanene like you knew."<br><br>I thought, that is impossible. I know her, and I know she will never change.<br><br>Then I was told, "You are not the same. There is no individual by the name of Richard Scott, and soon all of the memories you've had of Jeanene, your children, and other loved ones will be eradicated."<br><br>Fear entered my heart, accompanied by a horrifying feeling. Then came the thought: "No, that is impossible. Those relationships are enduring and unchanging. As long as we live righteously, they cannot be eliminated. They are eternally fixed."<br><br>As more encounters came I realized that I was surrounded with evil individuals who were completely unhappy, with no purpose save that of frustrating the happiness of others so that they too would become miserable. These wicked ones were striving to manipulate those persons over whom they sought to exercise control. I somehow was conscious that those who believed their lies were being led through treachery and deceit from what they wanted most. They soon began to believe that their individuality, their experience, and their relationships as families and friends were being altered and lost. They became angry, aggressive, and engulfed by feelings of hopelessness.<br><br>The pressure became more intense to accept as reality that what I had been no longer existed and that my cherished wife was no longer the same. Should I encounter her she wouldn't recognize me nor want me. I resisted those thoughts with every capacity that I could find. I was determined to find her. I knew that there must be a way and was resolute in searching no matter what the cost in time or effort.<br><br>It was then that I broke out of that oppressive surrounding and could see that it was an ugly, artificial, contrived environment. So intense were the feelings generated by what I had been told by those bent on destroying my hope to take me captive that I had not realized the forces of opposition that made my efforts appear fruitless could have no power over me unless I yielded through fear or abandonment of my principles. The environment appeared real, yet it had been generated from fear and threat. Although it was simulated, to those who let themselves believe the falsehoods thrust upon them it became reality.<br><br>I can now understand that because of my faith in the truths of the gospel plan, I could break through Satan's manipulative, evil environment to see it as it is--not only in the dream, but in real life as well--a confining, controlling, destructive influence that can be overcome by faith in and obedience to truth. Others were disheartened, disoriented, and finally overcome as they lost hope because they either lacked a foundation of truth to engender conviction, courage, and confidence or they let their belief be overcome by the pressure of the moment.<br><br>As I awoke there flooded over me feelings of love and gratitude for our Heavenly Father and his Beloved Son that I do not have the capacity to express. My heart and mind filled with consuming love for them and inexpressible appreciation for the blessings that are available to every spiritual child of Father in Heaven willing to believe and be obedient to the plan of happiness. I cannot convey the unspeakable joy, the feeling of being wrapped in pure love, the absolute assurance that we will never lose our identity or memory of cherished relationships or the benefits of righteous acts as we continue to resist evil and are obedient to truth.<br><br>Our Father's love, his perfections, and his perfect righteousness are absolute guarantees that we will ever exist as an individual entity, an intelligence clothed with spirit and body with latent divine capacities that mature and flower through obedience to his plan and his commandments. We have in his Son a perfect example of willing obedience and perfect love. How hopeless life would be without the absolute assurance of justice centered in fixed laws that are the bedrock foundation of the Father's plan. What is true one day cannot be manipulated to be something else by the whim or command of another personage. Your happiness is absolutely guaranteed as you willingly obey his commandments, receive all of the necessary ordinances, and are obedient to them, for he is a perfect, loving Father who will never change.<br><br>Somehow during that horrifying experience, I glimpsed how except for the Atonement of Jesus Christ, which lets us rectify mistakes through his plan of redemption, justice would demand a recompense for every error committed in life that we could not fulfill. Thus we could not return to Father in Heaven's presence. We would be left under the dominion of Lucifer, whose intent is to capture us and to destroy everything that is good and righteous in our beings. Over time we would become like Satan because we would lose all hope of returning to Father in Heaven and of benefiting from his righteousness, his mercy, and his perfect love.<br><br>Although I would not welcome another like experience, this dream has taught me how easy it is to take for granted our relationship with our Father in Heaven and his Beloved Son, our Master and Savior. Oh, how blessed are we that they are as they say they are, perfect in every possible capacity and attribute. Fundamental to their purpose is that you "might have joy" (2 Nephi 2:25).<br><br>Recognizing that you are a person who wants to live worthily and be obedient to Father in Heaven, how would Satan strive to lead you from the path to happiness? Surely he would not be successful by tempting you to commit serious transgression--at least not initially. He would more likely fill your mind and heart with visions of many, many worthwhile things--none of which could be criticized as being wrong, but, taken together, they would so occupy your time that you would not do those things that are absolutely essential for eternal life with Father in Heaven and his Beloved Son. Nephi warned of that approach:<br><br><i>And others will he pacify, and lull them away into carnal security, that they will say: All is well in Zion; yea, Zion prospereth, all is well--and thus the devil cheateth their souls, and leadeth them away carefully down to hell.</i><br><br><i>And behold, others he flattereth away, and telleth them there is no hell; and he saith unto them: I am no devil, for there is none--and thus he whispereth in their ears, until he grasps them with his awful chains, from whence there is no deliverance.</i>[2 Nephi 28:21–22]<br><br>It is clear that no one who has an inclination to live the commandments of God would intentionally do things that would separate him or her from the Lord. I am confident you have the intention of doing all of the right things. Yet I wonder, are you doing them as fully and as completely as you are capable of doing? That is not an accusatory question. It is one asked in sincerity to help you, if needed, to open your eyes and evaluate each day's decisions to confirm that what you are doing will lead you to where you most desire to be. Be certain that you are not being led "carefully" from the main track to happiness onto a sidetrack that can, in time, result in the loss of that which is most precious.<br><br>What are some of the warning signals that are red flags indicating danger ahead? Do you think of others more than of yourself? If you are married, are you more understanding of your companion, more anxious to make life easier for that beloved being than for yourself? Do you seek time with your children or your parents in preference to a group of private friends? Have you received all the ordinances of the temple that you can receive--or is that something left for a future day? If so, that day may never come. Does the acquiring of things, when viewed in the brilliant light of reality, sometimes mean more to you than obeying principles known to be true? Do you thirst after righteousness? Or are there times when the allure of stimulating images is allowed to temporarily fill your mind because, after all, they are really not that bad? Do your actions focus on entertainment, immediate satisfaction, self-interests, or personal gratification even though your goals are elsewhere?<br><br>Do you find yourself often thinking of all of the things that you wish you had that you've not been blessed to have--maybe even very desirable ones like a husband or wife or children, good health, more personal attractiveness, more joy and happiness and peace of mind--while neglecting to recognize all that the Lord has blessed you with already? Do you ever pray to him when your heart is so filled with things to thank him for that you do not feel inclined to ask for anything else?<br><br>If you are one of the truly happy individuals who love your Father in Heaven and are grateful for each day's blessings, reaching out to others in preference to thoughts of self, I rejoice for you. You have found a pattern of life that will ever bring you happiness. I can do little more than encourage you to continue to enjoy a life squarely centered in love of your Father in Heaven, your Savior, and those blessed to be within the circle of your righteous influence. If, however, you are among those who have not found a fullness of joy, even in your determination to live the commandments of the Lord, I pray that there could be something of worth in what we've talked about. I pray that you may feel how very much your Father in Heaven loves you and wants you to be happy. I pray that you will be stirred to recognize how infinitely blessed you are to have a Father in Heaven, to have a plan that is perfect, to be able to acquire a clear understanding of what brings happiness in life through pondering, prayer, and application of his teachings. I pray that you may grasp how comforting it is to have a fixed identity that can be counted on forever and to live in an environment where there is unchanging truth and justice tempered by mercy. May you be even more sensitive to the direction the Lord would give you in your personal life so that you may grow in understanding and perfection.<br><br>In my dream there was no physical evidence that what my faith led me to do could be done. There was nothing to indicate in any way that what I so much desired could possibly happen. There was nothing that I could see or hear or touch to encourage me. On the contrary, all around me was like a confirmation that I would never see the Jeanene I so much love ever again. Now I recognize that it was my faith in our Father in Heaven and his perfect Son as well as in their holy plan of happiness that freed me from that devastating environment. Fortunately you do not have to live in a world where there is nothing to support you in your convictions. By the choices you make, you can surround yourself with individuals and influences that will constantly aid you in your determination to live the commandments of God. In so doing you will receive the fullness of blessings possible from his comprehensive plan of happiness conditioned to your specific needs. By choosing to continually participate in Church activities you constantly renew influences for good from others with like dreams and the determination to live righteous lives. As you serve others there comes a strengthening of your own capacities. There quietly distills upon you a confirmation that those principles that guide your life taken from the Lord's commandments are true. Your selfless service to others in your home, in the Church, and in every other walk of life will help verify your confidence in the plan of the Lord. You will know that Satan can have no power over you except as permitted by fear, indolence, disobedience, and appetite.<br><br>In contrast, everywhere about you there are individuals that embrace the appealing offerings of Satan as the only real way of life. They do not recognize and many even deny the existence of spiritual guidance or the reality of a loving Father in Heaven. They allow themselves to be convinced that what is really enduring is what they see, touch, smell, hear, and taste. In short, they confine themselves to the world Satan wants them to be confined in. They cut themselves off from the glorious opportunities that their holy Father in Heaven wants them to have. Don't you make that mistake.<br><br>One can center his or her life in falsehood as though it were truth and be increasingly bound by the arch enemy of God while being subtly led from eternal happiness.<br><br>Although it may not be a welcome insight, you will grow more rapidly through challenge and trial than from a life of ease and serenity with no disturbing elements. The intent of your Father in Heaven is to lift you from where you are to where he knows you will have eternal purpose and unspeakable happiness. By using the talents, abilities, and latent capacities developed in the premortal existence, he will lead you through growth experiences here on earth. When faced squarely and lived fully without complaint, they will raise you to glorious heights of accomplishment and service. To do all of that during the brief period you are on earth is a tremendous challenge. To accelerate your growth and attainment in his plan for you, sometimes he employs a pattern described on the label of some medicines: "shake well before using."<br><br>Such shaking comes through stirring challenges and stretching tests. You likely have encountered some already. You undoubtedly will encounter others. They may come in the form of an accident, the conferral of a great responsibility, or a move that dramatically changes your surroundings and circle of trusted friends. You may begin educational or professional pursuits that prove far more demanding than anticipated. Perhaps personal illness, handicaps, or the death of a loved one puts seeming barriers in your path. In truth they are more likely giant steps intended to lift you to higher levels of understanding and accomplishment. How these challenges are confronted is critically important to your happiness and personal growth now and forever. When armed with the power that an understanding and application of the teachings of the Lord provide--and with faith in him and in the capacity of the Holy Ghost to guide and fortify--you will overcome those challenges and gain the intended growth and attainment. As you remember that you are an eternal being, with latent capacities derived from divine parentage, you will not allow yourself to be limited by the confining world that Satan would have you believe is all that exists.<br><br>How can you see with greater clarity and feel more intensely the help that is available beyond the veil of this physical world? I would remind you of six of the many sources of help.<br><h2><b>First: Guiding Principles</b></h2><br>Establish a set of guiding principles for your life. You likely have done that. With such standards you will not make the wrong decisions on the basis of the circumstances and the pressures of the day. Principles that you are determined to live by will keep you on track. There is no better set than the teachings of Jesus Christ, his gospel, and the principles that flow from them. As you crystallize guiding principles for life, be honest with yourself and with the Lord. My experience is that most of the tragedy, disappointment, and lack of attainment in life comes when one is dishonest with himself or with the Lord.<br><br>Then never compromise your principles, no matter how it seems that circumstance would allow some departure from them. Don't do it. Rationalization--to take something that is true and try to twist it to justify invalid exceptions--is Satan's tool to lead you from truth. Difficulties in life start when small deviations from your standards are justified on the basis of circumstance. Don't let that occur. Strength comes from making no exceptions to your principles. Individuals who live for the moment, who make decisions on the basis of current circumstances or what someone else would lead them to do, eventually are doomed to violate eternal law and to lose the great opportunities of life. They may temporarily leap ahead in a particular aspect of life, but they lose those things that bring happiness in the overall purpose of life. When you center your life in truth, you are assured success and happiness.<br><h2><b>Second: Scriptures</b></h2><br>The scriptures are an excellent source of understanding and strength. When carefully read, pondered, and the truths revealed applied diligently, they are an important source of worthy motivation and strength. They fortify faith in truth. As you read the scriptures with faith in the Redeemer and confidence and trust in the plan of salvation, you will receive great strength. Your courage to do what you know is right will be enhanced. You will be fortified in the necessary discipline in your life essential to consistent obedience to the teachings of the Lord and continually adherence to the most important priorities of life.<br><br>The scriptures give eloquent confirmation of how truth, consistently lived, opens the door to inspiration to know what to do and where you are needed to have your capacities enhanced by divine power. As you reflect upon the examples of how others' capacities to conquer difficulty, doubt, and seemingly insurmountable challenges were strengthened by the Lord in time of need, there will come a quiet confirmation through the Holy Spirit that their experiences are true. You will know that similar help is available to you on the conditions prescribed by the Lord.<br><h2><b>Third: Temple Worship</b></h2><br>Another most significant way to enhance your capacity to understand and live eternal truth is through temple worship. Only by receiving the fullness of temple ordinances and living the covenants made there can you enter into the highest degree of glory and receive the greatest measure of happiness eternally. Temple attendance has a calming, settling, consoling influence that distills peace and contentment. The accompanying family history work to identify ancestors to receive those ordinances yields similar blessings.<br><h2><b>Fourth: Prayer</b></h2><br>You have likely found that prayer can be a source of great comfort, direction, and sustaining power. Too often in the routine of daily life you may be tempted to offer hurried, mechanical communications to the Lord. You know they are of little value. Prayers that bring comfort, solace, direction, and great inner strength are of the variety offered by Enos. His record teaches you the importance of praying with faith in Christ and being diligent in keeping his commandments. These words of Enos show how to pray for something vital:<br><br><i>My</i>faith<i>began to be</i>unshaken in the Lord;<i>and I</i>prayed<i>unto him with</i>many long strugglings<i>for my brethren, the Lamanites.</i><br><br><i>And it came to pass that after I had</i>prayed and labored with all diligence,<i>the Lord said unto me: I will grant unto thee according to thy desires,</i>because of thy faith. [Enos 1:11–12; emphasis added]<br><h2><b>Fifth: Faith</b></h2><br>All that I have said is true. May it help you. Yet there will ever be a need for you to walk to the edge of the light of the knowledge and testimony you possess into the twilight area of faith. You will be asked to exercise faith in truths you have not yet come to prove through your own experience or through the sacred witness of the Holy Ghost.<br><br>Exercise faith. Faith is abiding trust in truth. Faith leads one to action, to achieve goals even when there is little visible evidence to give hope of success. It is a source of power to know simple yet profoundly important, priceless truths and to have the faith to live them. Enduring happiness is rooted in unchangeable truth.<br><h2><b>Sixth: Good Music</b></h2><br>Good music, especially sacred music, makes spiritual things more understandable. It is edifying and conducive to understanding. It prepares emotions for response to promptings of the Holy Spirit.<br><br>My prayer is that you may be helped in every way to live your life in the world of reality--the Lord's reality founded on his eternal truth, his plan of happiness--so that you will not be captured by the artificial environment that Satan would try to make you believe is all that exists. The environment of your Heavenly Father leads to celestial happiness. The environment of Satan leads to anguish, hatred, and enduring misery.<br><br>Your goals are noble, but you decide by the choices you make each day whether they will be realized or not. A knowledge of truth is of little value unless lived in full measure.<br><br>If you think it is too hard, that you are imperfect and will not be able to do it, you are slipping into Satan's world. Garner strength by remembering that you can do anything the Lord asks you to do. When needed, he will see that you get the required help as you do all you are capable of doing. It is the intent of our Father in Heaven to take you from your current state of progression to the highest levels of attainment in celestial worlds. You don't know how he can do it, yet by meeting each test you demonstrate your faith in the Savior and in the plan of your holy Father. Though you do not see the end from the beginning, your trust in them will give you the capacity to overcome.<br><br>It is a principle of happiness to work hard and to obey willingly the principles of truth, confident that the Lord will open doors of help when needed. Our Father in Heaven will not violate his plan. He will not give eternal blessings to those who want them but have not paid the price in repentance (when needed) and consistent obedience. All of the richest blessings Father in Heaven has in store are within the reach of every individual who submits to the will of the Father and consistently lives his commandments and receives all of the ordinances and covenants he is able to have in this life.<br><br>This dream helped me understand as never before what<i>hopeless</i>means. How grateful I am that in the Savior there is absolute surety of eternal life when we pay the price of obedience and receive the necessary ordinances and keep the covenants made therein. Our faith in justice and in mercy and in Jesus Christ and our confidence in the perfect Father lay a foundation for happiness in this life and provide assurance of eternal happiness.<br><br>Although I have with significant effort tried to make as clear to you as my dream did to me the difference between Satan's plan of entrapment and our Father's plan of happiness, I do not feel that I have succeeded. I therefore pray that as you ponder the things we have discussed that the Holy Ghost will bear witness to you of the truths I have tried to emphasize.<br><br>For our time together to have enduring benefit, you need to do something with the insights shared. You may already have begun. Make the commitments you are impressed to make with the Lord and keep them.<br><br>All of what we have discussed is true because you have a Father in Heaven who loves you very much and wants your eternal happiness and also because you have a Savior and Redeemer. He willingly took upon himself the consequences of all the transgressions of the Father's children that have been or ever will be committed. As Jehovah he understood what his Father asked him to do, as only a god could. Yet it was through this experience and those that followed--culminating in his giving of his life, being laid in the tomb, and his glorious resurrection--that he earned the right to judge each of Father in Heaven's children according to how they use this time of probation here on earth. Although he committed absolutely no transgression, he allowed the consequences of all others' transgressions to come upon him and thereby learned what, as a Savior, he needed to know and feel. We cannot comprehend, we cannot appreciate adequately the price he paid nor what this selfless, sinless, perfect being has done for us in total obedience to his Father's will.<br><br>I solemnly witness that God our Father lives, that his plan is perfect. I bear testimony that as you raise your voice in prayer, those prayers are heard and can best be answered when they come from a broken heart and a contrite spirit. I know that someday I will be judged on how well I testified of my certain knowledge of Jesus Christ. Therefore I solemnly witness that because of the Atonement of the Savior, the plan of happiness will succeed and Satan's plan is doomed to failure. I know that Jesus Christ lives. I solemnly witness with every capacity that I possess that he lives and that he loves you and will help you find happiness. I say this in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Richard G.

<h1> Freedom and the Search for Truth - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
The quest for truth and knowledge is as old as time. From the beginning men and women have searched for truth in the hope of better understanding life's purposes and to improve life. The temptation put before Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden was that of knowledge. If they partook of the forbidden fruit from the "tree of the knowledge of good and evil" (Moses 3:16–17), they were promised:<br><br><i>Ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.</i><br><br><i>And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food . . . and a tree to be desired to make her wise, she . . . did eat.</i>[Moses 4:11–12]<br><br>Just as Adam and Eve desired knowledge to become more like God, so Abraham's desire for knowledge was linked to his quest to be a more righteous person. He stated:<br><br><i>I sought for the blessings of the fathers, and the right whereunto I should be ordained to administer the same; having been myself a follower of righteousness, desiring also to be one who possessed great knowledge, and to be a greater follower of righteousness.</i>[Abraham 1:2]<br><br>With the same spirit, Aristotle described the importance of possessing knowledge so that one can practice virtue and take those actions that will improve not only one's own life but the lives of others. He said:<br><br><i>In practical matters the end is not mere speculative knowledge of what is to be done, but rather the doing of it. It is not enough to know about Virtue, then, but we must endeavour to possess it, and to use it, or to take any other steps that may make us good.</i>[Aristotle,<i>Nicomachean Ethics,</i>X, 9, 1]<br><br>As Aristotle pointed out, knowledge is not the end but an important means to the end. It provides the basis for understanding, for living, and for becoming. He understood that knowledge for knowledge's sake alone was not fulfilling. Just as Adam, Eve, and Abraham desired knowledge in order to be better people, so Aristotle associated knowledge with goodness. This same principle was taught by the Lord to the Prophet Joseph Smith: "And if a person gains more knowledge and intelligence in this life through his diligence and obedience than another, he will have so much the advantage in the world to come" (D&amp;amp;C 130:19). And further, "It is impossible for a man [or woman] to be saved in ignorance" (D&amp;amp;C 131:6).<br><h2><b>God's Omniscience</b></h2><br>The Savior's injunction "Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect" (Matthew 5:48) sets a standard for us. One of God's principal attributes is that of omniscience. The scriptural record provides assurance that God is infinite in his understanding (Psalms 147:5), is all-knowing (2Nephi 9:20), and possesses a fullness of truth (D&amp;amp;C 93:11). Elder Neal A. Maxwell has written:<br><br><i>God, who knows the beginning from the end, knows, therefore, all that is in between. . . .</i><br><br><i>Below the scripture that declares that God knows "all things" there is no footnote reading</i>"except<i>that God is a little weak in geophysics"! We do not worship a God who simply forecasts a generally greater frequency of earthquakes in the last days before the second coming of His Son; He knows precisely when and where all these will occur. God has even prophesied that the Mount of Olives will cleave in twain at a precise latter-day time as Israel is besieged. (Zechariah 14:4.)</i><br><br><i>There are no qualifiers, only flat and absolute assertions of the omniscience of God.</i>[Neal A. Maxwell,<i>All These Things Shall Give Thee Experience</i>(Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Company, 1980, p. 7; emphasis in original]<br><br>The Savior describes omniscience as the glory of God, which is "intelligence, or . . . light and truth" and then states that "light and truth forsake that evil one" (D&amp;amp;C 93:36–37). Intelligence is not only the capacity to analyze, synthesize, and store information but also the disposition to act righteously (see David H. Yarn, Jr., "My Age of Preparation,"<i>BYU 1995–96 Speeches</i>[Provo: Brigham Young University, 1996], pp. 315–21). As noted earlier, our first parents, the prophet Abraham, and Aristotle understood this important linkage.<br><br>John the Baptist bore record that Jesus received a fullness of truth from the Father. John told the Jews: "God giveth not the Spirit by measure unto him. The Father loveth the Son, and hath given all things into his hand" (John 3:34–35). The process by which we obtain knowledge and gain access to truth is "line upon line, precept upon precept, here a little and there a little" (2 Nephi 28:30). The Savior also "received not of the fulness at the first" (D&amp;amp;C 93:12–13), but, given his perfection and godly status in premortality, the Spirit was given him in full measure. He grew from "grace to grace" until he received a fullness of truth and light. Christ described himself as "the light of the world" (John 8:12), and John called Christ "the true Light, which lighteth every man [and woman] that cometh into the world" (John 1:9). Peter, James, and John became special witnesses of his extraordinary light when they beheld him in his glory on the mount as the "only begotten of the Father" (John 1:14). The three apostles reported that Christ's "face did shine as the sun, and his raiment was white as the light" (Matthew 17:2). It is significant that John links the Savior's light and truth with his royal birth (John 1:4–14). In the appearance of the Father and the Son to the Prophet Joseph Smith, Joseph, too, became a witness of their omniscience, or light and truth. He describes the pillar of light as "above the brightness of the sun" and their personages as having "brightness and glory" beyond "all description" (JS--H 1:16–17).<br><h2><b>Man's Search for Truth</b></h2><br>Not only are the Father and Son filled with light and, therefore, possessors of all knowledge, wisdom, and understanding, but we are told that it is possible for us to receive light and truth until we are "glorified in truth and [know] all things" (D&amp;amp;C 93:28). The eternal potential of men and women includes a fullness of light and truth.<br><br>As noted above, the first principle underlying the acquisition of knowledge and intelligence is diligence (i.e., persistent mental and physical exertion). Generally, the acquisition of knowledge is in proportion to one's effort to learn. As students apply themselves to a particular subject, their capacity to understand increases and their mastery of the subject allows them to use the discipline to inform others, to produce innovations, and to discover new truths.<br><br>The second principle is obedience to law. The discovery of secular truth generally occurs when certain principles are followed. First, a hypothesis is formulated that relates cause and effect. Second, data is gathered, and then the hypothesis is tested. An error term is usually included in the model to represent the unknown variables that have been omitted. The smaller the error term in the test, the greater one's confidence in the results. A large error term will lead one to reject the hypothesis.<br><br>The acquisition of sacred knowledge follows the same principles. Spiritual truths are received through faith and obedience. Joseph Smith stated "that when a man works by faith he works by mental exertion instead of physical force" (<i>Lectures on Faith,</i>compiled by N. B. Lundwall [Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, n.d.], p. 61 [7:3]). Diligent mental exertion is required in one's desires and efforts to learn sacred truths. The mental exertion required in the laboratory of faith is at least as much as that required in the art studio or the science lab. Further, the principle of diligence in the discovery of spiritual truth is a necessary but not a sufficient condition. Spiritual truth is known only through the Spirit, and obedience to God's commandments is required in order to access the Holy Ghost (see 1 Corinthians 2:9–14).<br><br>In this dispensation, revelation has made clear the responsibility of each person to search for truth--both secular and sacred. We are to be<br><br><i>instructed . . . in theory, in principle, in doctrine, in the law of the gospel. . . .</i><br><br><i>Of things both in heaven and in the earth . . . ; things which have been, things which are, things which must shortly come to pass . . . ; the wars and the perplexities of the nations . . . ; and a knowledge also of countries. . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . and . . . languages, tongues, and people.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 88:78–79, 90:15]<br><br>We are commanded to seek "diligently and teach one another words of wisdom; yea, seek ye out of the best books words of wisdom; seek learning, even by study and also by faith" (D&amp;amp;C 88:118).<br><br>Here are some of Brigham Young's comments concerning the purpose of mortality:<br><br><i>This life is worth as much to us as any life in the eternities of the Gods.</i>[<i>JD</i>]<i>9:170.</i><br><br><i>The object of this existence is to learn, which we can only do a little at a time. 9:167.</i><br><br><i>What are we here for? To learn to enjoy more, and to increase in knowledge and in experience. 14:228.</i><br><br><i>The whole mortal existence of man is neither more nor less than a preparatory state given to finite beings, a space wherein they may improve themselves for a higher state of being. 1:334.</i>[<i>Discourses of Brigham Young,</i>sel. John A. Widtsoe (Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Company, 1941), p. 87]<br><br>Brothers and sisters, we have the privilege of being engaged in the loftiest of pursuits at Brigham Young University--the search for truth and the dispensing of it. As individuals we are internally motivated by our divine nature to pursue truth. The core of our being is intelligence, or "light and truth." The scripture states that "man was also in the beginning with God. Intelligence, or the light of truth, was not created or made, neither indeed can be" (D&amp;amp;C 93:29). A part of us has always existed. It is intelligence, or light. We are told that "intelligence cleaveth unto intelligence . . . ; light cleaveth unto light" (D&amp;amp;C 88:40). One light to which our intelligence cleaves is the added light given at birth called the Light of Christ. Every human being receives this light so that he or she may know good from evil and be invited to do good (see Moroni 7:15–16). No wonder people hunger for truth. The insatiable desire is innate within each person and is enhanced by the Savior's light. It is a driving force that propels us along the path of eternal progression. When we act on the light, more light is received. When we lose light through sin, the insatiable desire may be partially or wholly reduced as our capacity to accept additional light is diminished.<br><h2><b>The Search for Truth at Brigham Young University</b></h2><br>What is BYU's role among the major universities in the search for truth? The purpose of any university is at least fourfold. The first is to discover truth; the second is to organize those discoveries; the third is to store knowledge for current and future generations; and the fourth is to teach truth to students and others. At this university we add one additional function. Students are to be taught how to live for the eternities. Where is BYU in this process?<br><br>From the beginning the university has emphasized teaching, or the dissemination of truth. Brigham Young Academy was a normal school established for the purpose of training teachers. The quality of teaching is still critical. A hallmark of this university is the attention that faculty give to students. During the past two years I have interviewed a number of BYU graduates who are now graduate students at other universities. I have asked them about their progress relative to their colleagues from other highly reputable institutions. Invariably the students share with me the fears and concerns they had at the time they entered graduate school. At first, like almost every other graduate student, they were unsure regarding their ability to compete. Within three to four months, however, many realized that their BYU education was equal or superior to the undergraduate experience of their friends. When asked about the strengths of their BYU experience, their answers often pointed to the quality of instruction and the close relationships they had with BYU faculty members. Recently an outstanding graduate of one of the top three or four major universities in America enrolled at BYU for additional undergraduate training. The reason given was that he was unable to obtain the quality of instruction desired because faculty access was almost nonexistent at the other school. At the particular institution in question, emphasis on research seemed to preclude faculty from spending time with undergraduate students outside the classroom.<br><br>Given a 90:10 undergraduate-to-graduate ratio and an emphasis on quality instruction, is the search for truth at BYU relegated to a second priority? The answer must be no! The discovery of truth is as important at this university as its dissemination, for a number ofreasons. The quest for and discovery of knowledge helps the<br><br><i>(1) . . . faculty to remain current in their disciplines and "alive" in teaching; (2) scholarly work contributes directly to the education of the students, both graduate and undergraduate; (3) scholarly work establishes the credibility of BYU and the . . . faculty in national academic/professional circles.</i>["A Model for Directing Scholarly Work at Brigham Young University," Brigham Young University Office of Research and Creative Activities, 1994, p. 6]<br><br>The search for truth is part of the divine nature, and I believe there are some secular truths yet to be discovered that have been reserved for the faithful. We must be contributors to the world's storehouse of knowledge to improve the lives of others.<br><br>During the past three decades, creativity in the arts and scientific research have become an integral part of BYU's program. I use the word<i>integral</i>for a special reason. My experience at five universities suggests that the best teachers, sacred or secular, are engaged in the discovery process. The discovery of truth and the creation of beauty are exhausting experiences, but they are also exhilarating ones as new light and energy are unleashed. Key attributes of a good teacher are knowledge and enthusiasm. Both are generated by the discovery process.<br><br>The most notable change in this university during the past three decades is the maturation of our scholarship. Funding from the board of trustees has allowed faculty loads in many areas to be reduced to a level that makes both the discovery of truth and quality teaching possible. Funding combined with quality faculty has resulted in a paradigm shift. An article inspired by Dean Addie Fuhriman and researched and written by M. Sue Bergin in the most recent<i>Brigham Young Magazine</i>describes the change as one from "teaching against research" to "teaching via research" (M. Sue Bergin, "Teaching via Research,"<i>Brigham Young Magazine</i>51, no. 3 [fall 1997], pp. 23–24). The author points out that hundreds of BYU faculty involve both graduate and undergraduate students in their research projects. The result is a "synergy that benefits both professor and student" (Bergin, "Teaching via Research," p. 24).<br><br>If Brigham Young University is to be a Zion university, as described by Presidents John Taylor and Spencer W. Kimball, the search for truth must be an integral part of the BYU experience. President Taylor said: "You will see the day that Zion will be as far ahead of the outside world in everything pertaining to learning of every kind as we are to-day in regard to religious matters" (John Taylor,<i>JD</i>21:100 [13 April 1879]).<br><br>President Kimball spoke extensively on this subject on a number of occasions. Typical is the following:<br><br><i>This university shares with other universities the hope and the labor involved in rolling back the frontiers of knowledge, but we also know that, through divine revelation, there are yet "many great and important things"</i>[Articles of Faith 1:9]<i>to be given to mankind which will have an intellectual and spiritual impact far beyond what mere men can imagine. Thus, at this university among faculty, students, and administration, there is, and there must be, an excitement and an expectation about the very nature and future of knowledge. That underlies the uniqueness of BYU.</i>[Spencer W. Kimball, "Installation of and Charge to the President,"<i>Inaugural Addresses,</i>Brigham Young University, 14 November 1980, p. 9]<br><br>These prophecies will be realized only as BYU faculty and staff are filled with light and truth. The filling process requires diligent mental exertion in both secular and spiritual dimensions, which then must be combined with obedience to secular and spiritual laws. These actions will guarantee access to the Spirit, which will accelerate the discovery process.<br><br>It is obvious from the above statements thata Zion university is not a copy of other institutions. The paradigm is faithful scholars involved in extending the frontiers of knowledge while engaging their students in the discovery process. In the words of President Kimball: "This university is not of the world any more than the Church is of the world, and it must not be made over in the image of the world" (Spencer W. Kimball, "Second Century Address and Dedication of Carillon Tower and Bells," Brigham Young University, 10 October 1975, p. 3).<br><br>Each member of the faculty, staff, and administration must be filled with truth. We must be not only the best scholars, the best staff and administrators, but also the best people we can be. This is crucial in light of the unique institution of which we are a part and its connection with the Church.<br><h2><b>Academic Freedom and the Search for Truth</b></h2><br>In the search for truth, the university has a responsibility to provide an environment in which the discovery of truth is fostered. Two environmental conditions are essential for the discovery process to be as fruitful as possible. The first is freedom of belief or freedom of thought. If anyone understands the importance of the right to pursue one's own beliefs, it is the LDS people. The sesquicentennial year is an important reminder. As stated in the Statement on Academic Freedom (SAF) at Brigham Young University:<br><br><i>Individual freedom lies at the core of both religious and academic life. Freedom of thought, belief, inquiry, and expression are crucial no less to the sacred than to the secular quest for truth. Historically, in fact, freedom of conscience and freedom of intellect form a common root, from which grow both religious and academic freedom.</i>[Statement on Academic Freedom at Brigham Young University (SAF), BYU 1997–98 Undergraduate Catalog, p. xvii]<br><br>The right to ask difficult questions, to rigorously analyze results, and to report one's work are vital to the discovery and dissemination process. We believe that faculty members should be able to research and teach in their disciplines without interference as long as a second environmental condition is allowed to operate. Before proceeding to that condition, it should be noted that individual academic freedom is "broad" and "presumptive," whereas any limitations coming from the second condition are "exceptional and limited" (SAF, p. xix).<br><br>The second environmental condition concerns the right of an academic institution to pursue its defined mission and to be free from outside control. Every university (public, private, religious, or nonreligious) places limitations on individual freedom in order to create an environment that fosters the discovery and dissemination of truth within the context of its institutional mission (see "Editor's Preface," George S. Worgul, Jr.,<i>Issues in Academic Freedom</i>[Pittsburgh: Duquesne University Press, 1992], pp. viii–ix). Public universities, for example, prohibit faculty members from advocating religious beliefs in class in order to preserve a separation between church and state. Most universities limit faculty members in denigrating individuals or groups based on race, gender, religion, or nationality. Some universities establish obscenity standards that prohibit the use of certain language, films, and written materials in the classroom.<br><br>From the beginning Brigham Young University has been open in declaring its mission and expectations while at the same time protecting the freedom of the individual as much as possible. The statement made by Brigham Young to Karl G. Maeser regarding the responsibility to teach by the Spirit encompasses the two expectations enunciated in the university's Statement on Academic Freedom. The first expectation is that all LDS members of the university community should "live lives of loyalty to the restored gospel" (Faculty Rank and Status: Professorial Policy, Policy and Procedures Section, University Electronic Handbook [rev. 1 September 1994], sec. 3.1.1). For LDS members of the faculty, staff, and administration, this expectation has been defined as accepting "as a condition of employment the standards of conduct consistent with qualifying for temple privileges" (Administrative/Staff Employment Policy, University Electronic Handbook [rev. 4 August 1997]; see also Faculty Rank and Status: Professorial Policy, sec. 3.1.1). For people of other faiths, the standard is the Honor Code coupled with a willingness to "respect the LDS nature of the university and its mission, while the university in turn respects their religious convictions" (SAF, p. xviii).<br><br>The second expectation is a clarification of the first. It asks community members not to engage in "behavior or expression [that]<i>seriously and adversely affects</i>the university mission or the Church" (SAF, p. xix; emphasis in original). Examples include public behavior or expression that "contradicts or opposes, rather than analyzes or discusses, fundamental Church doctrine or policy" or that "deliberately attacks or derides the Church or its general leaders" (SAF, p. xix). In addition, BYU's Statement on Academic Freedom contains an important safeguard. It states: "A faculty member shall not be found in violation of the academic freedom standards unless the faculty member can fairly be considered aware that the expression violates the standards" (SAF, p. xix).<br><br>Why are these expectations important to the university's mission? Do they relate to the discovery and dissemination of truth? When one understands our faith, one realizes that the university's expectations are, in fact, encased in the enabling principle of obedience. Obedience to sacred laws is necessary for access to the Spirit. Our faith teaches and our experience confirms that the Holy Spirit is an important aid in the discovery and dissemination of truth--sacred or secular. The university's mission could not be accomplished and community members would be handicapped in the search for truth if the condition of faithfulness was eliminated. This condition supports more than the establishment of a congenial community of believers engaged in higher education. For us, the condition is fundamental to the educational process.<br><br>Some have stated that the principle of obedience is inconsistent with the principle of agency. Elder Neal A. Maxwell has commented on this point as follows:<br><br><i>We are in a universe of physical and spiritual laws; it is these which demand obedience. It is actually enlightened obedience to follow freely those laws which produce the desired result. . . . That course is hardly blind obedience. . . .</i><br><br><i>Freedom does not always multiply options. A scientist wishing to create water must use two parts hydrogen and one part oxygen. "There is a law. . . ."</i><br><br><i>Freedom does not free us from law.</i>[Neal A. Maxwell,<i>Deposition of a Disciple</i>(Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Company, 1976), p. 96–97]<br><br>As declared in BYU's Statement on Academic Freedom, the university mission is to<br><br><i>nourish a community of believing scholars, where students and teachers, guided by the gospel, freely join together to seek truth in charity and virtue. For those who embrace the gospel, BYU offers a far richer and more complete kind of academic freedom than is possible in secular universities because to seek knowledge in the light of revealed truth is, for believers, to be free indeed.</i>[SAF, p. xx]<br><h2><b>Recent Challenges to BYU's Statement on Academic Freedom</b></h2><br>As all are aware, the university's Statement on Academic Freedom, its application, and our role as a religious institution have been challenged during the past year by the national organization of the American Association of University Professors (AAUP). The national AAUP was asked by its local chapter to investigate last year's denial of continuing status to Professor Gail Turley Houston of the English Department. Currently the university and the AAUP have an understanding not to release the organization's report or the university's response until both are published in the September/October issue of<i>Academe,</i>the organization's magazine.<br><br>Today, in keeping with that understanding, I will not disclose the report's contents or our response, even though a draft report has been released in violation of the understanding. Moreover, the recipient used the report as the basis for a Sunstone presentation earlier this month. A summary of his comments appeared in newspapers both locally and across the nation. Although I will not reveal the report's contents, as all of the material will be available at the appropriate time, there are some aspects of the Associated Press story that should be discussed because they illustrate the kinds of misstatements that are being made about the university.<br><br>You may remember that the Associated Press article begins with a story about my attempts to recruit a potential faculty member. The first few paragraphs indicate that I "pulled out all the stops" to recruit Professor David Babbel of the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. It describes his expertise and says that he was an LDS bishop--"just the sort of exemplar Bateman wanted." It then states that a meeting was arranged between Mr. Babbel and myself in New York to discuss a faculty position and that "Babbel assured Bateman he would give the offer serious consideration." The article then suggests that Babbel eventually turned down the offer for two reasons--the university's temple eligibility requirement and BYU's troubling "record on issues of academic freedom." Mr. Vern Anderson, the AP reporter, uses this story as a lead-in to Bryan Waterman's discussion of the AAUP's draft report to support an argument that the university is experiencing difficulty in recruiting faculty (see Vern Anderson, "BYU May Face Censure by Professors' Group,"<i>Deseret News,</i>10 August 1997, p. B5). In fact, nothing could be further from the truth. In general, the faculty pool is the deepest it has ever been in the history of the university.<br><br>The story appeared on the weekend of August 9–10. On August 11 Mr. Babbel was shown a copy of the AP article. He faxed me a letter. With his permission, I share the relevant portions:<br><br><i>Dear President Bateman,</i><br><br><i>It was with horror that I read an AP article by Vern Anderson on BYU's academic freedom. I have never been contacted by him, nor by Bryan Waterman, nor had I ever heard of either of them prior to reading the article.</i><br><br><i>It is deplorable to be co-opted into somebody's "grandstanding" campaign. In my view, "grandstanding" is an aberrant and disrespectful forum for discussing viewpoints. As I read the article and saw the numerous errors throughout, it gave me a better appreciation of how people in your situation must feel, from time to time, as you are subjected to an unremitting barrage of screaming accusations. It is little wonder that some of the Brethren are loathe to discuss anything with the press, or with people who may go to the press.</i><br><br>Mr. Babbel then states the following in a footnote:<br><br><i>Some of the errors in the Anderson article include:</i><br><br><i>(1) There was never an "arranged" meeting in New York--it was a happenstance meeting, and I had already been in discussions of an informal nature with the Marriott School for two years about opportunities there.</i><br><br><i>(2) You never "pulled out all the stops" to recruit me--indeed, had you done so, I would already be there.</i><br><br><i>(3) I was never offered a position at BYU--only an opportunity to apply for one.</i><br><br>Mr. Babbel then questions what might be done to correct the errors and expresses his desire to meet with me. The letter is signed "David F. Babbel."<br><br>I met with David Babbel last week, and additional exchanges will follow. As Professor Babbel noted, he was never asked by Mr.Anderson or Mr. Waterman as to the truthfulness of the story--nor did they ask me.<br><br>Mr. Anderson's story is typical of other press articles dealing with BYU personnel issues that have appeared in recent years. The university does not conduct its business in the press; consequently, articles dealing with personnel issues are biased in favor of those who do seek out reporters and use the press. Occasionally we will comment on a report if it does not require us to reveal confidential information or if the individual in question has released the pertinent data. Most of the time, however, little or no information is provided by the university, and the amount of truth published is one-half or less. The stories generally are embellished well beyond the facts and are used to distort university policies and actions.<br><br>This is well illustrated by the Babbel story. Babbel and I met by happenstance in New York at a BYU alumni event. We conversed for three or four minutes. I did not know at the time that he was in conversation with the Marriott School about a position. I did not discuss a job offer with him. Nor did he assure me that he would give serious consideration to a faculty position.<br><br>Part of the reason for misstatements made about BYU is that many people are opposed to BYU's mission and have an agenda to undermine it. Professor Douglas Laycock, the Alice McKean Young Regents Chair in Law and associate dean for research at the University ofTexas Law School, has commented on the absolutist position of the secularists in higher education as follows:<br><br><i>The secular side controls 97% or so of the institutions. Can the three percent have some existence of their own? Can the three percent strike their own balance of religious and academic commitments? Or is the secular model so absolutist that it cannot tolerate a three percent minority with a different solution? That is the issue.</i>[Douglas Laycock, "The Rights of Religious Academic Communities,"<i>Journal of College and University Law</i>20, no. 1 (summer 1993), p. 26]<br><br>Professor Laycock has carefully analyzed BYU's Statement on Academic Freedom in light of AAUP guidelines and has made the following statement:<br><br><i>Ironically, by purporting to expel from the academic community any school that invokes the limitations clause, or to deprive schools of any benefit even when they invoke it, the AAUP ensures that few academically serious universities will ever disclose potential limits on academic freedom. The most notable exception is Brigham Young, which has recently completed a courageous effort to state as carefully as possible the limitations on academic freedom necessary to its mission.</i>[Laycock, "The Rights," p. 29]<br><br>Laycock further states: "The Brigham Young Statement is probably as full a disclosure as can reasonably be achieved" ("The Rights," p. 32).<br><br>Although it is important that outside scholars consider the Brigham Young University Statement on Academic Freedom to be fair and evenhanded, it is far more important that our university community understand that our statement, which was generated by a faculty committee drawn from disciplines across campus, is a fair, open, and clear expression of university values. The genius of our statement is that it gives faculty members clear notice of conduct or expression that may be considered to be in violation of the statement.<br><br><i>A faculty member shall not be found in violation of the academic freedom standards unless the faculty member can</i>fairly<i>be considered aware that the expression violates the standards.</i>[SAF, p. xix; emphasis added]<br><br>Any criticism that charges the university with creating an unclear standard quite simply misses the mark. The university mission and the expectations necessary to preserve and further that mission are clear.<br><h2><b>Summary</b></h2><br>Brothers and sisters, Brigham Young University is a wonderful place filled with extraordinary people acquiring light and truth. The mission of the university was defined 120 years ago by a prophet of God. There has been no deviation since, nor will there be. We must be diligent in our efforts to safeguard individual academic freedom while fostering the university's unique purpose. Faithful faculty and staff understand that all truth is spiritual. They know by experience that the search for sacred and secular truth is enhanced by a spiritual environment that provides additional light. Ultimately there is no dichotomy. Truth is truth! The search for truth at Brigham Young University will prosper over time because of the way the community lives and the peace that prevails.<br><br>Also, the discovery process will become an even more integral part of the instruction that is offered as original scholarship increasingly informs outstanding teachers. If the common bond of the gospel stretches across the campus and includes every discipline--and if we are diligent in obeying both sacred and secular laws--we will have the respect of the One who counts. In the end, scholars and prophets will measure us by what we produce.<br><br>May the Lord bless each of us as we begin a new year, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Merrill J.

<h1>us Repeated: Pioneers - Russell M. Nelson - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
This large congregation at the Marriott Center at Brigham Young University is but a fraction of the total audience assembled in centers throughout the world tonight. I wish that I could greet each one of you, and I am very sorry that is not possible. I am also thankful that Sister Nelson and several members of our family can be here. Their steadfast support means much to me.<br><br>I bring love and greetings from the First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. We appreciate the great faith and devotion of the young adults of the Church. We hope that you students will enjoy your studies and excel in your chosen fields wherever you live. We hope that you who are single may meet and marry someone who can help you achieve your full potential. And for you who are already married, we hope that you will continually cherish your precious partner. Each person in this vast congregation may be privileged to bear great responsibilities in the Church in the exciting years ahead. We commend you, we thank you, and we pray for you.<br><br>The title for my message tonight is "The Exodus Repeated." I have chosen this topic because of the many instructive parallels that exist between the exodus from Egypt of the Israelites under Moses and the exodus from the United States of the Latter-day Saint pioneers under Brigham Young. In this year of celebration honoring those early converts to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, we sense our deep debt of gratitude to them. But I also chose this topic because we can learn much from these stalwarts of ancient and modern Israel.<br><br>Generally, the sesquicentennial sketches and pageants have portrayed well<i>what</i>the pioneers did. But only a few writers have delved deeply enough to explain<i>why.</i>Even fewer have reported the similarities between the pioneer trek and the exodus from Egypt. That exodus was a type, and shadow, for the exodus of the pioneers.<br><br>An obvious likeness is that both groups had their inland sea of salt water and a Jordan River. But there were many other very significant similarities. Ancient Israel and modern Israel are linked arm in arm.<br><h2><b>The Josephs</b></h2><br>Ancient Israel had leaders before Moses, and modern Israel had a prophet-president before Brigham Young. The predecessors for each group also bore a resemblance to each other. A name common to both was Joseph--Joseph who was sold into Egypt and the Prophet Joseph Smith.<br><br>Few men in the Old Testament are of greater importance to Latter-day Saints than is Joseph of Egypt. Many of us claim lineage from Joseph through his sons Ephraim or Manasseh. The Book of Mormon reveals:<br><br><i>A part of the remnant of the coat of Joseph was preserved and had not decayed. . . . Even as this remnant of garment . . . hath been preserved, so shall a remnant of the seed . . . be preserved by the hand of God, and be taken unto himself.</i>[Alma 46:24]<br><br>The pioneers were remnants of that precious seed. They knew that Joseph Smith had been chosen by the Lord to take up the labors of the tribe of Joseph, son of Jacob. Centuries earlier, Joseph had prophesied of Joseph Smith and had described their kinship:<br><br><i>Yea, Joseph truly said: Thus saith the Lord unto me: A choice seer will I raise up out of the fruit of thy loins; and he shall be esteemed highly among the fruit of thy loins. And unto him will I give commandment that he shall do a work for the fruit of thy loins, his brethren, which shall be of great worth unto them, even to the bringing of them to the knowledge of the covenants which I have made with thy fathers.</i><br><br><i>And I will give unto him a commandment that he shall do none other work, save the work which I shall command him. And I will make him great in mine eyes; for he shall do my work.</i>[2 Nephi 3:7–8]<br><br>The name of<i>Joseph</i>applied not only to Joseph Smith, Jr., but to his father as well. Again I quote from Joseph, who was sold into Egypt:<br><br><i>Behold, that seer</i>[Joseph Smith]<i>will the Lord bless; . . . for this promise, which I have obtained of the Lord, of the fruit of my loins, shall be fulfilled. . . .</i><br><br><i>And his name shall be called after me; and it shall be after the name of his father. And he shall be like unto me; for the thing, which the Lord shall bring forth by his hand, by the power of the Lord shall bring my people unto salvation.</i>[2 Nephi 3:14–15; see also JST, Genesis 50:26–38]<br><br>Jacob's son Joseph and Joseph Smith had even more in common. At age 17, Joseph was informed of his great destiny (see Genesis 37:2–11). At the same age Joseph Smith was informed of his destiny regarding the Book of Mormon. At age 17 he was first visited by the angel Moroni, who informed the boy prophet that "God had a work for [him] to do." He was to translate a book written upon golden plates containing the fullness of the everlasting gospel. His "name should be had for good and evil among all nations, kindreds, and tongues" (Joseph Smith--History 1:33; see also vv. 34–41).<br><br>Both Josephs endured persecution. Joseph of old was falsely accused of a crime he did not commit and was put into prison (see Genesis 39:11–20). Joseph Smith suffered incarceration on trumped-up charges and false accusations.<br><br>Joseph's coat of many colors was taken from him by his brothers in a cruel attempt to convince their father that Joseph had been killed (see Genesis 37:2–33). Joseph Smith's life was cruelly taken from him, largely because of betrayals by false brethren.<br><br>Anciently, when "all the land of Egypt was famished, the people cried to Pharaoh for bread: and Pharaoh said unto all the Egyptians, Go unto Joseph; what he saith to you, do" (Genesis 41:55). In the latter days, people starving for nourishment that only the gospel can provide are again to be fed--by Joseph. The Lord declared that "this generation shall have my word through [Joseph Smith]" (D&amp;amp;C 5:10). Today we may "feast upon the words of Christ" (2 Nephi 32:3) because of Joseph Smith.<br><h2><b>Moses and Brigham Young</b></h2><br>Moses and Brigham Young had much in common. They were astute followers before they became great leaders. Moses had been prepared in the courts of Egypt and had gained much experience in military and other responsibilities (see Flavius Josephus,<i>Antiquities of the Jews</i>2:10; see also Acts 7:22, Hebrews 11:24–27). Brigham Young was likewise prepared for his leadership role. In the march of Zion's Camp, he had observed the leadership of the Prophet Joseph Smith under difficult conditions (see<i>HC</i>2:61–134, 183–85). Brigham Young aided in the removal of the Prophet Joseph from Kirtland (see<i>HC</i>3:1–2; see also<i>Manuscript History of Brigham Young: 1801–1844,</i>ed. Elden J. Watson (Salt Lake City: Smith Secretarial Service, 1968), pp. 23–24). He also directed the move of the persecuted Saints from Missouri to Nauvoo (see<i>HC</i>3:250–52, 261; see also John K. Carmack, "Missouri Era: Residue of Wisdom,"<i>Regional Studies in Latter-day Saint Church History, Missouri,</i>eds. Arnold K. Garr and Clark V. Johnson [Provo: Department of Church History and Doctrine, Brigham Young University, 1994], pp. 2–3).<br><br>For both the Israelites and the Saints, civil and ecclesiastical law were unified under one head. Moses bore that responsibility for his people (see<i>Teachings,</i>p. 252). Brigham Young--the modern Moses (see D&amp;amp;C 103:16)<sup>1</sup>--led the Latter-day Saints' movement west, with the Lord's blessing (see D&amp;amp;C 136). Moses and Brigham Young followed parallel patterns of governance (see Exodus 18:17–21, D&amp;amp;C 136:1–3). Brigham Young organized the large group of men, women, and children for an orderly migration to the west.<br><br>We lament that leaders of both groups had to endure dissension from their close associates. On occasion Moses encountered opposition from his beloved Aaron and Miriam (see Numbers 12:1–11). Latter-day leaders also suffered contention among their trusted associates (see<i>HC</i>1:104–5, 226). Nevertheless, the same unified pattern of government will come again when the Lord shall be "King over all the earth" (Psalm 47:2; see also Zechariah 14:9) and govern from Zion and Jerusalem (see Isaiah 2:1–4).<br><br>The journey from Egypt to Mount Sinai took about three months (see Exodus 19:1). The journey from Winter Quarters to the valley of the Great Salt Lake also took about three months (111 days).<br><br>The destination for each group was described by the Lord as a land flowing with milk and honey.<sup>2</sup>The pioneers turned their wilderness into a fruitful field and made the desert blossom as a rose--precisely as prophesied by Isaiah centuries before (see Isaiah 32:15–16, 35:1).<br><h2><b>Miracles Shared</b></h2><br>Both groups shared many miracles that are memorialized annually. The celebration of Passover relates to the travels of the ancient Israelites. And each July we repeat legendary stories of our pioneers. Both groups traversed deserts, mountains, and valleys of untamed wilderness. Ancient Israelites left Egypt via the parted waters of the Red Sea "as by dry land" (Hebrews 11:29). The pioneers left the United States crossing the wide waters of the Mississippi river--frozen to become a highway of ice (see Orson Pratt,<i>JD</i>21:275–77).<br><br>The book of Exodus reports that quail were miraculously provided to feed the hungry people of ancient Israel (see Exodus 16:13, Numbers 11:32, Psalm 105:40). The pioneers had an equivalent experience. After the last of them had been driven out of Nauvoo, many were sick and some had died. Their provisions were meager. On the riverbank above Montrose, Iowa, 9 October 1846, many quail miraculously flew into camp. The quail were cooked and fed to some 640 destitute people (see Stanley B. Kimball, "Nauvoo West: The Mormons of the Iowa Shore,"<i>Brigham Young University Studies</i>18, no. 2 [winter 1978:142).<sup>3</sup>It was also miraculous that a permanent settlement survived in the valley of the Great Salt Lake. Seagulls that saved the crops were part of that miracle.<br><br>God preserved ancient Israel from plagues sent upon Egypt (see Exodus 15:26). Similarly, God preserved the Saints from the plague of the United States Civil War, which caused more American deaths due to war than any other war.<br><h2><b>Spiritual Strengths Shared</b></h2><br>For both the Israelites and the Saints, their travail forged great spiritual strength. They both endured trials of their faith, during which the weak were winnowed away and the strong were empowered to endure to the end (see Ether 12:6; D&amp;amp;C 101:4–5, 105:19). They had to leave their homes and earthly possessions and learn to rely wholly upon God. Protection was provided for ancient Israel by the Lord, who "went before them by day in a pillar of a cloud, to lead them the way; and by night in a pillar of fire" (Exodus 13:21; see also v. 22, Numbers 14:14, Deuteronomy 1:33, Nehemiah 9:19). The same has been said of divine watchcare afforded to the pioneers (see<i>HC</i>3:xxxiv; also Thomas S. Monson,<i>CR,</i>April 1967, p. 56).<br><br>Scriptures given to both societies speak of the strength of the Lord's hand in their deliverance. To those of ancient Israel, Moses said, "Remember this day, in which ye came out from Egypt, out of the house of bondage; for by strength of hand the Lord brought you out from this place" (Exodus 13:3).<br><br>To the Latter-day Saints, a comparable scripture was revealed: "For I, the Lord, have put forth my hand to exert the powers of heaven; ye cannot see it now, yet a little while and ye shall see it, and know that I am" (D&amp;amp;C 84:119).<br><br>The children of Israel had a portable tabernacle wherein covenants were made and ordinances were performed to strengthen them on their journey.<sup>4</sup>Many Latter-day Saints were endowed in the Nauvoo Temple before their arduous trek westward.<br><br>Gratefully, the Israelites celebrated their exodus from Egypt. The Latter-day Saints commemorated their exodus with the establishment of the world headquarters of the restored Church in the tops of the mountains. All celebrants acclaimed their deliverance by God (see Jeremiah 23:7–8).<br><h2><b>Timeless Gospel Principles</b></h2><br>Scriptures available to ancient and modern Israel include timeless principles of the gospel. You are familiar with the prophecy of Isaiah:<br><br><i>Thou shalt be brought down, and shalt speak out of the ground, and thy speech shall be low out of the dust, and thy voice shall be, as of one that hath a familiar spirit, out of the ground, and thy speech shall whisper out of the dust.</i>[Isaiah 29:4]<br><br>Could any words have been more descriptive of the Book of Mormon, coming as it did "out of the ground" to "whisper out of the dust" to people of our day?<br><br>Other Old Testament passages foretold the Book of Mormon. One such came to mind last January when I attended a prayer breakfast at the White House, in Washington, D.C., hosted by President Bill Clinton. During an informal reception that preceded the breakfast, I was chatting with a distinguished and scholarly Jewish rabbi from New York. Our conversation was interrupted by another rabbi, who asked his colleague from New York if he could recall the scriptural reference to the stick of Judah and the stick of Joseph that would come together one day. My friend paused for a moment, stroked his chin pensively, and then replied, "I think you will find that in the book of Ezekiel."<br><br>With that, I could not restrain myself. "You might look in chapter 37 of Ezekiel," I interjected. "There you will find the scriptures that you seek."<br><br>My rabbi friend expressed surprise: "How did<i>you</i>know that?"<br><br>"This doctrine," I concluded, "is very important in our theology."<br><br>Indeed it is. You know it, and I know it. I would like to read it:<br><br><i>Moreover, thou son of man, take thee one stick, and write upon it, For Judah, and for the children of Israel his companions: then take another stick, and write upon it, For Joseph, the stick of Ephraim, and for all the house of Israel his companions:</i><br><br><i>And join them one to another into one stick; and they shall become one in thine hand.</i>[Ezekiel 37:16–17]<br><br>Saints of modern Israel in 160 nations across the world are blessed to hold the Bible and the Book of Mormon as one in their hands. The worth of this privilege must never be underestimated.<br><br>Isaiah described the spirit of the Book of Mormon as "familiar." It resonates with people who know the Old Testament, especially those who are conversant with its Hebrew language. The Book of Mormon is rich with Hebraisms--traditions, symbolisms, idioms, and literary forms. It is familiar because more than 80 percent of its pages came from Old Testament times.<br><br>Timeless truths and principles of the gospel were and are important to people of ancient and modern Israel. The Sabbath day, for example, was honored for different reasons through the generations. From the time of Adam to Moses, the Sabbath was observed as a day of rest from the labor of creation (see Exodus 20:8–11, 31:16–17). From the time of Moses to the Resurrection of the Lord, the Sabbath also commemorated the liberation of the Israelites from their bondage in Egypt (see Deuteronomy 5:12–15; Isaiah 58:13; Ezekiel 20:20, 44:24; Mosiah 13:19). In latter days, Saints keep the Sabbath day holy in memory of the Atonement of Jesus Christ (see Acts 20:7, 1 Corinthians 16:2, Revelation 1:10, D&amp;amp;C 59:9–19).<br><br>The restoration of the priesthood rejuvenated the principle of tithing, linking to the Old Testament teachings of Genesis and Malachi (see Genesis 14:20, Malachi 3:8–12). Saints of modern Israel know how to calculate their own tithing from this simple instruction: "Those who have thus been tithed shall pay one-tenth of all their interest annually; and this shall be a standing law unto them forever, for my holy priesthood, saith the Lord" (D&amp;amp;C 119:4).<br><br>In contrast, have you ever amused yourself with the thought, on or about April 15 each year, that the filing of income tax returns is a bit more complicated? I'll confess that I have.<br><br>Turning our attention again to the timeless truths of the gospel, none are more vital than those associated with temple worship. They are another connection between ancient and modern Israel.<br><br><i>Whenever the Lord has had a people on the earth who will obey his word, they have been commanded to build temples in which the ordinances of the gospel and other spiritual manifestations that pertain to exaltation and eternal life may be administered.</i>[Bible Dictionary, s.v. "temple"]<br><br>The best-known temple of ancient Israel was Solomon's temple. Its baptismal font and dedicatory prayer provided patterns that are employed for temples today (see 2 Chronicles 4:15, 6:12–42; D&amp;amp;C 109). Old Testament scriptures refer to special clothing (see Exodus 28:4, 29:5; Leviticus 8:7; 1 Samuel 18:4) and ordinances (see Exodus 19:10, 14; 2 Samuel 12:20; Ezekiel 16:9) associated with temples (see D&amp;amp;C 124:37–40). How thankful we are that the Lord chose to restore the highest blessings of the priesthood to his faithful sons and daughters. He said: "For I deign to reveal unto my church things which have been kept hid from before the foundation of the world, things that pertain to the dispensation of the fulness of times" (D&amp;amp;C 124:41).<br><br>Revealed truth that we know as the Word of Wisdom came to the Prophet Joseph Smith in 1833. Every Latter-day Saint is familiar with it as one of the enduring hallmarks of our faith. The final verse of that revelation forges another link back to ancient Israel: "And I, the Lord, give unto them a promise, that the destroying angel shall pass by them, as the children of Israel, and not slay them" (D&amp;amp;C 89:21).<br><br>This reference to the Passover shows that the Lord wanted obedient Saints of modern Israel to receive physical and spiritual protection just as he had provided for his faithful followers centuries before.<br><h2><b>The Covenant, the Scattering, and the Gathering</b></h2><br>Other divine teachings revered by both societies include doctrines of the Abrahamic covenant and of the scattering and gathering of Israel. About four thousand years ago, Abraham received a promise from the Lord that blessings would be offered to all of his mortal posterity (see D&amp;amp;C 132:29–50, Abraham 2:6–11). Included were promises that the Son of God would come through Abraham's lineage, that certain lands would be inherited by his posterity, that nations and kindreds of the earth would be blessed through his seed, and more. Affirmation and reaffirmations of this covenant are evident in many scriptures of the Old Testament (see Genesis 26:1–4, 24, 28; 35:9–13; 48:3–4).<br><br>Although certain aspects of that covenant have already been fulfilled, many have not. The Book of Mormon teaches that we of modern Israel are among the covenant people of the Lord (see 1 Nephi 14:14, 15:14; 2 Nephi 30:2; Mosiah 24:13; 3 Nephi 29:3; Mormon 8:15). And, most remarkably, it teaches that the Abrahamic covenant will be fulfilled only in the latter days! (See 1 Nephi 15:12–18.) The Lord once again bestowed the Abrahamic covenant, this time upon the Prophet Joseph Smith, to be a blessing upon him and posterity after him (see D&amp;amp;C 124:56–59).<br><br>Did you know that Abraham is mentioned in more verses of modern revelation than in all verses of the Old Testament?<sup>5</sup>Abraham--this great patriarch of the Old Testament--is inextricably linked to all who join The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.<sup>6</sup><br><br>Doctrines relating to the scattering and gathering of the house of Israel were also among the earliest lessons taught in the Book of Mormon. I quote from 1 Nephi:<br><br><i>After the house of Israel should be scattered they should be gathered together again; . . . the natural branches of the olive-tree, or the remnants of the house of Israel, should be grafted in, or come to the knowledge of the true Messiah, their Lord and their Redeemer.</i>[1 Nephi 10:14]<br><br>Saints of modern Israel know that Peter, James, and John were sent by the Lord with "the keys of [his] kingdom, and a dispensation of the gospel for the last times; and for the fulness of times," in which he would "gather together in one all things, both which are in heaven, and which are on earth" (D&amp;amp;C 27:13; cf. Ephesians 1:10).<br><br>The travels and travails of our pioneers were of eternal consequence. Their mission was not limited to an international immigration or a transcontinental migration with wagons and handcarts. They were to lay the foundation of an endless work that would "fill the world" (Joseph Smith, quoted in<i>The Discourses of Wilford Woodruff,</i>sel. G. Homer Durham [Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1946], p. 39). They were essential to Jeremiah's prophecy: "Hear the word of the Lord, O ye nations, and declare it in the isles afar off, and say, He that scattered Israel will gather him, and keep him, as a shepherd doth his flock" (Jeremiah 31:10).<sup>7</sup><br><br>They got the message. Missionaries were sent very early to "the isles afar off" to commence the work of the Lord. As a result, the Church was established in the British Isles and in the islands of French Polynesia years before the pioneers entered the valley of the Great Salt Lake. It has been my privilege to participate in sesquicentennial celebrations in the British Isles in 1987 and in French Polynesia in 1994. Now we celebrate this one in 1997.<br><br>The lineage of Joseph--through Ephraim and Manasseh--is the seed appointed to lead in the gathering of Israel (see Erastus Snow,<i>JD</i>23:183–84). The pioneers knew--through their patriarchal blessings and from the Old Testament, amplified by scriptures and revelations of the Restoration--that the long-awaited gathering of Israel was to commence with them. This "ball" was in their court!<br><h2><b>Summary</b></h2><br>Early converts to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints were pioneers of modern Israel. Regardless of the time or place in which Saints may live, all faithful members of the Church will receive their just reward. "All things are theirs, whether life or death, or things present, or things to come, all are theirs and they are Christ's, and Christ is God's" (D&amp;amp;C 76:59).<br><br>Ancient and modern Israel subscribe to an ageless message of the Old Testament: "Know therefore that the Lord thy God . . . keepeth covenant and mercy with them that love him and keep his commandments to a thousand generations" (Deuteronomy 7:9).<sup>8</sup><br><br>Upon our shoulders lies the responsibility to keep the faith through our own generation. This "ball" is in our court! We of modern Israel are destined to be "a kingdom of priests, and an holy nation" (Exodus 19:6). We know that we are children of the covenant (see Acts 3:25, 3 Nephi 20:25–26). We are remnants of the seed now to be gathered and gleaned into God's eternal garners (see Alma 26:5).<br><br>You young adults are literally the hope of modern Israel. You are part of Zion's army. You are children of the promised day. I am grateful to be associated with you in the work of the Lord.<br><br>As Saints of modern Israel, we speak with one voice. We love our Heavenly Father. We love the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Living God. We are his people. We have taken his holy name upon us. We know the Book of Mormon to be the word of God and hold it as one with the Holy Bible. We proclaim Joseph Smith as the great prophet of the Restoration. And we sustain President Gordon B. Hinckley as God's gifted prophet of today.<br><br>I leave with each of you my testimony, my love, and my blessing, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Russell M. Nelson was a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when this fireside address was given at Brigham Young University on 7 September 1997.</i><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>1. Concerning Brigham Young's role in that exodus, President Spencer W. Kimball wrote:<br><br><i>Since Adam there have been many exoduses and promised lands: Abraham, Jared, Moses, Lehi, and others led groups. How easy it is to accept those distant in time as directed by the Lord, yet the ones near at hand as human calculations and decisions. Let us consider for a moment the great trek of the Mormon refugees from Illinois to Salt Lake Valley. Few, if any, great movements equal it. We frequently hear that Brigham Young led the people to make new tracks in a desert and to climb over mountains seldom scaled and to ford and wade unbridged rivers and to traverse a hostile Indian country; and while Brigham Young was the instrument of the Lord, it was not he but the Lord of heaven who led modern Israel across the plains to their promised land.</i>[Spencer W. Kimball,<i>Faith Precedes the Miracle</i>(Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Company, 1972), p. 28]<br><br>2. For the ancient Israelites, see Exodus 3:8, 17; 13:5; 33:3; Leviticus 20:24; Numbers 13:27, 14:8, 16:13–14; Deuteronomy 6:3; 11:9; 26:9, 15; 27:3; 31:20; Joshua 5:6; Jeremiah 11:5, 32:22; Ezekiel 20:6, 15; JST, Exodus 33:1. For the pioneers, see Doctrine and Covenants 38:18–19.<br><br>3.<i>Catching Quails,</i>an oil painting on canvas by C. C. A. Christensen, is in the Museum of Art at Brigham Young University.<br><br>4. Ordinances and covenants of ancient Israel are cited in 1 Corinthians 10:1–3; for those of modern Israel, see Doctrine and Covenants 84:26–27. The tabernacle of ancient Israel had been intended to be a movable temple before the people lost the higher law (see D&amp;amp;C 84:25, 124:38).<br><br>5. Abraham is mentioned in 506 verses of scripture, 289 of which are in modern revelation.<br><br>6. The covenant may also be received by adoption (see Matthew 3:9; Luke 3:8; Galatians 3:27–29, 4:5–7).<br><br>7. The word<i>gather</i>comes from the Hebrew verb<i>qabats,</i>which means "to gather, assemble."<br><br>8. See also Deuteronomy 11:1, 27; 19:9; 30:16; Joshua 22:5; 1 John 5:2–3; Mosiah 2:4. Other Old Testament scriptures refer to rewards for those obedient to God's commandments through a "thousand generations" (see 1 Chronicles 16:15; Psalm 105:8).<br><br><i>© Intellectual Reserve, Inc.

<h1>ifts: &quot;To Thine Own Self Be True&quot; - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
This is an inspiring sight--even a thrill--to look over this vast congregation. President Bateman and I welcome all of you to the 1997 fall semester at Brigham Young University. We hope all of you are happy to be here. We also hope that you appreciate the privilege it is to be at BYU. We are confident that each of you has determined in your mind and heart to live a life consistent with the honor code to which you have signed your name. Your honor and integrity are at stake.<br><br>Abraham Lincoln said, "Let us have faith that right makes might, and in that faith let us to the end dare to do our duty as we understand it" (address at Cooper Union, New York, 27 February 1860). There should be no question in anyone's mind regarding their responsibilities and duties at the university. May God help each of us as his covenant people to "arise and shine forth" and "be a standard for the nations" and a light to the world, as the Lord has commanded (D&amp;amp;C 115:5).<br><br>The education you receive here will be of the finest quality. Our able faculty are prepared--the rest depends on you. But there is more to Brigham Young University than just a secular education. President Spencer W. Kimball said:<br><br><i>The uniqueness of Brigham Young University lies in its special role--education for eternity--which it must carry in addition to the usual tasks of a university. This means concern--curricular and behavioral--for not only the "whole man" but for the "eternal man."</i>[Spencer W. Kimball, "Education for Eternity," Preschool Address to BYU Faculty and Staff, 12 September 1967, p. 1]<br><br>As we interact together at BYU, each person is involved in the ongoing process of educating the eternal within us. We are told in the scriptures that members of the Church are given special gifts of the Spirit for the benefit of those who love our Heavenly Father and keep his commandments. Brigham Young said, "The gifts of the Gospel are given to strengthen the faith of the believer" (<i>JD</i>10:324). In section 46 of the Doctrine and Covenants, it says:<br><br><i>All have not every gift given unto them; for there are many gifts, and to every</i>[person]<i>is given a gift by the Spirit of God.</i><br><br><i>To some is given one, and to some is given another, that all may be profited thereby.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 46:11–12]<br><br>Each of us is unique and in our own special way different from everyone else. We have been given gifts and talents by the Spirit of God that make us distinctly who we are. As we share our talents with others, we bless them--and they bless us with their gifts. We come together as parts of a whole, as Paul describes in 1 Corinthians 12. The body needs each part in order to function properly, to bless the lives of each member. We come together as members of Christ's church to share talents and the gifts that we have. As one shares leadership abilities, another shares the gift of love. Someone else shares their musical talents. We strengthen one another's testimonies as we express our feelings about the Savior and his gospel. Within the Church some teach, some testify, some lead--all have the opportunity to share and develop their talents.<br><br>We are given a commandment that when we are assembled together, we are to "instruct and edify each other" (D&amp;amp;C 43:8). In Moroni 6:5 we are told, "The church did meet together oft, to fast and to pray, and to speak one with another concerning the welfare of their souls."<br><br>A number of years ago President Bateman and I left our home in the United States to live in Ghana, West Africa. It was in the 1960s. There were no members of the Church in Ghana then. President Bateman was a lecturer in economics at the University of Ghana. He was also engaged in research for his doctoral thesis. Our family consisted of Merrill, myself, and two little boys--Michael and Mark. Michael was three years old, and Mark was 10 months old.<br><br>At the time Ghana's population was about 7 million people. You cannot imagine how lonely it was. We had been given permission by President Hugh B. Brown of the First Presidency to hold sacrament meetings in our home. Each Sunday we gathered together, and President Bateman would prepare, bless, and pass the sacrament to our little boys and me. We would sing Primary songs and tell the children stories about Jesus, and then President Bateman and I would share our testimonies of the gospel and our love for our family. We had one another's companionship, which was wonderful, but it was lonely. We missed the association and strength that comes from being a part of a ward or branch where we could serve and be served. We missed the diversity of gifts that are found in a larger group. We missed the friendships that exist among brothers and sisters in the gospel who share common goals and principles of truth.<br><br>Our daughter, Michele, has an egg collection. I am amazed at the variety of eggs she has assembled. I find the variety and uniqueness of each egg intriguing. There are large eggs and small ones. Some are beautiful, others are plain, and still others are very colorful. Some of Michele's eggs are hard and cold. Others are fragile and intricate. Each egg is different from the rest, but each is appealing in its own way. I have often thought how like people her eggs are. We are all children of our Heavenly Father, yet, like the eggs, we are different from one another--different in size and shape; different in coloring; different in decorativeness and in plainness. Some of us are hard and others fragile. Some people, like some eggs, look alike. We have twin daughters: Merilee and Melisa. In appearance they are quite similar. Some people think they look just alike. When they were younger they were often treated as one. But they did not want to be treated the same. They wanted to be appreciated for their differences rather than for their sameness.<br><br>The differences in us make life interesting. Think how boring an egg collection would be if all the eggs were alike.<br><br>There are two important pieces of knowledge that we need to understand and internalize to be happy. The first is that we are children--spiritual children--of our Heavenly Father. There is divinity within us. Every person on this earth is a child of God. Every one!<br><br>Second, our Heavenly Father loves us. He has endowed us with gifts of the Spirit that make us uniquely who we are. Our challenge is to know our real self--to live lives congruent with the Spirit inside us.<br><br>Because we were successful as spiritual children, we were given the opportunity to come to earth and be proven, to see if we would "do all things whatsoever the Lord . . . command[ed]" (Abraham 3:25). We are to continue our progress on this earth by being "added upon" (Abraham 3:26). We were born to succeed.<br><br>One of Satan's aims is to distract us from being successful. He would have us believe that success is something that it really is not. Satan's plan is full of half-truths, and he tries to lure us into accepting his counterfeit interpretation of life.<br><br>For instance, Satan would have us measure our worth and that of others by the standards of the world. He would have us believe that we should all be cast from the same mold--we should look alike, act alike, and even think alike to be in style--to be correct. Consequently we become preoccupied in trying to measure up to the fads and thinking of the day. We become more concerned about whether our clothes are in vogue than if they are modest and appropriate. "Modesty in dress and language and deportment is a true mark of refinement and a hallmark of a virtuous Latter-day Saint. . . . Shun the low and the vulgar and the suggestive" (Ezra Taft Benson, "To the Young Women of the Church,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 1986, p. 83).<br><br>The world would have us be more anxious about how we look and what we weigh than how healthy we are. A proper diet, appropriate exercise, and plenty of rest keeps our bodies, our minds, and our spirits in the best state of health. Anything else robs us of our full potential. Eventually a price is paid if we do not take care of our bodies.<br><br>We are often more into "political correctness" than "spiritual correctness." The world would have us believe that our happiness comes from other people's reactions to us. We use radarlike signals to measure how we look, how we act, and what we think and say. We send out signals--feelers--to others. These signals bounce back. When others find our actions congruent with their thinking, they send positive signals. We interpret those signals to mean that we are of worth. Our interest in others often depends on the signals we receive rather than on genuine feelings within.<br><br>In contrast, gifts of the Spirit, especially charity, are like a gyroscope. They are internal. Like a gyroscope they are steady and sure amidst the changing fads of the world. As part of our education for eternity, we must seek a principle-centered life. This is a life where the gyroscope--our real self--maintains an equilibrium and direction based on eternal truths rather than on the signals generated by others. Knowledge of our inner self lifts us above criticism, above discouragement, and above failure--"This above all: to thine own self be true" (William Shakespeare,<i>Hamlet,</i>act 1, scene 3, line 78). I say this in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Marilyn S. Bateman, wife of Merrill J. Bateman, gave this devotional address on 9 September 1997.</i><br><br><i>© Brigham Young University.

<h1>ne: A Relationship With the Savior - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
It is wonderful to gather in the Marriott Center for the second devotional of the year. We express thanks to the ballroom dance team for their outstanding performance last week. On the one hand, many of you have returned for a second, third, or fourth year. You come with anticipation and excitement as you renew friendships, look forward to new relationships, and continue the learning process. Earlier experiences have taught you how to navigate the campus, what to expect in terms of homework, how to study effectively, and the importance of staying current on assignments.<br><br>On the other hand, more than 8,000 are new to campus--6,000 freshman and 2,000 transfer students enter Brigham Young University each year. They replace more than 8,000 who graduate annually. The student body now represents all 50 states and 108 foreign countries. As Vice President Wilkins has noted on occasion, some of the new freshmen now are in classes larger than their hometown. Some may be the first person from their high school or family to attend the university. In spite of freshman orientation, some are experiencing a feeling of being alone and lost.<br><br>Two weeks ago I shared an experience with the freshmen that captures the theme of my remarks for today. The incident concerns a young woman who desired to attend BYU from the time she was very young but believed she would never have the opportunity because of difficult financial circumstances. Consequently she did not apply last spring during her senior year in high school even though her grades were excellent and she was worthy.<br><br>As is customary, university advisement personnel hold meetings for newly selected freshmen each spring. On the day this meeting was held in her hometown, the young woman received in the mail a notice that she was a National Merit finalist. This meant her tuition would be paid by a national scholarship. Still, she did not have the financial means to cover the additional costs associated with moving from home and living in another state and city. However, the confluence of the notice and the meeting for new BYU freshmen rekindled a spark of hope, and she decided to attend even though she was not on the invitation list.<br><br>I happened to be in the city that day on other business and was invited by our advisement people to speak to the new freshmen at the evening gathering. Following the main session, the freshmen were divided into small discussion groups and sent to other parts of the building. As I left the chapel, I stopped momentarily to visit with waiting parents. While conversing, I suddenly felt the presence of someone behind me. The feeling was followed by an impression that my help was needed. I turned, and there stood two women a few feet distant quietly conversing. They noticed my movement and looked up. I could tell they were waiting to see me. As I approached them, the mother introduced herself and indicated that her daughter would like to ask some questions. The young woman told me of her lifelong dream to attend Brigham Young University and how because of financial circumstances she had not applied. She then proceeded to tell me of the letter that had arrived that day notifying her of the National Merit Scholarship. She further stated that even though her tuition could be paid, her circumstances were such that it still appeared impossible to attend. She then asked if I knew of any way a door might be opened. As I listened, the thought came that her hope had been rekindled by the Holy Spirit and that I had been made aware of her presence by the same source. Additional thoughts came regarding university resources, including student jobs that are available. With the help of BYU admissions personnel, a way was found for the young woman to attend. I suspect she is in the audience today, as she was two weeks ago.<br><br>In the intervening two weeks, I received a short note from her. It has prompted me to speak on the subject I have chosen. The note read as follows:<br><br><i>Dear President Bateman,</i><br><br><i>I would like to thank you for sharing my story last night. I came here feeling lost and lonely and a little bit without purpose. I cannot tell you how I felt when I realized you were talking about me. I know God wants me here and I know I am here to serve him. Thank you!</i><br><br>The note is then signed by the young woman.<br><br>As I reflected on the letter, I realized that all of us feel lonely, lost, and weighed down at times. It is not a freshman phenomenon. It is part of life. It is part of the "opposition in all things" (2 Nephi 2:11). For that reason, I want my young friend and all of you to know that we are not alone. First, Brigham Young University is a family. It is a community of close friendships, of brothers and sisters who share testimonies and values and who treasure each other. In this regard I was impressed with an article in last week's<i>Daily Universe.</i>The author is a professor on campus. The article was written about a student friend whose life was taken in a tragic automobile accident two weeks ago. In concluding the article, Professor Rudy stated:<br><br><i>I hope students can learn from Lindsay to dare to have conversations with their professors. We want to talk with you about our courses, but also about the problems and challenges in your lives, about the big and important decisions you are making, about your hopes and dreams. . . . Together, here and now, we can continue to help each other attain the experiences and learning that will help us fulfill our missions in this life and in the life to come.</i>[Jill Terry Rudy, "Student's Death Teaches Lessons of Life,"<i>Daily Universe,</i>4 September 1997, p. 4]<br><br>Given the special nature of the university, there are many friends who will listen, provide counsel, and share your hopes and dreams. In addition to faculty, staff, and fellow students, bishops wear a special mantle and are entitled to the gift of discernment in your behalf.<br><br>Second, there is a special friend who knows us intimately, who stands by us in critical moments, and whose request is that we come to know him and his Father (see John 17:3). He is the Lord Jesus Christ. His sojourn in mortality and his atoning experience provide him with unique insights regarding our challenges, sorrows, and infirmities. As Paul testified, we worship a Savior who has a "feeling of our infirmities" (Hebrews 4:15), who has "compassion" for us because he was "compassed with infirmity" (Hebrews 5:2). His personal knowledge, his great love, and his atoning powers combine in tailoring his assistance to meet our peculiar needs. To honor the gift of agency, he invites each person to come to him and establish a "one by one" relationship through the Holy Spirit (see John 16:12–14; 3 Nephi 11:15, 17:21). There are two passages in the Book of Mormon that clearly illustrate the level of his personal interest and many passages that provide understanding regarding his awareness of our problems and willingness to help. Let me share a few passages with you.<br><br>During the Savior's visit to the Nephites in the Western Hemisphere, he told them that he had "drunk out of that bitter cup" (3 Nephi 11:11). He then extended the following invitation to the multitude gathered:<br><br><i>Arise and come forth unto me, that ye may thrust your hands into my side, and . . . feel the prints of the nails in my hands and . . . feet, that ye may know that I am the God of Israel, and the God of the whole earth, and have been slain for the sins of the world.</i>[3 Nephi 11:14]<br><br>The record indicates that the multitude went forth<i>"one by one</i>until they had all gone forth, and did see with their eyes and did feel with their hands, and did know of a surety" (3 Nephi 11:15; emphasis added). Although the multitude totaled 2,500 souls, the record states that "all of them did see and hear, every man for himself" (3 Nephi 17:25). If each person were given 15 seconds to approach the resurrected Lord, thrust their hand into his side, and feel the prints of the nails, more than 10 hours would be required to complete the process.<br><br>The record indicates that later in the day the Savior "took their little children,<i>one by one,</i>and blessed them, and prayed unto the Father for them" (3 Nephi 17:21; emphasis added). The scriptures do not indicate how many children were there, but one surmises that in a multitude of 2,500, there must have been a few hundred. Again, it would have taken hours to complete the blessings.<br><br>Why did Jesus take the time to invite each individual to feel the wounds in his hands and feet and put their hand into his side? Why did he bless each child rather than give a collective pronouncement? Would the personal touch of his hands and the power of his spirit be more efficacious in a "one by one" relationship? The answer is given by the Savior himself when he said:<br><br><i>And ye see that I have commanded that none of you should go away, but rather have commanded that ye should come unto me, that ye might feel and see; even so shall ye do unto the world.</i>[3 Nephi 18:25]<br><br>Suppose you had been in Bountiful that day and experienced a "one by one" relationship with the Savior of the world. You would have fallen at his feet. You, too, would know that he had drunk out of the bitter cup. You would feel some responsibility for the print of the nails in his hands and feet and the wound in his side. You would have seen the engraving of your image in "the palms of [his] hands" (1 Nephi 21:16). On occasion, speakers note that the impact of his appearance produced a season of peace that lasted two hundred years. The truth is that his appearance and teachings had an eternal impact on the lives of those present and for generations to come.<br><br>The Savior's "one by one" invitation is consistent with the principle that salvation is an individual matter. The saving ordinances are administered "one by one." Baptism, confirmation, and priesthood ordinations are performed individually. Missionaries are sent "two by two" to teach individuals and families and baptize "one by one." Home teachers and visiting teachers are sent to "visit the house of each member" (D&amp;amp;C 20:47). Although the highest exalting ordinances are administered "two by two" and in families, saving covenants administered one person at a time form the foundation. The gospel plan provides for each individual to receive his or her own witness (see Alma 32, Moroni 10:3–5). Men and women are expected to know for themselves. More than that, the Savior knows each of us for who we are. As Paul told the Corinthians, "Now I know in part; but then shall I know even as also I am known" (1 Corinthians 13:12).<br><br>As I have stated previously, there were many years in which I believed that the atoning process involved an infinite mass of sin being heaped upon the Savior. As I have become more familiar with the scriptures, my view of the Atonement has expanded. The Atonement involved more than an infinite mass of sin; it entailed an infinite stream of individuals with their specific needs. Alma records that Jesus took upon himself the pains, afflictions, temptations, and sicknesses of his people. In addition, he experienced their weaknesses so that he would know how to help them (see Alma 7:11–12). Isaiah prophesied that the Lord would bear "our griefs, and [carry] our sorrows"; that he would be "wounded for our transgressions" and "bruised for our iniquities" (Isaiah 53:4–5). Paul explained to the Hebrews that Jesus tasted "death for every man" and woman (Hebrews 2:9). No wonder "his sweat was as it were great drops of blood" coming from "every pore" (Luke 22:44, D&amp;amp;C 19:18). Isaiah and Abinadi stated that when "his soul has been made an offering for sin he shall see his seed" (see Isaiah 53:10, Mosiah 15:10). And who are his seed? Those who follow the prophets (Mosiah 15:11–17).<br><br>Brothers and sisters, the Atonement was not only infinite in its expanse but intimate in the lives of God's children. The Redeemer of the world is acquainted with each person's infirmities. He knows your problems. He understands your joys as well as your sorrows. He knows the nature of the temptations that beset you and how they interface with your weaknesses. Above all he knows you and knows how and when to help you. Generally his help is given through the Holy Ghost. The Holy Spirit speaks quietly by generating thoughts and feelings within. The promptings received a few months ago for the young woman wanting to study at BYU were not happenstance. I do not know what the Lord has in store for her, but I do know that her desires to attend this university were important to him.<br><br>Do you understand the process by which you "come to Christ" in order to know him and his Father? I suspect you do! Nevertheless, I wish to review four important steps every person must follow in order to nurture a "one by one" relationship with the Savior.<br><br>The first step is to believe in him and to exercise faith in his character and being by praying to the Father in his name.<br><br>The second involves becoming familiar with his words, his promises, and his covenants.<br><br>The third is to ponder over his teachings and internalize them.<br><br>The fourth is to follow the Savior by serving the one, by showing respect to each and every person, and by obeying the commandments.<br><br>During the Savior's visit to the Nephites, he instructed them that they were to pray always so they would not enter into temptation. He warned them that "Satan [desires] to have you, that he may sift you as wheat" (3 Nephi 18:18). The word<i>sift</i>means to separate or divide. There is strength in unity. Beware of the world's philosophies that claim to be unifying but are divisive. If Satan can separate an individual from the righteous influence of his or her family and the Church, the person becomes vulnerable to temptation. Satan's most effective tool is to teach a person not to pray (see 2 Nephi 32:8). Alma promised his son Helaman that if he would counsel with the Lord in all his doings both morning and night, he would be lifted up at the last day (see Alma 37:37). Prayer is a master key that opens heaven's door. It also opens the door to one's own heart and gives the Holy Spirit access. Students, will you pray at least morning and evening of every day?<br><br>Faith in Christ grows as we become familiar with the Lord's teachings and apply them in our lives. Alma teaches that if a person plants the word of the Lord in his or her heart and then nurtures the seed, it will grow into the tree of life with all the fruits thereof (see Alma 32). The Savior told Joseph Smith in Doctrine and Covenants 18 that those who study the scriptures will hear his voice, feel his Spirit, and know his words (see D&amp;amp;C 18:34–36). Just as study of academic subjects expands one's mind and provides tools for earthly success, so a study of eternal truths expands one's soul and provides the strength to be successful in heavenly things. Students, will you study the scriptures every day even if it is only for a few minutes?<br><br>When Nephi wanted to understand his father's dream, the scriptures state that he pondered the meaning in his heart (see 1 Nephi 11:1). Deep spiritual understanding does not come through casual thinking or study. Profound mental searching is required. Often, spiritual insights come after we have done all that we can do and then with the aid of the Spirit. Students, it is important that you take a few minutes each day to review your life, reflect on your spiritual status, make the necessary adjustments in order to stay on the "strait path" (2 Nephi 33:9), and recommit to be obedient to the commandments.<br><br>Finally, brothers and sisters, serve one another by showing respect for each person and by helping those in need who cross your path. Nephi states that the Lord invites "all to come unto him and partake of his goodness; and he [denies] none that come . . . black and white, bond and free, male and female" (2 Nephi 26:33).<br><br>As I stated in the beginning, the student body comes from all 50 states and 108 countries. There are many cultures and subcultures represented. The campus is a rich milieu. There is much we can learn from one another. A distinguishing feature of this campus is that we care about each other, "black and white, bond and free, male and female." It would be rare to find hate on any campus in America, but it is not difficult to find indifference. That condition must not exist here. Visitors to campus immediately notice a difference. It is because we have respect for each person, "for there is no respect of persons with God" (Romans 2:11). The Master does not hold one of us above the rest. He loves each man and woman and asks us to do the same. The prophet Alma asked the following question:<br><br><i>Is there one among you that doth make a mock of his brother</i>[or sister],<i>or that heapeth upon him persecutions?</i><br><br><i>Wo unto such an one, for he is not prepared, and the time is at hand that he must repent or he cannot be saved!</i>[Alma 5:30–31]<br><br>We ask men and women to honor each other. Each woman and man "has the right and the responsibility to direct her [or his] own life" (Spencer W. Kimball,<i>My Beloved Sisters</i>[Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Company, 1979], p. 23). Each person is of infinite worth as measured by the plan of mercy. Christ suffered for and experienced the pains of "every living creature, . . . men, women, and children" (2 Nephi 9:21).<br><br>Almost four years ago Marilyn and I attended a district conference in Kanazawa, Japan. The theme for the Saturday evening session was "The Atonement of Christ." We spoke about the Savior's sacrifice, his knowledge concerning each person, his invitation to have a "one by one" relationship, and his desire to help each individual overcome the trials and temptations in his or her life. At the end of the Sunday morning session, a young Japanese woman sought me out. She wanted to share a special experience she had had during the morning session. While listening to the sermons, she had reflected on the message of the previous evening. Suddenly she realized that the Savior knew the songs of her heart. He knew how she felt about the gospel. He could read the thoughts and feelings that were hers. With tears rolling down her cheeks, she told how wonderful it was to know that the Savior of the world knew her.<br><br>May each of us accept the Savior's invitation to approach him and to spiritually see and feel the wounds in his hands, feet, and side. May we exercise faith in him as the Redeemer of the world. May we honor him by loving one another as he loves us I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Merrill J.

<h1>g It Rain” - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I'm reminded of a survey that I recently heard of in which people were asked to list their greatest fears. The majority of those surveyed listed giving a talk as that which they feared most. The second most feared activity was that of dying. I suppose that one could deduce from the study that most people would rather die than give a talk.<br><br>Preparation for this devotional has been a most interesting experience. It has given me the chance to more closely focus on an area that is becoming increasingly important to me. I seek for your faith and prayers that what I have prepared will be presented clearly and that you will find value in its content.<br><br>During my 26 years as a faculty member at BYU I have discovered that age is a relative matter. If you continue to work and absorb the beauty in the world about you, you find that age does not necessarily mean getting old. Rather it refers to a continual process of developing and maturing. In my case it refers to an ever-increasing desire to fill my mind with things that will make life more productive and meaningful. Age has taught me the importance of using all that is "virtuous, lovely, or of good report or praiseworthy" (Articles of Faith 1:13) to create a shield in my mind that can ward off temptation and assist me in drawing closer to God and his Son Jesus Christ.<br><br>Today I want to share with you some reasons for, as well as examples of, using two areas of the fine arts--visual representation and music--to give us increased ability to make our lives better and more productive, especially as they relate to our purpose here: to become like Christ.<br><br>There is no profession more important than that of teaching. At any level it is a great responsibility. Good teachers help shape and give direction to the lives of their students.<br><br>One of the principles that plays such an important part in the process of teaching is that there are some things teachers can give to students rather easily and some things they cannot give, except as the students are willing to reach out, grab, and take hold of an object or thought--thus beginning to pay the price for making it an integral part of their lives.<br><br>It is a wonderfully rewarding experience to see the "light go on" in a student's eyes after seeing them grapple and come to grips with a problem or a new experience. On the other hand, it is a disheartening experience to see a student who, when exposed to that which is "of good report or praiseworthy," rejects it because, paraphrasing the American composer Charles Ives, they seek only that which allows the ears to "lie back in an easy chair" (Charles Ives, as quoted by Joseph Machlis in<i>The Enjoyment of Music</i>[New York: Norton, 1977], p. 566).<br><br>There are few things that require concentration or extra effort that are comfortable or convenient. Those people who do not want to put themselves out or "seek" for that which is "of good report or praiseworthy" can usually find an excuse for not participating in the experience. Self-improvement is seldom situated within easy reach. Learning requires active effort. Seeking that which is "virtuous, lovely, or of good report or praiseworthy" requires that one look for, search for, inquire after, try to discover, or try to acquire. It means being willing to carefully and thoroughly engage yourself in the process of finding and discovering.<br><br>In describing his dream, Lehi spoke of "a tree, whose fruit was desirable to make one happy." The fruit of the tree was "most sweet, above all that [he] ever before tasted" and it was "white, to exceed all the whiteness that [he] had ever seen." After partaking of the wonderful fruit, his soul was filled "with exceedingly great joy" (1 Nephi 8:10–12).<br><br>Lehi also spoke of a "rod of iron" and of a path extending along the bank of a river. The rod assists one in staying on the path. Both lead to the tree containing the white, most sweet, and wonderful fruit.<br><br>During the course of Lehi's narration it becomes obvious that reaching the tree is no easy task. It is not simple or convenient. You cannot progress down the path if you simply allow yourself to "lie back in an easy chair" (see 1 Nephi 8:19–33).<br><br>At no point in Lehi's dream was anyone forced to take hold of the rod and proceed down the path. Those desiring to partake of the fruit had to be willing to do so of their own volition. They had to be willing to exert all of their might, mind, and strength in seeking that which would give greater gripping power.<br><br>Being able to continually hold on requires that we fully experience the gospel of Jesus Christ, and it means that we completely understand and internalize our obligations and responsibilities.<br><br>As we thoroughly engage ourselves in making that which is "virtuous, lovely, or of good report or praiseworthy" a part of our lives, our grip on the rod becomes stronger. And when the floods descend and the mists of darkness surround us, we are able to withstand the temptation to release our grip and leave the path. We are able to hang on until we can partake of that which is the "greatest of all the gifts of God," even eternal life (1 Nephi 15:36, D&amp;amp;C 14:7).<br><br>Each member of Christ's church has the responsibility to find that which allows them to have a sturdy grip on the rod. Elder Dallin H. Oaks admonished that we have the responsibility of filling<br><br><i>our minds with "the things of the Spirit"--things that teach of God or promote that which is pleasing to him, things that are "virtuous, lovely, or of good report or praiseworthy."</i>[Dallin H. Oaks,<i>Pure in Heart</i>(Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1988), p. 146]<br><br>We need to seek wisdom and understanding. We need to "seek learning, even by study and also by faith" (D&amp;amp;C 88:118). We need to fill our minds with thoughts and expressions, with pictures and music and books that can be judged as worthy to draw one closer to the Spirit of Christ. "They are the daily bread of the soul, the best friends a man can have. . . . They teach us the best way of living and the noblest way of thinking" (Henry Fielding, quoted by Hugh B. Brown,<i>The Abundant Life</i>[Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1965], p. 112).<br><br>Several individuals from this and other pulpits have told us to fill our minds with good music. They have suggested that we have a favorite hymn that we sing in our minds when the mists of darkness surround us. Others have suggested that we memorize poems or scriptures for the same purpose. Some have used works of art as contemplative material to help overcome the influence of evil. All of these interventions can help combat evil's influence. They focus our minds. They enrich us with wisdom.<br><br>We need to start filling our minds with good things. As Paul said in his letter to the Thessalonians, "Hold fast that which is good" (1 Thessalonians 5:21).<br><br>Dr. Arthur Henry King, an emeritus member of our faculty, said in a June 1970 forum lecture:<br><br><i>We have a message</i>[for]<i>the world. That message springs from our faith. In order to give that message, we need to select from the world the instruments which will help us to convey our faith; and at the same time, we need to study the world to understand with what we have to deal. But we need to study the world, not from the point of view of the world, because that is wrong; but from the point of view of the center which we have in the Church and in ourselves that enables us to judge clearly and firmly. One of the major tasks of our education surely is to apply the Church's standards to the great artistic works of all time in order that we may judge them in their approaches to the relationship of God and man.</i><br><br>Dr. King concludes:<br><br><i>The Holy Spirit does not do everything for us. It is there to guide us when we are unable to do what is needed for ourselves. It is up to us in our Church to educate ourselves to the point at which we can experience the best of art.</i>[Arthur H. King, "Some Notes on Art and Morality,"<i>BYU Studies</i>11, no. 1 (autumn 1970):48]<br><br>"Experience the best of art"--being in the world but not of the world. We are different. Our view of life must be from the standpoint of the gospel and its teachings. We, indeed, have a message for the world--a message that we must internalize. It must become a part of our being. We must inwardly have an understanding of what it means to take upon ourselves the name of Christ. We must be convinced and certain of the message as given by the Savior.<br><br>To "experience the best of art," we must understand that "all things which are good cometh of God" and that "the Spirit of Christ is given to every man, that he may know good from evil" (Moroni 7:12, 16).<br><br>Elder Richard L. Evans wrote, "We are the sum of all our actions and attitudes and utterances, of all things stored in body and mind and memory" (Richard L. Evans,<i>An Open Door,</i>vol. 2 [Salt Lake City: Publishers Press, 1967], p. 100). Thus we should be continually filling our bodies, minds, and memories with that which is "virtuous, lovely, or of good report or praiseworthy."<br><br>Several years ago one of our older boys, who was five or six years old at the time, was sitting on the sofa in our front room. It was summer--midday--and the sun was shining through our large front windows. He was taking a few moments out from his play to read and rest. As I looked at him with the open book resting on his lap, he seemed to be sleeping. Thinking that it would be more comfortable for him to lie down, I went over to him and began putting my arms under his legs and around his back. As I touched him, he suddenly moved and said, "What ya doin', Dad?"<br><br>In response I said that I was simply trying to make him more comfortable. In his most direct way he said that he wasn't tired and didn't want to nap.<br><br>"What do you mean, Son? Your eyes were closed, and you seemed to be sleeping."<br><br>"I wasn't sleeping, Dad," he said. "I was just watching it rain."<br><br>"Watching it rain." The book was about rain. This young boy had taken his life experiences with rain and combined them with that which he had been reading. Inside his mind, despite the fact that the sun was shining brightly through the windows, he was "watching it rain." He had internalized the message. It had become a part of him, so much so that when he wanted he could recall and visualize in his mind the experience of rain.<br><br>During a Study Abroad experience in London in 1991, we visited many of the great art museums of Europe. It was then that my slide collection of paintings depicting events in the life of the Savior was started. Many of these paintings have made it possible for me to visualize the written word. They have given my imagination the opportunity to see how certain scenes might have been. They are snapshots of a moment in time suspended forever as seen through the artist's eyes. They have, in Elder Boyd K. Packer's words, "a sense of spiritual propriety" (Boyd K. Packer, "The Arts and the Spirit of the Lord,"<i>Speeches of the Year, 1976</i>[Provo: Brigham Young University Press, 1977], p. 278).<br><br>Just as our young son was "watching it rain" after reading a book, so works of art can give us the opportunity to visualize particular events in the life of the Savior with greater depth and understanding. Works of art literally can bring scriptural passages to life.<br><br>The following paintings were not originally intended for display in the Marriott Center setting. Rather they were intended for settings in which those viewing them could stand close to them and bask in their visual display. Some were intended for monasteries or chapels, some were intended for small rooms in which individuals gathered for worship and contemplation, some were intended for personal or private display. All were painted with the idea of drawing the viewer into a scene and giving him or her more empathy. All were designed to assist in giving greater individual internalization to the subject being portrayed.<br><br>[Slide 1]<i>Taken in Adultery--</i>Bruce Hixon Smith<br><br>Early one morning Jesus came into the temple. John writes that<br><br><i>all the people came unto him; and he sat down, and taught them.</i><br><br><i>And the scribes and Pharisees brought unto him a woman taken in adultery; and when they had set her in the midst,</i><br><br><i>They say unto him, Master, this woman was taken in adultery, in the very act.</i><br><br><i>Now Moses in the law commanded us, that such should be stoned: but what sayest thou?</i>[John 8:2–5]<br><br>That is the moment Bruce Hixson Smith of our faculty was attempting to pictorialize in his<i>Taken in Adultery</i>(in personal collection of Bruce L. Christensen). Brother Smith described it this way: "The painting . . . implicitly refers to the evilness and insensitivity of the accusers; yet for me, the painting primarily reaffirms faith in repentance, and strengthens my will to repent. It illustrates the perfect understanding of our Savior and confirms his magnanimous persuasion."<br><br>Professor Smith has purposely taken great pains not to paint this scene in a realistic style. Rather, the viewer is required to engage the imagination. The "evilness and insensitivity of the accusers" is there, but it is not on a platter. You have to put your mind to work. You have to reach out and discover what is being pictorialized by the artist.<br><br>For some time<i>Taken in Adultery</i>hung in the office of Dean Bruce Christensen. As you would walk by his open door, it was in full view. It was always difficult for me to go past his office without contemplating the painting and thinking of the Savior's response to the scribes and Pharisees: "He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her." His admonition to the woman, "Go, and sin no more," and her response that she "glorified God from that hour, and believed on his name" have always given me cause for hope and for knowing the direction I should take as I sin and go through the repentance process (John 8:7, 11; JST John 8:11).<br><br>Close your eyes, ponder on the scriptural passage, allow yourself to visualize the moment through the eyes of the artist: All these actions will allow you the opportunity to more fully understand, envision, and internalize the lessons being taught by the Savior. You will indeed be "watching it rain."<br><br>[Slide 2]<i>Crucifixion--</i>Francisco de Zurbarán<br><br>In 1627 Francisco de Zurbarán painted<i>Crucifixion</i>(in collection of the Art Institute of Chicago) for the monastery of San Pablo el Reale in Seville, Spain. Not intended to be a work that allows the eyes to lie back in an easy chair,<i>Crucifixion</i>gives the viewer a realistic rendering of Zurbarán's concept of the horror of crucifixion, of nails being driven into hands and feet, of a spear being thrust into the Savior's side, and of the agony of death. Crucifixion is not a pretty sight but is one that we must allow to become part of our visualization process. It happened. Christ hung on the cross. But there was a purpose. Eliza R. Snow wrote:<br><br><i>Behold the great Redeemer die,<br>A broken law to satisfy.<br>He dies a sacrifice for sin,<br>That man may live and glory win.</i><br><br><i>While guilty men his pains deride,<br>They pierce his hands and feet and side;<br>And with insulting scoffs and scorns,<br>They crown his head with plaited thorns.</i><br><br><i>Although in agony he hung,<br>No murm'ring word escaped his tongue.<br>His high commission to fulfill,<br>He magnified his Father's will.</i><br>. . .<br><i>He died, and at the awful sight<br>The sun in shame withdrew its light!<br>Earth trembled, and all nature sighed<br>In dread response, "A God has died!"</i><br>["Behold the Great Redeemer Die,"<i>Hymns,</i>1985, no. 191]<br><br>A snapshot of a moment in time. Can you see the sun withdraw its light, the earth tremble, and all nature sigh? Can you "watch it rain," thunder, and lightning as the Son of God is crucified?<br><br>[Slide 3]<i>Doubting Thomas--</i>Michelangelo da Caravaggio<br><br>Following his resurrection, Christ appeared to his disciples. Thomas, one of their number, was not with them. Following the appearance, the disciples said to Thomas:<br><br><i>We have seen the Lord. But he said unto them, Except I shall see in his hands the print of the nails, and put my finger into the print of the nails, and thrust my hand into his side, I will not believe.</i>[John 20:25]<br><br>Eight days later, while Thomas and the other disciples were together in a room, the doors being shut, Jesus suddenly stood in their midst and said, "Peace be unto you." He then turned to Thomas and said, "Reach hither thy finger, and behold my hands; and reach hither thy hand, and thrust it into my side: and be not faithless, but believing" (John 20:26–27).<br><br>The Italian painter Caravaggio painted<i>Doubting Thomas</i>in 1604 (in collection of the Potsdam Neuespalais). The painting allows us the opportunity to envision the Savior's conversation with Thomas. It makes it possible for us to focus our minds on the event and more fully internalize the Savior's admonition: "Thomas, because thou hast seen me, thou hast believed: blessed are they that have not seen, and yet have believed" (John 20:29).<br><br>[Slide 4]<i>Doubting Thomas--</i>Guercino<br><br>This same<i>Doubting Thomas</i>scene was painted a short while later by another Italian known as Guercino.<br><br>Neither of these two artists intended their paintings to depict events in another part of the world. They can, however, give us opportunity to better envision and incorporate within ourselves the resurrected Savior's appearance to the Nephites. You remember his appearance--after the sun withdrew its light in shame, the earth trembled, and "all nature sighed." Picture in your mind's eye the Savior saying:<br><br><i>Arise and come forth unto me, that ye may thrust your hands into my side, and also that ye may feel the prints of the nails in my hands and in my feet. . . .</i><br><br><i>And it came to pass that the multitude went forth, and thrust their hands into his side, and did feel the prints of the nails in his hands and in his feet; and this they did do, going forth one by one until they had all gone forth, and did see with their eyes and did feel with their hands, and did know of a surety . . . that it was he, of whom it was written by the prophets, that should come.</i>[3 Nephi 11:14–15]<br><br>Another snapshot of frozen time. Can you envision yourself being there? Can you see the Savior asking them to arise? Can you envision placing your hands into his side and feeling the prints of the nails in his hands? Can you "watch it rain?"<br><br>[Slide 5]<i>The First Vision--</i>Minerva Teichert<br><br>Minerva Teichert was born in Ogden, Utah, in 1888. She studied at the Chicago Art Institute from 1908 to 1912. In the 1930s, during her most productive period, her first priority was to paint the Mormon story. For her, painting was a means of telling people about her faith in Christ and of his church restored to earth by the Prophet Joseph Smith. This painting of the Father and Son's appearance to Joseph currently hangs in the Joseph Smith Building on our campus (<i>The First Vision,</i>painted for the LDS tabernacle in Montpelier, Idaho). Unfortunately, it hangs in an area that is not all together conducive to contemplation on a personal level. But upon viewing the painting one ought to have brought to mind the experience that this painting is attempting to pictorialize.<br><br><i>Exerting all my powers to call upon God to deliver me out of the power of this enemy which had seized upon me, and at the very moment when I was ready to sink into despair . . . I saw a pillar of light exactly over my head, above the brightness of the sun, which descended gradually until it fell upon me.</i><br><br><i>. . . When the light rested upon me I saw two Personages, whose brightness and glory defy all description, standing above me in the air. One of them spake unto me, calling me by name and said, pointing to the other--</i>This is My Beloved Son. Hear Him! [Joseph Smith--History 1:16–17; emphasis in original]<br><br>In your quiet moments can you envision the power of the enemy? Can you envision the feeling of despair of the Prophet? Can you see the pillar of light descend upon him? Can you see the "brightness and glory" of the heavenly personages as they appeared to him? Can you "watch it rain"?<br><br>Music is one of the most influential and powerful areas of the arts. It can draw us closer to the Spirit--the Spirit of Christ and the Holy Ghost. Or it can draw us closer to that spirit that causes us to do and say those things that are not of God. It has the power to persuade mankind to do evil, or it can assist us to more deeply believe in Christ. It can indeed be a great gift for good. It is our responsibility to internalize the kind of music that will assist us in becoming a child of Christ.<br><br>Music is the power of emotion expressed in sound. It can enhance our inner being. It can assist us in more vividly "watching it rain."<br><br>Upon arriving in the Eastern Canadian Mission, I was assigned to labor in Ottawa with Elder Gary Heiner. Elder Heiner wasted no time involving me in the work. On the evening of my first day there we visited a Mrs. Groves. The experience that evening is so vivid that I remember it like it was yesterday. We entered her home, Elder Heiner gave the first discussion, and then he bore his testimony. He then turned to me and said, "Elder Randall, will you please bear your testimony?" Oh, how I wanted to bear my testimony by playing the piano. I would have found that so much easier. I had had much more experience performing in front of people than in bearing my testimony--especially to a stranger. Well, there was no piano available that night, and I found it necessary to verbally share with Mrs. Groves my testimony of the Prophet Joseph Smith and the Restoration.<br><br>Now, however, I have the opportunity, along with my fellow faculty member Robin Hancock, to play for you an expression of testimony: "I Know That My Redeemer Lives." The arrangement was done by Larry Beebe. As you listen, allow yourself to contemplate the words of the hymn and visualize the resurrected Savior in all of his glory and majesty.<br><br>Don't allow yourselves to simply lie back in an easy chair, or be like the cow Hugh B. Brown described standing on the hillside chewing her cud "blissfully unaware of the beautiful sunset in the west" (Hugh B. Brown,<i>The Abundant Life,</i>p. 262). Be willing to seek after all that is "virtuous, lovely, or of good report or praiseworthy." Be willing to continually fill your mind with that which will draw you closer to the Spirit of Christ and help you resist temptation at every turn. Be willing to fill your mind with that which will allow you to more clearly "watch it rain." By doing so you will create a shield in your mind that will assist you in warding off temptation and drawing closer to God and his Son Jesus Christ.<br><br>God lives. This is his church. We live in a day when there are prophets--prophets who represent the Lord Jesus Christ. May we continually seek to do his will, that we might one day enter back into his presence, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>David M.

<h1> God When Things Go Wrong - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
In selecting a topic for today's talk--trusting God when things go wrong--I in no way wish to be the bearer of bad tidings. Mentioning the possibility (or better, certainty) that things can go badly caused me some uncomfortable moments in the past. At one time I was a member of a high council in a married student stake. I had been discussing the delights of this assignment with a number of my colleagues and friends. Almost unanimously they spoke of the great opportunity it would be to work with young people during the happiest time of their lives.<br><br>During a later Church meeting I told the students of my conversations. They greeted my story with blank stares and stony silence. But I could read the meaning of their disapproving glances: "Here we are trying to get adjusted to a new marriage, hoping to stretch the Ramen noodles to the end of the month, being deprived of sleep by a colicky baby (or variously--by a wife with terminal morning sickness [this is the husband's perspective, of course; the wife is far more miserable]), working full-time and enrolled for 17 hours, having just taken out another student loan, hitting our heads on furnace vents every time we move around our basement apartment, trying to drive a car that burns equal amounts of gas and oil--and here this idiot is telling us that these are the happiest times we can expect?"<br><br>The only response that I could think of was, "That's right. Life gives us much happiness, but if your happiness is dependent on circumstances, you probably never will find yourself any happier."<br><br>I guess that it doesn't hurt too much to hope that some utopian time is on the horizon when some circumstance will end our problems. It just isn't very helpful to expect that it really will happen. As Alexander Pope, our English language's second-most-quoted poet puts it: "Hope springs eternal in the human breast: / Man never is, but always to be blest" (<i>An Essay on Man</i>[1733–34], Epistle I, lines 95–96).<br><br>There will be times when earthly hopes--hopes for material rewards, for changed circumstances, for loving relationships, for health, for repentant loved ones, even for lots of sleep and easy A's--will be dashed on the rocks of despair, and then it will be important for all of us to rely on spiritual hope, on the trust we have developed in a loving and all-wise Heavenly Father.<br><br>My reflections on things going wrong have often centered on two of my heroes: the great prophet Mormon and the profound apostle Paul. I have always stood in awe of Mormon, who describes himself at age 10 as beginning "to be learned somewhat after the manner of the learning of my people" (Mormon 1:2) and who at 15 was "visited of the Lord, and tasted and knew of the goodness of Jesus" (Mormon 1:15). Then, a year later, he became the commander of the Nephite troops. The remainder of his life, as we know, was spent leading his people in their desperate and hopeless struggle against the overwhelming forces of the Lamanites and their own evil ways, at the same time ministering to them spiritually and mourning their increasing corruption. But all the while he was engaged in a massive literary project--reading and condensing the huge body of Nephite records.<br><br>I have occasionally undertaken some kind of academic task--although none of my projects has come close to the complexity and size of Mormon's--and I can think of some pretty good conditions under which to complete such work. One should sit in front of a word processor in an air-conditioned office, interrupted only occasionally by one of a cadre of research assistants, taking time to revise, and having a good copy editor checking for typos and mistakes. But Mormon did his work on the run, carrying the load of plates with him as he and his people fled repeated enemy onslaughts. It is difficult to conceive how he could complete such a vast spiritual and literary project under such conditions. Here was a man of heroic stature whose life was filled with tragic circumstances. For this reason, a few verses about him brought tears to my eyes as I was preparing a Gospel Doctrine lesson last year.<br><br>At this point I would like to insert another of the parenthetical comments that will interrupt the already disjointed flow of this talk. I have sometimes told my students that they don't deserve to read Homer's<i>Iliad</i>at their age--that they need more experience with life to understand it's profundity. (This does not mean, of course, that I won't test them on it!) I would never tell students not to read the scriptures, but I do feel that repeated readings at various stages of our lives reveal many things that we simply are not prepared for at first. I recently remarked to a passage of scripture, "Where were you the last time I read the Book of Mormon?"<br><br>But it seemed to answer back to me, "I was always here. Where were<i>you</i>the last time you read the Book of Mormon?"<br><br>Now, back to the passage that so moved me as an older reader: In Mormon 8:5, Moroni writes in the middle of a verse, "My father hath been slain in battle, and all my kinsfolk, and I have not friends nor whither to go; and how long the Lord will suffer that I may live I know not." What struck me so deeply was that not even in the end was Mormon spared the troubles of this earth. Here was one of the Lord's greatest who had survived to old age serving as prophet, writer, and military leader. Wouldn't death on his bed be appropriate? Couldn't he have spoken his goodbyes to his son and then just slipped away? No, true to his fallen people, he died in conflict, and his undoubtedly heroic death is noted only in the words "My father hath been slain in battle."<br><br>The death of Paul, whose sudden conversion wrenched him from his course as persecutor of the Christians to becoming the apostle most responsible for spreading the blessings of Israel to what has become modern-day Christian Europe, is not even recorded in the scriptures. Luke's account in Acts does not carry the narrative that far, and we are left to tradition when seeking after the last events of his life. In 2 Corinthians, written probably nine or 10 years before his death, Paul describes his life:<br><br><i>Of the Jews five times received I forty stripes save one.</i><br><br><i>Thrice was I beaten with rods, once was I stoned, thrice I suffered shipwreck, a night and a day I have been in the deep;</i>[We should add that this was written before the shipwreck described in Acts 27.]<br><br><i>In journeyings often, in perils of waters, in perils of robbers, in perils by mine own countrymen, in perils by the heathen, in perils in the city, in perils in the wilderness, in perils in the sea, in perils among false brethren;</i><br><br><i>In weariness and painfulness, in watchings often, in hunger and thirst, in fastings often, in cold and nakedness.</i>[2 Corinthians 11:24–27]<br><br>Paul, like any mortal, really suffered through these experiences. In chapter 12 of the same book, he describes his well-known "thorn in the flesh, the messenger of Satan to buffet me." This thorn, which has been variously interpreted as an illness, pain, or even a persecutor or apostate enemy, was a stinging torment. But Paul reports, "For this thing I besought the Lord thrice, that it might depart from me. And he said unto me, My grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength is made perfect in weakness" (2 Corinthians 12:7–9). The Lord told Paul not to expect relief in this matter.<br><br>Others might think, based on their experiences, that both Mormon and Paul would be bitter or at least perplexed about their lives. But such is not the case. In his last writing but for the epistles recorded by his son, Mormon first laments the destruction of his people and then pleads to those who will come after, especially his enemies, the Lamanites, that they come to Christ and his gospel. As he describes Christ's victory over the grave, he adds:<br><br><i>And he bringeth to pass the resurrection of the dead, whereby man must be raised to stand before his judgment-seat.</i><br><br><i>And he hath brought to pass the redemption of the world, whereby he that is found guiltless before him at the judgment day hath it given unto him to dwell in the presence of God in his kingdom, to sing ceaseless praises with the choirs above, unto the Father, and unto the Son, and unto the Holy Ghost, which are one God, in a state of happiness which hath no end.</i>[Mormon 7:6–7]<br><br>Let's think of this for a moment. Here is a military commander who, having just experienced the virtual annihilation of his people, concludes his work with a promise of endless happiness to those of his enemies who turn to God. What can cause a person to think this way? We'll leave that question for a moment.<br><br>Paul is equally positive: after declaring himself prepared to be offered, he adds:<br><br><i>I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith:</i><br><br><i>Henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give me at that day: and not to me only, but unto all them also that love his appearing.</i>[2 Timothy 4:7–8]<br><br>I believe that the characteristic that helped both Mormon and Paul face difficult lives with calmness and optimism is trust in the Lord and his promises. For them this trust transcended any circumstance, however negative and threatening. Once believers have come to know that God's assurances are true, no circumstance can undermine their fervent and, ultimately, optimistic view of the world God has created. They understand that the reason for their existence, even in times of trial, is joy. For the next few minutes I would like to make some suggestions that might strengthen our trust in God--even when conditions are not the best.<br><br>First, it is good to know how things will ultimately end. That is, it is important to know that God's promises of the ultimate triumph of goodness and righteousness are valid. I would like to illustrate this point with an analogy from football. I do this with a bit of an apology to my colleagues who can't understand how someone who makes his living teaching about poetry, music, and painting could be such a fanatic about this slightly rough sport.<br><br>A few years ago, before the time that all BYU games were televised live, I landed at the Salt Lake airport just as a BYU "away" game was concluding. I rushed around the terminal until I finally found someone who could assure me that we had won, although by a very close score. That evening, after returning to Provo, I went downstairs to watch the replay of the game on KBYU. My demeanor was amazingly serene. When we fumbled or had a pass intercepted, I hardly reacted. My wife could even let our children get around me. Usually I feel obligated to help my brethren in striped shirts by pointing out their errors in judgment. Because my seats are on row 25, such correction often requires a rather high decibel level. This loudness has carried over to watching football on television. But on that day I remained absolutely calm, even when I had the benefit of instant replay to verify my claim that their defensive back clearly arrived early and that the ground had obviously caused our running back to lose the ball. I was a veritable model of football decorum, never becoming unduly upset or ill behaved.<br><br>The cause of my improved behavior was obvious: I already knew the outcome of the game--BYU would win. It is amazing how that knowledge changes things: cornerbacks can get beat, running backs can fumble, linebackers can miss tackles, offensive guards can blow blocking assignments, and other things can go wrong. But when we know the final score, such things can be endured and sometimes even ignored.<br><br>We also know the final score for the history of this world and for the life of the righteous. The Lord and his people will triumph. It is true that the sorrows of this world and the strength of Satan's forces will win a number of the skirmishes. I am reminded of a wonderful cartoon that appeared in the<i>New Yorker</i>magazine many years ago. It depicts on a baseball scoreboard the battle between the optimists and pessimists. Each inning the pessimists are ahead, sometimes by rather large scores. But at the end of the game, the score reads, "Optimists 1, Pessimists 0." So it is with the history of this world. Satan and his followers, as well as the natural circumstances of mortal life, will inflict many bruises and win many battles. But God, who knows the end from the beginning, has promised that those who serve him will receive the fullness of his blessings. When we realize that righteous living puts us on the winning side, we can learn to trust him during trying times.<br><br>Second, it is good to know how trials can serve us. In Gospel Doctrine class in September or October of this year, nearly all of us have read or will read sections 121–23 of the Doctrine and Covenants. These sections concern what was, at least until the actual martyrdom, the low point of the Prophet Joseph Smith's life. In that amazing letter dated March 25, 1839, and signed by the Prophet, Hyrum, and three others, from which these sections were excerpted, Joseph describes his conditions in considerable detail. At one point he says the following:<br><br><i>Therefore, dearly beloved brethren, we are the more ready and willing to lay claim to your fellowship and love. For our circumstances are calculated to awaken our spirits to a sacred remembrance of everything, and we think that yours are also, and that nothing therefore can separate us from the love of God and fellowship one with another; and that every species of wickedness and cruelty practiced upon us will only tend to bind our hearts together and seal them together in love. We have no need to say to you that we are held in bonds without cause, neither is it needful that you say unto us, We are driven from our homes and smitten without cause. We mutually understand that if the inhabitants of the state of Missouri had let the Saints alone, and had been as desirable of peace as they were, there would have been nothing but peace and quietude in the state unto this day; we should not have been in this hell, surrounded with demons (if not those who are damned, they are those who shall be damned) and where we are compelled to hear nothing but blasphemous oaths, and witness a scene of blasphemy, and drunkenness and hypocrisy, and debaucheries of every description.</i><br><br><i>And again, the cries of orphans and widows would not have ascended up to God against them. Nor would innocent blood have stained the soil of Missouri. But oh! the unrelenting hand! The inhumanity and murderous disposition of this people! It shocks all nature; it beggars and defies all description; it is a tale of woe; a lamentable tale; yea a sorrowful tale; too much to tell; too much for contemplation; too much for human beings; it cannot be found among the heathens; it cannot be found among the nations where kings and tyrants are enthroned; it cannot be found among the savages of the wilderness; yea, and I think it cannot be found among the wild and ferocious beasts of the forest--that a man should be mangled for sport! women be robbed of all that they have--their last morsel for subsistence, and then be violated to gratify the hellish desires of the mob, and finally left to perish with their helpless offspring clinging around their necks.</i>[<i>HC</i>3:290–91]<br><br>It is no wonder then that the Prophet cried out, "O God, where art thou?" and asked how long his hand would be stayed (D&amp;amp;C 121:1–2).<br><br>I, for one, do not like to tell someone my troubles and then have them respond that theirs or others' are worse. But the Lord does tell Joseph that he is not yet as Job, that others have suffered even more (see D&amp;amp;C 121:10). And later he adds, "The Son of Man hath descended below them all. Art thou greater than he?" (D&amp;amp;C 122:8). But God does give the Prophet comfort:<br><br><i>My son, peace be unto thy soul; thine adversity and thine afflictions shall be but a small moment;</i><br><br><i>And then, if thou endure it well, God shall exalt thee on high; thou shalt triumph over all thy foes.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 121:7–8]<br><br>Later Joseph is told, "Know thou, my son, that all these things shall give thee experience, and shall be for thy good" (D&amp;amp;C 122:7).<br><br>At the time of trials, it is difficult for us to understand how suffering can be for our good. But all of us have had the experience of learning afterward what great gains we have made when things have gone wrong. Elder Neal A. Maxwell often quotes the analogy of remodeling the human soul and a living house:<br><br><i>Imagine yourself as a living house. God comes in to rebuild that house. At first, perhaps, you can understand what He is doing. He is getting the drains right and stopping the leaks in the roof and so on: you knew that those jobs needed doing and so you are not surprised. But presently He starts knocking the house about in a way that hurts abominably and does not seem to make sense. What on earth is He up to? The explanation is that He is building quite a different house from the one you thought of--throwing out a new wing here, putting on an extra floor there, running up towers, making courtyards. You thought you were going to be made into a decent little cottage: but He is building a palace.</i>[George MacDonald, cited in C. S. Lewis,<i>Mere Christianity</i>(New York: Macmillan, 1960), p. 160]<br><br>Certainly it would be wrong to seek out adversity. And it is not likely that all difficult experiences are sent by God. But he has given us the opportunity to be where bad things can happen, and he knows what we can become if we trust him when they do.<br><br>Third, we become more trusting as we accustom ourselves to the divine presence of the Holy Ghost. Latter-day Saint teachings inform us, both in the Book of Mormon and the Doctrine and Covenants, of the concept of spiritual death, the separation of our spirits from God. In D&amp;amp;C 29:41, the Lord says:<br><br><i>Wherefore, I, the Lord God, caused that he</i>[Adam]<i>should be cast out from the Garden of Eden, from my presence, because of his transgression, wherein he became spiritually dead, which is the first death, even that same death which is the last death, which is spiritual, which shall be pronounced upon the wicked when I shall say: Depart, ye cursed.</i><br><br>In calling this separation both the first and the last death, the Lord seems to be telling us that such a death can be temporary--that unless we are finally thrust from his presence, this separation can be overcome. And the process of overcoming our separation from God is described in the fourth article of faith. When we have developed faith in Christ's atonement, repented, and been baptized, we can receive the constant companionship of a member of the Godhead. The gift of the Holy Ghost means that we no longer need to endure an existence away from God. Thus we are told "that they may always have his Spirit to be with them" (Moroni 4:3). Having a member of the Godhead always present in our lives should develop our trust to a high degree.<br><br>When the Lord promised the companionship of the Holy Ghost, it was to comfort disciples who were becoming aware that they would soon be without Christ.<br><br><i>And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever;</i><br><br><i>Even the Spirit of truth; whom the world cannot receive, because it seeth him not, neither knoweth him: but ye know him; for he dwelleth with you, and shall be in you.</i><br><br><i>I will not leave you comfortless: I will come to you.</i>[John 14:16–18]<br><br>He also promised peace:<br><br><i>Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid.</i>[John 14:27]<br><br>A good place to observe the nonworldly peace that the Comforter can bring is in the lives of those very disciples who received these promises. I once looked with my computer through the book of Acts for direct references to the Holy Ghost. They were everywhere--as the means by which Jesus guides the apostles, in the account of Pentecost, in the calling of the seventy, in the martyrdom of Stephen, in Ananias's blessing of Saul, in the extending of the gospel to Cornelius and the Gentiles, in the description of Barnabas, in Paul's missionary call, etc. Although circumstances were often discouraging and filled with danger, the Holy Ghost helped these apostles and disciples show undaunted confidence in the Lord.<br><br>This is clearly the same confidence of which the Prophet Joseph wrote:<br><br><i>Let thy bowels also be full of charity towards all men, and to the household of faith, and let virtue garnish thy thoughts unceasingly; then shall thy confidence wax strong in the presence of God; and the doctrine of the priesthood shall distil upon thy soul as the dews from heaven.</i><br><br><i>The Holy Ghost shall be thy constant companion, and thy scepter an unchanging scepter of righteousness and truth; and thy dominion shall be an everlasting dominion, and without compulsory means it shall flow unto thee forever and ever.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 121:45–46]<br><br>It is a trust and confidence gained through the ever-present companionship of the Spirit.<br><br>This spiritual blessing is with us today. A man whom I know related the following event:<br><br><i>I awoke early one morning to feel a very real presence in my bedroom. Although I could not identify who was there nor hear with my natural ears, I knew that I was supposed to learn something important. Clear words entered my mind. They told me: "Something terrible is happening. Tell</i>[your daughter]<i>that it must stop or she will suffer unmeasurable sorrow."</i><br><br><i>I asked, "Will she know what it is about?"</i><br><br><i>"Yes."</i><br><br><i>"Is it too late?"</i><br><br><i>"It is not too late."</i><br><br>The message was relayed to the daughter, who called her father later that week to tell him not to worry. She had received a priesthood blessing and was visiting with her Church leaders. Some time later she told her father that she had been contemplating terminating her activity in the Church. She had become so disillusioned by disappointments and seemingly unfulfilled promises that her life was filled with confusion and numbness. Her trials were far from over, but by then she had the support of Church leaders, family members, and, most important, the Holy Ghost.<br><br>My fourth suggestion is closely related to the previous one: Become alert to the softening and protecting influence of God, even in the midst of troubles. For the plan of this second estate to work, we must be exposed to all kinds of risks. But God often tempers these trials to make sure that they do not push us beyond our capacities. Lehi, as he is expounding for a last time to his sons (and just before he explains the necessity of opposition and suffering), says the following: "But behold, the Lord hath redeemed my soul from hell; I have beheld his glory, and I am encircled about eternally in the arms of his love" (2 Nephi 1:15). All around us there are signs that we, too, are in God's arms, often when we are not completely aware of the fact. Let me give you an example from my own life.<br><br>The October conference of 1993 was particularly moving to my wife and me. For once, we were able to sit down in our family room and listen without interruption. Both of us were especially struck by Elder Jeffrey R. Holland's talk. He related the story of a Sister Lewis, who was struggling with her son's leukemia.<br><br>[One day]<i>as she entered her home, four-year-old Katie ran up to her with love in her eyes and a crumpled sheaf of papers in her hand. Holding the papers out to her mother, she said enthusiastically, "Mommy, do you know what these are?"</i><br><br><i>Sister Lewis said frankly her first impulse was to deflect Katie's zeal and say she didn't feel like playing just then. But she thought of her children ... and the possible regret of missed opportunities and little lives that pass too swiftly. So she smiled through her sorrow and said, "No, Katie. I don't know what they are. Please tell me."</i><br><br><i>"They are the scriptures," Katie beamed back, "and do you know what they say?"</i><br><br><i>Sister Lewis stopped smiling, gazed deeply at this little child, knelt down to her level, and said, "Tell me, Katie. What do the scriptures say?"</i><br><br><i>"They say, 'Trust Jesus.'" And then she was gone.</i><br><br><i>Sister Lewis said that as she stood back up, holding a fistful of her four-year-old's scribbling, she felt near-tangible arms of peace encircle her weary soul and a divine stillness calm her troubled heart.</i>[Jeffrey R. Holland, "Look to God and Live,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 1993, p. 15]<br><br>Later that same Saturday evening, seated alone in the broadcast of the general priesthood meeting, I experienced a moment of important spiritual insight about my family and our relationships. This insight was unrelated to the subject matter of specific talks. It was so personal that I cannot tell you any details, but it became very critical for Dorothy and me when we received a call very early Monday morning informing us that our 20-year-old son, who had moved to Arizona to work, had died, almost certainly before we had had these experiences. Naturally the death of a son at any age will bring its share of sorrow, and to lose a bright young man at 20 may increase the suffering and questioning. But as we have looked back at the events surrounding his death, we have observed the comforting arm of the Lord around us. Elder Holland was clearly not aware that his talk would have special meaning for us--teaching us to trust--but it did. And my experiences in priesthood meeting were a critical preparation for us even though we did not know that at the time I had them. Event after event gave evidence that we were encircled by protections and comforts. And these comforts were not a revising of the record to make ourselves feel better. Some were so specific that even the cynic would need to concede that God was there for us.<br><br>What we experienced was not exceptional. Loving fathers often need to chasten and correct their children, and they sometimes need to let them learn hard lessons through experience--but they are always there for them. So it is with our Father in Heaven.<br><br>Fifth, we should learn that on this earth God expects our obedience and best effort, not our perfection. Often, when things go wrong, we feel that it is because we have failed in some way. There are times this is true and others when it is not. We live in fragile, mortal conditions and are sometimes quite weak. In chapters 7 and 8 of his epistle to the Romans, Paul discusses the tendency of humans to fall short even of their own expectations and desires. He points out that none of us could be saved through the law alone. He tells us that he delights in the law of God:<br><br><i>But I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members.</i><br><br><i>O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this death?</i>[Romans 7:23–24]<br><br>The King James translation of Paul's apparently complicated Greek seems to be saying this--that even those who wish to obey God's law, and who keep that wish in their minds, are still subject to the temptations of the flesh. Because of this, we sometimes fall. But, Paul continues, Christ has overcome our frailties, sorrows, sins, and mortal weaknesses. We are enabled through him to live in the Spirit (see verse 25). And, "The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the children of God: And if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ" (Romans 8:16–17). Thus Paul can express his faith: "For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us" (Romans 8:18). We should not add to the anxieties of this world a lack of confidence in what God has promised he can do for us through his Son Jesus Christ. He can overcome our sins and failings and cleanse us from our iniquities.<br><br>Ultimately it is this faith in what God has done for us and revealed to us through his Son that will strengthen our trust in him when things go wrong. We believe Christ when he said, "In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world" (John 16:33). And we can affirm with Paul:<br><br><i>For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come,</i><br><br><i>Nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.</i>[Romans 8:38–39]<br><br>To which I bear my witness in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Todd A. Britsch was a BYU professor of humanities when this devotional address was given on 30 September 1997.</i><br><br><i>© Brigham Young University. All rights reserved.</i>

<h1>Service - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I enrolled at Yale University as a doctoral student in administrative sciences in September 1977. All kinds of changes were occurring around me. A new school, the School of Organization and Management (SOM), had been established the year previous to my arrival at Yale. The Administrative Sciences Program shared its faculty and even a few of its classes with the School of Organization and Management, which offered a master's degree in public and private management. In return, the SOM provided a brand-new, state-of-the-art facility to house the doctoral and master's programs in management--a facility that was still being built when I arrived. The vision of the School of Organization and Management and the purpose of the new degree it offered was to train managers for working in both government and business, the so-called public and private sectors. The school's founding dean, Bill Donaldson, wanted to create a cadre of managers who could move freely between the worlds of government and business. He took a personal interest in student admissions to the new program to ensure that every student had interest and experience in both the public and private sectors. He expected that half of the graduates of the program would launch their careers in the public sector and half in the private sector; he also expected that both groups would not view their careers as bound to either sector.<br><br>There was something noble and inspiring about Bill Donaldson's vision for the School of Organization and Management. Certainly he had nothing against making money--he had made a lot himself as the senior partner and founder of the brokerage house Donaldson, Lufkin, and Jenrette--but at the same time he felt a sense of civic duty to the nation that had made his success possible. He believed there was more to life than making and spending one's fortune; there was public service.<br><br>By the time I left Yale in 1981 for my first faculty appointment at Purdue, Bill Donaldson had already left Yale's School of Organization and Management. In that brief span of time, his shining vision had been tarnished. It became clear as soon as the SOM's first graduating class entered the job market that something had gone awry. Instead of the half-and-half mix of graduates taking jobs in government and business, nearly all the graduates took jobs in business. Many of the graduates felt conflict in this choice, but it was difficult to turn down a private sector job that in some cases paid three times as much as a public sector job. Unfortunately, Bill Donaldson took the economically motivated decisions of the SOM's graduates personally. He felt betrayed because most of the SOM's graduates chose an opportunity to enrich themselves over an opportunity to serve. He left Yale more cynical than when he arrived, believing his grand experiment had failed. In his mind, there was a clear separation between business and government--business was about making money and government was about service.<br><br>We can give many kinds of service. Robert Coles, in his book<i>The Call of Service,</i>identifies seven different kinds of service: (1) social and political struggle; (2) community service; (3) personal gestures and encounters; (4) charity; (5) religiously sanctioned action; (6) government-sanctioned action; and (7) service to country (Robert Coles,<i>The Call of Service</i>[Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1993], pp. 31–67). We could use other means of differentiating between service activities, such as specifying the settings in which service occurs. This approach might lead to the following list: (1) home service; (2) Church service; and (3) university service. Another way is to focus on the target or receiver of service, the logic that created the term<i>customer service.</i>Today I want to use the relatively crude distinction between public and private service and focus on private service. The major difference between public and private service is that one relates to the activities of governments or the public sector whereas the other relates to the activities of businesses or the private sector. In the end, however, service is service, and all attempts to distinguish between different kinds of service are somewhat artificial.<br><br>A significant event occurred in my life during the summer of 1995, when I was asked to cochair a university committee with Alton Wade, BYU's vice president of student life, with the mandate to explore "service and learning" opportunities at BYU. Obviously, BYU's Service and Learning Committee was inspired by the words at BYU's west entrance: Enter to Learn; Go Forth to Serve. The first time I spoke in the Marriott Center, I was still a master's student in organizational behavior and my topic was "Enter to Learn; Go Forth and Continue Learning." Although that speech had some valuable things to say, it ignored the sublime symbiosis between service and learning. Unfortunately, learning without consideration of the service it can provide becomes a self-warming activity. Like the equally symbiotic relationship between faith and works, learning without service is dead. Our committee created consensus around likening the entrance of BYU to a revolving door. Members of this educational community come to learn, leave for either brief or long periods to serve, refine their learning objectives through their service, and return to the university with a renewed and focused desire to learn--thus completing one full turn of the revolving door.<br><br>Although I am not certain, I believe I was asked to cochair BYU's Service and Learning Committee because I have consistently made service a part of my Organizational Behavior 320/321 course. The class is taught two days each week in a large auditorium lecture format. Students then divide into lab groups of approximately 25 to 30 students to apply some of the learning they receive during lecture time. Students in each lab are divided into two organizations that do various projects over the course of a semester. The first project is a service project that is required but not graded. Student organizations are expected to plan and implement a project requiring each member to perform at least three service hours; then each student writes about the organizing experience. Papers about the organizing experience<i>are</i>graded. A highlight of lecture time is having representatives of each organization report on their service projects to the entire class during either the first five minutes or the last five minutes of class.<br><br>Over the last 11 years that I have taught Organizational Behavior 320/321 at BYU, these service projects have been an integral part of our learning experience. Moreover, a great deal of good has been accomplished--forests of trees have been planted on fire-ravaged hillsides; hundreds of gallons of paint have been applied to floors, walls, and playground equipment; homeless people have been fed and provided clothing items such as coats and shoes; dances and concerts have been sponsored to raise funds for deserving charities and causes; a range of people with special needs have been entertained and visited; and the list goes on. Still, one of my favorite projects involved the organization of an indoor soccer league for the Provo Boys' Club that resulted in some organization members spending 10 to 20 times the required three hours.<br><br>There was a time when I felt content and complacent because I was promoting these many and varied service projects. I calculated all the service hours I was requiring my students to perform and felt a surge of vicarious self-satisfaction while I remained at arm's length from the needy who were being served. More recently, however, the Savior's stinging words to the scribes and Pharisees have rung in my ears: "These ought ye to have done, and not to leave the other undone" (Matthew 23:23). The fact that I was facilitating the service of others did not excuse me from doing more service on my own. My spiritual diet required more than vicarious service experiences. I personally needed to heed King Benjamin's council: "When ye are in the service of your fellow beings ye are only in the service of your God" (Mosiah 2:17). I needed to launch my own service and learning project. Figuratively, I needed to leave by the revolving door.<br><br>What is interesting about standing in the Marriott Center at this moment in time is that it affords me an opportunity to provide an interim report on my current service and learning project. You see, I am on professional development leave from the university, trying to apply what I have learned over the course of an academic career that spans nearly 20 years to the development of the pharmaceutical industry in central and eastern Europe. By way of introduction, I can say that the process has evolved much like the Savior's growth and development described in section 93 of the Doctrine and Covenants: "And he [the Savior] received not of the fulness at first, but continued from grace to grace, until he received a fulness" (verse 13).<br><br>The words<i>grace to grace</i>are important to highlight. I count each insight from each service experience for what it is--a saving grace, a redeeming grace, an amazing grace. My process, however, unlike the Savior's, has neither been planned nor intentional, at least the way I have experienced it. Perhaps it is described best by the French word<i>tatonne,</i>which means "finding one's way."<br><br>What have I learned so far along the way? First, I have learned as described in Matthew 25 that I have been given talents. These are not my talents because they are God-given. I have stewardship over them, but I am also expected to expand them and I will be held accountable for what I do with them. If I am unwise, eventually they will be taken from me. Second, I have learned that the best way to expand my talents is to use them. This may sound like common sense, but it is amazing to me how easy it is for me to treat my talents like precious objects--I may not bury them, but I would much rather display them or talk about them than actually use them. Third, I have learned the answer to the piercing question the people posed to John the Baptist: "What shall we do then?" (Luke 3:10). We should serve God by serving our brothers and sisters. The divine derivative of the parable of the talents is the statement "Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me" (Matthew 25:40). Finally, I have learned that some of the best service is accomplished as a team effort. Leverage is created by combining my talents with the talents and resources of others.<br><br>I received a telephone call in March from a representative of Merck &amp;amp; Company, the large pharmaceutical firm. For those of you who have not heard of Merck, it is a remarkable company. In fact, for six consecutive years during the late 1980s and early 1990s it was rated the number one company in America by<i>Fortune</i>magazine. I was asked by this company representative whether I would like to be involved in a major project in the IDEA (International Development of Eurasia) region of Merck. I expressed both hesitation and interest, and we decided that I should visit Whitehouse Station, New Jersey--the location of Merck's corporate headquarters--to explore further whether our interests meshed.<br><br>I spent my first day with Merck making the rounds, being interviewed by anyone who had any connection with the IDEA region. I was briefed and rebriefed about the unique challenges faced by Merck in central and eastern Europe. My final interview was with the president of the region, a Merck vice president named Bernard Brigonnet. Mr. Brigonnet and I started our conversation cautiously, but we quickly became absorbed in a delightful dialogue. At the conclusion of our time together, and somewhat to my surprise, he offered me a job. He wanted me to work with an internal team to develop the strategy and organization design for Merck's operations in the region through 2005.<br><br>So far, the way I have described it, this sounds more like a business decision than a service decision, and under normal circumstances that would be the case, but there is nothing normal about central and eastern Europe. You see, the success of any multinational pharmaceutical company in central and eastern Europe must be preceded by a prolonged investment period. Unfortunately, most multinational pharmaceutical companies take the low road and use bribes and other forms of under-the-table payments to secure a presence in the region. Merck's ethical standards are intolerant of any form of unethical business practices, whether or not they fit with local customs, so Merck's approach is to invest in building the pharmaceutical and health-care industry in each country in which it operates. This is where significant "private" service is rendered.<br><br>Let me share with you just a few private service initiatives that Merck has taken in the IDEA region.<br><br><i>Medical study centers.</i>Establishing medical study centers is an initiative that began in Hungary and spread to all but a few countries in the region. Merck negotiates with local government officials for space, usually near the entrance of major research universities, to create medical study centers. The centers become gathering places for local physicians to come and learn the latest information about new medical practices. Merck equips each center with a very good medical library, medical journals, instructional video- and audiocassettes, and access to MedLine. The centers regularly sponsor lectures featuring local opinion leaders who share their most recent research findings.<br><br><i>Donations.</i>Another private service initiative involves donations. Last April, Merck contributed $400,000 to improve intensive-care pediatric services for children in St. Petersburg, Russia. The donations support training of St. Petersburg pediatricians, nurses, and technicians at Georgetown University Medical Center. They, in turn, will train their Russian colleagues to combat epidemic diseases such as diphtheria, dysentery, and scarlet fever that are infecting alarmingly large numbers of Russian children. (Information drawn from an article entitled "MSD Russia Contributes $400,000 to Improve Russia's Intensive Care Services for Children," which appeared in<i>The Daily,</i>Merck's in-house employee newsletter, on April 11, 1996.)<br><br><i>Scientific associates.</i>Further private service initiatives are accomplished by Merck's scientific associates. Merck does not field a traditional sales force in the IDEA region. Most of the salespeople hired by the company are physicians who are hired as scientific associates, not as direct sales representatives. In addition to gaining the commitment of practicing doctors to prescribe Merck's drugs, scientific associates spend a great deal of time face-to-face with either individual doctors or groups of doctors sharing the latest in medical information. In a recent questionnaire developed to understand perceptions and attitudes of employees in the region, there was nearly universal agreement with the statement "Merck should always invest heavily in providing educational support for physicians." Please understand that underlying this nontraditional approach to sales are some inherent costs. Scientific associates, unlike direct sales representatives, are somewhat uncomfortable driving hard to make a sale. Moreover, the time they spend educating practicing doctors significantly reduces the number of contacts they can make each day. Of course, one of the compensating features of Merck's nontraditional approach is each scientific associate's sense that he or she is providing a service to the local health-care community. Their motivation is increased because their activities are perceived as more significant than merely transacting a sale.<br><br>Now imagine for a moment that you are a Polish doctor or a Russian child living in St. Petersburg who has been directly affected by one of Merck's private service initiatives. What image would you have of American business? You would probably see the visible hand of capitalism providing a service to you and your country that would not otherwise be provided, and you would feel grateful. You would experience firsthand the blessings of private service.<br><br>What is interesting about these private service initiatives is that in the end they translate into good business results. Merck's reputation is enhanced across the IDEA region, strengthening its ability to influence health-care policy makers, hire the best people, and market and sell products. Private service, while an indirect approach, leads to positive, real, and direct business results.<br><br>As an aside, it is interesting to note that Merck's experience with expansion into new areas of the world is similar to that of the worldwide Church. Although the core mission of the Church as it spreads throughout the world is to bring all people to Christ through the threefold purpose of proclaiming the gospel, perfecting the Saints, and redeeming the dead, we have sometimes taken a more indirect approach to that ultimate end. For example, mission presidents have encouraged missionaries to become more involved in lending community service in areas in which the Church is still unestablished and struggling. The Church's manifold humanitarian service efforts also involve a more indirect approach. We seem to acknowledge through these activities that though the ultimate service we can provide is the knowledge of the true and restored Church, initially, at least, we need to establish the reputation of the Church and prepare people to receive the gospel. The Japanese have a word to describe this activity:<i>nemawashi,</i>which literally means "preparing the ground for planting." Both the Church and Merck are very sophisticated practitioners of nemawashi.<br><br>I would be guilty of oversimplification if I left anyone with the impression that the decision by any business, including Merck, to provide private service is without conflict. It is not always easy to resolve the goals of business and society. Although businesses can be charitable, they are not charities. Most businesses that even approach the size of Merck are publicly held, which means they are owned by stockholders. Managers, while often major stockholders themselves, are agents of the owners of the company; therefore, they are expected to make decisions consistent with the long-term interests of stockholders. If stockholders do not receive expected returns on their investments, they are likely to withdraw their money and invest it elsewhere. This, of course, lowers the stock price and can seriously limit a company's access to capital. So the point is that no matter what a company does, it must keep its stockholders happy to ensure long-term viability.<br><br>The so-called pressures of Wall Street create some sizeable speed bumps for Merck on the road to providing private service. One of the major problems involves decisions about how to price Merck's drugs in the region. Although it might be easy to say that the only honorable thing that Merck can do is make its drugs affordable to people in the IDEA region, this issue is far from clear-cut. For example, if Merck sells its drugs for a significantly lower price in Latvia, it is likely that the lower-priced drugs will find their way into nearby Scandinavia. These problems with parallel trade argue compellingly for a globally consistent pricing strategy. Once we settle on the logic of a global pricing strategy, however, we are hit in the face by the hard reality that the cost of a monthly supply of a lifesaving drug like Tienam (a powerful antibiotic marketed as Primaxim in the U.S.) may cost three times the average monthly income of a patient who needs it in Kiev, Ukraine. Moreover, in the Ukraine there is no government reimbursement or private insurance system currently in place. So what is the moral and ethical thing to do? Fortunately, in the Ukraine, family and community values provide a social safety net. If a Ukrainian doctor prescribes Tienam for one of his or her patients and he or she cannot afford it, extended family members will typically step in and pay for the prescription. If the extended family does not have adequate resources, then it is appropriate to appeal to friends and neighbors, who will lend money without terms, meaning they neither require interest be paid on the loan nor do they stipulate when the loan should be repaid.<br><br>Just because a company is motivated by economic goals does not exclude it from providing private service. When I participated on BYU's Service and Learning Committee, some members of the committee took the position that any activity for which a student was paid was not service. I defended a broader definition of service than is normally applied to so-called volunteer and community service. My point was that service can be provided in many ways. For individuals, groups, and organizations, the more important question is whether they possess an attitude of service--not the questions that foster precise and limiting definitions of what is and is not service.<br><br>Returning to Merck, a scientific associate is paid a salary to gain the commitment of physicians to prescribe Merck's drugs, but it is his or her attitude of service as well as encouragement and support from Merck's management that leads him or her to linger longer to educate a doctor about new advances in cardiovascular system treatments. Indeed, these extra-role behaviors are examples of private service because they are motivated by an attitude of service.<br><br>Although it might be easy for someone to feel content with the role he or she plays in private organizational service, none of us are excused from individual service. The logic of individual service is the same as the logic of private organizational service--we discover what someone needs, then respond to that need using the resources and talents we possess. We should avoid the trap of believing that because the service we provide as an individual is less grand than the service provided by large institutions, it is de facto less important. When Steve Jobs, the cofounder of Apple Computer, created his vision of the personal computer, he imagined that one thousand people working on one thousand $1,000 computers could accomplish more than a person on a single million-dollar computer. And so it is with service. If a lot of us do a little, even if we have limited time and resources, it adds up to a lot. The descriptions of what ordinary, everyday individuals do to serve others may sound quite ordinary and everyday until we start doing the addition and multiplication. John the Baptist's answer to the people who asked him "What shall we do then?" (Luke 3:10) was to do a little, but to definitely do something. A more specific answer would be to provide as much individual service as our individual resources and talents allow.<br><br>One of my most rewarding experiences in central and eastern Europe involved a Sunday I spent with the branch president of the Ljubljana Slovenia Branch of the Church. He was an inspired leader but also a young, mostly inexperienced leader in the Church. What he wanted most was better training about the priesthood and Church leadership, which I tried to provide. I mostly listened, of course, because I needed to understand the intricate and unique circumstances he faced to be helpful, to provide the needed service. He also pleaded for a radio-wave translation system for their branch building, something I worked to facilitate after I returned home.<br><br>One of my goals for the next year is to expand my individual service offerings. A need that has been expressed to me several times by people in central and eastern Europe is the need to receive better management education. In areas where I am not an expert, I am gathering basic books and textbooks to distribute in the region. I also intend to offer lectures at local universities about my two areas of specialty: business strategy and organizational behavior. It may appear on the surface that capital investment is the most glaring need of the countries of central and eastern Europe, but a need of equal and complementary importance is the need for education. This is service I can provide, want to provide, and should provide.<br><br>On August 19, 1983, Dr. Hugh Nibley delivered a commencement address at BYU titled "Leaders and Managers," and believe me when I say it was a rather intense rebuke of business and management. In spite of the fact that Dr. Nibley called everyone associated with the School of Management to repentance, I probably agreed more than disagreed with most of what he said. However, I did disagree with one critical point of definition. I believe that Dr. Nibley was speaking more about the distinction between good and bad leadership than the distinction between leadership and management. Dr. Nibley spent a great deal of time recounting the classic struggle between Moroni and Amalickiah detailed in chapters 46 through 51 of Alma. If Professor John Kotter of the Harvard Business School is right when he defines management as dealing with complexity and leadership as dealing with change, then Moroni and Amalickiah were acting as leaders more than as managers (John P. Kotter, "What Leaders Really Do,"<i>Harvard Business Review,</i>May/June 1990, p. 104). The undeniable commonality between Moroni and Amalickiah is they were both skilled agents of change. The major differences between these two very different men were their respective motives. From Alma 48, verses 12 and 13, we read that Moroni was<i>a man who did labor exceedingly for the welfare and safety of his people.</i><br><br><i>Yea, and he was a man who was firm in the faith of Christ, and he had sworn with an oath to defend his people, his rights, and his country, and his religion, even to the loss of his blood.</i><br><br>On the other hand, and in Dr. Nibley's own words, Amalickiah's only "object in life was to become king of both the Nephites and Lamanites, using the one to subdue the other" ("Leaders and Managers,"<i>Brigham Young University 1982–83 Fireside and Devotional Speeches</i>[Provo: BYU, 1983], p. 188; also<i>Classic Speeches,</i>vol. 1 [Provo: BYU, 1994], p. 191). In other words, the changes promoted by Amalickiah were designed to increase his influence and power over as many people as possible, whereas the changes promoted by Moroni were designed to ensure the freedom and liberty of his people. The "bad" leader served only himself, but the "good" leader served both God and his people.<br><br>The topic of leadership is important to the practice of private service because effective leaders are the standard setters in their organizations. If their actions reflect an attitude of service, their subordinates are likely to follow suit. Their efforts to give individual service can be leveraged into a whole organization providing private service. These service multipliers are every bit as important as the economic multipliers of which macroeconomists speak and write. In the worldview promoted at this university, perhaps they are more important. As the leaders of the future, I hope all of you will set the standard; what is distinctive about you and what others will try to emulate will be your attitudes of service.<br><br>I began with the story of my experience at Yale University in the late 1970s and early 1980s and my observations about Dean Bill Donaldson's sense of betrayal and failure because he believed that work in the public sector was somehow more noble than work in the private sector. I believe his view was both inaccurate and incomplete. There are no boundaries marking where we can and cannot serve, because service is an attitude that we can take with us anywhere and everywhere we go. Just as there is public service, there is private service.<br><br>I know that through service we can expand our talents by using them. I also know that what James said is true: "Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this, To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep himself unspotted from the world" (James 1:27). I know that central to the teachings of the gospel is the second great commandment: After we love our God with all our heart, soul, and mind, we should love our neighbor as ourself (see Matthew 22:37–39).<br><br>I know that the Book of Mormon is true and that it teaches of Christ, our exemplar of a perfect servant leader. I know that Joseph Smith was a true prophet and that all the prophets of this dispensation, even our current prophet, President Gordon B. Hinckley, have emulated the Savior's example of service. May we follow his and their examples of service so that we, too, may be counted as "good and faithful" servants (see Matthew 25:14–30) is my humble prayer, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Lee Tom Perry was a BYU professor of strategy and organizational behavior when this devotional was given on 1 October 1996.</i><br><br><i>© Brigham Young University.

<br>
I am honored to be with you this morning. As this sesquicentennial year draws to a close, I would like to reflect upon the legacy left by a special set of pioneers who are perhaps not well known. These pioneers, my ancestors, experienced the trials of the trek westward, converted to the Church, and left a noble heritage but left us little to understand their everyday feelings and experiences. Still, they left a great legacy, even though my first acquaintance with them occurred as I helped my parents copy the pages of pedigree charts for our family.<br><br>Mary A. Johnson wrote:<br><br><i>I've always known your names<br>But,<br>You were flat people on a white page<br>Until<br>I read your stories.<br>Now you are more than names<br>And<br>I know that your blood flows also in<br>My veins.</i><br>[Excerpt from a poem by Mary A. Johnson, quoted in Sarah Jane Cannon, "Pioneers Exemplify Faith, Courage,"<i>Church News,</i>22 July 1995, p. 5]<br><br>For each of us here today, the path to Utah is marked with special events. For some the story is recent, whereas for others those events are recorded in the memories of our families. My father, whose parents emigrated from Yugoslavia to the now-dormant logging town of Bridal Veil, Oregon, used to chide my mother for following an ancestry of her people that she hoped to trace to the Mayflower. My father's rhetoric was silenced when Mother discovered the migration of the 19-year-old Puritan Jonas Westover to a Pilgrim colony in the Massachusetts Bay area in 1647. It was the desire for freedom to worship God according to the dictates of his own mind that precipitated his departure from a Dutch port where his family had worked to reform the Church of England, in opposition to the British Crown. For well over a century the Westovers meandered the plains and hills of Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Vermont. The end of the American War of Independence opened opportunities for migration to the west at a time when heavy frost and drought forced many from New England.<br><br>Charles Westover was born in Ohio during the fall of 1827. His father died in Ohio during the spring of 1834, but shortly before his death he described a dream in which he saw people being baptized by immersion in something that resembled a "tan vat." This dream would later have dearer meaning for Charles. After the death of his father, young Charles lived with many different families. At times he was ill-treated, and he never seemed to really fit in.<br><br>Charles heard about the events that surrounded the rise of the LDS Church in Ohio and became prejudiced against it, even though his aunt and cousin had been baptized. Finally, two elders (Goodale and Howe) arrived and left the message of the restored gospel. Although Charles' prejudices vanished at that time, he did not commit to baptism. He recorded:<br><br><i>The house was jammed full. Such a sermon as we heard that night I never heard before. That night with all my prejudices, I was converted to the truth of Mormonism. I tell you all who read this sketch that Elder</i>[Goodale]<i>was most powerful and that he was filled of the Holy Spirit. His words pierced you through and through.</i>[Charles Westover, Pinto Ward Membership Records]<br><br>Charles was intrigued by what he had heard. The occasion arose for Charles to attend a conference of the Saints only 15 miles north. Again he wrote about the special feeling that attended that conference. A few months later young Charles accompanied his mother and his brother's family to Council Bluffs on the Missouri River. From there he ferried across the river to Winter Quarters. He tried without success to find Elder Goodale. Discouraged, without money, and 1,000 miles from home, he wandered out to the graveyard, where there were buried more than 600 people from the areas where the Saints camped.<br><br>Then, though Charles had still not been baptized, Brother Erastus Snow engaged him to drive one of his wagons across the plains. This must have been an exciting moment for a rough young man whose independence had caused him so much trouble in the past. He noted, "It was a beautiful team to drive--a yoke of large stags on the tongue, a yoke of cows and a yoke of yearling heifers on the lead" (Charles Westover, "A Short History of My Life," family archives).<br><br>A few days later, while camped at the Elkhorn River waiting for the arrival of President Brigham Young's company, Charles' eye caught sight of a lovely young lady--Eliza Ann Haven. Eliza's roots were also in Massachusetts, where she had been born on May 15, 1829. I have asked my mother to read a part of the letter Eliza wrote to her son, since my mother and Eliza knew each other and together their lives span the history of the Church from the time of the restoration of the Aaronic priesthood by John the Baptist to the present day.<br><br><i>The first Mormon Elders that I saw, I was eight years old, were President Brigham Young and Willard C. Richards. ... In 1838 my father and mother joined the Church. In 1841 we left our native home for Nauvoo. Arrived there in May, traveling by canal, rail and steamboat. The first to greet us on landing were the Prophet Joseph Smith and Brigham Young. After shaking hands and bidding us welcome, Brother Joseph's first question: had we anyplace to go. ... Brother Joseph was a great lover of children. I never met him but I had a bow and one of his sweet smiles. Used to love to hear him preach although then I was but a child, he was always interesting.</i><br><br><i>We lived on the main street going East out of Nauvoo, less than a half mile from the temple. Seldom a week but Brother Joseph would go by, either horseback or in his family carriage with his family. He was a noble-looking man. ...</i><br><br><i>Brother Joseph, with the other brethren and heavy guard, rode past our house on their last ride. When word came that our Prophet and Patriarch were killed, what a gloom was over the city. Everyone was in tears. We were a flock of sheep without a shepherd. The question was a general one: What shall we do without a Prophet?</i><br><br><i>I was then 15 years old and I felt so sad. I was to</i>[the]<i>meeting when Sidney Rigdon declared himself our true prophet and leader. Very few responded to the call, I am happy to say none of my father's family felt that he was. Soon after Brother Brigham came home from the East where he was on a mission. I was to</i>[the]<i>meeting he said he was our Prophet and Seer. When he spoke it was in Brother Joseph's voice. I gave a jump of</i>[f]<i>my seat and said, "our Prophet Joseph has come to life, we have our Prophet back!" I looked up and there stood Brother Joseph just as slim as I ever saw him when alive. For a minute I heard Br. Joseph's voice and saw his features then a mist seemed to pass from Brighams face and go up. Then there stood Brother Brigham talking to us. Hundreds saw the same thing I did, but not all that were present. I forgot to tell you. I saw Brothers Joseph and Hyrum after they were in their coffins, the cruel bullet hole in Brother Hyrum's head. It was a sad day for the saints in Nauvoo.</i><br><br><i>After that, all seemed at peace for a short while, but our enemies found out they had not killed Mormonism by killing our Prophet. The temple was built through much persecution (dedicated) so the saints could receive their endowments. Father's family, myself included, received our endowments there. Persecution continued. Father sold his home and we left Nauvoo before the big battle. ...</i><br><br><i>In the Spring of 1848 we left for Winter quarters, the general gathering place for the saints, then started for Salt Lake City in President Brigham Young's company, a large one. I had a very pleasant time. I was young. No cares. Father had a team of two yoke of oxen and two cows in the company so we had milk along the way. It was on the plains I first met your father.</i>[Eliza Ann Haven Westover, letter to her son Lewis, 2 July 1916, Church Archives; copy in possession of the author]<br><br>Although the family journals do not record much of the final exodus of the Saints to the Salt Lake Valley, it was begun in the spring with the goal to reach their destination before the winter months set in. Charles was assigned guard duty once every six or seven days. They observed hundreds of buffalo on the slope of the river going to drink. They had dancing and music, for the Nauvoo brass band was in the company. We read from the previous journey that the travel across Iowa was slowed by the heavy spring rains that made the trail a path of mud. Brigham noted that one day they only had one mud hole to contend with, but it was six miles long. It must have been similar on this trek. Charles was baptized on May 17, 1848.<br><br>Eliza and Charles were sealed for time and eternity as husband and wife in the home of apostle Erastus Snow on October 14, 1849, by President Brigham Young. Family tradition has it that they were the first couple to be married in Utah, but the late date of this sealing makes that unlikely.<br><br>Why is this legacy of our forefathers so important? I am reminded of the words of Alma:<br><br><i>And behold, he preached the word unto your fathers, and a mighty change was also wrought in their hearts, and they humbled themselves and put their trust in the true and living God. And behold, they were faithful until the end; therefore they were saved.</i><br><br><i>And now behold, I ask of you, my brethren of the church, have ye spiritually been born of God? Have ye received his image in your countenances? Have ye experienced this mighty change in your hearts?</i><br><br><i>Do ye exercise faith in the redemption of him who created you? Do you look forward with an eye of faith, and view this mortal body raised in immortality, and this corruption raised in incorruption, to stand before God to be judged according to the deeds which have been done in the mortal body?</i>[Alma 5:13–15]<br><br>My heritage from my father differs from that of my mother in several respects. First, my father was a convert to the Church. Second, his family ostracized him for his choice to accept the gospel. My paternal grandparents emigrated from Yugoslavia to this country at the beginning of this century.<br><br>I recoil at the horror of the recent events in that country. When I asked my grandmother about our ancestors, she would never distinguish Croatian from Serbian--she insisted she was Yugoslavian. My grandmother often talked to me about honesty and integrity. Only once can I remember that she talked to me about the Old Country, when she reminisced about the difficult times when food was scarce and her blonde sister had starved to death. Integrity, honor, and character were paramount in her expectations for her family.<br><br>My first given name is Douglas. As a young man I was taught by my father about love of this country, honor, and duty. He was at times a stern man, but he deeply loved his children. From his example I inferred that my name was chosen because of the distinction that General Douglas MacArthur had brought to this country. I carried that belief through most of my life. As I was preparing for this talk, however, I thought I would verify this fact with my mother. She informed me that my name was chosen to remind me of her Scottish ancestry. (She might have envisioned Douglas Fairbanks as an exemplar.) I have been proud to carry the name of my father as my middle name. Honoring the names we have been given is something I believe to be important.<br><br>The commandment "Honour thy father and thy mother: that thy days may be long upon the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee" (Exodus 20:12) caused me to want to do something of significance to honor the heritage I received. As I attended college, I sought for something I could do that would make a contribution to mankind. I would like to challenge each of you to set a goal to make a significant contribution during your life.<br><br>Each one of you is faced with the issues of choosing direction in life. You have the benefit and help of your Heavenly Father in verifying the choice of an eternal companion and a major area of study. The most important thing in life is to center upon the salvation available to each of us through the redemption of Jesus Christ.<br><br>A few years ago a young man who was an electrical engineering student at BYU came to my office. He was tense, perplexed, and struggling to find the answer to his prayer about the future. He wanted some help. He had several job offers and had made a list of the pros and cons of each. We talked about the manner in which one is able to receive an answer to prayer--that is, praying with an honest heart, believing that you will receive an answer, and having faith. We talked about studying the matter.<br><br>After a long discussion he concluded that he should accept the job offer with AT&amp;amp;T Bell Labs. His supervisor would be a bishop, and he saw a bright future. He was still tense but left saying that he was going home to call AT&amp;amp;T. The next day I saw him coming down the hallway. The spring was back in his step, the tension was gone, and a broad smile graced his lips. He called to me from down the hall, "Brother Chabries, I did what you said. I went home and called Hewlett Packard and accepted their job."<br><br>He had never brought up Hewlett Packard, but this was the answer to his prayer. I thought to myself that he had only superb choices, but once he made his decision the Lord confirmed his selection. For each of you, making the choice of something significant you can do with your life may produce a similar experience.<br><br>As I continued to wonder how I might repay my heritage, I had the chance to observe several modern-day pioneers, three of them Nobel Prize winners in physics. One of these prize winners abandoned the things that had won him acclaim and started a dubious campaign on social issues. Another switched from the field that had netted him the Nobel Prize into the area of neural networks, seeking to find ways to capitalize on this emerging new field. The third used his talent and ability to provide a superb course in introductory physics for undergraduates. He wrote a series of texts to cover the material. The nature of this man's classes was such that upon leaving school on the West Coast, I arrived on the East Coast to find that there was a weeklong showing of his lectures. I was most impressed with the service of the latter prize winner, but as I reviewed the work and contributions of all three, I felt that there was something missing.<br><br>Then I recalled people I had met just a few years previously in the mission field. One was James C. Christensen, who is a member of the Visual Arts Department at BYU. At the age of 20 I had observed his musical performance talents in the mission field and was certain that he would use them to bless many people. I bought one of his earliest works. Unfortunately for me, my investment was a recording, and I later came to find that his talent as a performing artist was second to his imaginative art. He stayed close to his Heavenly Father. Another missionary hero was Noel B. Reynolds. He chose to make a lifelong study of the Book of Mormon his contribution. He has served as a bishop and a stake president and is the president of the Foundation for Ancient Research and Mormon Studies. Then I reflected on Elder Gene R. Cook. You are all aware of the example of his life and service as a General Authority of the Church.<br><br>As I pondered on these things, I sought to find something I might do to make this stay in mortality a little more pleasant for my fellowman and yet keep focused on the primary reason for being on this earth. As I finished my education and accepted a civilian research position with the United States Navy, I decided to use my recently acquired knowledge of sound to assist in restoring hearing for the hearing-impaired. Along the way I had some interesting experiences.<br><br>The navy had experienced difficulties with the safety of newly installed equipment on its systems. These difficulties had at times threatened their lives. You may recall that the air force has had similar problems of late with some of their aircraft. The navy pondered what additional safety precautions were necessary and concluded that there was a simple solution. The civilian designers and manufacturers of the new systems would be required to test them. This is similar to the old approach used by ancient kings who employed tasters to shield them against the possibility of poison in their food. I was elected for this honor by my group to test a new computer system designed to enhance the capability of sonar to respond to underwater sounds.<br><br>I took the equipment and flew to the East Coast to board a ship known as a destroyer escort. It was named the USS<i>Connole.</i>On each ship was a plaque that gave the traditions and heroism of those who had contributed to its name--in other words, the heritage for the current crew. Names are important, even on U.S. Navy ships. As I boarded, I was asked to give my name, social security number, and next of kin. I was somewhat sobered by the last question. This was not an experience I looked forward to, but my colleagues and I proceeded to install the computers, hoping to improve the sonar system's sensitivity.<br><br>Our ship left port and joined a task force of several ships and submarines, and we got underway. After the first day I arose and went out on deck. Everything was calm. I had never observed such a smooth ocean surface before. I felt fine, with no trace of seasickness. As the day wore on, though, the sea became more troubled, the waves increasing in height to nearly five feet. When the ship hit the waves head-on, there was little undulation of the ship and I could keep my seasickness under control. But as more waves began to hit from the side, the ship tossed to and fro. (In life we tend to believe it is easier to confront problems head-on, but it often occurs that problems come from directions we least expect.) I went to my room and lay in bed, bracing myself between the wall and the side rails on the bed.<br><br>Then I noticed that the ship seemed to calm down even though the sea remained rough. I was informed that the ship had just actuated some small stabilizers that protruded from the hull to lessen the roll of the ship. Similarly, as we navigate through life, the gospel of Jesus Christ provides just such stability in our lives. Without it we find ourselves spiritually seasick.<br><br>I then observed another phenomena. The propeller and shaft of the ship were made of different metals than the hull. This creates a voltaic effect, giving rise to electrical currents that corrode the hull and shaft. To counteract this corrosion an opposing voltage is applied to the hull to cancel this current. So, too, do we need constant protection available through prayer to prevent spiritual erosion. Prayer keeps us intact spiritually.<br><br>As the cruise continued, I went to the sonar shack to talk with the operators. I was anxious that the test of our new system go well. I found the sonar crew relaxed and talking about the upcoming meal and about returning home after the cruise. There was no stress. Spirits were high.<br><br>Nevertheless, it was not unusual for Russian trawlers and occasionally Russian submarines to silently appear during tests of new systems. Whenever there was a task force of several ships present, this likelihood increased. But we were at peace, and there was no threat. Further, the task force was moving at moderate speed. Between the noise of the waves and the sound of the ship thrashing through the water, it would be difficult for a surface ship to hear an enemy submarine anyway. The sonar men took advantage of the calm situation, knowing that not much was expected of them.<br><br>Suddenly there was a loud alert on the ship's public address system. It was the captain. He announced, "Attention, all hands! The sonar shack has just detected a Russian submarine. I have contacted the commander and requested permission to break from the task force and head in pursuit of the submarine. Permission has been granted. Man your stations!"<br><br>The mood in the sonar shack changed immediately. Had the captain misunderstood that we did not have any contact, or did he have a hunch that there must be an enemy submarine nearby? The sonar crew snapped into operation. Suddenly they began to look intently at the sonar displays they had previously only glanced at. This was the real test for the newly sensitized sonar system. Then, after a few moments, one of the sonar men called out, "I have a contact." The ship set out in pursuit, joined by other members of the task force, several transmitting loud bursts of sound at the enemy submarine. Sound blast after sound blast was transmitted to cloak our own submarines' sound signatures and chase off the enemy submarine. Again, comparing this situation to life, we are often called upon without warning to answer unexpected challenges. Being prepared in advance is the surest guarantee that we will be successful.<br><br>Having completed the testing of the sonar equipment in a fashion more adventurous than I had planned, I asked if there was some way to leave the ship and get home early. Not only were the waves of the sea continuing to worsen, but also a hurricane was forecast. The lieutenant commander assigned to watch out for me informed me that a helicopter was coming, and I could go home on it. We were about 200 miles out at sea, however, and this was near its maximum operating range.<br><br>As the helicopter arrived and hovered over the rear deck, the ship turned into the wind, cutting off the breeze to it. The helicopter dipped, then caught the deck, and crashed. That day I found that, just as in life, we often look for the easy way out, but we may have to stay the course. The trip home was rough, and when the ship finally arrived home in Norfolk, Virginia, I was relieved to be back on solid ground.<br><br>Time after time since this voyage, as I have struggled through life's trials, I have been greatly comforted by the knowledge that Jesus Christ is our Savior--the enabler of our postmortal existence and the great stabilizing force in our lives when we are hit by life's vagaries. Prayer provides the daily protection to help us remain spiritually intact and maintain our course, our direction made certain.<br><br>Setting a goal to accomplish something significant for our fellowman provides a legacy for future generations. It adds spice to this mortal existence. It allows us to dot our mortal path with beautiful flowers and sweet fragrances. It becomes a way to repay the heritage we have received and provide a legacy for future generations. I hope that my own efforts and those of my colleagues will reach fruition in a few months in the form of a computer so miniaturized that it will fit deeply within the ear canal and that it will benefit the hard-of-hearing. In this effort the knowledge, support, and assistance of many others along the way has been essential. But whether this project is successful or not, the journey has been exciting.<br><br>Finally, I would like to share with you one last example of a modern pioneer. David C. Evans was born in 1924. It was when he had briefly slipped out of Sunday School that he learned of the bombing of Pearl Harbor. He served his country in the United States Army on the European front. He became a respected educator and joined the faculty at the University of California at Berkeley and later at the University of Utah. His students have become modern leaders in the computer industry, including Alan Ashton of WordPerfect, Edwin Catmul of Pixar, Nolan Bushnell of Atari, John Warnock of Adobe, and James Clark of Silicon Graphics and Netscape. Several others also credit him with the vision that launched them on the route to technical success.<br><br>Each of you can imagine the intense effort that is required to establish international leadership in the computer industry, where product capabilities change by factors of two at least every 18 months. David C. Evans made legendary contributions to mankind. During this period he served as branch president, counselor in two bishoprics, and counselor in a stake presidency. But the service that endears him to me as a hero is his service as a Scoutmaster for 27 years. Each of you would do well to note that you, too, can make a significant difference--but your eternal focus must be maintained.<br><br>I am grateful for the legacy left by our pioneer forefathers. I am grateful to my family and especially to my Uncle Paul Westover, who provided me with the extended history of our family that I was able to use today. I am grateful for the blessings of freedom, which freedom is necessary to achieve exaltation. I am grateful for modern examples of those who leave a modern legacy for each of us to enjoy. I extend to each of you a challenge to honor your heritage and to leave a legacy for the future. Do not set your sights too low. May the Lord bless you in this endeavor is my prayer in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Douglas M. Chabries was the dean of the BYU College of Engineering and Technology when this devotional address was given on 7 October 1997.</i><br><br><i>© Brigham Young University. All rights reserved.</i>

<h1>of God - Henry B. Eyring - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
One of the reasons I love to come to this campus is to see you, the young people of the Church. Invariably it seems to me that you look even better than you did the last time I was with you. Because I came today expecting that experience, I was reminded of an account written a number of years ago by General James Gavin. He was a young general in the American army during World War II. He commanded the 82nd Airborne Division. He led them in the invasion of Sicily. There were casualties there. He parachuted with them behind enemy lines during the invasions in France. They lost more men there. Then he led them in the bloody battles in Belgium when the Germans counterattacked, taking a terrible toll among his troops.<br><br>General Gavin's soldiers were given some well-earned leave. Some of them went to Paris. A general from another Allied army saw them there. Later, when he met General Gavin, he said that he had never seen better looking soldiers. General Gavin's laconic reply was that they ought to look good: they were the survivors.<br><br>You look good. You ought to look good, because you are the survivors. By making the right choices plus the help of uncounted servants of God, you have made it through a hail of spiritual bullets. There have been tens of thousands of casualties. You know some of them because they are your friends, your spirit brothers and your sisters. You are more than simply the survivors of that spiritual war. You are the future of the Church. God knows that. And so he now asks more of you than he has asked of those who were here before you, because the kingdom will need more. And Satan knows that you are the future of the Church, which gives me a solemn obligation to warn you of the hazards ahead and to describe how to survive them as you rise to the privileges God will give you.<br><br>I will speak today of one of the great things God asks of you and how you will deal with the spiritual hazard that always comes with it.<br><br>You are under mandate to pursue--not just while you are here, but throughout your lives--educational excellence. That is true for you as individual members of the Church and for this university as a community. And yet the Lord gives the warning of danger as he gives the charge. You remember the words from the Book of Mormon:<br><br><i>O that cunning plan of the evil one! O the vainness, and the frailties, and the foolishness of men! When they are learned they think they are wise, and they hearken not unto the counsel of God, for they set it aside, supposing they know of themselves, wherefore, their wisdom is foolishness and it profiteth them not. And they shall perish.</i>[2 Nephi 9:28]<br><br>You are to pursue educational excellence while avoiding pride, the great spiritual destroyer. Most people would question whether it is possible to pursue excellence in anything without feeling some measure of pride.<br><br>A professional basketball player in the National Basketball Association sat next to me on a plane just after President Benson gave a talk warning about pride. In general conference President Benson had said that there was no such thing as righteous pride. My seatmate hadn't heard the talk, so I told him about it and asked whether he could excel in the NBA down under the basket if he were stripped of all pride. His quiet answer was that he doubted that he could survive at all, let alone excel.<br><br>A Broadway star had a colorful way of expressing his opinion about the place of pride in his work. He had been hired to be the lead in a production of<i>Fiddler on the Roof</i>with a cast of college students. I was asked to give a prayer with the cast on opening night. The Broadway veteran, who had played the part hundreds of times, stood at the back of a ring of students gathered around me just before the curtain was to go up. He looked puzzled.<br><br>As I recall now, I prayed about the way you might have done. I pleaded with God that the members of the cast would be lifted above their natural abilities, that the stage equipment would function well, that the hearts of the audience would be softened, and that they would be touched. I can't remember much else of the prayer, but I can remember what happened just after I said "Amen."<br><br>The Broadway star jumped into the air, landed on the stage with the sound of an explosion coming from his heavy boots, slapped his hands to his sides, and then thrust them into the air and shouted, "Okay, now let's go for it!" If the audience heard his bellow, and I can't imagine that they didn't, they must have expected the cast to come charging through the curtain out into the audience bent on some kind of mayhem.<br><br>I can only assume that he was determined to counteract the terrible mistake he had just witnessed. The last thing on earth he wanted was to go on a stage with a bunch of amateur actors who had been infected with humility.<br><br>I will not tell you today how to pursue excellence and humility simultaneously in the NBA or on Broadway. In those settings, if you get there, you will have to find your own way.<br><br>But I will tell you that not only can you pursue educational excellence and humility at the same time to avoid spiritual danger but that the way to humility is also the doorway to educational excellence. The best antidote I know for pride also can produce in us the characteristics that lead to excellence in learning.<br><br>Let's start with the problem of pride. There is more than one antidote for it. Some of them don't take any action on our part. Life delivers them. Failure, illness, disaster, and losses of all kinds have a way of chipping away at pride. But they come in uneven doses. Too much can come at one time and crush us with discouragement or embitter us. Or the antidote can come too late, after pride has made us vulnerable to temptation.<br><br>There is a better way. There is something we can choose to do in our daily life that will provide a constant protection against pride. It is simply to remember who God is and what it means to be his child. That is what we covenant to do each time we take the sacrament, promising always to remember the Savior. Because of what has been revealed to us about the plan of salvation, remembering him can produce the humility that will be our protection. And then, as we will see later, that same choice to remember him will in time produce in us greater power to learn both what we need to know for living in this world and in the life to come.<br><br>Remembering the Savior produces humility this way: Because we are blessed by revelation from prophets in this dispensation, we see his part in the plan of salvation, and from that we come to know both our loving Heavenly Father and what it means to be his spirit child.<br><br>When we remember the Savior we see him as the creator of all things, about which the wisest of us knows so little. We remember our dependence on his sacrifice when we think of the fall of man and of our own sins. We remember his unfailing love for us and his arms extended in invitation to us when we think of the little we understand of what he did to atone for our sins. We remember that we will only come again to our Heavenly Father to live forever in families by obeying his commandments and having the Holy Ghost to guide us. And we remember his example of complete submission to the will of his Father and our Father.<br><br>Those memories, if we choose to invite them, can produce a powerful blend of courage and meekness. No problem is too hard for us with his help. No price is too great to pay for what he offers us. And still in our greatest successes we feel as little children. And in our greatest sacrifices we still feel in his debt, wanting to give more. That is a humility which is energizing, not enervating. We can choose that shield as a protection against pride. And when we make that choice, to remember him, we are at the same time choosing to do what can lead us to acquire the characteristics of great learners.<br><br>That view of what it means to be a child of God, if we choose to act on it as reality, will lead us to do what great learners do. Those habits are not unique to those who understand and have faith in the revelations of God. The principles of learning work the same for all people, whether or not they know and believe in the plan of salvation. But we have an advantage. We can remember the Savior, think again of what the revelations tell us about who we are, and then we can choose to act on that reality. That will make us better learners. And by making those choices together, we can forge a learning community.<br><br>I'll talk about just a few of those habits of great learners. In each instance you will recognize them. You have known great scholars and observed them carefully. There are some common patterns in what they do. And each of those habits will be strengthened by acting in our daily life on our faith that the plan of salvation is a description of reality.<br><br>The first characteristic behavior is to welcome correction. You've noticed that in the people around you who seem to be learning most. You see that in your fellow students, for instance, who value wise editing of their writing. If they seek that correction, study it when they get it, and then revise what they have written, they become better writers. In the same way the scientists who submit their work to be reviewed by those who understand their methods and their research findings make the most rapid progress.<br><br>I have to insert something here. There must be one mathematics major sitting here who knows history and who may say, "But, Brother Eyring, there was a famous mathematician, and after his death it was found that he had never shared some of his best work with anyone."<br><br>My response is that there would have been more if he had shared it. The desire to receive wise correction is a hallmark of a learner and of a community of learners. That is why you can appreciate getting back one of your papers when it is covered with jottings in red ink. The wise learner cares more for the jottings than for the grade at the top of the page. In the same way the wise student of a new language seeks not the tutor who praises whatever they say but one who won't let a mispronounced word or an error in conjugating a verb pass uncorrected.<br><br>That desire for correction, a mark of great learners, comes naturally to a Latter-day Saint who knows and values what it means to be a child of God. For him or her it begins with seeking frequent correction directly from our Heavenly Father. One of the most valuable forms of personal revelation can come before private prayer. It can come in the quiet contemplation of how we might have offended, disappointed, or displeased our Heavenly Father. The Spirit of Christ and the Holy Ghost will help us feel rebuke and at the same time the encouragement to repent. Then prayers asking for forgiveness become less general and the chance to have the Atonement work in our life becomes greater.<br><br>We have another advantage as Latter-day Saints. We know that a loving Father has allowed us to live in a time when Jesus Christ has called prophets and others to serve as judges in Israel. Because of that we listen to a prophet's voice or sit in counsel with a bishop with the hope that we will hear correction.<br><br>That is true because we know something of the nature of God and our own condition. There was a fall. There was a veil placed over our memories. We walk by faith. Because of our mortality, we all sin. We cannot return to our Father unless we repent and, by keeping covenants, are washed clean through the sacrifice of his Son. We know he has placed servants to offer us both his covenants and his correction. We see the giving and the taking of correction as priceless and sacred. That is at least one of the reasons why the Lord warned us to seek as our teachers only men and women who are inspired of him. And that is one of the reasons why this learning community welcomes prophets to lead it.<br><br>A second characteristic of great learners is that they keep commitments. Any community functions better when people in it keep their promises to live up to its accepted standards. But for a learner and for a community of learners, that keeping of commitments has special significance.<br><br>That is why we sometimes describe our fields of study as "disciplines." You've noticed as you studied in different fields that they have different rules. In physics there are some rules about how to decide to believe something is true. That is sometimes called the "scientific method." But when you move over into your course in engineering or in geology, you find yourself learning some slightly different rules. When you arrive in your history or your French literature class, you find yet another set of rules. And your accounting professor seems to be living in a very different world of many rules. You will someday, if you haven't yet, experience the turmoil of trying to learn in a discipline that is trying to agree on new rules but failing.<br><br>What all disciplines have in common is a search for rules and a commitment to them. And what all great learners have is a deep appreciation for finding better rules and a commitment to keeping them. That is why great learners are careful about what commitments they make and then keeping them.<br><br>The Latter-day Saints who see themselves in all they do as children of God take naturally to making and keeping commitments. The plan of salvation is marked by covenants. We promise to obey commandments. In return, God promises blessings in this life and for eternity. He is exact in what he requires, and he is perfect in keeping his word. Because he loves us and because the purpose of the plan is to become like him, he requires exactness of us. And the promises he makes to us always include the power to grow in our capacity to keep covenants. He makes it possible for us to know his rules. When we try with all our hearts to meet his standards, he gives us the companionship of the Holy Ghost. That in turn both increases our power to keep commitments and to discern what is good and true. And that is the power to learn, both in our temporal studies and in the learning we need for eternity.<br><br>There is a third characteristic you have seen in great learners. They work hard. Oh, think of President Hinckley! I've traveled with him, and I know something of this great learner and how hard he works. When people quit working they quit learning, which is one of the hazards of getting too much recognition early in a career and taking it too seriously.<br><br>You will notice that the learners who can sustain that power to work hard over a lifetime generally don't do it for grades or to make tenure in a university or for prizes in the world. Something else drives them. For some it may be an innate curiosity to see how things work.<br><br>For the child of God who has enough faith in the plan of salvation to treat it as reality, hard work is the only reasonable option. Life at its longest is short. What we do here determines the rest of our condition for eternity. God our Father has offered us everything he has and asks only that we give him all we have to give. That is an exchange so imbalanced in our favor that no effort would be too much and no hours too long in service to him, to the Savior, and to our Father's children. Hard work is the natural result of simply knowing and believing what it means to be a child of God.<br><br>That leads to the description of another characteristic of a great learner: great learners help other people. Every great learner I have ever met has helped me, or tried to help me, or clearly wished to help me. That could seem to you a paradox, since people trying hard to learn might justifiably be absorbed only in themselves and what they are trying to learn. Now I know the rebuke you might give me. I'll anticipate your correction. You would say, "Is that true of all great learners?"<br><br>I answer, "Of course not." There are renowned scholars who are selfish and even unkind to those they consider less gifted. You will meet them if you haven't yet. But those who learn most over long lives seem to have a generous view of others, both in what they can learn from other people and the capacity others have to learn. Those who can't suffer fools gladly become more foolish themselves. They have shut themselves off from what they can learn from others.<br><br>Those who learn best seem to see that everyone they meet knows something they don't and may have a capacity they don't have. Because of that you will find that the best learners make the best company.<br><br>That kindly and optimistic view of others comes naturally to the believing Latter-day Saint. Every person they will ever meet is a child of God--their brother or their sister in fact, not as a pleasant metaphor. Every person they meet, whatever their condition in this life, has been redeemed by the loving sacrifice of the Savior of the world. Every person who is accountable can exercise faith in Jesus Christ unto repentance, make and keep covenants, and qualify for eternal life, the life that God lives. Even those who are not accountable here will someday have that same potential.<br><br>With this as our reality, it is not hard to feel that the needs of those around us are as important as our own or that the most humble person has divine potential. Such thinking will lead not only to kindness and to generous appraisal of potential but to high expectations for each other. Sometimes the greatest kindness we could receive would be to have someone expect more from us than we do, because they see more clearly our divine heritage.<br><br>Here is one more characteristic: the great learner expects resistance and overcomes it. You remember from your early school days reading about the number of materials Thomas Edison tried in his search for a filament for an electric light bulb. The persistence he needed to work through failure after failure was an application of the rule of learning, not an exception to it.<br><br>That has been your experience as well. Some learning has been easy for you. But more often your enemy has been discouragement. You may try to avoid that by choosing to learn only what is easy for you, looking for the path of least resistance. But the great learner expects difficulty as part of learning and is determined to work through it.<br><br>That is a view common to believing Latter-day Saints. You may have been blessed by a mother as I was for whom the plan of salvation was reality. More than once I complained about some difficulty in my school days. Her answer, given in a matter-of-fact tone, was, "Hal, what else did you expect? Life is a test." Then she'd go off to something else and leave me to ponder. She knew that, because I understood the plan, her statement of the obvious would give me hope, not discouragement.<br><br>I knew and she knew that to have the blessings of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob we need to face and pass comparable tests. She knew and I knew that the greater the test, the greater the compliment from a loving Heavenly Father.<br><br>She died after a decade of suffering with cancer. At her funeral President Kimball said something like this: "Some of you may wonder what great sins Mildred committed to explain her having to endure such suffering. It had nothing to do with sin. It was that her Heavenly Father wanted to polish her a little more."<br><br>I remember as I sat there at the time wondering what trials might lay ahead for me if a woman that good could be blessed by that much hard polishing.<br><br>You and I will face difficulty in our studies and in our lives, and we expect it because of what we know about who God is and that we are his children, what his hopes are for us, and how much he loves us. He will give us no test without preparing the way for us to pass it. Because of what we know about adversity in learning, in this community of Saints we pay special honor to determined learners because we know the price that they gladly pay. And we know from whence their power to persist through difficulty comes.<br><br>In this community we know that we are the brothers and sisters of Job, of Joseph in Egypt, of Joseph in Carthage Jail, and of Jesus in Gethsemane and on Golgotha's hill. So we are not surprised when sorrows come. We respect their place and know their potential.<br><br>You might well wonder what I would hope will come from this brief review of the power of our faith in the plan of salvation to produce humility and the power to learn. It is not that we will now go out to seek some grand experience to transform our lives and our learning.<br><br>The way to grow in the faith that we are the children of our Heavenly Father is to act like it. The time to start is now. You've received some prompting in your heart while you have listened to my suggestion about what God would have you do, or do differently. Do what you have been prompted to do. Do it now. After you obey you will receive more impressions from God about what he requires of you. Keeping commandments increases the power to keep other commandments.<br><br>Today you could seek correction. You could keep a commitment. You could work hard. You could help someone else. You could plow through adversity. And as we do those things day after day, by and by we will find that we have learned whatever God would teach us for this life and for the next, with him.<br><br>You are a child of God. Our Heavenly Father lives. Jesus is the Christ, our Savior. Through Joseph Smith the knowledge of the plan of salvation was restored. If we act upon that plan as we should, it will allow us to claim eternal life, which is our inheritance. And if we act upon it, we will be blessed with a humility that gives us the power to learn and the power to serve and the power to rise up to the privileges that God wants to grant us. Of that I testify in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Henry B.

My beloved young brothers and sisters, you can imagine what a thrill it is for me to be here with you tonight! You are outstanding young people, some of the noble and great ones. Your lives reflect integrity and virtue and faith. You know who you are--sons and daughters of our Heavenly Father. You know that he loves you.<br><br>You are blessed to be at the threshold of life at this time in the world's history. Imagine how Isaiah or John the Revelator would feel. This was the day they saw; the time of which they taught. We know the fullness of the gospel, we are led by a prophet, and there are abundant opportunities for both young women and young men. I hope you feel very blessed and loved by your Heavenly Father. He has sent you to earth at this crucial and exciting time because he needs your strength and your talents and your goodness.<br><br>A demanding world awaits you, and I am so proud of you for the preparation you are making toward your own unique contribution. These are preparing, precious years. What you learn and do in the period of time between 18 and 30 will in large part determine the direction of the remainder of your life. You have no time to waste! Very simply, you don't have time to major in popular TV sitcoms and minor in the pursuit of recreation. What you spend your time doing is what you are going to become. You must find a way to mesh the goals you have for your life with what you are doing on a daily basis.<br><br>Tonight I have with me an old envelope. I know it's old because the postage is only six cents, and that means it was mailed a very long time ago. On the back of this envelope are directions to a destination.<br><br>It belonged to a young couple in their twenties and newly married. They were romantic and idealistic and optimistic about their future. He was in graduate school. She taught high school to support the two of them. One bright autumn day in New England they took a picnic lunch out to Walden Pond, near Boston. For those of you who love literature, you'll remember that Walden Pond and Henry David Thoreau go together. Like Thoreau they chose this location to think and ponder about their future. The question they had come to consider was this: What should they do with the rest of their lives?<br><br>They wanted a road map for the future. They had a new marriage. It was a promising partnership. The future stretched out before them, and they wanted to make the very most of it. They talked of what to do and where to live. They talked about the children they wanted to have. They wanted to develop talents and share what they had been given. They wanted the world to be better because they had lived in it. They wanted to serve God always.<br><br>They were goal setters, so after a very philosophical afternoon and lots of discussion, they wrote down on the back of an envelope a list of goals and hopes and dreams that they intended would set the tone for the rest of their lives together. They drove away from that beautiful, serene setting with hope and optimism and the envelope.<br><br>The practical, routine, daily things of life took over. The envelope was soon forgotten. They got caught up in life. They prayed often and worked hard, and they served others. They started their family and finished graduate school. He worked at his career. She worked at being a young mother. They served--both in their Church and in the community. They had more children. Life got busier and busier. They didn't think about their Walden Pond envelope much at all. Things weren't so philosophical anymore, but they were happy. They were very happy. They just kept trying, with each choice they made, to see which path God wanted them to take.<br><br>Many years passed. They faced trials--some of them were very hard ones. There were a variety of challenges--some of them could have broken their spirits. They were middle-aged, and they plucked gray hairs and watched their waistlines expand. They moved to a new city, where the husband was hired for a very responsible job.<br><br>One day, in the process of the move, she found among some long-forgotten papers the Walden Pond envelope. It was old and yellowed. On the back was the list of goals made by the young newlywed couple so many, many years before.<br><br>As she read down the list, tears came to her eyes. The years since they had spent that long-ago afternoon at Walden Pond flashed by. As her eyes focused on each item, she realized that most of the goals on the list had come to pass. Interestingly enough, her husband's new job was the fulfillment of the final notation they had made at Walden Pond. It was time now to get a new envelope and make a new list.<br><br>I would assume that many of you have your own envelope, so to speak. If, for some reason, you haven't gone through the process of thoughtfully preparing written goals, I strongly counsel you to do so now. You will go places and do things and have experiences that I cannot even imagine. But you must be working at something worthy of your best effort. You can't just expect the Lord to come along and pluck you off the couch and set you on a path of achievement. He doesn't work that way. He will direct effort, but he won't direct inertia!<br><br>I have to tell you that in your lives there will be surprises and experiences--both good and bad--that you can't even dream of. That's what makes life such an interesting adventure! Author George MacDonald gave a wonderful story example:<br><br><i>Imagine yourself as a living house. God comes in to rebuild that house. At first, perhaps, you can understand what He is doing. He is getting the drains right and stopping the leaks in the roof and so on: you knew that those jobs needed doing and so you are not surprised. But presently He starts knocking the house about in a way that hurts abominably and does not seem to make sense. What on earth is He up to? The explanation is that He is building quite a different house from the one you thought of--throwing out a new wing here, putting on an extra floor there, running up towers, making courtyards. You thought you were going to be made into a decent little cottage: but He is building a palace.</i>[George MacDonald, cited in C. S. Lewis,<i>Mere Christianity</i>(New York: Macmillan, 1960), p. 160]<br><br>We don't want to willfully set goals for ourselves with no thought of what Heavenly Father might have for us to do. Pray for divine guidance so he can direct your efforts on a path that will bless you. Then remember that there really is a law of the harvest. It's unrealistic to suppose that lofty goals and ambitions can be met without hard work, discipline, and focused effort. So each day, each step along the way, ask for and then listen for divine guidance. Work hard at the goals you've set for yourself, and the Lord will bless you in your efforts. The combination of directed effort on your part and living close to the Spirit will get you to where you really should be.<br><br>Right now you are at such a wonderful place in life where you have mainly yourself to work on. Most of you don't have families for whom you are responsible. This is your time of personal development. This moment in your life will never happen again. Who you're sitting by, the place where you are--it will never be just like this again. Make the most of it so there will be no regrets: "For of all sad words of tongue or pen, / The saddest are these: 'It might have been!'" (John Greenleaf Whittier,<i>Maud Muller</i>[1856], st. 53.)<br><br>I would guess that some of you could be feeling overwhelmed with your circumstances, the academic demands of college life, the reality of having to work, and the social ups and downs you are all experiencing. I remember well my first few weeks of living away from home and at college. They were hard. I struggled a bit, and I guess I was naïve, too.<br><br>I had come from a small town that didn't even have one stoplight. Fortunately I didn't have a car, so I didn't have to worry about stoplights. At least that's one worry I didn't have! My mother had created a wonderful home, where accomplishment was a way of life. She inspired me. My father provided spiritual and financial security and wise counsel.<br><br>Suddenly I was on my own. There were decisions to make, papers to write, exams to take, classes to prepare for, laundry to do, meals to fix, Church assignments, and an expanding social life. There were new roommates. It was difficult--some days nothing went well. After one such day I remember calling my mother and saying, "This is just too hard! If you think college is so great, why don't you come and take my place? I bet I could get my old job back at the Dairy Queen on Main Street."<br><br>She listened quietly. Mother was very wise but not very sympathetic. She simply said, "Well, dear, you'd better learn to handle it, because it gets harder!"<br><br>She was so right. Gradually I did learn to organize myself, and I learned a lot of other things, too. I changed my mind about wanting to give up college and go back to where everything was familiar and easy. I'm so thankful I stayed and did something that was hard for me. From those demanding experiences I began to mature.<br><br>Elder Glenn L. Pace told a wonderful story that illustrates my point:<br><br><i>When I was in junior high school, I would get out of bed on cold winter mornings and head for the heat vent to get warm. The family cat would always beat me there, so I would gently shoo her away and sit down. Soon my mother would tell me it was time to leave for school. I would look out at the icicles on the house and dread going out into the cold, let alone beginning another day of school.</i><br><br><i>As I kissed my mother good-bye and went out the door, I would look longingly at my comfortable spot in front of the heat vent and find that the cat had repossessed it. How I envied that cat! If that weren't enough, she would look up at me with heavy eyelids and an expression that seemed to laugh at me and say, "Have fun in school, Glenn. I'm sure glad I'm not a human." I hated it when she did that.</i><br><br><i>However, an interesting thing would happen as the day went on. I would come home after experiencing the joys and sorrows of the school day and see that lazy cat still curled up in front of the vent, and I would smile and say to her, "I'm sure glad I'm not a cat."</i>[Glenn L. Pace,<i>Spiritual Plateaus</i>(Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Company, 1991), pp. 84–85]<br><br>Leaving that heat vent took discipline on his behalf on cold mornings. Maturing and growing requires discipline and can be uncomfortable. But how unfortunate it would be to waste these growing moments. As you concentrate on developing a wide variety of skills, your life will be forever blessed.<br><br>Now is the time to develop some skills that will make an eternal difference to you. I would like to focus on four tonight. They aren't necessarily learned in the classroom, but they are developed through practice and much effort.<br><h2><b>Social Skills</b></h2><br>The first on my short list is social skills. If you can develop good social skills, the trip through life can be smoother.<br><br>The trend in the world is to demand our rights, to accuse others, and to excuse ourselves. The Savior taught us to care for others, to bless their lives, to understand their needs, and to be humble and meek, merciful and kind.<br><br>Remember when Jesus was mourning the death of his beloved cousin John the Baptist? He was sorrowing, he was sad, and he wanted to go away and be alone.<br><br><i>He departed thence by ship into a desert place apart: and when the people had heard thereof, they followed him on foot out of the cities.</i><br><br><i>And Jesus went forth, and saw a great multitude, and was moved with compassion toward them, and he healed their sick.</i><br><br><i>And when it was evening, his disciples came to him, saying, . . . send the multitude away, that they may go . . . and buy themselves victuals.</i><br><br><i>But Jesus said unto them, They need not depart; give ye them to eat.</i>[Matthew 14:13–16]<br><br>Jesus forgot about his own concerns and fed the 5,000 with five loaves of bread and two fishes.<br><br>Jesus was the perfect exemplar of caring for others. He taught:<br><br><i>Blessed are the poor in spirit who come unto me, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. . . .</i><br><br><i>And blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth. . . .</i><br><br><i>And blessed are the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy.</i><br><br><i>And blessed are all the pure in heart, for they shall see God.</i><br><br><i>And blessed are all the peacemakers, for they shall be called the children of God.</i>[3 Nephi 12:3, 5, 7–9; see also Matthew 5:3–9]<br><br>He taught us to be peacemakers.<br><br>You can't beat those items for social skills, can you? And he promised us rewards for those behaviors: We will have mercy. We will inherit the earth. We will see God.<br><br>How do you treat others? Do you think of others first? Are you warm and interested in other people? Do you know someone who knows how to listen--really listen, with his or her heart? Does that person go beyond just being kind and pleasant and listen to real needs and try to help? Does that person focus attention on the other person rather than on him- or herself? It gives one a feeling of freedom to forget oneself and one's own needs and inadequacies and care for another person. People who can do that are loved, and they are happy.<br><br>It has been my privilege to know people like that. Let me tell you about one. She was tall and a bit round. She was older. Her smile exuded warmth. She had such a pleasant sense of humor. She was capable and she was kind. I don't know that she was born with those qualities, but I do know that they were well developed because she practiced them constantly. She nurtured her sense of humor by laughing at things that were funny and making light of things that didn't really matter. I can still remember her chuckle and lighthearted laugh. When she didn't marry or have children, she didn't mope away her life. She was productive in her career and in her community. She was elected to the city council. She held positions of respect in organizations she belonged to. At Christmastime she got a list of all the little children in her small town and sent Santa Claus letters to them. She didn't have her own children, so she found little girls who were needy and bought dolls for them and gave remote-control cars to the little boys. She was happy, and others were happy because of her.<br><br>Oh, my friends, how skills such as these social skills will bless you in your life--in public service, in careers, as parents, as spouses, as Church workers. Think of talking to a boss or going to a parent-teacher conference or speaking with the zoning commission or the ward council and having a desire to be warm, to understand, to be helpful rather than self-centered and combative and defensive and always so very right! Can you see how developing good social skills can bless lives, including your own?<br><br>You may recall a story told about President Spencer W. Kimball when he helped a young mother in an airport. This act of kindness is often told, but let me share with you the result of that kindness. It came in a letter President Kimball received more than 20 years later.<br><br><i>Dear President Kimball: . . .</i><br><br><i>I was sitting in priesthood meeting last week, when a story was told of a loving service which you performed some twenty-one years ago in the Chicago airport. The story told of how you met a young pregnant mother with a . . . screaming child, in . . . distress, waiting in a long line for her tickets. She was threatening miscarriage and therefore couldn't lift her child to comfort her. She had experienced four previous miscarriages, which gave added reason for the doctor's orders not to bend or lift.</i><br><br><i>You comforted the crying child and explained the dilemma to the other passengers in line. This act of love took the strain and tension off my mother. I was born a few months later in Flint, Michigan.</i><br><br><i>I just want to</i>thank you<i>for your love.</i>Thank you<i>for your example!</i>[Gordon B. Hinckley, "Do Ye Even So to Them,"<i>Ensign,</i>December 1991, p. 5]<br><br>Good social skills begin with the Golden Rule: "Whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them" (Matthew 7:12).<br><h2><b>Practical Skills</b></h2><br>Second on my list is practical skills. The joy of living in a happy, productive home environment in the years to come is dependent on the creators of that home.<br><br>You young men out there, do you know what I see in you? I see more than bulging biceps or computer geniuses. I see men who want to be husbands, men who love little children and who want to communicate effectively with their wives and sons and daughters. I see men who are taking full advantage of available educational opportunities, who are preparing to be providers, and who take seriously that God-given responsibility.<br><br>I also see something else! I see men who should know how to care for a yard--mow, edge, fertilize, make it look like a million bucks! I see men who should know what to do with a tool chest, who should know the difference between pliers and a pipe wrench, and who should know how to use tools to make home repairs.<br><br>I know of one young man who spent the summer before starting graduate school working as a handyman in his neighborhood. He repaired sprinklers, he remodeled closets, he landscaped front yards, he replaced old fences, and he painted decks.<br><br>He got married. And then the time came that the young couple was able to buy their first little home. It needed a lot of work--it was a real fixer-upper. Conveniently, he had developed the necessary skills. In one month he remodeled the basement into an apartment, which they rented out. This helped make their house payment. Besides being glad that her husband is smart and romantic, his new bride is impressed with the financial benefits of his practical skills.<br><br>This is the practical side of life. And it is important. You need to be more than an athlete! You need to be more than a superb test taker in school! Go apprentice with a plumber and learn how to fix a leaky faucet or follow your grandpa around his garden and learn the art of growing from him. Can your father or uncle or neighbor teach you basic carpentry skills or simple electrical techniques?<br><br>Now, young women, let's focus on you. For you this is a time of unprecedented opportunities and options. You have important choices to make, and I'm sure you're aware of that. Please, for yourself and for your future family, choose a fine education. I can see in you women who are educating themselves and who are preparing to bless others through that education.<br><br>Let me tell you about Alice. She is trained as a pediatrician. She is happily married and the mother of six children. She has served in many ways in the Church, including serving in a Relief Society presidency, and now she is the Cub Scout leader. She sews Halloween costumes and volunteers at the elementary school in the science lab.<br><br>Right now Alice is a full-time mother. Undoubtedly she will return to her medical practice when her children are raised, but that doesn't mean that she isn't using her medical education. Teenagers from the neighborhood have been known to appear on her porch with all kinds of symptoms.<br><br>One dramatic event occurred when a vacationing mother telephoned Alice. Her daughter's baby-sitter had reported that the little girl was coughing and seemed sick. After apologizing for bothering her, the mother asked Alice for a favor. Could she please find time during the afternoon to check on her little girl, who appeared to have croup? For some reason, Alice immediately put aside what she was doing and went right down. She found the girl not breathing and in full cardiac arrest. She applied CPR. By the time the paramedics arrived, the little girl was breathing again. Alice's education and her skills saved the child's life.<br><br>Another young woman had great plans for her life. It's the story written by Ardeth G. Kapp about her sister Shirley. Shirley said:<br><br><i>"I want to help the world turn, and I want to help it turn sharply. I want to make a mark in life."</i><br><br><i>With enough successes already to give her considerable confidence, her goals could be lofty. As she spoke of far-away places and exotic endeavors, her father posed a simple question with a not so simple answer. "Shirley," he said, "why don't you become great like your grandmother?"</i><br><br><i>. . . She excitedly asked, "What did she do?"</i><br><br><i>. . . He replied, "She kept a beautiful home and raised a fine family."</i><br><br><i>Often during the following years her father's counsel would come to mind for Shirley at the most unexpected times, such as during a psychology class at college, or when she was organizing the election campaign for a student body candidate. It would come during a piano recital or when she was camping or learning first aid. It would seem logical when she was preparing for a Spiritual Living lesson, but why right in the middle of an economics class dealing with the gross national product? Why in the middle of a heated discussion with a roommate about the budget and the laundry? And especially why during general household responsibilities?</i>[In Ardeth Greene Kapp,<i>Miracles in Pinafores and Bluejeans</i>[Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Company, 1977], pp. 2–4]<br><br>The time came when Shirley married and had 11 children. Her husband was serving as stake president in Canada when a General Authority came to stay in their home while he was on a conference assignment. Upon his return home from the assignment, he called Shirley's sister and reported on a grand experience. He said these words: "Your sister keeps a beautiful home and is raising a fine family." This was a direct quote from Shirley's father's advice to her as a girl. All the preparation she had made to make a mark on the world truly paid off. With her skills and talents, she has blessed a family, and the ripple effect of that will go on forever.<br><br>In you young women I see souls preparing to create a beautiful, loving environment for raising a family. I see women who can cook delicious, balanced, and healthy meals. I see women who find satisfaction from following recipes handed down by mothers and grandmothers. I see women who understand the importance of having a family put their feet under the dinner table every day. I see in you women who love children and look forward to the day when you will be mothers, nurturers of precious sons and daughters. I see women who will learn to make a budget and understand provident living, who look forward to establishing a home of love, a home of order, a home of faith.<br><br>Certainly husbands and wives can and will help each other. There may no longer be as strict a division of labor as there was in times gone by, but you will discover when you establish a home of your own that someone must accept responsibility for each task. Listen to these words from "The Family: A Proclamation to the World":<br><br><i>By divine design, fathers are to preside over their families in love and righteousness and are responsible to provide the necessities of life and protection for their families. Mothers are primarily responsible for the nurture of their children. In these sacred responsibilities, fathers and mothers are obligated to help one another as equal partners.</i>[<i>Ensign,</i>November 1995, p. 102]<br><br>I take the words from this proclamation very seriously and very solemnly.<br><br>Young people, learn how to do practical things. Start now! It's fun to be a doer. Hard workers are admired! Accomplishment is attractive!<br><br>President Hinckley believes in the gospel of work. He said, "There is no substitute under the heavens for productive labor" (<i>Teachings of Gordon B. Hinckley</i>[Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Company, 1997], p. 705).<br><br>He also said:<br><br><i>Children need to work with their parents--to wash dishes with them, to mop floors with them, to mow lawns, to prune trees and shrubbery, to paint and fix up and clean up and do a hundred other things where they will learn that labor is the price of cleanliness and progress and prosperity.</i>[<i>Teachings of Gordon B. Hinckley,</i>p. 707]<br><br>"Without hard work, nothing grows but weeds. There must be labor, incessant and constant, if there is to be a harvest" (Gordon B. Hinckley, "Farewell to a Prophet,"<i>Ensign,</i>July 1994, p. 37).<br><br>That's from the prophet.<br><h2><b>Refinement</b></h2><br>The third skill is refinement. Seek to add culture to your lives. I remember when I began dating Steve, who would become my husband. I was thrilled to know that he was student-body vice president of culture! Wow!<br><br>I romantically envisioned a constant round of evenings at the theater, concerts, art exhibits, and ballets with this exciting man. I had better confess, though, that cultural vice president may well have been false advertising. After we really got acquainted, I learned that he prefers athletic events to concerts.<br><br>Perhaps I had a somewhat idealistic view of life. Still, there is something in us that is better and finer when exposed to the arts and cultural events. I'm grateful that my husband attends and enjoys these things with me and encourages them in our home. That well-roundedness is attractive to me.<br><br>It is a joy to me when one of our sons takes a date to a symphony performance after playing a muddy, mean rugby game. We introduced our seven young sons to the symphony by taking them to an outdoor performance of Tchaikovsky's<i>1812 Overture,</i>complete with live cannon fire at the end. That caught their attention!<br><br>Like many of your parents, we've spent thousands of dollars on music lessons and untold hours helping children practice the piano and violin at our house. A favorite memory is of a little boy sitting on the piano bench with his ball mitt next to him and his cleated feet swinging in time to the music he played. I remember one time one of the little boys said, "Oh, if I only had one hour left to live, I'd spend it practicing the piano because those practice hours last forever." Now he, too, realizes that beautiful music can add an enrichment to your home and to the lives of those who can play and create it.<br><br>What about art? If you can't paint artistically, you can learn to appreciate it. If you don't play or sing musically, you can develop a taste for the beauty of it. My favorite free-time pursuit is great literature. I love to curl up with a good book (and have been known to do so late at night and early into the morning hours).<br><br>President Hinckley said:<br><br><i>I have in my home a reasonably good sound system. I do not use it frequently, but now and again, I sit quietly in the semidarkness and listen for an hour or so to music that has endured through the centuries because of its remarkable qualities. I listened the other evening to Beethoven's Concerto for the Violin and marveled that such a thing could come out of the mind of a man. The composer, I suppose, was very much like the rest of us. I do not know how tall he was or how broad he was or how much he weighed. I assume that he got hungry, felt pain, and had most of the problems that we all have, and maybe some that we do not have. But out of the genius of that mind came a tremendous blending to create rare and magnificent masterpieces of music.</i>[General Authority Training Meeting, 29 September 1992, quoted in<i>Teachings of Gordon B. Hinckley,</i>p. 398]<br><h2><b>Spiritual Skills</b></h2><br>Lastly, and encompassing all of the other skills, are the spiritual skills. One of our beloved hymns asks, "Ere you left your room this morning, / Did you think to pray?" ("Did You Think to Pray?"<i>Hymns,</i>1985, no. 140). Then, I would ask, did you stop to listen? Have you left time in your busy, bustling schedule for quiet moments?<br><br>The whispering of the Spirit is a still small voice--one that isn't heard over loud, blaring music or harsh voices or frantic activity. It is a sweet, divine gift given to those who seek and patiently wait upon the Lord.<br><br>President David O. McKay told about the grief suffered in a family due to the loss of a precious, priceless son. His death had occurred as the result of a tragic accident, and the parents were inconsolable. The mother was particularly troubled and went about her round of duties relentlessly trying to block out her intense sorrow.<br><br>One day the mother was at home, quietly going about her work, and her thoughts turned toward the son they mourned so much. And then something very unusual happened. This son came to her briefly. He explained that he had tried to visit his father, but his father's life was too busy, and he hadn't been able to get through to him. He wanted his parents to know that he was fine and that there was no need to worry about him (see<i>Gospel Ideals</i>[Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Company, 1953], pp. 525–26).<br><br>This spiritual experience was a great source of comfort to the mother, and to the father when she recounted it to him. But the father learned a great lesson. Sometimes we need to be still for a moment. We need to slow down and be less frenetic. Psalm 46:10 teaches us, "Be still, and know that I am God."<br><br>We need to have more reverence in our lives, more holiness, more times of quiet and peace and calm. We need a place where our souls can be nourished and tutored and blessed. Temples are such places. Homes can be such places. Dear young friends, you busy, happy, enthusiastic young friends, invite the Spirit to abide with you and then welcome its companionship with a listening, prepared, quiet heart.<br><br>The Sabbath day is a good day to calm down and put aside studies. It is a day to feed our souls. The story is told about a group of anthropologists traveling with some aborigines. On the third day of their trip, the aborigines just stopped moving. When the anthropologists asked why, the reply was, "We are stopping to wait for our souls to catch up." The Sabbath is a good time to wait for our souls to catch up.<br><br>I had an experience that I would like to share with you. I was trying to make a decision that was very important, and it concerned more than just myself. I'd had many years of practice in going to the Lord with decisions. I fasted. I attended temple sessions. I prayed a great deal. I tried to be spiritually in tune. Then I made the decision and took it to the Lord for confirmation. In spite of all my spiritual preparations, I still felt unsettled with the final decision. Then I read Doctrine and Covenants 9:7, which says, "Behold, you have not understood; you have supposed that I would give it unto you, when you took no thought save it was to ask me."<br><br>It became very clear to me that to be completely settled about my decision, I needed more than spiritual preparation. I needed to do some practical preparation.<br><br>I got up from my knees and went to work. I met with people. I gathered data. I analyzed it. I thought about it. I counseled with Church leaders. I counseled with family. I considered it thoughtfully and very prayerfully. I wrote things down. Using a pencil and paper is always useful to me in analyzing information. It clarifies my thinking. So I wrote lists of pros and cons and considered these very prayerfully--crossing things off, narrowing things down.<br><br>I didn't hurry. I took time to let things settle in my mind. Then in due time I knew what I should do. Finally, the Lord blessed me with peace about the matter, just as promised in Doctrine and Covenants 6:23: "Did I not speak peace to your mind concerning the matter? What greater witness can you have than from God?" I learned that inspiration comes during this process. Can these same steps apply to you in major decisions you make? Surely it can.<br><br>Let me share another example: A young couple had a decision to make concerning a financial matter. Together they researched all the options. They investigated the matter inside out. The husband was well educated in financial and business matters and put his best thinking and analyzing to work. The final decision had to be made when the business opened on Tuesday. On Monday night, as the couple knelt together in prayer, they presented their decision to the Lord. They explained that they had used all their own data-gathering, analysis, and logic resources. They had done all they could think of, and this seemed to be the course to take. But they recognized that Heavenly Father knows all things, and so they pleaded that if there was some piece of information that would affect the decision, would the Lord please bring it to their attention. They retired for the night, feeling fine about their decision and also about what they had asked of the Lord.<br><br>Early the next morning they were awakened by the phone ringing. The person on the other end gave them information regarding their decision that they would have had no way of knowing. This information clearly changed the decision that they would make. By opening of business that day, they knew what to do. It proved to be correct as the years passed and time confirmed their choice. The Lord did help them after they had done all they could do themselves.<br><br>This is not to say that if we pray hard and do what is right we are never going to have a bad outcome. We're on this earth to have experiences. Those experiences aren't always the ones we would choose for ourselves, but we're more likely to fulfill Heavenly Father's purposes and our goals if we develop the faith to know that after all we can do, he will bless our experience to our good. The Lord will help you after you have done all you can to make good decisions. He will bless you as you serve him and his children.<br><br>Do you love the Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ? Do you understand what he did for you and what he will do for you?<br><br>Read the gospel of John from start to finish. Then read the other gospels--Matthew, Mark, and Luke. Then read 3 Nephi, starting with chapter 11. Learn of Christ. Thank God for his life and for his perfect love for you and for his perfect example. Then try to follow it. Try to live like he taught. Try to ask, "What would the Savior do?" And then do it. Try to always remember what he did for you. Remember his atoning sacrifice and never mock it by your actions, but glorify his name by your actions. We should all be reminded of how he blessed us when we partake of the sacrament each week. If we thoughtfully listen to the words of those prayers and live worthily to take his name upon us, we will be blessed and we will bless others. If we love the Lord, we will reverence him and worship him, and our reverence will be observed in our actions and attitudes.<br><br>Let us always remember and reverence and worship him whose name this Church bears. A recent convert expressed this. He was out in the foyer with the stake missionary who had helped teach and baptize him. They were both tending their babies. They had something in common. But the convert had a concern, which he shared. He said, "You know, I joined this Church because it is The Church of Jesus Christ and it bears his name. And yet since I was baptized, I haven't heard about him. When will they teach me about Jesus?"<br><br>As you prepare lessons and teach others, do not forget whose church this is, my dear young people. Christ must be at the forefront of all of our teaching, as well as the pattern for our daily life. Let us come to know Jesus. Let us take his name upon us and follow his example. It is simple. Living the gospel is really just that simple. Follow Christ.<br><br>As we study the scriptures, the standard works, we will come to know how best to follow Christ. Pushing a button on your computer and finding every quote on a certain subject is interesting, but it is not as powerful as reading the words of heaven in context from the books of scripture. There are many wonderful books written about the scriptures and explaining them--and they have their place. But the best way to get to know the Lord and his ways is to read his word. There is power and there is testimony in the word of God as he has given it in the Book of Mormon, the New Testament, and the other standard works. Find time to daily feast from those pages. Even if it is only 10 or 15 minutes, the strength you will gain will help you in your daily challenges.<br><br>As you go home tonight, as you kneel in your own private prayer, remember to give thanks for all you have been given, because you are so very blessed. Heavenly Father will continue to give. He'll give you wisdom as you list goals on your very own envelope. He'll help you develop the skills that will enable you to reach your goals. He'll give you strength to keep practicing at them until they are part of you. Let him help you be all that you can be and help you do all that you can do.<br><br>I bear testimony of our Heavenly Father's great goodness and love, and I pray for him to help you meet your bright future well equipped and with confidence in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Margaret D. Nadauld was the Young Women general president of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when this fireside address was given at BYU on 2 November 1997.</i><br><br><i>© Intellectual Reserve, Inc.

<h1>Experience: Becoming a Disciple of Jesus Christ - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Thank you, President Bateman, for that introduction. Thank you, Brother Wilberg, for that stirring music. It was wonderful. I think I'd like to be the drummer. Thank you, Ri Ho Nam. It's nice to hear from you again. I first met Ri Ho Nam in 1960 when he was a little fellow in Korea. Now he's a little fellow in Provo. We've had many interesting times together over there in the Land of the Morning Calm. I have a great regard for this, my friend Ri Ho Nam.<br><br>My beloved brethren and sisters, what a wonderful thing it is to look into your faces, of the thousands and thousands of you who are here this morning. Thank you for coming. You do us great honor by your presence. We're grateful for your lives, for your faith, for your love of the Lord, and for your desire to walk his way and be the kind of men and women that the Lord expects you to be. Thank you for the goodness of your lives.<br><br>What a wonderful time it is to be alive. What a wonderful time to be a student at this great university. There is peace in the world. We are closing the bloodiest century in the history of all mankind. There are a few skirmishes here and there, but no great cataclysmic wars. How thankful you ought to be for that fact. You are free to go forward with your lives. You live at a time when perhaps there are greater career opportunities than at any other time in the history of the world. I commend you most warmly on your presence.<br><br>In a recent meeting of the board of trustees, members of the administration of the university spoke of ways to give a larger number of young people a taste of "the BYU experience."<br><br>I thought of that much after the meeting. The BYU experience? What is it? What is unique about attending this university in contrast with another?<br><br>I recently spoke on the campus of another university in this state. The paper reported there were 20,000 in attendance. I think that figure was exaggerated. But the fact is, there was a huge crowd. Most of them were institute students. They looked just the way you look. They were clean, well-groomed, and neatly dressed. They were eager and attentive. As high a percentage of them will be married in the temple as there will be of you. They were much better behaved than some few of you I saw on television the other night.<br><br>Returning from my experience on this other Utah campus, I asked myself, "What does BYU have to offer that this school does not?" Perhaps we need to go beyond our neighbor universities with their strong institutes. We need to reach out across the nation and beyond and take note of what is happening on the campuses of America. We have some truly great institutions of learning in this nation. But in so many cases are found circumstances that are seriously disquieting. Many of you, I am sure, read of the student who recently died of over-drinking--binge drinking, as they called it. There have been other cases of this. We have coeducational dormitories on some campuses. There are many faculty members who, perhaps even boastfully, speak of a lack of belief in God as if that were the mark of a great scholar. There are other problems--so very many of them.<br><br>I have reflected much of late on the unique features of this Church university. I am not surprised that students from far and wide are trying to get in here. It is a tragedy that so many must be turned away. Sometimes I wish we could support a dozen institutions such as this. But we cannot, and the problem becomes more serious every year as we have in the Church an increasing number of young people.<br><br>What do you have here that for the most part is not found elsewhere? Is there any substance to this so-called BYU experience?<br><br>I think so. For instance, you have student wards and stakes. I do not know how many of you really appreciate the meaning of this. There is no competition to get into social fraternities, and yet there is every opportunity for sociality. Here every student stands on an equal footing in belonging to a student ward. That ward is presided over by a bishop--a man called by the spirit of prophecy and revelation with all the keys and the authority of a bishop in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. He stands ready to listen to your problems, and you seem to have so very many of them. He stands ready to advise and counsel under the inspiration and direction of the Holy Spirit. Your bishop is your friend. He prays about you. He worries about you. He stands ready to help you at all times and in all circumstances. Further, you have elders quorums composed of young men of dedicated purpose. They stand ready to help and to assist in any way that they can.<br><br>In a recent severe storm, lightning struck the house next to my daughter's place. Windows were blown out of some 23 homes in the neighborhood. It was not 30 minutes, with the rain still falling, before an elders quorum was going from house to house boarding up the shattered windows so that there could be some measure of comfort in each home.<br><br>One of those neighbors was not a member of the Church. She had come from Europe. She was of a different faith. Her windows were boarded up along with the others. She said to my daughter, "I cannot understand your Church. These young men were here immediately when I needed them. They seemed to come out of nowhere. No money was asked for or expected. I do not belong to your Church, but I was treated as though I did."<br><br>You young women have a Relief Society, a remarkable organization of your own. The Sunday before last I attended a stake conference where a young woman, president of the Relief Society of a singles ward, spoke of service and the great opportunity afforded the young women in her ward. You have all of this. You have your own organization. You have able leaders to counsel you. You have those who will reach out to you to help you in your times of trouble and distress.<br><br>I believe you belong to the greatest brotherhood and sisterhood in the world. You are bound together by an endowment of one faith, one Lord, one baptism. You work together with appreciation and respect one for another. This is all part of the BYU experience.<br><br>You of this great institution have just to the east of you the house of the Lord, the beautiful Provo Temple. Many of you go there on a frequent basis. You have been there before, and you return again and again. You go very early in the morning before your classes start. You have this great and remarkable opportunity to work unselfishly in the interest of others while growing spiritually yourselves. This is another aspect of the BYU experience.<br><br>I want to add parenthetically that we do not encourage our young sisters necessarily to go to the temple unless they are being married or going on missions. This is a matter of choice that they must make after prayer and much deliberation, as well as discussion with their bishops and stake presidents.<br><br>You have the proscriptions and the prescriptions of the Word of Wisdom. Hence, drinking is not one of your problems. What a wonderful thing it is to have pleasant and happy associations without any inclination whatever to indulge in drinking or any related practice. And beyond this is the wondrous promise that you will receive treasures of knowledge, even hidden treasures. This does not mean that you will necessarily be smarter in your normal studies. It does mean that the power of the Holy Ghost may distill upon you and bring to you an increased knowledge and understanding of the sweet and marvelous things of the Lord. This is another phase of the BYU experience.<br><br>You have a unique and dedicated faculty to teach you. They bring to this great responsibility the learning of all the ages of man, in a vast variety of fields of knowledge. They are, for the most part, dedicated Latter-day Saints, men and women who feel as much at home in the house of the Lord as they feel in the classrooms of this university. When all is said and done, it is not this elaborate campus that really counts. It is the faculty who teach you, who lead you, who encourage you, who help you find your way as you go forward with your studies. This, again, is an element of the singular BYU experience.<br><br>Your studies will qualify you for your vocations. Time here will pass quickly, and you will soon be out in the world of work. You have a great variety of job opportunities from which to choose. I hope that you will choose well, that you will be happy in the work you will undertake for the remainder of your lives. I hope you will make a great contribution in the fields in which you serve. I hope you will distinguish yourselves as leaders, as workers with a great sense of loyalty and dedication. I hope your training at this university will endow you with an interesting and powerful sense of responsibility toward the world of which you will be a part. Your performance will reflect honor on your alma mater.<br><br>I hope that the BYU experience will cause you to take on those qualities that will make of you a true disciple of Jesus.<br><br>All of you are taking religion classes while you are here. I hope that you are gaining much more than a knowledge of the organization of the scriptures and such matters as that. I hope that you are developing a great desire to walk in the footsteps of the Master, to reach out to those in distress, to serve the Church with great faithfulness, and to serve your fellowmen in a spirit of love and consecration.<br><br>I hope the lessons of going the second mile, of the prodigal son, of the Good Samaritan--and all the other lessons of the Son of God who gave his life in a great offering of atonement--will motivate you and never leave you.<br><br>I hope that this university will give to you a great sense of tolerance and respect for others not of your faith. The true gospel of Jesus Christ never led to bigotry. It never led to self-righteousness. It never led to arrogance. The true gospel of Jesus Christ leads to brotherhood, to friendship, to appreciation of others, to respect and kindness and love.<br><br>Mr. Shimon Peres called on us last Wednesday in the Church Administration Building. He is one of the elder statesmen of the world, the former prime minister of Israel. He has seen much of conflict and trouble in his time. He is a wise and able man who speaks with the spirit of a sage.<br><br>I asked him whether there was any solution to the great problems that constantly seem to divide the people of Israel and the Palestinians. He replied that of course there is. He said an interesting thing. As I recall, he said, "When we were Adam and Eve, we were all one. Is there any need for us to be divided into segments with hatred in our hearts one for another?"<br><br>He told a beautiful story that he said he got from a Muslim. The Muslim told of a Jewish rabbi who was conversing with two of his friends. The rabbi asked one of the men, "How do you know when the night is over and the day has begun?"<br><br>His friend replied, "When you look into the distance and can distinguish a sheep from a goat, then you know the night is over and the day has begun."<br><br>The second was asked the same question. He replied, "When you look into the distance and can distinguish an olive tree from a fig tree, that is how you know."<br><br>They then asked the rabbi how he could tell when the night is over and the day has begun. He thought for a time and then said, "When you look into the distance and see the face of a woman and you can say, 'She is my sister.' And when you look into the distance and see the face of a man and can say, 'He is my brother.' Then you will know the light has come."<br><br>Think about that story for a minute. What a wonderful truth it tells.<br><br>Not long ago I was asked to speak at a convention of the Religion Newswriters of America. Following my talk I invited questions. I was asked, "What are you going to do when 15,000 or 20,000 Baptists visit you in Salt Lake City next summer and try to proselytize you?"<br><br>I replied, "We are going to welcome them. We are going to do everything we can to make them feel at home. These are our brethren and sisters. They accuse us of not being Christian. I hope that our people will try to show them, by the very manner in which they act, that we are truly disciples of the Lord."<br><br>I said to these professional journalists, "As all of you know, we carry on a vast missionary program in the Church. But it is not argumentative. We do not debate. We, in effect, simply say to others, 'Bring all the good that you have and let us see if we can add to it.'"<br><br>We have no worry about the strength of our doctrinal position. We need only explain it--not with vociferous argument, but in a quiet and friendly manner.<br><br>I hope that you will take from this university the habit of seeking knowledge and that this habit will never leave you for as long as you live. A truly educated man never ceases to learn. He never ceases to grow. I hope you young women, as you take upon yourselves the burden of rearing families, will never set aside your desire to acquire knowledge. I hope that you will read to your children. They will be blessed and you will be blessed if you do so. I hope that you will even read to your husbands. They need to be read to. I hope that you will read to yourselves.<br><br>Will you pardon me if I tell you about my father? When he was about the age that I am now, he was fully retired. But he was active. He lived in a rather simple but comfortable home in a rural area. He had an orchard around him and enjoyed giving away the fruit. The yard of his home included lawns and shrubs and trees. It had a rock wall about two feet high separating one level from another. Whenever the weather was good he would sit on the wall, an old hat on his head to shade his eyes from the summer sun. When we went to visit him I would sit beside him. With a little prompting he would talk of his life--of the time when as a boy he lived in Cove Fort. He would smile as he told of the time that his brother found a loaded pistol in the telegrapher's office. The boys began fooling around, the pistol fired, and his brother shot my father in the leg.<br><br>His father sent to Beaver for the doctor. The doctor arrived hours later and tried to remove the ball with a darning needle. He only made the pain worse. Father, sitting on his wall, would lift his pant leg, feel the flesh of his leg, and say that the ball was still there.<br><br>The family moved from Cove Fort to Fillmore, and when Father was in his late teens he came here to Provo and enrolled in the Brigham Young Academy. He was a student of Karl G. Maeser, whom he came to know well. From here he went East to school. He then came back and taught here until the First Presidency of the Church asked him to move to Salt Lake City and preside over the business college, for which the Church had great plans.<br><br>He was an educator. He was a successful businessman. He presided over the largest stake in the Church, with more than 15,000 members. He served as a mission president and in many other capacities. And now he was retired, and he sat on his wall. He was a great reader with a wonderful library. He was an excellent speaker and writer. Almost to the time he died, just short of the age of 94, he read and wrote and contemplated the knowledge that had come to him.<br><br>I discovered that when he sat on the wall, hours at a time on a warm day, he would reflect on the things he had read from his library.<br><br>I think he grew old gracefully and wonderfully. He had his books with the precious treasures they contained of the thoughts of great men and women of all the ages of time. He never ceased to learn. As he sat on the wall he thought deeply of what he had read the night before. He acquired the habit as a student here under Dr. Maeser. It was part of his BYU experience.<br><br>At times I almost envy him: time to read and time to ponder. What a blessing. He reminded me of leaves on the trees. When autumn comes with killing frost, the leaves change their color, and they give off a new beauty until they eventually drop to form a carpet on the ground.<br><br>Now, you are young, and why am I telling you of an old man and the wall on which he sat? I am telling you because I think it has a lesson for each of us. We must never cease to learn. We believe in eternal progression and that this life is a part of eternity to be profitably lived until the very end.<br><br>Now, my dear young friends, I have talked with you about the BYU experience as I sense it. I have spoken of a few of many things that are a part of it. It has or will become a part of you. You are involved in it. You are going through it. It should--it must--leave an everlasting impression upon you. It is scarcely perceptible most of the time. But it is nonetheless real. It should become an inseparable part of your very nature, something almost intangible but of great substance.<br><br>You might have gone to another school and received an excellent education. But you came here, and you were fortunate enough to be accepted. You came because you wanted the BYU experience, although perhaps you could not define it. Having gained it, never lose it. Cultivate it in your lives and hold its very essence until you grow old and gray. Even then you can sit on the wall on a warm summer day and think of the things you are still learning in light of the great experience you had as a young man or a young woman.<br><br>God bless you. I leave my love and blessing upon you and my testimony of this great work in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Gordon B. Hinckley was the president of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when this devotional address was given at Brigham Young University on 4November 1997.</i><br><br><i>© Intellectual Reserve, Inc.

<h1>e Great Test - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I have always wondered where the marvelous introductions for devotional and forum speakers came from--now I know. Thank you, President Bateman, for reading that introduction just like my mother wrote it!<br><br>You have to be careful about believing everything in introductions. A speaker at a business conference was introduced as a man who had recently made $10 million in the oil fields of Texas. The man began his remarks by stating, "It wasn't in oil, it was in coal; it wasn't in Texas, it was in Pennsylvania; and I didn't make $10 million, I<i>lost</i>$10 million."<br><br>I appreciate your attendance this morning. I realize that coming to hear from the dean of the Marriott School of Management, an accountant at that, may not be at the top of your priority list. And talk about anticlimactic: last week we were privileged to hear from our prophet, President Hinckley, and next week we get to hear from President Faust. Wow! We have such wonderful leaders. We will do well to follow our prophets.<br><br>Some of you have taken the introductory accounting course at BYU or are in the accounting program and have studied out of my textbooks. You are, no doubt, really going the extra mile in being here today. However, my kids do tell me that my accounting texts are valuable: they say that they can put them to sleep just about anytime, anywhere!<br><br>On a serious note though, for me this is a real opportunity to speak to you today. I sincerely hope and pray that something I say today will be of worth to you.<br><br>Today I'd like to talk to you about life. I hope you are happy to be alive. I hope you are grateful for the wonderful blessings that Father in Heaven gives you during this earthly existence.<br><br>Each of us have, no doubt, reflected on:<br>Where we came from;<br>Why we are here; and<br>Where we are going.<br><br>Flippantly, and with a very short-range perspective, some may say, "Well, I just came from the Tanner Building or the library or from my dorm. And I'm here because President Bateman has encouraged us to attend the devotionals or because that cute girl in my history class was coming or because I want to see if this business guy can possibly shed any light on how we integrate the sacred and the secular at BYU. As to where I'm going, I'm going to lunch. I'm starved. I sure hope this speaker doesn't talk too long."<br><br>From a more serious, longer-term, and eternal perspective, we know that we come from a pre-earthly existence where we lived as spirit children of our Heavenly Father. We know that the great plan of salvation was presented to us and that our Elder Brother agreed to make the plan effective through his atoning sacrifice. We know that we "shouted for joy" at the opportunity to come to earth (Job 38:7). We are here to gain a body and to keep the commandments so that we might grow and develop. Eventually we hope to live with our Father in Heaven and our families throughout eternity.<br><br>Today I'd like to concentrate my remarks on the purpose of this life. Specifically, I'd like to consider life as "The Great Test." And I'd like to frame my remarks in an academic setting that each of us here at BYU can perhaps relate to.<br><br>Have you ever had (or perhaps you now have) a class that you just loved, a class that taught you so much, a class that really made a difference? What was it that made that class so special? Perhaps it was a clearly written syllabus, an excellent text, an outstanding teacher, or meaningful learning assignments. Maybe you thought the final exam was fair and adequately covered the concepts learned in the course. Maybe your special course combined all of these positive elements.<br><br>To me life is just such a course. What a great opportunity and privilege to be enrolled in Life.<br><br>The objective of this course is clearly stated: "To bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man" (Moses 1:39). The course may be titled The Plan of Redemption. The instructor is the Master Teacher, our Elder Brother, the Savior of the World, Jesus Christ. He is assisted by loving parents and by living prophets and inspired Church leaders. The text is fantastic; it is called the scriptures.<br><br>The pedagogy for this course emphasizes experience-based learning. There are some important lectures and case studies that we can learn from, and there are many examples we can read about in the text (scriptures), but the greatest growth and development come from our personal experiences in trying to apply the principles that the Master Teacher has taught us and that he has shown us by his perfect example.<br><br>There are three basic and related concepts in this course that we must understand. They are<br><br>Agency,<br>Accountability, and<br>Consequences.<br><h2><b>Agency</b></h2><br>In our premortal state, as spirit children, we were given the great gift of agency--the ability to discern between good and evil and the freedom to choose between the two. We made a correct decision in choosing to support our Elder Brother's defense of agency and the plan of salvation. Satan and a third of the hosts of heaven were cast out for seeking to destroy the agency of man (see Moses 4:1–3).<br><br>In mortality, this gift of agency was continued through Adam and Eve and their posterity, which includes you and me. We continue to have this marvelous gift of agency. God will not force anyone to do good, nor can a person be forced by Satan to do evil.<br><br>A veil of forgetfulness has been placed over our eyes and minds. We cannot remember our premortal existence. We must live by faith, exercising our agency in striving to live the commandments.<br><br>Sometimes it seems that circumstances are thrust upon us that take away our freedom to choose. Consider the case of the late Viktor Frankl. In his book<i>Man's Search for Meaning,</i>Frankl describes his experience as a prisoner in the German concentration camps during World War II. There he suffered every imaginable affliction: fear, hunger, cold, brutality, the loss of his entire family (except for a sister), and all his possessions. But he still considered himself free.<br><br>Frankl says this:<br><br><i>Man</i>can<i>preserve a vestige of spiritual freedom, of independence of mind, even in such terrible conditions of psychic and physical stress. . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . Everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedoms--to choose one's attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one's own way.</i>[Viktor E. Frankl,<i>Man's Search for Meaning</i>(New York: Pocket Books, 1984), p. 86; emphasis in original]<br><br>The point is that we cannot always choose what happens to us, but we can choose how we react and how we handle the trials and situations that we are asked to face. Our beloved President Rex E. Lee and his wife, Janet, are great examples. In their book<i>The Marathon of Faith,</i>written with Jim Bell, the Lees express gratitude to their Father in Heaven for the almost nine-year extension to President Lee's life and describe that period as among the most challenging, yet rewarding of their lives. The trials, the pain, and the suffering President Lee went through did not keep him from exercising his agency to be positive, enthusiastic, and productive to the very end of his earthly life.<br><br>Similarly, Elder Neal A. Maxwell, in his April 1997 conference address, helps us understand "from whom all blessings flow." In that brief, but touching address, Elder Maxwell explains that "mortal experience points evermore to the Atonement of Jesus Christ as the central act of all human history" ("From Whom All Blessings Flow,"<i>Ensign,</i>May 1997, p. 12). Elder Maxwell refers to Alma 7:11–13. In verse 11 we read: "He shall go forth, suffering pains and afflictions and temptations of every kind." In verse 12: "And he will take upon him death, that he may loose the bands of death." And in verse 13: "The Son of God suffereth according to the flesh that he might take upon him the sins of his people." Elder Maxwell states:<br><br><i>Jesus knows how to succor us in the midst of our griefs and sicknesses precisely because Jesus has already borne our griefs and sicknesses. . . . He knows them firsthand; thus His empathy is earned. Of course, we do not comprehend it fully any more than we understand how He bore all mortal sins, but His Atonement remains the rescuing and reassuring reality.</i>["From Whom All Blessings," p. 12]<br><h2><b>Accountability and Consequences</b></h2><br>The companion principles to agency are accountability and consequences of decisions. President Wilford Woodruff said: "By virtue of this agency you and I and all mankind are made responsible beings, responsible for the course we pursue, the lives we live, the deeds we do in the body" (<i>Millennial Star</i>51, no. 41 [14 October 1889], p. 642).<br><br>Having the ability and opportunity to choose for ourselves makes us accountable for those choices. Samuel the Lamanite, in preaching to the Nephites, stated:<br><br><i>And now remember, remember, my brethren, that whosoever perisheth, perisheth unto himself; and whosoever doeth iniquity, doeth it unto himself; for behold, ye are free; ye are permitted to act for yourselves; for behold, God hath given unto you a knowledge and he hath made you free.</i><br><br><i>He hath given unto you that ye might know good from evil, and he hath given unto you that ye might choose life or death; and ye can do good and be restored unto that which is good, or have that which is good restored unto you; or ye can do evil, and have that which is evil restored unto you.</i>[Helaman 14:30–31]<br><br>Charles W. Penrose, an early Church leader, made the same point with these words:<br><br><i>Here</i>[Moses 4:2–3]<i>we read that that power of choice, the gift, the ability to understand right from wrong, to understand light from darkness, was given to the spirit of man by the Lord and He gave to him that agency, power in himself to choose the good and refuse the evil, to choose the light or the darkness as he willed. So because of that, man can be brought to judgment for the deeds that he performs, for he is not forced to do evil, neither is he forced to do right. The power of volition is in the spirit man and he brings it with him when he is born into the earthly sphere, and so we can do good or do evil as we elect, and therefore we will be brought to judgment and every man will be judged according to the deeds done while in the body; according to his works, so will his future be determined.</i>[<i>CR,</i>October 1914, p. 40]<br><br>Recognizing that there are consequences of decisions is an important part of this course of life. The consequences may be immediate or deferred for a time; they may be reversible or permanent; and they may be of little consequence or of great magnitude.<br><br>To illustrate, the decision to not eat breakfast and lunch probably means you will be pretty hungry by suppertime. For golfers, the decision (consciously or unconsciously) to leave a putt "short"<i>always</i>means the ball cannot go in the hole. The decision of our children when they were teenagers to not meet a negotiated, mutually agreed upon be-at-home time meant a meeting early the next morning with Dad to set an appropriate consequence, generally the dreaded "You're grounded." More applicable to your current situation, a decision to stay up late watching a movie and to not study for tomorrow's quiz will generally mean a lower score on that quiz. For you or your parents, a poor investment decision will likely lead to a low or perhaps no return on a particular investment. While on your mission, your decision to work hard and contact<i>lots</i>of people will lead you to a few wonderful people that the Lord has prepared to hear the gospel. For you recently returned elders, the decision to continue "contacting"<i>lots</i>of attractive young ladies will likely lead to your finding a special young lady to be your eternal companion--<i>or this isn't BYU!</i>The list of examples, some humorous and some serious, could go on and on.<br><br>The first significant consequence of a decision impacting all of us took place in the Garden of Eden. Adam and Eve were told by Father in Heaven that if they partook of the forbidden fruit, they would be cast out of the Garden and would "surely die." Adam and Eve partook of the fruit, and as a consequence physical death (mortality) came into the world.<br><br>In this regard it is instructive to observe the pattern of the Lord and how he carefully links the concepts of agency, accountability, and consequences. A careful reading of Moses 3:15–17 shows that the Lord first gives us a stewardship: "And I, the Lord God, took the man, and put him into the Garden of Eden, to dress it, and to keep it." Then the Lord gives us clear instructions so that we can understand what is expected: "And I, the Lord God, commanded the man, saying: Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat, But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it." But the Lord also gives us our agency and then makes us accountable, having an understanding of the consequences of our decisions: "Nevertheless, thou mayest choose for thyself, for it is given unto thee; but, remember that I forbid it, for in the day thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die."<br><br>It is also important to note that Adam and Eve voluntarily partook of the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, understanding the consequences of that decision. They knew they would be cast out of the Garden of Eden, but they also knew it was better to experience the sorrows of life in order to have joy and happiness with their posterity.<br><br>We read in the Pearl of Great Price:<br><br><i>And in that day Adam blessed God and was filled, and began to prophesy concerning all the families of the earth, saying: Blessed be the name of God, for because of my transgression my eyes are opened, and in this life I shall have joy, and again in the flesh I shall see God.</i><br><br><i>And Eve, his wife, heard all these things and was glad, saying: Were it not for our transgression we never should have had seed, and never should have known good and evil, and the joy of our redemption, and the eternal life which God giveth unto all the obedient.</i>[Moses 5:10–11]<br><br>Another significant consequence of a decision that has had far-reaching impact in our lives is the result of a simple, yet great principle found in James 1:5: "If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally." In the spring of 1820 Joseph Smith applied this principle and had the marvelous experience of being instructed by Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ. Subsequently, as the Prophet Joseph Smith continued to make righteous decisions, he became the instrument in the Lord's hand to bring about the restoration of the gospel in these latter days.<br><br>All consequences of the positive decisions relating to the restoration of the gospel are too numerous to mention here, but they include the establishment of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, now numbering more than $10 million members; the restoration of priesthood authority to the earth; the building of temples throughout the world where eternal ordinances can be performed; the calling of living prophets to direct us; and almost 60,000 full-time missionaries working to bless the lives of the peoples of the earth. And certainly not the least of these consequences is the fervent testimony that you and I can have of the truthfulness of this great work and of our role in building the kingdom.<br><br>The scriptures give us many additional examples of the consequences of important decisions. To name but a few, the decision to live the Word of Wisdom brings the promise that we will receive health and find wisdom and "shall run and not be weary, and shall walk and not faint" (D&amp;amp;C 89:18–21). The decision to pay our tithes and offerings brings the promise that the windows of heaven shall be opened and the blessings of heaven showered upon us (see Malachi 3). The decision to magnify the priesthood brings with it the wonderful promise that we may be sanctified by the Spirit and receive<i>all</i>that our Father has, as a part of the oath and covenant of the priesthood (see D&amp;amp;C 84:33–41).<br><br>The Prophet Joseph Smith received several revelations pointing out the positive consequences (i.e., the rewards) that come from choosing the right. We read in the Doctrine and Covenants: "Fear not to do good, my sons, for whatsoever ye sow, that shall ye also reap; therefore, if ye sow good ye shall also reap good for your reward" (D&amp;amp;C 6:33). "For the power is in them, wherein they are agents unto themselves. And inasmuch as men do good they shall in nowise lose their reward" (D&amp;amp;C 58:28). "But learn that he who doeth the works of righteousness shall receive his reward, even peace in this world, and eternal life in the world to come" (D&amp;amp;C 59:23).<br><br>The general rule, then, is that poor decisions lead to unfavorable consequences--whether of a physical, economic, or spiritual nature. Good decisions lead to positive consequences, even eternal life.<br><br>But we don't always make good decisions. Sometimes we make mistakes. Sometimes we sin by not following the commandments. Fortunately, in this course of life, our Master Teacher has both the ability and the willingness to intercede in our behalf. And because of him, we can<i>always</i>rectify our mistakes through the repentance process.<br><br>The consequence of Christ's decision to voluntarily lay down his life for us to atone for our sins is that he has prepared the way for us to live again with him and our Father in Heaven. We all will be resurrected, and those who choose to repent and to keep the commandments and endure to the end can have eternal life because of Jesus Christ and the great plan of redemption.<br><br>The quizzes, the smaller tests in life, will come in a variety of different forms. Each must be answered with individual integrity and with a firm grasp of the basic concepts and values taught by the Master.<br><br>As one example, I'd like to relate a brief story entitled "Appointment with Love."<br><br><i>Six minutes to six, said the clock over the information booth in New York's Grand Central Station. The tall, young Army lieutenant lifted his sunburned face and narrowed his eyes to note the exact time. His heart was pounding with a beat that shocked him. In six minutes he would see the woman he had never seen, yet whose written words had sustained him unfailingly.</i><br><br><i>Lieutenant Blandford remembered one day in particular, the worst of the fighting, when his plane had been caught in the midst of a pack of enemy planes.</i><br><br><i>In one of his letters, he had confessed to her that he often felt fear, and only a few days before this battle, he had received her answer: "Of course you fear . . . all brave men do. Next time you doubt yourself, I want you to hear my voice reciting to you: "Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for Thou art with me." He had remembered, and it had renewed his strength.</i><br><br><i>Now he was going to hear her real voice. Four minutes to six.</i><br><br><i>A girl passed close to him, and Lieutenant Blandford started forward. She was wearing a flower, but it was not the little red rose they had agreed upon. Besides, this girl was only about 18, and Hollis Olson had told him she was 30. "What of it?" he answered, "I'm 32." He was 29.</i><br><br><i>His mind went back to the book he had read in the training camp. "Of Human Bondage," it was; and throughout the book were notes in a woman's writing. He had never believed that a woman could see into a man's heart so tenderly, so understandingly. Her name was on the bookplate: Hollis Olson. He had gotten hold of a New York City telephone book and found her address. He had written; she had answered. Next day he had been shipped out, but they had gone on writing.</i><br><br><i>For thirteen months she had faithfully replied. When his letters did not arrive, she wrote anyway, and now he believed he loved her, and she loved him.</i><br><br><i>But she had refused all his pleas to send him her photograph. She had explained: "If your feeling for me has any reality, what I look like won't matter. Suppose I'm beautiful. I'd always be haunted that you had been taking a chance on just that, and that kind of love would disgust me. Suppose I'm plain (and you must admit that this is more likely), then I'd always fear that you were only going on writing because you were lonely and had no one else. No, don't ask for my picture. When you come to New York, you shall see me and then you shall make your decision.</i><br><br><i>One minute to six. . . . He nervously paced the floor. Then Lieutenant Blandford's heart leaped. A young woman was coming toward him. Her figure was long and slim; her blond hair lay back in curls from her delicate ears. Her eyes were blue as flowers, her lips and chin had a gentle firmness. Her pale green suit made her look like springtime come alive.</i><br><br><i>He started toward her, forgetting to notice that she was wearing no rose, and as he moved, a small, provocative smile curved her lips.</i><br><br><i>"Going my way, soldier?" she murmured.</i><br><br><i>He made one step closer to her. Then he saw Hollis Olson. She was standing almost directly behind the girl, a woman well past 40, her graying hair tucked under a worn hat. She was more than plump; her thick-ankled feet were thrust into low-heeled shoes. But she wore a red rose on her rumpled coat. The girl in the green suit was walking away quickly.</i><br><br><i>Blandford felt as though he were being split in two, so keen was his desire to follow the girl, yet so deep was his longing for the woman whose spirit had truly companioned his own; and there she stood. He could see that her pale, plump face was gentle and sensible; her gray eyes had a warm twinkle.</i><br><br><i>Lieutenant Blandford did not hesitate. His fingers gripped the worn copy of "Of Human Bondage," which was to identify him to her. This would not be love, but it would be something precious, a friendship for which he would ever be and had been ever grateful.</i><br><br><i>He squared his shoulders, saluted, and held the book out toward the woman, although even while he spoke he felt the bitterness of his disappointment.</i><br><br><i>"I'm Lieutenant John Blandford, and you--you are Miss Olson. I'm so glad you could meet me. May--may I take you to dinner?"</i><br><br><i>The woman's face broadened in a tolerant smile. "I don't know what this is all about, son," she answered. "That young lady in the green suit, she begged me to wear this rose on my coat. And she said that if you asked me to go out with you, I should tell you she's waiting for you in that restaurant across the street. She said it was some kind of a test."</i><br><br>We, too, must pass the tests of life. But one of the best parts about this course of life is the grading--there are no grading curves. All of us can get A's through reliance on our Master Teacher. If we do<i>all</i>we can, our Savior has promised that he will do the rest (see 2 Nephi 25:23). He'll make up the difference in our score so that we can get 100 percent and, therefore, the top reward from the course.<br><br>Now we don't know when our personal final exam is scheduled. Life is uncertain in that regard. So we shouldn't procrastinate the day of our repentance. We should keep current, we should read the text (the scriptures) daily, and we should communicate daily (through prayer) with our teacher and ask for his help. And we should provide meaningful service to our fellowmen and otherwise try to emulate our Master Teacher.<br><br>The prophet Lehi, in teaching his sons, summed up the essence of this course of life in these words:<br><br><i>But behold, all things have been done in the wisdom of him who knoweth all things.</i><br><br><i>Adam fell that men might be; and men are, that they might have joy.</i><br><br><i>And the Messiah cometh in the fulness of time, that he may redeem the children of men from the fall. And because that they are redeemed from the fall they have become free forever, knowing good from evil; to act for themselves and not to be acted upon, save it be by the punishment of the law at the great and last day, according to the commandments which God hath given.</i><br><br><i>Wherefore, men are free according to the flesh; and all things are given them which are expedient unto man. And they are free to choose liberty and eternal life, through the great Mediator of all men, or to choose captivity and death, according to the captivity and power of the devil; for he seeketh that all men might be miserable like unto himself.</i><br><br><i>And now, my sons, I would that ye should look to the great Mediator, and hearken unto his great commandments; and be faithful unto his words, and choose eternal life, according to the will of his Holy Spirit.</i>[2 Nephi 2:24–28]<br><br>I conclude with words from a beautiful song entitled "The Test," written by Janice Kapp Perry:<br><br><i>Tell me friend, I see your trials,<br>Why doesn't He who worked the miracles send solace to his child?<br>Tell me friend, if you understand,<br>Why doesn't He with pow'r to raise the dead just make you whole again?<br>It would be so easy for Him.<br>I watch you and in sorrow question why<br>Then you, my friend, in perfect faith reply:</i><br><br>(Chorus)<br><br><i>Didn't He say He sent us to be tested?<br>Didn't He say the way would not be sure?<br>But didn't He say we could live with Him forevermore, well and whole if we but patiently endure?<br>After the trial we will be blessed, but this life is the test.</i><br>[Janice Kapp Perry, "The Test"]<br><br>I am grateful for this mortal life, for the opportunities that are mine, for my wonderful wife and family. I bear testimony that God's plan of salvation will bring us happiness if we choose wisely. I am very grateful for a loving Father in Heaven and for my Savior. I bear testimony of them in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>K. Fred Skousen was the dean of the BYU Marriott School of Management when this devotional address was given on 11 November 1997.</i><br><br><i>© Brigham Young University. All rights reserved.</i>

<h1>early, Act Well, Appreciate - Learning for Eternity - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
President Bateman, distinguished faculty, students--brothers and sisters all--coming to Brigham Young University is always a pleasure for many reasons. One is the special spirit on this campus. Another is the friendly, understanding atmosphere that obtains between students and faculty. A few years ago the<i>Reader's Digest</i>printed the following account from a student at this university:<br><br><i>During my first semester at Brigham Young University, I forgot to take a science test. Panic-stricken, I approached the professor to explain my predicament. He looked at me sternly and asked, "Were you ill?"</i><br><br><i>"No," I answered.</i><br><br><i>"Well, did you have a family emergency?" he questioned.</i><br><br><i>"No," I repeated.</i><br><br><i>He tried once more. "Are you a freshman?" I nodded. "Good enough," he said and handed me the make-up slip.</i>[Campus Comedy,<i>Reader's Digest,</i>October 1992, p. 7]<br><br>You young people live in a time of peace and tranquillity. As I began my college career, we were faced with the ominous clouds of the terrible Second World War. You are also enjoying a time of economic prosperity. We were just emerging from the Great Depression.<br><br>I congratulate you students. You have the high honor of attending what a recent article in<i>Insight</i>magazine described as the most politically incorrect university in America (as reported in "BYU Praised for Political Incorrectness by Magazine,"<i>Salt Lake Tribune,</i>25 September 1997, p. D3). As I understand it, this dubious honor was earned because this institution knows its purpose. It has not strayed from its mission by following the popular sophistries of education. The article stated that prestigious schools such as Harvard and Yale, which were founded as religious institutions of learning, have "altered their academic makeup to fit notions of what's fashionable in education" ("BYU Praised," p. D3). In education, being politically correct implies following the philosophy of the current trendsetters.<br><br>I have said repeatedly that Brigham Young University is a continuing experiment on whether an institution--the majority of whose trustees are prophets, seers, and revelators--can continue to be true to its trust by the world's changing standards and yet be a first-class university academically. Elder Jeffrey R. Holland said it well: "The 'watchmen on the tower' cry out for those who will integrate, coalesce, clarify, and give both order and rank to important human knowledge" ("A School in Zion," BYU Annual University Conference address, August 1988, p. 27). At Brigham Young University the secular must be taught in a spiritual context. Indeed, as President Spencer W. Kimball points out, "The secular without the foundation of the spiritual is but like the foam upon the milk, the fleeting shadow" (<i>TSWK,</i>p. 390).<br><br>Each of you, on a personal level, has the same challenge that exists for the university. You need to know the purpose for your being. Each of you needs to ask yourself, Why am I here on earth? Why am I at this university rather than at any other university, one that will teach only secular learning? Am I here to enjoy a scintillating social life? Is it to support the athletic program? Is it to find a companion? The answer is, You are here to learn for eternity.<br><br>A year ago, when President Gordon B. Hinckley was on this campus, he admonished:<br><br><i>If this university meets the purpose for which it is maintained, then you must leave here not alone with secular knowledge but, even more important, with a spiritual and moral foundation that will find expression to improve the family, the community, the nation, even the world of which you will be a part.</i>[Gordon B. Hinckley, "Stand Up for Truth,"<i>BYU 1996–97 Speeches</i>(Provo: Brigham Young University, 1997), p. 23]<br><br>Learning and education have always been the hallmark of our people. Every president of the Church, beginning with President Joseph Smith, has zealously fostered, encouraged, and supported the cause of education. The reason for this emphasis is that education equates with our eternal well-being. In a First Presidency message dated March 26, 1907, the Brethren said:<br><br><i>To the Latter-day Saints, salvation itself, under the atonement of Christ, is a process of education. That knowledge is a means of eternal progress, was taught by Joseph Smith:--It is impossible for a man to be saved in ignorance.--A man is saved no faster than he gets knowledge.--The glory of God is intelligence.</i>[<i>Messages of the First Presidency of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints,</i>comp. James R. Clark (Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1970), 4:146–47]<br><br>In the law school I attended not far from here, our dean told us we were studying the law so that we could learn to think straight. He said the law would change, but if we could learn to think critically by separating the wheat from the chaff, we would be better qualified to become effective advocates. Brigham Young stated it better: "Education is the power to think clearly, the power to act well in the world's work, and the power to appreciate life" (Brigham Young, quoted by George H. Brimhall in "The Brigham Young University,"<i>Improvement Era,</i>vol. 23, no. 9 [July 1920], p. 831).<br><h2><b>Think Clearly</b></h2><br>Thinking clearly does not mean we can think "by infection, catching an opinion like a cold" (John Ruskin, in<i>Dictionary of Humorous Quotations,</i>ed. Evan Esar [New York: Paperback Library, Inc., 1949], p. 154). Thinking clearly is the ability to discern things that matter most and separate them from things of less importance. We can think more clearly when we:<br><br>1. Take an interest in current events: listen to the news or read a newspaper.<br><br>2. Discuss ideas with one another, even in the courses you are taking! The Internet can be fascinating, but so can a conversation with a live person with whom you can exchange original thoughts.<br><br>3. Read good literature. This is, of course, expected of English majors, but for the rest of us good literature is just as important. It improves our vocabularies as well as our minds.<br><br>4. Keep our bodies healthy. Go for a walk and look at the trees, the birds, the flowers, the mountains, and the sky. This campus has one of the most beautiful settings in the world. Enjoy the view along with your exercise. A healthy body promotes a healthy mind.<br><br>Questions--in the sense of searching, not doubting--seem to be essential for learning. They are a primary means of expressing curiosity, the self-motivation to search for knowledge. Indeed, many of the Prophet Joseph Smith's revelations<br><br><i>came in response to enquiry, in response to prayer. "Ask and ye shall receive;" "Seek and ye shall find," seems to have been the principle on which the Lord has acted with reference to giving revelations.</i>[<i>HC</i>2:210, footnote]<br><br><i>Such inquiries may be considered as a condition precedent to his receiving revelations.</i>[<i>HC</i>5:xxxiv]<br><br>In today's jargon, thinking clearly is often characterized as "prioritizing." But clear thinking means more than that: it is choosing the better part, not the one that will bring the most money or fame. It also means making the best use of our time. Let us not be like he who said: "I never put off till tomorrow what I can possibly do the day after" (Oscar Wilde, in<i>Dictionary of Humorous Quotations,</i>p. 191).<br><h2><b>Act Well</b></h2><br>We have all heard the axiom that knowledge is power. But President Stephen L Richards put this into proper perspective when he said:<br><br><i>Knowledge is power, today and always, but it is power only when it is put into service. The acquisition of all the world's learning is really futile, except in application. The best in life is that which is given to serve the noblest causes and the highest purposes.</i>[Stephen L Richards,<i>Where Is Wisdom?</i>(Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Company, 1955), p. 408]<br><br>What kind of a heart will each of you have when you graduate from Brigham Young University? Graduating from this distinguished school with any degree is a notable achievement. Having higher degrees can promote a sense of pride. All of you are anxious to receive your degrees, particularly a doctor of philosophy. This is a high academic achievement. A newly degreed professor at the University of Southern California reported that "a friend had called his home and asked, 'Is the doctor in?' The professor's ten-year-old son replied, 'Yes, but he's not the kind who can do you any good'" (Campus Comedy,<i>Reader's Digest,</i>April 1997, p. 48.)<br><br>Dealing with lofty issues should not generate pride, which is an enemy to learning spiritual things. The training of the heart comes by and through the Holy Spirit. Reaching for eternity requires an understanding heart. We can all learn from the great Solomon, who, when he was made the king of Israel, said:<br><br><i>I am but a little child: I know not how to go out or come in....</i><br><br><i>Give therefore thy servant an understanding heart to judge thy people, that I may discern between good and bad: for who is able to judge this thy so great a people?</i>[1 Kings 3:7, 9]<br><br>This so pleased the Lord that he said, "I have given thee a wise and an understanding heart; so that there was none like thee before thee, neither after thee shall any arise like unto thee" (1 Kings 3:12).<br><br>The patient training of the heart will also lead us to acts of kindness. You may have heard the old ditty: "Kindness is to do and say the nicest things in the nicest way." This means being courteous at home to roommates and in the classroom to other students. I mentioned the<i>patient</i>training of the heart because right now with all our road construction we need to be more patient and consciously courteous while driving on the busy highways. You can make a difference. Do not let yourselves be drawn into road rage. Slow down. Play a tape of pleasant music and remember what the Savior taught: "For out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh" (Matthew 12:34).<br><br>Sometimes we get too caught up with our cars. I remember reading about Ty, a young man in Seattle who was preparing to go to college:<br><br>[He]<i>pleaded with his parents to let him take his car to school. They consented, with words of caution about driving around town when he should be studying. But they needn't have worried.</i><br><br><i>After a few weeks on campus Ty called home for some supplies. His mother said she'd send him money. "You can drive to the shopping center and get what you need," she said, "and we'll save the shipping cost."</i><br><br><i>"What!" exclaimed Ty. "And lose my parking space?"</i>[Campus Comedy,<i>Reader's Digest,</i>June 1994, p. 123]<br><h2><b>Appreciate Life</b></h2><br>Enjoy what you do whether it be studying for a degree, earning a living, or raising a family--or all three! In the rush of campus life we are prone to a kind of blindness that keeps us from appreciating our full opportunities. In Thornton Wilder's play<i>Our Town,</i>the heroine, Emily, recognizes too late some of those simple but beautiful blessings that she had taken for granted all of her life. Emily dies in childbirth, but before passing on, she is given the opportunity to relive one day of her life. She chooses her twelfth birthday and is able to watch herself and others as they were on that day. It is then that she realizes the precious beauty of the ordinary things of everyday life--clocks ticking, sunflowers, the old white fence that once stood around her house, food, freshly ironed dresses, hot baths, sleeping, and waking up.<br><br>At last the magnificent beauty of all she had barely seen as she lived overwhelmed her, and she cried out:<br><br><i>Oh, earth, you're too wonderful for anybody to realize you. Do any human beings ever realize life while they live it--every, every minute?</i>[Thornton Wilder,<i>Our Town</i>(1938), act 3]<br><br>The clocks tick as you pursue your studies at Brigham Young University. This should be a happy time as you move forward, tooling up for your working lives. Don't forget to laugh at the silly things that happen. Humor is built very largely upon incongruities and contrasts. It is a powerful force for good when used with discretion. Its physical expression, laughter, is highly therapeutic.<br><br>To summarize, President Brigham Young's statement really is talking about internalizing what we learn, going from what we<i>know</i>to what we<i>do</i>to what we<i>are.</i>All our learning and living should prepare us for leadership in the Church and the community. As President Hugh B. Brown pointed out:<br><br><i>Every doctrine has its associated duty, ... every truth has its task. The gospel when the Master first proclaimed it, was not intended primarily for preaching--it was intended for action....</i><br><br><i>No man can truly assimilate Christianity by impression alone, there must be expression as well.</i>["Service,"<i>Relief Society Magazine,</i>December 1969, p. 888]<br><br>For 25 years I have been privileged to walk with and sit at the feet of the prophets almost daily. Some have excelled academically or in the business world. Others achieved distinction in medicine, in science, or in law. Yet they are all men of great humility and wisdom. They bear witness, as expressed by our late President Howard W. Hunter, that<br><br><i>belief must be realized in personal achievement. Real Christians must understand that the gospel of Jesus Christ is not just a gospel of belief; it is a plan of action. His gospel is a gospel of imperatives, and the very nature of its substance is a call to action.</i>[<i>CR,</i>April 1967, p. 115]<br><br>Do not become puffed up with pride as you progress in secular learning.<br><br>My challenge to you is to learn to think spiritually. That is far harder to master than learning by rote the many facets of secular education. I emphasize spiritual thinking because secular learning is ever changing. Even the so-called exact sciences, with some exceptions, are changing. Spiritual knowledge and intelligence are unchanging and eternal.<br><br>Your purpose in being at Brigham Young University is to help you reach to eternity. The quest for eternity begins now, this year, this month, this day, this moment. You want to be able to compete as competent equals with others in your discipline.<br><br>As we think about what we will take into the eternities, it will only be our faith and our understanding and knowledge, both spiritual and temporal.<br><br><i>Whatever principle of intelligence we attain unto in this life, it will rise with us in the resurrection.</i><br><br><i>And if a person gains more knowledge and intelligence in this life through his diligence and obedience than another, he will have so much the advantage in the world to come.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 130:18-19]<br><br>We do not want to arrive in the next world educationally bankrupt, though I am afraid I have a lot of chemistry and math to learn! I hope I will be a better student there. Also, I expect our teachers there will have enhanced abilities.<br><br>For many students in higher education, going to a university is a game, a self-defeating game. To them it is a process of cramming like the seagulls in pioneer times when the crops were threatened by crickets. The gulls came and devoured, then they would fly off to disgorge and return to devour again. Learning is more than cramming for tests. Education is more than bulimia at exam time.<br><br>I learned that in my own discipline of the law. Reading the cases and briefing them for possible recitation in the classroom is difficult, arduous, challenging work. You cannot learn the rules of law just by having a good heart. Some found that they could buy canned briefs as a shortcut to the laborious work of reading and briefing the cases. However, in an hour of need in the courtroom, they were apt to find themselves doing a disservice to their clients and embarrassing themselves. There is no simple substitute for the hard work of learning well the rules of law. And so it is with us. In the courtroom of life we need to have well-honed skills.<br><br>President Lorenzo Snow taught:<br><br><i>The whole idea of Mormonism is improvement--mentally, physically, morally, and spiritually. No half-way education suffices for the Latter-day Saint. He holds with Herbert Spencer that the function of education is to "prepare man for complete living," but he also maintains that "complete living" should be interpreted "life here and hereafter." Joseph Smith declared that the glory of God is intelligence, that a man is saved no faster than he gets knowledge, and that whatever principles of intelligence he attains to in this life, they will rise with him in the resurrection, giving him the advantage over ignorance and evil in the world to come. He taught that man by constantly progressing may eventually develop into a divine being, like unto his Father in Heaven.</i>[<i>Teachings of Lorenzo Snow</i>(Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1984), p. 27]<br><br>My dear young friends, we hope you are enjoying your years at Brigham Young University. As you grow older you will look back on this season of your life as one of the sweet experiences in your preparation for eternity. Please know that we have confidence in you. We pray for you. Only through the quality of your lives, your achievements, your faith, and devotion can you justify the expenditure of the widow's mite to provide this religious and secular education for you. I know of the heartache of thousands who are not so privileged. I have a beautiful, gifted, intelligent granddaughter who applied for admission to Brigham Young University and was not accepted because her grades were just a whisker below the minimum requirements. It made all of our family feel bad, but she has fully recovered. She has gone to another university and is getting a good education, and she will be married to an exceptionally fine young man in the Salt Lake Temple in just a few weeks.<br><br>May our Heavenly Father bless you so that you will have the vision, an enlarged vision, of the purpose of your being at Brigham Young University and a full realization that you are in fact learning for eternity.<br><br>I bear witness of the divinity of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, of his atonement, of his resurrection, of the restoration of the gospel in our day and time by our great prophet of this dispensation, Joseph Smith. I also bear testimony of the divine leadership that is coming to this church through the present prophet of our day and time, President Gordon B. Hinckley. I leave you this witness and testimony in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>James E.

<h1>e of the Lord - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Today I would like to speak with you about a topic that is of the most singular importance to every person here. It is a topic that is especially important to you who are young adults and facing some of the most important decisions of your life--mission, education, career, marriage. That topic is personal revelation, or hearing the voice of the Lord.<br><br>When we are baptized and confirmed members of the Church, we are commanded to receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. When you think about it, that is an incredible gift. Imagine receiving a member of the Godhead as our personal companion. We are told that our mission in life is to "come unto Christ, and be perfected in him" (Moroni 10:32). But that is not a simple thing. Life is too complex to provide a rule book that covers every situation. Instead, the Lord has given us the Holy Ghost to serve as our teacher, watchman, mentor, and guide.<br><br>I believe that one of the most important challenges of our mortal probation is learning to hear, recognize, and then follow the voice of the Lord. I would like to say that again:<i>One of the most important--if not the most important--challenges in learning how to come unto Christ and to be perfected in him is to learn to hear, to recognize, and then to follow the voice of the Lord.</i><br><br>Part of that challenge is that there is sometimes confusion in the minds of some about personal revelation. Others have important questions about how it works or what it is like. Have you heard statements such as these: "How do I know if an impression is really from the Lord or if it is just my own emotions?" Or "I never seem to have a spiritual experience." Or "I have prayed again and again about this. Why isn't the Lord answering me?"<br><br>Let me give just one quick example of how the area of personal revelation can sometimes get confusing. When I was teaching in the institutes of religion in Southern California, there was hardly a semester that went by that I didn't have an experience like this: One of my students would come to me (usually a girl) and report that the boy she had been dating (sometimes seriously, sometimes casually) had received a "revelation" that they were to marry. I won't ask for a show of hands how many here have faced a similar declaration, but I know, from my own experience, it will be more than a few of you. Carlfred Broderick, a renowned LDS family therapist, dubbed these as "hormonal revelations" (Carlfred Broderick,<i>One Flesh, One Heart: Putting Celestial Love into Your Temple Marriage</i>[Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Company, 1986], p. 21).<br><br>The interesting thing to me was that often the girl felt intimidated by such a declaration, feeling that she needed to accept the "Lord's will" even though she found the prospect somewhat distasteful. [In some cases that was downright distasteful.] Some were even a little shocked when I boldly explained that unless they received an independent confirmation from the Lord, they should feel no pressure to accept the boy's request.<br><br>Today I should like to address three questions about personal revelation:<br><br>1. What is the voice of the Lord like?<br><br>2. How can I distinguish between true and counterfeit revelation?<br><br>3. What can I do to enhance my ability to hear, recognize, and follow the voice of the Lord?<br><h2><b>Question 1: What Is the Voice of the Lord Like?</b></h2><br>There are two scriptures in the Doctrine and Covenants that are particularly helpful in describing what the voice of the Lord is like and how it works with us. The first is in section 85, wherein the Lord says: "Thus saith the still small voice, which whispereth through and pierceth all things" (D&amp;amp;C 85:6).<br><br>Note the descriptive phrases used here. The voice is still. It is small. And it whispers. When you think about that, it becomes clear that hearing the voice of the Lord has inherent challenges. It would be much simpler if the Lord spoke in a voice of thunder or used a microphone and 80-megawatt speakers. Then there would be no doubt. But he does not. He whispers. His voice is still and small. Elder Boyd K. Packer said this about the nature of the Lord's voice:<br><br><i>The Spirit does not get our attention by shouting or shaking us with a heavy hand. Rather it whispers. It caresses so gently that if we are preoccupied we may not feel it at all. . . .</i><br><br><i>Occasionally it will press just firmly enough for us to pay heed. But most of the time, if we do not heed the gentle feeling, the Spirit will withdraw and wait until we come seeking and listening.</i>[Boyd K. Packer, "The Candle of the Lord,"<i>Ensign,</i>January 1983, p. 53]<br><br>The second scripture that tells us what the voice of the Lord is like is found in section 8, a revelation given through the Prophet Joseph Smith to Oliver Cowdery. In that section the Lord defined what revelation is and how it comes:<br><br><i>Yea, behold, I will tell you in your mind and in your heart, by the Holy Ghost, which shall come upon you and which shall dwell in your heart.</i><br><br><i>Now, behold, this is the spirit of revelation.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 8:2–3]<br><br>"In your mind and in your heart"--think about that for a moment. If the Lord spoke something to our mind, how would it come? We would probably describe it as coming to us as "thoughts." If he tells us something in our hearts, we would probably describe that as coming as "feelings."<br><br>Thoughts and feelings--these are the most common ways the Lord gives his children personal revelation. And therein lies another challenge. Every one of us is a veritable stream of thoughts and feelings. Every day our minds are constantly occupied with thoughts, and we are filled with various emotions. In the midst of that torrent of thought and feeling, the Lord from time to time inserts a thought or a feeling that comes from him. How do we tell the difference? Revelation is rarely preceded by a drumroll or by the announcement "The following thought or feeling will be from the Lord."<br><br>There is yet one other thing we need to note when we talk about what the voice of the Lord is like. It has to do with revelation that does not come from the Lord. Note what Elder Packer said about counterfeit revelation:<br><br><i>Be ever on guard lest you be deceived by inspiration from an unworthy source. You can be given false spiritual messages. There are counterfeit spirits just as there are counterfeit angels. . . .</i><br><br><i>The spiritual part of us and the emotional part of us are so closely linked that it is possible to mistake an emotional impulse for something spiritual. We occasionally find people who receive what they assume to be spiritual promptings from God, when those promptings are either centered in the emotions or are from the adversary.</i>[Packer, "Candle," pp. 55–56]<br><br>If something is counterfeit, it means that it resembles the original so closely that it is difficult to distinguish which is the true and which is the false. So it is with counterfeit revelation. On the surface it may feel real. It may appear to be from the Lord. We may even have very strong feelings about what we have received. But this alone is not proof it is from God. Note that President Packer warns that we must<i>ever be on guard</i>against being deceived by our emotions or by revelation from an unworthy source. That suggests that counterfeit revelation is not a rare thing.<br><br>This shouldn't be too surprising to you, should it? If you were Satan and knew that personal revelation was absolutely essential for a person striving to come unto Christ, wouldn't you try to sow confusion and deception about it? Which brings us to our second question.<br><h2><b>Question 2: How Can I Distinguish Between True and Counterfeit Revelation?</b></h2><br>Personal revelation comes in many different ways and forms. It may vary from one person to another, and therefore it is difficult to set down rigid rules that cover every situation. But the Lord has not left us without guidance in this matter. Through the scriptures and the statements of his modern prophets, we find principles that can help us determine how to decide if revelation comes from the Lord or from another source. I would like to briefly outline five of those guidelines or principles to you today. There are others, but these have proven to be particularly helpful to me.<br><br>Principle 1:<i>It is God who determines all aspects of revelation</i>.<br><br>By definition, revelation is the communication of the mind and will of the Lord to his children. If you think about that for a moment, then you will understand that revelation is always unidirectional. It comes only from God to us. We may communicate back and forth with God in a two-way process, but revelation always comes in one direction. We never reveal anything to God.<br><br>Since all revelation comes from the Lord, then it is reasonable that he should set all of the parameters of that revelation. Those parameters include (a)<i>to whom</i>a revelation is given; (b)<i>what</i>content is given in the revelation; (c)<i>when</i>the revelation comes; and (d) in<i>what form</i>the revelation may be given. Sometimes, with the best of intentions, we inadvertently seek to tell the Lord how he should conduct his business. We may feel a particular urgency about a question and press the Lord for an answer by a certain deadline. Or we may strongly desire a particular kind of manifestation, such as one of the more dramatic forms of revelation, and be satisfied with nothing less. We may try to tell the Lord how to solve our problems or what answer we would like. But these are not our choices. All aspects of the revelation are determined by the Lord.<br><br>Elder Packer counseled against trying to force spiritual things:<br><br><i>It is not wise to wrestle with the revelations with such insistence as to demand immediate answers or blessings to your liking. You cannot force spiritual things. Such words as compel, coerce, constrain, pressure, demand, do not describe our privileges with the Spirit. . . . You can create a climate to foster growth . . . ; but you cannot force or compel. . . .</i><br><br>[And then comes this warning:]<i>. . . Do not force it or you will open the way to be misled.</i>[Packer, "Candle," p. 53]<br><br>Note that he says we can create a climate that fosters spiritual growth. Through appropriate action we can influence the process of revelation. We can study and pray, on occasion we can add fasting to our prayers, we can importune the Lord with deep yearnings, we can keep sacred covenants--all of these will help create a climate that fosters spiritual growth. But we must remember that when all is done, it is still up to the Lord to determine when the revelation comes, how it is given, what is revealed, and to whom.<br><br>In connection with the principle that God determines all aspects of revelation, I should like to make two other points. The prophet Jacob taught a simple principle with these words: "Seek not to counsel the Lord, but to take counsel from his hand" (Jacob 4:10). Think about that for a moment. God's wisdom is infinitely greater than ours. His knowledge is infinitely more complete. How foolish we are when we presume to tell him how he should do his work.<br><br>There is also great wisdom in what some have called the Gethsemane principle. With the utmost earnestness and the deepest of pleadings, the Savior called on his Father in the Garden of Gethsemane to remove the dreaded cup of his coming sacrifice. But that request was followed immediately by these profound words: "Nevertheless not as I will, but as thou wilt" (Matthew 26:39). That should be part of every prayer we utter, every request we take to the Lord. In that simple phrase lies the key to our willingness to let the Lord decide what is best.<br><br>Principle 2:<i>The content given in a revelation is more important than the form in which it comes.</i><br><br>Another mistake some make is to covet the more dramatic forms of revelation. God reveals his mind and will to man across a broad spectrum of experiences. These may range from the very direct and dramatic: the appearance of divine beings, open visions, fire from heaven. Or they may be very subtle: quiet premonitions, gentle thoughts, a feeling of peace. The latter are by far the most common. We must be careful that we don't feel that only the more direct forms of revelation are valid. President Spencer W. Kimball warned of this tendency:<br><br><i>Even in our day, many people . . . expect if there be revelation it will come with awe-inspiring, earth-shaking display. . . .</i><br><br><i>The burning bushes, the smoking mountains . . . , the Cumorahs, and the Kirtlands were realities;</i>but they were the exceptions.<i>The great volume of revelation came to Moses and to Joseph and comes to today's prophet in the less spectacular way--</i>that of deep impressions,<i>without spectacle or glamour or dramatic events.</i><br><br><i>Always expecting the spectacular, many will miss entirely the constant flow of revealed communication.</i>[Spencer W. Kimball,<i>CR,</i>Munich Germany Area Conference, 1973, pp. 76–77; emphasis added]<br><br>We must learn to be content, not only with what the Lord decides to reveal to us but with what form he chooses to send that revelation. As Elder Packer warned, if we try to force a spiritual manifestation to our liking, we open the way for us to be deceived.<br><br>Principle 3:<i>True revelation does not contradict gospel principles or go contrary to established Church policy and procedure.</i><br><br>This principle seems self-evident and hardly worthy of mention, but again and again we hear of cases where the principle is violated. Sensational stories or wild rumors go through the Church like wildfire. Some are almost ridiculous in nature, and yet there are still those who believe them. For example, one story that has been around for years tells of a hitchhiker supposedly picked up by Church members. As they drive along, the hitchhiker tells the people that if they don't have their food storage now, it is too late. Then he mysteriously disappears out of the car. You would think that everyone would be skeptical of such a story, but there are always a few who believe it. In another case a person predicted that the great earthquake foretold in the scriptures was about to hit Utah. For months he was a popular fireside speaker, and tapes of his talk were widely distributed. Do you remember a major earthquake in Utah in recent years? Neither do I. Another man worked out the exact day and date that Christ will come, and that, too, went around the Church like a sensation. The scriptures say that "no man, no, not [even] the angels of heaven" know the day nor the hour of his coming (Matthew 24:36). So where does that leave him? And why aren't we wise enough to see the contradiction? Here is what President Harold B. Lee had to say of such things:<br><br><i>It never ceases to amaze me how gullible some of our Church members are in broadcasting sensational stories, or dreams, or visions, or purported patriarchal blessings, or quotations, or supposed</i>[entries]<i>from some person's private diary. . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . We find that these</i>[things]<i>are finding their way into our Relief Society meetings, into priesthood quorums, firesides, institutes, and seminaries.</i><br><br><i>Brethren of the priesthood, you defenders of the faith, . . .</i>cease promoting the works of the devil . . . for they are the works of Satan. [Harold B. Lee,<i>CR,</i>April 1970, pp. 55–56; emphasis added]<br><br>Now is that strong enough language for you? Here is something equally clear given in an official declaration by the First Presidency:<br><br><i>When visions, dreams, tongues, prophecy, impressions or any extraordinary gift or inspiration conveys something out of harmony with the accepted revelations of the Church or contrary to the decisions of its constituted authorities,</i>Latter-day Saints may know that it is not of God, no matter how plausible it may appear. . . . Anything at discord with that which comes from God through the head of the Church is not to be received as authoritative or reliable. ["A Warning Voice," August 1913, in<i>Messages of the First Presidency,</i>comp. James R. Clark (Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1970), 4:285, as cited by Harold B. Lee,<i>CR,</i>April 1970, p. 55; emphasis added]<br><br>Is that plain enough? If the Lord wants to warn the Church about the importance of food storage, he won't do it through a hitchhiker. If you need to be told of a coming earthquake, you won't get that news from an audiotape your neighbor hands you. Let us be wise, brothers and sisters. When there is new doctrine or new procedures to come forth, you will get it in one of three ways:<br><br>a. A formal press conference will be called by the leaders of the Church and an official announcement will be made.<br><br>b. It will be announced through the<i>Church News,</i>the<i>Ensign,</i>or other official Church organs.<br><br>c. It will be announced in general conference by those in authority.<br><br>Otherwise we should be very wary about accepting it ourselves, and also we should not share it with others.<br><br>Principle 4:<i>The Lord wants us to use our agency and develop spiritual self-reliance.</i><br><br>In some ways this guideline may at first seem like a paradox. There is no question but what the Lord wants us to rely on him, to turn to him, and to trust in his guidance, counsel, and direction. On the other hand, the scriptures and the prophets warn us about having to be directed in every matter of life. From time to time we meet people who feel that being "spiritual" means that the Lord inspires or confirms every action they take. Everything they do is attributed to the Spirit. In some cases they submit even the most trivial of matters to the Lord for confirmation. When I was a young college student many years ago, I remember a teacher saying something like this: "If you are living by the Spirit, you will even know which brand of toothpaste to buy." I was deeply impressed then and hoped that someday I might reach that level of "spirituality." Today I have a different understanding.<br><br>Do these words sound familiar?<br><br><i>For behold, it is not meet</i>[i.e., it is not proper, it is not good]<i>that I should command in all things; for he that is compelled in all things, the same is a slothful and not a wise servant; wherefore he receiveth no reward.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 58:26]<br><br>They should sound familiar. They come from the Lord. It seems to me that if I require spiritual direction in whether to buy Crest or Colgate, I run the risk of being slothful and not wise.<br><br>We know from scripture that there are some things that don't matter to the Lord, that he leaves the choice up to us. There are several places in the Doctrine and Covenants where you will find this phrase: "it mattereth not unto me" (see, for example, D&amp;amp;C 60:5, 61:22, 62:5, 63:40). It is clear then that the Lord does not expect us to seek help on every trivial matter. As president of BYU, Elder Dallin H. Oaks spoke of this:<br><br><i>The Spirit of the Lord is not likely to give us revelations on matters that are trivial. I once heard a young woman in a testimony meeting praise the spirituality of her husband, indicating that he submitted every question to the Lord. She told how he accompanied her shopping and would not even choose between different brands of canned vegetables without making his selection a matter of prayer. That strikes me as improper.</i>[Dallin H. Oaks, "Revelation,"<i>BYU 1981–82 Fireside and Devotional Speeches</i>(Provo: Brigham Young University, 1982), p. 26]<br><br>Striking the balance between trust in the Lord and spiritual self-reliance is a delicate matter, but it is clear that the Lord does not want us to be spiritual automatons who are afraid to move without first being told what to do.<br><br>Principle 5:<i>A person is not given revelation to direct another person unless they have priesthood or family responsibility for that person.</i><br><br>Some time ago I was speaking at a Know Your Religion lecture in another part of the country. My topic was the same as it is today. Afterward a woman came up and told me that this was the first Church meeting she had been to in more than six years and that she had come only at the urging of a friend. Then she told me why. She and her husband had been unable to have children for several years after marriage. Finally she got pregnant, and they looked forward with great joy to having a child. Shortly before the baby was due, she went into terrible contractions and started to hemorrhage. Her husband rushed her to the hospital barely in time to save her life, but not in time to save the baby. You can imagine their devastation.<br><br>About a week after the funeral a sister from the ward came to visit this woman. This neighbor told the woman that she had had a dream the previous night in which it had been revealed to her that if the father had taken the time to give his wife a priesthood blessing before he had rushed her to the hospital, the baby would have lived.<br><br>"That was when I stopped going to Church," the woman told me. "My husband is a faithful priesthood holder, but all he could think about that night was saving my life. I decided that if God would let my child die under such circumstances, I wanted nothing more to do with him." Then she said this: "But what that woman told me wasn't from the Lord, was it?"<br><br>I shook my head and said no.<br><br>What had led her to that conclusion? It came from two quotes I read that night. Let me read them to you now. The first is from an official declaration by the First Presidency: "In secular as well as spiritual affairs, Saints may receive Divine guidance and revelation affecting themselves,<i>but this does not convey authority to direct others"</i>("A Warning Voice," pp. 285–86; emphasis added).<br><br>The second statement comes from Elder Oaks:<br><br><i>We should understand what can be called the principle of "stewardship in revelation." . . . Only the president of the Church receives revelation to guide the entire Church. Only the stake president receives revelation for the special guidance of the stake. The person who receives revelation for the ward is the bishop. . . . Individuals can receive revelation to guide their own lives. But when one person purports to receive revelation for another person outside his or her own stewardship . . .</i>you can be sure that such revelations are not from the Lord. [Oaks, "Revelation," p. 25; emphasis added]<br><br>This young mother began to weep then and said: "I am so glad I came tonight. It is time I came back to the Lord." I am sure the neighbor woman was well-meaning. I am sure that she felt that her dream was from the Lord. But had she understood this principle, she would have known that it wasn't from God because she had no right to direct the lives of that couple.<br><br>Remember those cases of "hormonal revelation" that I came across while teaching institute? I told my students that they didn't have to accept another's so-called revelation about marriage unless they received independent confirmation of it for themselves. Why did I feel bold enough to make such a statement? Because it comes under this same principle of not getting revelation to direct another over whom we have no responsibility. Again from Elder Oaks:<br><br><i>I have heard of cases where a young man told a young woman she should marry him because he had received a revelation that she was to be his eternal companion. If this is a true revelation, it will be confirmed directly to the woman if she seeks to know. In the meantime,</i>she is under no obligation to heed it. . . .<i>The man can receive revelation to guide his own actions, but he cannot properly receive revelation to direct hers. She is outside his stewardship.</i>[Oaks, "Revelation," p. 25; emphasis added]<br><br>That concludes the five principles that can serve as guidelines concerning personal revelation. I hope from these examples that you can see how they provide a standard by which we can judge and measure the processes of personal revelation. They help us better understand how the Lord works with us and also help us weigh which things are truly from the Lord and which may be counterfeit.<br><br>This now brings us to the third and, almost certainly, the most important of our three questions.<br><h2><b>Question 3: What Can I Do to Enhance My Ability to Hear, Recognize, and Follow the Voice of the Lord?</b></h2><br>There are obviously many answers that could be given to that question: be worthy, earnestly seek the Lord, pray always, follow the Brethren. But I should like to answer in a little different way. To do that, I would like to conduct a brief experiment with you. Even though we are a large audience in a massive hall, I would like to have absolute silence for a few moments. Then I would like you to listen to the silence and see what you can hear.<br><br>[Pause]<br><br>What did you hear? Could you hear the hum of the air conditioning? There is something up there. I don't know if it is the lights or something else. Had you heard those sounds before? Why not? Do you see the principle now? If, as we noted before, the Lord's voice is still and small and it whispers, then if our lives are filled with noise, we will find it difficult to hear. Elder Henry B. Eyring noted in his recently released book:<br><br><i>Your problem and mine is not to get God to speak to us; few of us have reached the point where he has been compelled to turn away from us.</i>Our problem is to hear. [Henry B. Eyring,<i>To Draw Closer to God</i>[Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Company, 1997], p. 29; emphasis added]<br><br>In our little experiment, only in the silence did we begin to hear the more subtle and quieter sounds. And yet they were there all along. Other sounds cover, mask, or distract us from those quieter sounds. If the voice of the Lord is still and small and whispers to us, then we must find ways to reduce the inner noise in our lives and create times of inner stillness and quiet.<br><br>There are many sources of inner noise. Some are obvious. Sin is clearly a major source of spiritual noise. The effect is similar to what loud prolonged noise does to the auditory nerves. Prolonged permanent hearing loss can result. I believe this is what Paul meant when he spoke to Timothy about having our "conscience seared with a hot iron" (1 Timothy 4:2). It means we are beyond feeling. Sin rapidly impairs our spiritual senses. It can create tremendous inner noise.<br><br>Anger and contention are a major source of inner noise. Remember the story of the Prophet Joseph during the days of translating the Book of Mormon? It was reported that one day he came up to the room to translate but could get nowhere. He then admitted that he and Emma had spoken some disagreeable words earlier. He excused himself and went to make his peace with his wife. After a time he returned and indicated he was now ready to proceed.<br><br>Other sources of inner noise are not necessarily bad in and of themselves. Physical tiredness, stress, busyness, apathy, and worry can all create inner noises of their own.<br><br>Even outer noise can detract from inner quiet. Noise is endemic in our society. We live in envelopes of outer noise. We play music in our homes and cars, we watch television while we study, we even buy portable tape and CD players so we can carry this envelope of noise with us when we walk or jog. This is not a bad thing, but it may interfere at times with the quiet whisperings the Lord wants to give us. One observer noted that before a revelation could be given to some people, there would have to be something like this: "We interrupt this broadcast to bring you the following message."<br><br>Irreverence is a source of inner noise. Elder Boyd K. Packer made this observation in a conference talk:<br><br><i>Irreverence suits the purposes of the adversary by obstructing the delicate channels of revelation in both mind and spirit. . . .</i><br><br><i>Leaders sometimes wonder why so many active members get themselves into such predicaments in life. Could it be that they do not feel what they need to feel because our meetings are less than they might be spiritually?</i><br><br><i>. . . Leaders should teach that reverence invites revelation.</i>[Boyd K. Packer, "Reverence Invites Revelation,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 1991, p. 22]<br><br>Let me mention one other common source of great inner noise, often found even among faithful, obedient people. It is what Elder Eyring on another occasion described as "having your wants too high." When we desperately desire something, it creates a great rush of emotion within us. And high emotion can mask or cover spiritual promptings. Even if the thing we desire is a good thing--such as wanting help for a critically ill family member--our "wants" may be so high that we become unwilling or unable to hear the Lord's will in the matter.<br><br>In summary then, if the voice of the Lord is still and small and it whispers, should it surprise us that his counsel is<i>"Be still</i>and know that I am God" (D&amp;amp;C 101:16; emphasis added). Only as we are still can we learn to hear the still small voice.<br><br>Thankfully, the scriptures and the prophets teach us how to reduce inner noise and create times of quiet and reverence. These will neither be new nor surprising ideas to you, but they are of great importance. I list only a few.<br><br>Reading and studying the word of God is a great source of inner quiet. There are many here who already understand that principle. Life has left you torn and troubled. Inside you feel like a churning, boiling cauldron of anxiety and unrest. Then you turn to the scriptures. Almost immediately you can feel things begin to change. The churning calms, the agitation melts away, and peace comes in its place. I have experienced that time and again in my own life.<br><br>Prayer is another source of inner quiet and serenity. I am not talking about the perfunctory "I-have-to-do-my-duty" sort of prayers. I speak of prayers that are filled with yearning. I speak of prayers when your heart swells with gratitude for the almost countless gifts God has given you. I speak of prayers that are consistent, focused, and submissive to God's will.<br><br>If irreverence is a great source of static and noise, then we can deliberately set about to increase our own personal reverence. In sacrament meetings we can sit quietly and prepare for the covenant-making process offered there. We can sing the hymns, paying attention to the words so they become a prayer unto the Lord. We can focus on what the speaker is saying and try to understand how the principles being taught apply to us.<br><br>Here is a simple thing, and yet one of the most effective ways to attune our inner hearing to spiritual things. In the sacramental covenant we witness to God that we are willing to do three things. One of those, to "always remember him," is repeated in both of the sacramental prayers. If we keep that covenant, what is God's promise back to us?<i>That we shall always have his Spirit to be with us</i>(see D&amp;amp;C 20:77, 79). What a promise! Let me give you a quick example of how that simple promise could bring tremendous inner peace and quiet.<br><br>One of the great sources of inner noise in our society is driving the freeways, a challenge that earlier generations did not have to face. In Utah, at the moment, that has become particularly so. After half an hour or more on the freeways, we feel anger and frustration, irritation and impatience. Some even experience rage. By the time we reach our destination we are fuming with anger or trembling with fear. The next time you get in your car to drive the freeway, try this experiment. Pause for a moment and offer this short prayer: "Help me to remember the Savior as I drive today. Help me to try and act as he would act. When that person in front of me is talking on his cellular phone and not paying attention to his driving, help me to remember the Savior and act accordingly. When some knucklehead cuts directly in front of me, help me to not say anything that the Savior would not say." I suggest that it will not only dramatically reduce the inner noise within you, but it will directly bring the promise of the Lord to you: "That they may always have his Spirit to be with them."<br><br>Finally, one of the most important things you can do when you are searching to reduce inner noise in your life is to take time to ponder and reflect. Get away from the bustle of life. Find a quiet place and take time to simply sit and think, to listen to your thoughts and feelings, to open yourself to the promptings of the Spirit. Note what the following prophets said they were doing prior to receiving important revelations. Nephi: "I sat pondering in my heart" (1 Nephi 11:1). Joseph Smith and Sidney Rigdon: "While we meditated upon these things" (D&amp;amp;C 76:19). Joseph F. Smith: "I sat in my room pondering over the scriptures; and reflecting" (D&amp;amp;C 138:1–2). Joseph Smith: "My mind was called up to serious reflection. . . . I reflected . . . again and again [upon the words of James]" (JS--H 1:8, 12).<br><br>Sometimes we must deliberately put aside the cares of the world, put aside the rush of our daily lives, and find a quiet place and a quiet time where we can sit and ponder and reflect and mediate--and listen for that still small voice that whispers. Part of that time of pondering will be to deliberately push your wants down. You will remind yourself that it is not your place to counsel the Lord or to try and tell him what is best for you. You will consciously remember the Gethsemane principle mentioned earlier and submit your will to his.<br><h2><b>Conclusion</b></h2><br>I say again now, as I said at the beginning:<i>One of the most important--if not the most important--challenges in learning how to come unto Christ and to be perfected in him is to learn to hear, to recognize, and then to follow the voice of the Lord.</i>Fortunately the Lord has given us this almost incomprehensible gift of the Holy Ghost--a member of the Godhead--to be our constant companion and spiritual guide. If we learn how to distinguish the voice of the Lord from the many other voices and sounds that fill our lives, the promises are incredibly rich. I cite only one such promise:<br><br><i>For thus saith the Lord--I, the Lord, am merciful and gracious unto those who fear me, and delight to honor those who serve me in righteousness and in truth unto the end.</i><br><br><i>Great shall be their reward and eternal shall be their glory.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 76:5–6]<br><br>To the realities of that promise I add my own testimony, having experienced to some small degree the blessings therein promised, and I testify to that in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Gerald N. Lund was a Church Educational System zone administrator when this devotional address was given at BYU on 2 December 1997.</i><br><br><i>© Intellectual Reserve, Inc.

<br>
<br>
When Elder F. Enzio Busche was attempting to make a telephone call from Frankfurt, Germany, on December 5, 1995, he accidentally pushed the wrong button and was connected to Elder Dean L. Larsen at 7:00 a.m. Elder Larsen asked how things were going. Elder Busche replied by saying, "It is hard to imagine how much we are learning from our experiences in Russia." Recently he had visited in Moscow with the mission president there, who had several branches under his direction. He had written to each branch, wanting to know what they were going to do to celebrate Christmas. Each branch president replied except one. Several additional requests to the one were made without results. Finally the mission president contacted the branch president directly about the project and was startled to hear the response, "What is Christmas?"<br><br>Each of you knows what Christmas is, but today let us explore the holiday of holidays even more deeply.<br><br>I have never before been in a position to deliver an early Christmas gift to so many in one place. That is what I hope to do this morning. If there is a group of young adults anywhere in the world more deserving of a special Christmas gift, I cannot imagine where.<br><br>A number of years ago someone began delivering gifts to us by night, leaving them on our front porch about two weeks before Christmas. We didn't know who it was. When the first gift was discovered, I asked our children to look around the driveway and our front-porch area to see if the card had simply dropped out of the package. They couldn't find the name of the person who had brought the gift to us. The same thing happened the next day. Within another day or two we figured someone had made our family the focus of the 12 days of Christmas tradition. For almost two weeks prior to Christmas that year, a wonderful young woman dropped off gifts and, in an important way, changed the lives of our children. They were so touched by her generosity and her desire to<i>secretly</i>do such a nice thing that they each have participated in the 12 days of Christmas for others since that time. The holiday season brings memories of her kindness.<br><br>I would like to address my remarks this day focusing on 12 presents that I would like to give you. I would prefer to deliver them in person, but that is impossible. If carefully thought about and used, they will keep you on the path of peace and joy today, tomorrow, and perhaps forever. Make this your happiest Christmas!<br><h2><b>First Present</b></h2><br><em>Let the gospel of Jesus Christ be your guide, your personal philosophy, and the main determinate of your decision making.</em><br><br>Several years ago a man I had known for 30 years asked if he could come and spend time with me in my office.<br><br>I said, "Yes, of course," and eagerly anticipated his visit.<br><br>When we sat down he said something that surprised me. He mentioned that there were several of us who seemed to have things figured out when we were in school many years ago. I asked him who, and he named several of our mutual friends. In each instance they had been people who, at around your age, had determined to live the gospel of Jesus Christ.<br><br>The Savior made an interesting statement that only John recorded. We are all familiar with the words "If ye love me, keep my commandments" (John 14:15). But in that same chapter, a few verses later, the Lord said, "If a man love me, he will keep my words" (John 14:23). Then he went on to reiterate the most amazing promise for someone like you he had ever made. He said, "And my Father will love him, and we will come unto him, and make our abode with him" (John 14:23). Having the Savior move into your apartment or dorm would, I suppose, somewhat alter your daily behavior. Think for a moment: Could there ever be a greater reward than to be that close to the Father and Son?<br><br>Incidentally, my friend has gone on to live the gospel more deeply and thoroughly than ever before and is presently living a somewhat remarkable life because he decided to accept the gift of Jesus Christ in his life.<br><br>A lovely lady wrote:<br><br><i>You never know when someone<br>Might catch a dream from you<br>Some little thing you say<br>Or some little thing you do.<br>Might open up the windows<br>Of a mind that seeks the light.<br>A certain way you live might not matter,<br>But, you never really know. It might!</i><br>[Jenny Jones Fredericks Belliston, "Christmas Message," 1997]<br><h2><b>Second Present</b></h2><br><em>Select good friends.</em><br><br>Already many of you have as friends some of the finest individuals you will ever know. They love you, they appreciate you, they are happy in your presence and you in theirs. After your college years you will make more friends, of course, but as the years quickly come and go, you will learn that some of your closest friends are those men and women with whom you are already acquainted. Select your friends almost as carefully as you select your eternal companion. Choose friends of different backgrounds and cultures. Many of your special friends are to be different from you, and from that comes great strength. Continue to earn their friendship. My wife and I, as we mail Christmas cards each year, realize that some of these wonderful school friends remain the backbone of those we love today.<br><br>Friends are the bargains of life. Treat them as a precious treasure.<br><h2><b>Third Present</b></h2><br><em>Guard your name and do your best.</em><br><br>I have a friend that I met in the seventh grade. His name is George Suvall. He has been a very successful basketball coach and trainer. He is also a homespun philosopher. Periodically I see him out walking near where we live. We stop to chat. George reported his family had come from Greece when he was very young. At first, because they didn't speak English in the home, George did not know how to read or write English very well. He was able to keep most of it a secret. An insightful teacher, because she cared and noticed that he was always trying to do his best, rescued him. One day his father was attempting to explain the importance of doing the best you can to George and said, "Hey, George, if you gonna be anything, you be the best anything you can be." His father knew that in America if you do the best you can, you will succeed.<br><br>Then his father said, "Georgie, there are two-a-things you cannot-a buy. It's a your-a-name and your-a-health. Take-a-care of them both." Those few words provided a personal philosophy George still follows.<br><br>First: Do the best you can.<br><br>Second: Protect your name.<br><br>Third: Guard your health.<br><br>If I notice a single characteristic about the men and women I serve with, it is their commitment to go the extra mile, often tirelessly working through the hours that sometimes an individual 40 years younger will not do. The<i>respect</i>that you earn so often comes when you are<i>trusted</i>to do extra things as needed. Your good name comes from what you do and the things you say.<br><h2><b>Fourth Present</b></h2><br><em>Live a covenant-making life.</em><br><br>Are you willing to make a contract between yourself and God? Let us talk about dating, as an example. What is a date? Well, social interaction, going to the game, attending a college activity, studying together, watching a video or movie, going for a walk. It is a time to covenant with God that we will behave.<br><br>But what if we define a date as an opportunity for each of you to get to know someone better by promising yourself that at the end of the evening, the person you have been with is a better person than when you began the date? Can you say at the end of the evening, "Thank you for being such a kind person? It has been wonderful being with you tonight." Or maybe a date is a time to visit someone in need. Is it possible that your best dates are when you<i>lift</i>and<i>teach</i>and<i>help</i>and<i>bless</i>another? Could a date be a time to discuss the gospel of Jesus Christ in all of its magnificence? How about sharing a secret thought, an eternal dream, a future hope? Shouldn't a date be a frustration-free, guilt-free experience? Covenant with the Lord, promising him you will leave circumstances better than you find them.<br><h2><b>Fifth Present</b></h2><br><em>Give the Savior a chance to build you to your full potential.</em><br><br>The Lord will push you right to the brink, if you allow him to. It was Jesus who stated, "Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect" (Matthew 5:48). Plead with the Lord to give you more challenges. If you study 20 hours each week, then say, "Lord, I am going for more." Let his example give you power to ask, "In addition to what I am doing, what else?"<br><br><i>The heights by great men reached and kept<br>Were not attained by sudden flight,<br>But they, while their companions slept,<br>Were toiling upward in the night.</i><br>[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow,<i>The Ladder of St. Augustine</i>(1858), st. 10]<br><br>Elder Neal A. Maxwell received a very low grade on a high school English essay he wrote. He went to Miss Mason and said, "This is not fair. This is good work. I deserve a higher grade."<br><br>She said, "Sorry, but I grade students by potential. You are capable of much better work."<br><br>Elder Maxwell has often stated, "She made the difference in my life." Why? Because he wanted to meet her expectations. He wanted to be the best he could, and because of that he has continued to be one of the most verbal and clear-thinking people in the Church.<br><br>Are we meeting the Lord's expectations for us? Never, ever forget: He has great plans for each of us!<br><h3><b>Sixth Present</b></h3><br><em>Speak and seek the truth.</em><br><br>In John 4:23 we read, "But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in<i>truth:</i>for the Father seeketh such to worship him" (emphasis added).<br><br>The Prophet Joseph Smith defined the gospel as all truth by stating, "Truth is 'Mormonism'" (<i>Teachings,</i>p. 139).<br><br>John also stated, "And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free" (John 8:32).<br><br>Seneca wrote, "Time discovers truth" (<i>Moral Essays,</i>"On Anger," 2, 22).<br><br>"What is truth?" asked Pilate, but he would not even stay for an answer (John 18:38).<br><br>Whether you are a scientist or not, make pure truth an eternal objective. It is only when you are honest that you are safe.<br><h2><b>Seventh Present</b></h2><br><em>Seek to retain or reobtain the heart of a child, especially at Christmastime.</em><br><br><i>Backward, turn backward, O Time, in your flight,<br>Make me a child again just for tonight!</i><br>[Elizabeth Akers Allen,<i>Rock Me To Sleep</i>(1860), st. 1]<br><br>In the<i>Daily Mail,</i>a British newspaper, dated December 21, 1995, an article was printed reporting that Laura Goffin, six years old, had been told that she was naughty during the stressful time many families go through while decorating for Christmas. In a few hasty words she was informed that Santa wouldn't be coming down the chimney because of something she had done to aggravate her parents.<br><br>Now six-year-old Laura had a nagging fear--would Santa overlook her little brother and sister, too?<br><br><i>She decided to plead the cases of Abigail, four, and two-year-old Alfie in a personal letter to Father Christmas. She wrote: "Dear Santa, Don't come to me as I have been very naughty and I told my mummy I don't want any toys for Christmas and I don't want Christmas.</i><br><br><i>"Please come to Abigail and Alfie, but not me. Laura."</i><br><br>She dropped her note into Santa's letter box outside the town hall in Milford Haven, touching the heart of the mayor's secretary when she read it as a yule season assignment.<br><br>The letter's plea caused the secretary to search and finally find the little girl who was prepared to "miss out on the festive fun" of Christmas but didn't want her little brother and sister ignored--<i>a sweet little girl whom the world had not yet polluted.</i><br><br>The mayor gave her a new doll. Her parents were startled at the way she had responded, to which she said, "I'm sorry I was naughty and I promise Father Christmas I will be a good girl from now on." ("The Girl Who Told Santa She Was Too Naughty to Be on His List,"<i>Daily Mail,</i>21 December 1995, p. 28.)<br><br>Let me tell you of another example of Christmastime giving.<br><br><i>During a drive to amass warm clothing to ship to suffering Saints, Elder Harold B. Lee and Elder Marion G. Romney took President George Albert Smith to Welfare Square in Salt Lake City. They were impressed by the generous response of the membership of the Church to the clothing drive and the preparations for sending the goods overseas. They watched President Smith observing the workers as they packaged this great volume of donated clothing and shoes. They saw tears running down his face. After a few moments, President Smith removed a new overcoat that he had on and said, "Please ship this also."</i><br><br><i>The Brethren said to him, "No, President, no; don't send that; it's cold and you need your coat."</i><br><br><i>But President Smith would not take it back.</i>[Thomas S. Monson, "My Brother's Keeper,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 1994, p. 45; see also Glen L. Rudd,<i>Pure Religion</i>(Salt Lake City: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 1995), p. 248)]<br><br>May we be childlike, not childish. (See the ninth present to understand the difference.)<br><h2><b>Eighth Present</b></h2><br><em>Seek the world of "reality."</em><br><br>Are you seeking the world of reality? Periodically I will hear some less-than-thoughtful person criticize our lifestyle or demean that which we may be doing by saying, "Hey, get real. Join the real world." May I communicate with each of you that the real world is that which our prophet, Church leaders, and scriptures define. It is President Gordon B. Hinckley who is walking in the real world. How blessed we are to have him!<br><br>A number of years ago, as I was leaving the Church Office Building a day or two before Christmas, I found myself walking next to Elder Bruce R. McConkie. We wished each other a merry Christmas. I drove home and surmised he did the same. The day after Christmas the telephone rang. It was David Wirthlin, the administrator of the LDS Hospital.<br><br>"Guess what happened just before Christmas?" he asked.<br><br>"I don't know," I replied.<br><br>"Elder Bruce R. McConkie came to the hospital. He asked if he could give a few blessings. With permission granted, he went from room to room placing his hands on the heads of several dozen patients."<br><br>That is the real world, isn't it?<br><h2><b>Ninth Present</b></h2><br><em>Be an effective giver.</em><br><br>There is a line that all must step over. It marks the place where an individual goes from receiving more pleasure from giving than from receiving gifts.<br><br>As seniors in high school, several of us had decided to sub for Santa. We had been given the name of a single mother who had three little children. They lived in a rather dismal apartment house with dirty walls, steps, and hallways. The whole building needed a coat of paint and a scrubbing. The doors didn't fit very well.<br><br>We gathered food, toys, and clothes. Excitedly we ascended a rickety staircase to the door with the number on it that we had been given.<br><br>A tired woman invited us in. There were no warm lights or even a tree to greet us. Her little children seemed too frightened to speak. As we placed the gifts around a tree we had bought and did some decorating, we observed a large, quite new television set. Our gifts were soon distributed, signaling that it was time for us to leave. The little family said very little as we slipped out of that dark place to go home. Father greeted me as I arrived home.<br><br>"How did it go?" he asked.<br><br>"Fine, Dad, except," I sputtered, "they had this large TV set." That was a time when many families could not afford a big television or even a small one.<br><br>My father said something like, "What does that have to do with it?"<br><br>I stammered, "Well, why didn't the lady buy Christmas toys, decorations, and food for her family instead of the big TV?"<br><br>"Maybe that is all they have for any happiness in their lives," Dad said.<br><br>I realized that what he said was true. We had observed how little else they had. Suddenly my whole immature attitude spun around. We had blessed four people and that was all that mattered. We are never quite the same after an experience like that. Some of my own pettiness evaporated that night as I realized how much we had enjoyed giving those gifts.<br><br>President Howard W. Hunter said:<br><br><i>Let us look backward for just a moment to our childhood and analyze that which gave us the greatest happiness when we were children. I am inclined to believe that the things we enjoyed most and those that gave us the greatest happiness when we were children, were the things that were given to us. When our parents went away and returned, we always looked for some little token they would bring back to us. We looked forward to Christmas because of the things we were going to receive. Our whole life was built around receiving. At that time we did not understand the other side of giving. Sometime during our progress through this life, we came to that point when we suddenly realized it was not receiving that brings us happiness. To some this comes early in life; to others it comes later; and I am inclined to believe that there are some who never have this awakening during the daytime of their lives. They miss one of the great principles that brings happiness to us.</i>[Howard W. Hunter,<i>Gifts That Money Cannot Buy,</i>Brigham Young University Speeches of the Year (Provo, 26 April 1961), p. 2]<br><br>Yes, hopefully we will all be able to completely leave those years of childhood when our thoughts are more self-focused than they should be. Victor Herbert captured that truth when he wrote:<br><br><i>Toyland, Toyland,<br>Little girl and boy land,<br>While you dwell within it<br>You are ever happy then.<br>Childhood's joyland,<br>Mystic, merry Toyland!<br>Once you pass its borders,<br>You can ne'er return again.</i>&amp;lt;<br>["Toyland," words by Glen MacDonough and music by Victor Herbert, Ardee Music Publishing, Inc., 1981]<br><h2><b>Tenth Present</b></h2><br><em>Bless others with your hands.</em><br><br>Look at your hands. Are they busy lifting the burdens of others? Are they used in happy greeting as you shake another's hand? Marriage vows are taken while holding hands. Will the diploma you receive from this institution be received with a hand outstretched? Hands give blessings when placed on another's head. It is with our hands that we write a term paper, paint a painting, play the piano, or wave to a friend in parting. What about the hands of your professors as they write upon a chalkboard or help you utilize a test tube, a computer, or a scientific measuring device more effectively?<br><br>Hands symbolize so much. Whom do your hands applaud? How do you use your hands? By wrapping a gift? By helping a friend with a complex mathematical problem? Each of you is learning to become more self-sustaining and more skilled in your life's pursuits. Yet each of us needs a hand to lift us at one time or another in our lives. A couple falling in love as they hold each other's hands are saying, "It's you I love." Those same hands could be saying, "I will protect you. I will strive to be a good servant of the Master. I will play with a child, help a colleague move--or help a merry Christmas to happen as we speak those holiday words."<br><br>President Gordon B. Hinckley reported a pioneer Christmas he had learned about. He quoted a story he had read in which the author wrote:<br><br><i>I remember the Christmas of 1862. All of us children hung up our stockings. We jumped up early in the morning to see what Santa had brought, but there was not a thing in them. Mother wept bitterly. She went to her box and got a little apple and cut it in little tiny pieces and that was our Christmas, but I have never forgotten to this day how I loved her dear little hands as she was cutting that apple.</i>[Hannah Daphne Smith Dalton, quoted by Gordon B. Hinckley,<i>CR,</i>April 1959, p. 119]<br><br>Incidently, this year President Gordon B. Hinckley has been in 20 countries and has had 137 speaking assignments with 731,671 in attendance (information provided by the Office of the First Presidency, 6 December 1997). This does not include general conference nor so many other engagements he attends as he represents the Savior and each of us.<br><h2><b>Eleventh Present</b></h2><br><em>Offer the gift of generosity.</em><br><br>The level of our sharing with others is the level of our love for others combined with large doses of self-forgetting. Generosity, in part, symbolizes our maturity level.<br><br>On the birthdays of our children and grandchildren, my wife and I distribute a dollar for each year they have lived. I am 63 years old. An eight-year-old granddaughter had been worrying about the fact that I had just sent her $8 for her birthday but that she couldn't afford to send me 63 one-dollar bills for my birthday.<br><br>Finally she hit upon a solution to her frustration. She said to our daughter, Annette, "Mom, I know how I can do for Grandfather what he does for us. I will send him one dollar for every 10 years he has lived. That's six dollars and another three for the three of 63." She sent me back her eight birthday dollars plus one extra, never caring she had lost a dollar in the transaction.<br><br>Beginning a number of years ago, a young woman, Kathy Conwell, collected angels to put on a special Christmas tree she had at home. Kathy was a lovely young woman, a college student who learned that she had a very violent aggressive form of cancer. She had been told that she would not live long but that medical science would do everything it could to assist her, and she also received several blessings. Her collection eventually grew to 156 angels, covering a six-foot tree with lights and these special decorations. Kathy and her mother, Joy Conwell, would go to yard sales, post-Christmas sales, and anywhere little angels could be located. At her untimely death in October 1996, she asked her mother to distribute these angels to her friends. I was blessed to receive one of them. I have kept it in my office now for more than 400 days. She is now an angel herself. Her generosity goes on blessing us all.<br><h2><b>Twelfth Present</b></h2><br><em>Understand the supreme Christmas.</em><br><br>The scriptures remind us<br><br><i>that there went out a decree from Caesar Augustus, that all the world should be taxed.</i><br><br><i>(And this taxing was first made when Cyrenius was governor of Syria.)</i><br><br><i>And all went to be taxed, every one into his own city.</i><br><br><i>And Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth, into Judaea, unto the city of David, which is called Bethlehem; . . .</i><br><br><i>To be taxed with Mary his espoused wife, being great with child.</i><br><br><i>And so it was, that, while they were there, the days were accomplished that she should be delivered.</i><br><br><i>And she brought forth her firstborn son, and wrapped him in swaddling clothes, and laid him in a manger; because there was no room for them in the inn.</i>[Luke 2:1-7]<br><br>The greatest person ever to live on this planet was born.<br><br><i>What can I give Him,<br>Poor as I am?</i><br><br><i>If I were a shepherd<br>I would bring a lamb,</i><br><br><i>If I were a wise man<br>I would do my part,--</i><br><br><i>Yet what I can I give Him,<br>Give my heart.</i><br>[Christina Georgina Rossetti, "A Christmas Carol," also called "Mid-Winter"]<br><br>Which brings us to you and the gifts you can give Jesus. Christina Rossetti essentially penned, "I give him my heart." What does that mean, "Give him my heart?"<br><br>James, the Lord's half-brother (see Galatians 1:19), thoughtfully wrote, "Every good gift and every perfect gift [the Atonement] is from above, and cometh down from the Father of lights, with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning" (James 1:17). This being true then, we must help others to grasp the true meaning of the Atonement and Christmas, which is<i>Christ.</i><br><br>Think of the influence you students can have on parents, siblings, friends, and relatives by helping them to think about Jesus even more this year than perhaps they have on earlier occasions. You will never forget this Christmas if you do.<br><br>A while ago I read of a survey of more than 6,000 teenagers (not members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints) pertaining to their feelings about the scriptures. Only 14 percent said they considered reading the scriptures "very important." Perhaps that would be true of some of us.<br><br>When the students were asked about the importance they place on a variety of activities, from their relationships with God to helping others, reading the Bible ranked lowest.<br><br>Surely Christmastime is the best time of all to read the scriptures! Think how the circumstances surrounding the birth of the baby Jesus come alive when we read Luke, who had learned so much from Mary because he wrote the things that only she could have told him. Then include with those beautiful verses those found in 3 Nephi 12 and nearby sections of the Book of Mormon. It will add tinsel to your Christmas this year, and that is a promise!<br><br>It follows then that you introduce a sacred spirit to all that goes on.<br><br>Merchants of things have invaded the minds of most people, disregarding the "holy day" characteristics of the Christmas holiday. Commercialism has turned it into a day of<i>feasting, foolishness,</i>and<i>football</i>instead of<i>friends, family, faith,</i>and<i>following Jesus.</i><br><br>There are exceptions, thank goodness, that each of you know about. But now, let us take you and transplant you wherever you will be on Christmas Day. Your responding with gracious enthusiasm, kindly expressing your love of the Savior and of those of your family and others with whom you come in contact will make this Christmas the best ever. Isn't that the spirit of Christmas?<br><br>Perhaps Johnny Hart, the great Christian cartoonist, said it as well as anyone. He wrote a Christmas poem that appeared in his comic strip<i>B.C.</i>four years ago. It read:<br><br><i>Follow the star<br>and you shall see,</i><br><br><i>His gift of grace<br>to you and me.</i><br><br><i>Follow the star&amp;lt;<br>that followed the youth,</i><br><br><i>Who gave us love<br>and taught us truth.</i><br><br><i>Follow the star<br>that follows the man</i><br><br><i>Who takes us<br>where none other can,</i><br><br><i>To where our hopes<br>and treasures are.</i><br><br><i>Follow, O follow the star.</i><br>[Johnny Hart,<i>B.C.,</i>26 December 1993]<br><br>Yes, the supreme Christmas gift is Jesus. A loving Father let him hang on the cross, even after he had cried, "My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?" (Matthew 27:46).<br><br>Why did Jesus need to suffer so? Because the Father loves us so much that we have this greatest of gifts, becoming purified through his atonement. Thanks to a loving Heavenly Father who provided his Firstborn Son to give us examples of how to live and in what to believe. Resolve to give yourself to him as your supreme gift. And if you do, next year and all the years to follow will be lived in concert with what our Father and Jesus hope you will become. To these simple truths I testify, in the name of Jesus Christ, our Master. Amen.<br><br><i>Hugh W.
