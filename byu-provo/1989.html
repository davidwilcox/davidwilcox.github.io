<h1>vior, Like Thee” - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
As difficult as this assignment is, I am delighted with the opportunity to be in your midst, to feel the spirit on this campus--a spirit that is here at least in part because of your strivings for righteousness and excellence. Thank you for your graciousness.<br><h2><b>"Come Unto Christ"</b></h2><br>Now we have packed away the tinsel and the ornaments of the season. But I hope the warm memories of fellowship, expressions of love, cheerful greetings, giving of gifts, gathering of families together, and reflecting upon the birth of our Savior and the significance of this event will linger long in our hearts. It seems that during this time we are more charitable and have better feelings toward each other than at any other time during the year.<br><br>Now comes the beginning of a new year, and, though we make New Year's resolutions to improve ourselves, often the good feelings of the Christmas season are forgotten and disregarded. But the image of the Savior, what he taught, what he sacrificed and did for us planted firmly in our minds can help us remember all that we must do.<br><br>While enjoying the opening presentation and listening to the words, "Just let your heart believe in him; never let his light go; never let your love grow dim . . . I heard him come," I reflected on the account in 3 Nephi, chapter 11. While the people were marveling and wondering about this Jesus Christ and the sign that had been given concerning him, they heard a voice, "not a harsh voice, neither was it a loud voice," but "being a small voice it did pierce them that did hear to the center," and it caused "their hearts to burn" (verse 3). Again they heard, but they did not understand.<br><br>Then, in hearing the voice the third time, they did "open their ears to hear it," and "they cast their eyes up again towards heaven; and behold, they saw a Man descending out of heaven; and he was clothed in a white robe" (verses 4–8). It was the Savor, who came down and ministered unto them. He taught them there should be no disputations among them, and they were baptized and took his name upon themselves.<br><br>What a wonderful way for us to begin a new year--open our ears that we may hear, then resolve to follow Moroni's admonition. (Moroni 10:32):<br><br>"Come unto Christ, and be perfected in him," by establishing Christlike attributes in our lives. We can be more thoughtful, kind, and considerate of our fellowmen. "Come unto Christ . . . and deny yourselves of all ungodliness."<br><h2><b>"Remembering to Choose Love"</b></h2><br>As I think of striving to rid ourselves of contention and living peaceably with our fellowmen, I am reminded of an experience President Gordon B. Hinckley tells:<br><br><i>For a number of years, while I had responsibility for the work in Asia, I interviewed each missionary one-on-one. I asked each what virtue he or she saw in his or her companion . . . .</i><br><br><i>When I raised that question, almost invariably the missionary, an elder for example, would stop with a surprised look on his face. He had never thought of his companion that way before. He had seen his faults and weaknesses but had not seen his virtues. I would tell him to pause and think about it for a minute. Then the answers would begin to come. Such answers as, "He's a hard worker." "He gets up in the morning." "He dresses neatly." "He doesn't complain."</i><br><br><i>It was a remarkable thing, really. These young men and women, for the most part, had been oblivious to the virtues of their companions, although they were well aware of their companions' faults, and often felt discouraged because of them. But when they began to turn their attitudes around, remarkable things began to happen.</i>["Strengthening Each Other,"<i>Ensign</i>, February 1985, pp. 3–4]<br><br>Campus living is very similar to this, as is family living. Developing skills and positive attitudes in living with roommates now will enable you to have happier eternal companionships.<br><br>Sometimes we hear of priesthood bearers being overly critical of their wives and children. Sometime ago I was visiting a region where a joint priesthood/Relief Society leadership meeting was held. One of the priesthood leaders was the husband of the Relief Society president. During the meeting principles of cooperation were discussed and expressions of appreciation were given for the opportunity to work together. But the actions of this couple spoke louder than words. He treated her as a servant, thrusting her his coat to hang up, criticizing her cooking and homemaking skills, and scolding the children for minor infractions.<br><br>President Spencer W. Kimball said,<br><br><i>Our sisters do not wish to be indulged or to be treated condescendingly; they desire to be respected and revered as our sisters and our equals. I mention [this] because in some situations our behavior is of doubtful quality.</i>["Our Sisters in the Church," general conference priesthood session,<i>Ensign</i>, November 1979, p. 49]<br><br>Sisters, too, have a responsibility to build harmonious relationships. There are times when we are not as thoughtful as we should be. The most important place all of us should be practicing our own "perfecting skills" is right where we live, with those nearest and dearest to us.<br><br>David O. McKay's wife, Emma, was credited with this statement: "The most important thing one can take to marriage is a cheerful disposition."<br><br>President and Sister McKay always seemed to be the ideal couple. He was such a gentleman, and she was so gracious. Seldom did a cross word come between them. How wonderful it would be if we could be cheerful always, not only with our own marriage partners, but with all people.<br><br>In recent years we have witnessed great changes in the relationships between men and women. Some of this has been beneficial as it relates to equal pay, education, and opportunity. But sometimes, in our desire for equality, we have eliminated those common courtesies that are so important for harmonious relationships. The prophets have taught that in his wisdom and mercy our Father made men and women dependent upon each other for the full flowering of their potential. Because their natures are somewhat different, they can complement each other. Because they are in many ways alike, they can understand each other. Let neither envy the other for their differences; let both discern what is superficial and what is basic in those differences and act accordingly. And may the brotherhood of the priesthood and the sisterhood of the Relief Society be a blessing in the lives of all members of the Church as we help each other along the path to perfection.<br><br>Often our roles change. For many years I supported my husband in his priesthood callings. Then almost overnight a change came. He was asked to give up what he was doing, be released as a mission president, and come home so that he could support me. This he has done cheerfully. I am always grateful when he can accompany me on my assignments because it demonstrates that we can work together as a team, supporting and helping each other.<br><br>I watch the supporting relationships of your campus and church leaders. I watch the loving relationships of the Brethren and their wives, but especially I love to watch the adoration President Benson has for his wife, Flora, and she for him.<br><br>Just recently I heard President John Larson of the Jordon River Temple tell of the weekly visit of President and Sister Benson to that temple. He mentioned that President Benson, though not strong physically himself, is determined to help Sister Benson as she gets out of the car or to hold her chair as she is seated for lunch after the session, and he will not relinquish that right to anyone else. Their love and devotion to each other are obvious.<br><br>These are relationships that have "weathered the storms"--the difficulties--and have endured through the years. They have learned to control their feelings and not say or do things that were offensive to the other.<br><br>It's interesting that when we are dating, we usually try to be our very best in order to impress our date. Young men are perfect gentlemen. The young women are perfect ladies. Why should we change our behavior just because we "catch" each other? A women never gets so old or has been married so long that she doesn't appreciate common courtesies. A man never gets to the point where he doesn't appreciate being treated as an important human being.<br><br>The development of this kind of behavior is told in the story of Tom Anderson.<br><br><i>I made a vow to myself on the drive down to the vacation beach cottage. For two weeks I would try to be a loving husband and father. Totally loving. No ifs, ands or buts.</i><br><br><i>The idea had come to me as I listened to a commentator on my car's tape player. He was quoting a Biblical passage about husbands being thoughtful of their wives. Then he went on to say, "Love is an act of will. A person can</i>choose<i>to love." To myself, I had to admit that I had been a selfish husband--that our love had been dulled by my own insensitivity. In petty ways, really: chiding Evelyn for her tardiness; insisting on the TV channel I wanted to watch; throwing out day-old newspapers that I knew Evelyn still wanted to read. Well, for two weeks all that would change.</i><br><br><i>And it did. Right from the moment I kissed Evelyn at the door and said, "That new yellow sweater looks great on you."</i><br><br><i>"Oh, Tom, you noticed," she said, surprised and pleased. Maybe a little perplexed.</i><br><br><i>After the long drive, I wanted to sit and read. Evelyn suggested a walk on the beach. I started to refuse, but then I thought,</i>Evelyn's been alone here with the kids all week and now she wants to be alone with me.<i>We walked on the beach while the children flew their kites.</i><br><br><i>So it went. Two weeks of not calling the Wall Street investment firm where I am director; a visit to the shell museum, though I usually hate museums (and I enjoyed it); holding my tongue while Evelyn's getting ready made us late for a dinner date. Relaxed and happy, that's how the whole vacation passed. I made a new vow to keep on remembering to choose love.</i><br><br><i>There was one thing that went wrong with my experiment, however. Evelyn and I still laugh about it today. On the last night at our cottage, preparing for bed, Evelyn started at me with the saddest expression.</i><br><br><i>"What's the matter?" I asked her.</i><br><br><i>"Tom," she said, in a voice filled with distress, "do you know something I don't?"</i><br><br><i>"What do you mean?"</i><br><br>"Well . . . that checkup I had several weeks ago . . . our doctor . . . did he tell you something about me? Tom, you've been so good to me . . . am I dying?"<br><br><i>It took a moment for it all to sink in. Then I burst out laughing.</i><br><br><i>"No, honey," I said, wrapping her in my arms, "you're not dying; I'm just starting to live!"</i>[Tom Anderson, "How Love Came Back,"<i>Reader's Digest,</i>October 1986, pp. 129-30]<br><br>We are taught that we should deal kindly with one another even in difficult situations.<br><br>True love is unselfish. President Kimball said,<br><br><i>For many years, I saw a strong man carry his tiny, emaciated, arthritic wife to meetings and wherever she could go. There could be no sexual expression. Here was selfless indication of affection. I think that is pure love. I saw a kindly woman wait on her husband for many years as he deteriorated with muscular dystrophy. She waited on him hand and foot, night and day, when all he could do was to blink his eyes in thanks. I believe that was love.</i>[<i>Love vs. Lust,</i>Brigham Young University Speeches of the Year (Provo, 5 January 1965), p.18]<br><h2><b>Following the Golden Rule</b></h2><br>I have always been impressed with the instructions given to Joseph Smith by the Lord at a most difficult time in his life. The Prophet had been incarcerated in Liberty Jail for a number of months under most distressing conditions. It was cold and dark and uncomfortable. He knew that his people were being driven from their homes and scattered. He worried for the welfare of his family. It is only natural that at such a time he would be discouraged. He cried out, "O God where art thou?" "How long shall [thy people] suffer these wrongs and unlawful oppressions, before thine heart shall be softened toward them?" And then the answer came, "My son, peace be unto thy soul; thine adversity and thine afflictions shall be but a small moment; And then, if thou endure it well, God shall exalt thee on high; thou shalt triumph over all thy foes" (D&amp;amp;C 121:1, 3, 7–8).<br><br>Really hearing the Savior's voice as he taught the Golden Rule would help us: "Therefore all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them" (Matthew 7:12). Surely we do not need to hear this three times before we really hear it.<br><br>Learning to say, "I'm sorry," learning to say, "I forgive; it's all right"--these are part of perfecting ourselves, too.<br><br>President Kimball said,<br><br><i>If we forgive all real or fancied offenses before we ask forgiveness of our own sins . . . if we manage to clear our own eyes of the blinding beams before we magnify the motes in the eyes of others--what a glorious world this would be! Divorce would be reduced to a minimum; courts would be freed from disgusting routines; family life would be heavenly;</i>[and our community lives would be blessed]. [Except ye Repent . . . ," general conference,<i>Improvement Era,</i>November 1949, p. 771]<br><br>The Lord offered a warning and some instruction on how we are to deal with each other. This was given particularly to priesthood holders, but it seems to apply equally well to all of us. The Lord said,<br><br><i>When we undertake to cover our sins, or to gratify our pride, our vain ambition, or to exercise control or dominion or compulsion upon the souls of the children of men, in any degree of unrighteousness, behold, the heavens withdraw themselves, the Spirit of God is grieved.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 121:37]<br><br>And this is how he said we should deal with others: "By persuasion, by long-suffering, by gentleness and meekness, and by love unfeigned; By kindness . . . . Let thy bowels also be full of charity towards all men, . . . and let virtue garnish thy thoughts unceasingly." Then comes the promise: "Then shall thy confidence wax strong in the presence of God" (D&amp;amp;C 121:41–42, 45).<br><br>President George Albert Smith had a nine-point creed by which he lived. Two of the points seem to be particularly relevant to share with you at this time. First, "I would not knowingly wound the feelings of any, not even one who may have wronged me, but would seek to do him good and make him my friend.' And second, "I would overcome the tendency to selfishness and jealousy and rejoice in the success of all the children of my Heavenly Father" ("Greatness in men--Superintendent George Albert Smith," by Bryant S. Hinckley,<i>Improvement Era,</i>March 1932, p. 295).<br><br>During the past election campaign, President-elect Bush said that his desire was for us to be a kinder, gentler nation. Possibly this was campaign rhetoric, but the idea is certainly laudable and can be achieved as each of us seeks to be perfected in the Savior, to be more thoughtful and considerate of others.<br><br>Jesus said, "A new commandment I give unto you, That ye love one another; as I have loved you, that ye also love one another" (John 13:34). It was not to be just friends and family that we love. He also said, "Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you" (Matthew 5:44).<br><br>I remember reading an incident of true Christian charity recorded by columnist Jack Anderson:<br><br><i>The remarkable thing about Joann Jones is the way she smiles through the tears. Her neighbors in Paris, Arkansas, can tell you she has been dogged by hard times. Yet her whole personality always seems to smile.</i><br><br><i>Left with three children to support, Joann found work as a cook and eventually opened her own small restaurant. But her 22-year-old son was stricken with a rare disease. He lost a leg and, because she couldn't keep up with the medical bills, she lost the restaurant.</i><br><br><i>Yet these tragedies didn't dampen her spirit. All that mattered, she told friends, was that her son was alive and preparing to become a missionary.</i><br><br><i>The financial squeeze left her with no money to pay insurance premiums. Then her small home burned down. She remained cheerful. At least the family was still together--almost too close together, cramped into a cheap, second-hand trailer.</i><br><br><i>Then the other day, a cold front sent the tem perature plunging below zero in Arkansas. Joann stopped at a country store to use the pay phone. Across the road in a frozen field, she noticed Mexicans huddled under a cedar tree. They were shivering in shirt-sleeves in the cruel-cold, with only one blanket to keep them all warm.</i><br><br><i>She put down the phone and strode over to the freezing men. She couldn't speak Spanish, and they didn't understand English. But with gestures and a few words in common, they let her know they wanted to return to Mexico. But they had no money, no food, no warm clothing.</i><br><br><i>Joann, though impoverished herself, brought the migrant Mexicans home. The family took two blankets off their beds, and the afflicted son gave up his wool coat so each Mexican could wrap himself against the cold.</i><br><br><i>Joann remembered her church was holding a fireside service that evening in Fort Smith. She carefully counted out enough quarters to buy gas for the 65-mile round trip. She drove the forlorn four to the Latter-day Saints church, where she found two dozen members still assembled.</i><br><br><i>Interrupting, she announced she had four destitute Mexicans who needed help. The church members rustled up more warm clothing and collected enough cash to buy four bus tickets to Dallas, with pocket money for food along the way. The members also put through a call to Dallas and arranged for some Spanish-speaking members to meet the bus.</i><br><br><i>Joann Jones gave her widow's mite expecting nothing in return. I learned about her act of kindness from others. Because she cannot afford a telephone, I reached her at the diner where she now works. She didn't want to talk about her good deed; it didn't seem right, she said.</i><br><br><i>"Charity should be given in secret," she said. "Anyway, it was no big deal. Anyone would have done the same thing."</i>[Charity Deserves Reward,"<i>Washington Merry-Go-Round,</i>Winter 1983]<br><br>Joann lived the law of charity. Moroni describes Charity as "the pure love of Christ" (Moroni 7:47).<br><h2><b>"More Holiness Give Me"</b></h2><br>I would like to say just a word now about Moroni's advice to deny all ungodliness in our perfecting process. Ungodliness has crept into our society and is manifested in many ways. It would persuade us from our eternal course of perfection. We must be aware of its many disguises. I speak tonight specifically of inappropriate music, videos, and television that encourage unacceptable moral and sexual behavior. I would plead for you to avoid them even as the very plague that they are.<br><br>For as we seek to "come unto Christ," we must also come to his holy house. We must prepare to do so by denying ourselves all ungodliness.<br><br>Let us not have to be called three times as were the Nephites when the Savior came to them, but hear him now that he may minister to us, and then pray for strength that we might come unto him.<br><br>I close with this prayer that it may be ever on your mind to help you in this quest:<br><br><i>More holiness give me,</i><br><i>More strivings within,</i><br><i>More patience in suff'ring,</i><br><i>More sorrow for sin,</i><br><i>More faith in my Savior,</i><br><i>More sense of his care,</i><br><i>More joy in his service,</i><br><i>More purpose in prayer.</i><br><br><i>. . .</i><br><br><i>More purity give me,</i><br><i>More strength to o'ercome,</i><br><i>More freedom from earth-stains,</i><br><i>More longing for home.</i><br><i>More fit for the kingdom,</i><br><i>More used would I be,</i><br><i>More blessed and holy--</i><br><i>More Savior, like thee.</i><br>["More Holiness Give Me,"<i>Hymns</i>, 1985, no. 131]<br><br>I know our Savior lives. I pray that each of us will let our hearts believe him, be more receptive to his voice, be more willing to respond, and faithfully come unto him. I say this in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Barbara W. Winder was general president of the Relief Society of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when this fireside address was given at Brigham Young University on 8 January 1989.</i><br><br><i>© Intellectual Reserve, Inc.

<h1>e: Submitting to The Will of the Father - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
At a university it seems appropriate to introduce such a message with a piece of great literature--but I decided to use this verse anyway. Rudyard Kipling, eat your heart out.<br><br><i>If you can smile when things go wrong</i><br><i>And say it doesn't matter,</i><br><i>If you can laugh off cares and woe</i><br><i>And trouble makes you fatter,</i><br><br><i>If you can keep a cheerful face</i><br><i>When all around are blue,</i><br><i>Then have your head examined, bud,</i><br><i>There's something wrong with you.</i><br><br><i>For one thing I've arrived at:</i><br><i>There are no ands and buts,</i><br><i>A guy that's grinning all the time</i><br><i>Must be completely nuts.</i><br>["Smile, Darn You, Smile"]<br><br>I begin with a bit of humor only because the task I wish to discuss with you this morning is a sobering one--not something we can laugh off or say doesn't matter. It is not an issue limited to university-educated people, but it may be a particularly poignant one for them. It is a matter central to our salvation, and it may involve great pain. Unless we are "nuts," we probably won't grin through it all.<br><h2><b>"I Have Suffered the Will of the Father"</b></h2><br>Let me take a moment to set the stage. I use the word advisedly. I want to imply divine theater. Ralph Waldo Emerson once wrote, "If the stars should appear one night in a thousand years, how would men believe and adore; and preserve for many generations the remembrance of the city of God which had been shown [them]!" (<i>Nature</i>[1836], section 1).<br><br>In the spirit of that very provocative thought, I invite you to consider another startling--and much more important scene that should evoke belief and adoration, a scene which, like the stars at night, we have undoubtedly taken too much for granted. Imagine yourselves to be among the people of Nephi living in the land of Bountiful in approximately A.D. 34. Tempests and earthquakes and whirlwinds and storms, quickened and cut by thunder and sharp lightning, have enveloped the entire face of the land.<br><br>Some cities--entire cities--have burst into flames as if by spontaneous combustion. Others have disappeared into the sea, never to be seen again. Still others are completely covered over with mounds of soil, and some have been carried away with the wind.<br><br>The whole face of the land has been changed, the entire earth around you has been deformed. Then, as you and your neighbors are milling about the temple grounds (a place that has suddenly seemed to many like a<i>very</i>good place to be), you hear a voice and see a man clothed in a white robe descending out of heaven. It is a dazzling display. He seems to emanate the very essence of light and life itself--a splendor in sharp contrast to the three days of death and darkness just witnessed.<br><br>He speaks and says simply, with a voice that penetrates the very marrow of your bones, "I am Jesus Christ, whom the prophets testified shall come into the world" (3 Nephi 11:10).<br><br>There it is--or, more correctly speaking, there<i>he</i>is! He is the focal point and principal figure behind every fireside and devotional and family home evening held by those Nephites for the last six hundred years, and by their Israelite forefathers for thousands of years before that.<br><br><i>Everyone</i>has talked of him and sung of him and dreamed of him and prayed--but here he actually is. This is the day, and yours is the generation. What a moment! But you find you are less inclined to check the film in your camera than you are to check the faith in your heart.<br><br>"I am Jesus Christ, whom the prophets testified shall come into the world." Of all the messages that could come from the scroll of eternity, what has he brought to us? Get a pencil. Where's my notebook? Turn on every tape recorder in town.<br><br>He speaks:<br><br><i>I am the light and the life of the world; ... I have drunk out of that bitter cup which the Father hath given me, and have glorified the Father in taking upon me the sins of. the world, ... I have suffered the will of the Father in all things from the beginning.</i><br><br>That is it. Just a few lines. Only fifty-two words. "And ... when Jesus had spoken these words the whole multitude fell to the earth" (3 Nephi 11:11–12).<br><br>This introductory utterance from the resurrected Son of God constitutes my only text today. I have thought very often about this moment in Nephite history. I cannot think it either accident or mere whimsy that the Good Shepherd in his newly exalted state, appearing to a most significant segment of his flock, chooses first to speak of his obedience, his deference, his loyalty, and loving submission to his father. In an initial and profound moment of spellbinding wonder, when surely he had the attention of every man, woman, and child as far as the eye could see, his submission to his father is the first and most important thing he wishes us to know about himself.<br><br>Frankly, I am a bit haunted by the thought that this is the first and most important thing he may want to know about<i>us</i>when we meet him one day in similar fashion. Did<i>we</i>obey, even if it was painful? Did<i>we</i>submit, even if the cup was bitter indeed? Did we yield to a vision higher and holier than our own, even when we may have seen no vision in it at all?<br><br>One by one he invites us to feel the wounds in his hands and his feet and his side. And as we pass and touch and wonder, perhaps he whispers, "If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me" (Matthew 16:24).<br><br>If such cross-bearing self-denial was, by definition, the most difficult thing Christ or any man has ever had to do, an act of submission that would, by the Savior's own account, cause him, "God, the greatest of all, to tremble because of pain, and to bleed at every pore, and to suffer both body and spirit"--if yielding and obeying and bowing to divine will holds only that ahead, then no wonder that even the Only Begotten Son of the true and living God "would that [he] might not drink the bitter cup, and shrink" (D&amp;amp;C 19:18)!<br><br>Even as we rehearse this greatest of all personal sacrifices, you can be certain that with some in this world it is not fashionable nor flattering to speak of submitting--to anybody or anything. At the threshold of the twenty-first century it sounds wrong on the face of it. It sounds feeble and wimpish. It just isn't the American way.<br><br>As Elder Neal A. Maxwell wrote recently,<br><br><i>In today's society, at the mere mention of the words </i>obedience <i>and </i>submissiveness<i> hackles rise and people re put on nervous alert. ... People promptly furnish examples from secular history to illustrate how obedience to unwise authority and servility to bad leaders have caused much human misery and suffering. It is difficult, therefore, to get a hearing for what the words </i>obedience <i>and </i>submissiveness <i>really mean--even when the clarifying phrase, "to God," is attached. </i>[<i>"Not My Will, But Thine"</i>(Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1988), p. 1]<br><br>After all, we come to a university, at least in part, to cultivate self-reliance, to cultivate independence, to learn to think and act for ourselves. Didn't Christ himself say, "Ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free" (John 8:32)? Such freedom is exactly what universities are about,<i>especially</i>this one. We try very hard here to unshackle you from the bondage of ignorance and the captivity of wrong opinions. We want you to be strong and to have the most enlightened intelligence possible. We want you to be powerful and high-principled free agents.<br><br>So how do we speak of such spiritual freedom and intellectual independence in one breath only to plead with you to be submissive and<i>very</i>dependent in the next breath? We do so because no amount of university education, or any other kind of desirable and civilizing experience in this world, will help us at the moment of our confrontation with Christ if we have not been able--and are not then able--to yield, yield all that we are, all that we have, and all that we ever hope to have to the Father and the Son.<br><br>The path to a complete Christian education passes through the Garden of Gethsemane, and we will learn there if we haven't learned it before that our Father will have no other gods before him--even (or especially) if that would-be god is our self. I assume you are all far enough along in life to be learning that great discipline already. It will be required of each of us to kneel when we may not want to kneel, to bow when we may not want to bow, to confess when we may not want to confess--perhaps a confession born of painful experience that God's thoughts are not our thoughts, neither are his ways our ways, saith the Lord (see Isaiah 55:8).<br><br>I think that is why Jacob says to be learned--or, we would presume, to be any other worthy thing--is good<i>if</i>one hearkens unto the counsels of God. But education, or public service, or social responsibility, or professional accomplishment of<i>any</i>kind is in vain if we cannot, in those crucial moments of pivotal personal history, submit ourselves to God even when all our hopes and fears may tempt us otherwise. We must be willing to place all that we have--not just our possessions (they may be the easiest things of all to give up), but also our ambition and pride and stubbornness and vanity--we must place it all on the altar of God, kneel there in silent submission, and willingly walk away.<br><br>I believe what I am describing here is the scriptural definition of a saint, one who will "yield to the enticings of the Holy Spirit," and "through the atonement of Christ ... becometh as a child, submissive, meek, humble, patient, full of love, willing to submit to all things which the Lord seeth fit to inflict upon him, even as a child doth submit to his father" (Mosiah 3:19).<br><h2><b>Obedience, the First Law of Heaven</b></h2><br>As the Great Exemplar and Daystar of our lives, is it any wonder that Christ chooses first and foremost to define himself in relation to his father--that he loved him and obeyed him and submitted to him like the loyal son he was? And what he as a child of God did, we must try very hard to do also.<br><br>Obedience<i>is</i>the first law of heaven, but in case you haven't noticed, some of these commandments are not easy, and we frequently may seem to be in for much more than we bargained for. At least if we are truly serious about becoming a saint, I think we will find that is the case.<br><br>Let me use an example from what is often considered by foes, and even by some friends, as the most unsavory moment in the entire Book of Mormon. I choose it precisely because there is so much in it that has given offense to many. It is pretty much a bitter cup all the way around.<br><br>I speak of Nephi's obligation to slay Laban in order to preserve a record, save a people, and ultimately lead to the restoration of the gospel in the dispensation of the fulness of times. How much is hanging in the balance as Nephi stands over the drunken and adversarial Laban I cannot say, but it is a very great deal indeed.<br><br>The only problem is that<i>we</i>know this, but Nephi does not. And regardless of how much is at stake, how can. he do this thing? He is a good person, perhaps even a well-educated person. He has been taught from the very summit of Sinai "Thou shalt not kill." And he has made gospel covenants.<br><br>"I was constrained by the Spirit that I should kill Laban; but ... I shrunk and would that I might not slay him" (1 Nephi 4:10). A bitter test? A desire to shrink? Sound familiar? We don't know why those plates could not have been obtained some other way--perhaps accidentally left at the plate polishers one night or maybe falling out the back of Laban's chariot on a Sabbath afternoon.<br><br>For that matter, why didn't Nephi just leave this story out of the book altogether? Why didn't he say something like, "And after much effort and anguish of spirit, I did obtain the plates of Laban and did depart into the wilderness unto the tent of my father?" At the very least he might have buried the account somewhere in the Isaiah chapters, thus guaranteeing that it would have gone undiscovered up to this very day.<br><br>But there it is, squarely in the beginning of the book--page 8--where even the most casual reader will see it<i>and must deal with it.</i>It is not intended that either Nephi<i>or</i>we be spared the struggle of this account.<br><br>I believe that story was placed in the very opening verses of a 531-page book and then told in painfully specific detail in order to focus every reader of that record on the absolutely fundamental gospel issue of obedience and submission to the communicated will of the Lord. If Nephi cannot yield to this terribly painful command, if he cannot bring himself to obey, then it is entirely probable that he can never succeed<i>or</i>survive in the tasks that lie just ahead.<br><br>"I will go and do the things which the Lord hath commanded" (1 Nephi 3:7). I confess that I wince a little when I hear that promise quoted so casually among us. Jesus knew what that kind of commitment would entail, and so now does Nephi. And so will a host of others before it is over. That vow took Christ to the cross on Calvary, and it remains at the heart of every Christian covenant. "I will go and do the things which the Lord hath commanded." Well, we shall see.<br><br>In all of this we are, of course, probing Lucifer's problem--he of the raging ego, he who always took the Burger King motto too far and had to have<i>everything</i>his way. Satan would have done well to listen to that wisest of Scottish pastors, George MacDonald, who warned: "There is one kind of religion in which the more devoted a man is, the fewer proselytes he makes: the worship of himself" (C. S. Lewis, ed.,<i>George MacDonald: An Anthology</i>[New York: Macmillan, 1947], p. 110).<br><br>But Satan's performance can be instructive. The moment you have a self there is the temptation to put it forward, to put it first and at the center of things. And the more we are--socially or intellectually or politically or economically--the greater the risk of increasing self-worship. Perhaps that is why when a newborn baby was brought before the venerable Robert E. Lee and the hopeful parents asked for this legendary man's advice, saying, "What should we teach this child? How should he make his way in the world?" the wise old general said, "Teach him to deny himself. Teach him to say no."<br><br>Often such an exercise in submission is as lonely as it is wrenching. Sometimes, in those moments when we seem to need the Lord the very most, we are left to obey<i>seemingly</i> unaided. The psalmist cries out on behalf of all of us in such times: "Why standest thou afar off, Lord? why hidest thou thyself in times of trouble?" "Why art thou so far from helping me? ... I cry in the daytime, but thou hearest not; and in the night season, [I] am not silent." "Hide not thy face far from me; ... leave me not, neither forsake me, O God of my salvation." "Be not silent [un]to me" (Psalms 10:1, 22:1–2, 27:9, 28:1).<br><br>The psalmist's plea rings most painfully of that ultimate anguish on Calvary, the cry that characterized an act of supreme submission: "My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?" (Matthew 27:46 and Psalms 22:1). And to a lesser degree we hear the supplication from Liberty Jail: "O God, where art thou? And where is the pavilion that covereth thy hiding place? How long shall thy hand be stayed... ? Yea, O Lord, how long...?" (D&amp;amp;C 121:1–3).<br><br>We know a good deal about the abuse that Joseph and his colleagues suffered at the hands of their jailors. Furthermore, we know of Joseph's submissive spirit at that time, choosing then of all moments to pen some of the most sublime language in holy writ--the appeal to maintain influence "only by persuasion, by long-suffering, by gentleness and meekness, and by love unfeigned" (D&amp;amp;C 121:41). What a setting in which to speak so kindly. What a brutal context in which to bring out such compassion.<br><br>But part of the story we<i>don't</i>remember as well is that of fellow prisoner Sidney Rigdon. Sidney was actually released from jail some two months before the Prophet Joseph and the others, but Rigdon left muttering that "the sufferings of Jesus Christ were ... fool[ish compared] to his" (<i>HC</i>3:264).<br><br>Now it would not behoove us here in the security of our pleasant quarters to pass judgment on Brother Rigdon or anyone else who suffered these indignities in Missouri, but to say that Christ's atoning sacrifice, bearing the weight of all the sins of all mankind from Adam to the end of the world, was foolishness compared to Brother Rigdon's confinement in Liberty Jail smacks of that defiant and finally fatal arrogance we so often see in those who end up in spiritual trouble.<br><br>Professor Keith W. Perkins of our Church History Department has written that this moment marks the turning point for ill in Sidney Rigdon's life (see "Trials and Tribulations: The Refiner's Fire" in<i>The Capstone of Our Religion: Insights into the Doctrine and Covenants,</i>eds. Robert L. Millet and Larry E. Dahl [Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1989], p. 147). After this experience he was no longer the distinguished leader he truly had been in the early years of the dispensation. Soon Joseph Smith no longer felt him to be of use in the First Presidency, and after the Prophet's death, Rigdon plotted against the Twelve in an effort to gain unilateral control over the Church. In the end he died a petty and bitter man, one who had lost his faith, his testimony, his priesthood, and his promises.<br><br>Joseph, on the other hand, would endure and be exalted when it was over. No wonder the Lord told him very early in his life, "Be patient in afflictions, for thou shalt have many; but endure them, for, lo, I am with thee, even unto the end of thy days" (D&amp;amp;C 24:8).<br><br>"Who are those arrayed in white before the throne of God?" John the Revelator is asked in his mighty vision. The answer: "These are they which came out of great tribulation, and have washed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb" (Revelation 7:14).<br><br>Sometimes it seems especially difficult to submit to "great tribulation" when we look around and see others seemingly much less obedient who triumph even as we weep. But time is measured only unto man, says Alma (see Alma 40:8), and God has a very good memory.<br><h2><b>"Thou Hast Sought My Will"</b></h2><br>Elder Dean L. Larsen writes of a Sabbath observing farmer who was troubled and dismayed to see his Sabbath-breaking neighbor bring in far better crops with a much higher, more profitable yield. But in such times of seeming injustice, we must remember that God's accounts are not always settled in October (see "The Peaceable Things of the Kingdom" in<i>Hope</i>[Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1988], p. 200).<br><br>Sometimes, too, we underestimate the Lord's willingness to hear our cry, to confirm our wish, to declare that our will is<i>not</i>contrary to his and that his help is there only for the asking.<br><br>Note this example taken from Elder F. Burton Howard's biography of President Marion G. Romney. I quote Elder Howard generously in summarizing this story.<br><br>In 1967 Sister Romney suffered a serious stroke. The doctors told then–Elder Romney that the damage from the hemorrhage was severe. They offered to keep her alive by artificial means but did not recommend it. The family braced themselves for the worst. Brother Romney confided to those closest to him that in spite of his anguished, personal yearning for Ida's restored health and continued companionship, above all he wanted "the Lord's will to be done and to take what he needed to take without whimpering."<br><br>As the days wore on, Sister Romney became less responsive. She had, of course, been administered to, but Elder Romney was "reluctant to counsel the Lord about the matter." Because of his earlier unsuccessful experience of praying that he and Ida might have children, he knew that he could never ask in prayer for something which was not in harmony with the will of the Lord.<br><br>He fasted that he might know how to show the Lord that he had faith and that he would accept God's will in their lives. He wanted to make sure that he had done all he could do. She continued to fail.<br><br>One evening in a particularly depressed state, with Ida unable to speak or recognize him, Brother Romney went home and turned as he always had to the scriptures in an effort to commune with the Lord. He picked up the Book of Mormon and continued where he had left off the night before.<br><br>He had been reading in the book of Helaman about the prophet Nephi, who had been falsely condemned and unfairly charged with sedition. Following a miraculous deliverance from his accusers, Nephi returned home pondering the things which he had experienced. As he did so he heard a voice.<br><br>Although Marion Romney had read that story many times before, it now struck him this night as a personal revelation. The words of the scripture so touched his heart that for the first time in weeks he felt he had tangible peace. It seemed as if the Lord was speaking directly to him. The scripture read:<br><br><i>Blessed art thou, ... for those things which thou hast done. ... And thou ... hast not sought thine own life, but hast sought my will, and to keep my commandments.</i><br><br><i>And now, because thou hast done this ... I will bless thee forever; and I will make thee mighty in word and in deed, in faith and in works; yea, even that all things shall be done unto thee according to thy word, for thou shalt not ask that which is contrary to my will.</i>[Helaman 10:4–5]<br><br>There was the answer. He had sought only to know and obey the will of the Lord, and the Lord had spoken. He fell to his knees and poured out his heart, and as he concluded his prayer with the phrase, "Thy will be done," he either felt or actually heard a voice which said, "It is not contrary to my will that Ida be healed."<br><br>Brother Romney rose to his feet. It was past two o'clock in the morning, but he knew what he must do. Quickly he put on his tie and coat, then went out into the night to visit Ida in the hospital.<br><br>He arrived shortly before three o'clock. His wife's condition was unchanged. She did not stir as he placed his hands upon her pale forehead. With undeviating faith, he invoked the power of the priesthood in her behalf. He pronounced a simple blessing and then uttered the incredible promise that she would recover her health and mental powers and yet perform a great mission upon the earth.<br><br>Even though he did not doubt, Elder Romney was astonished to see Ida's eyes open as he concluded the blessing. Somewhat stunned by all that had happened, he sat down on the edge of the bed only to hear his wife's frail voice for the first time in months. She said, "For goodness' sake, Marion, what are you doing here?" He didn't know whether to laugh or to cry. He said, "Ida, how are you?" With that flash of humor so characteristic of both of them, she replied, "Compared to what, Marion? Compared to what?"<br><br>Ida Romney began her recovery from that very moment, soon left her hospital bed, and lived to see her husband sustained as a member of the First Presidency of the Church, "a great mission upon the earth" indeed (F. Burton Howard,<i>MarionG.Romney: His Life and Faith</i>[Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1988], pp. 137–42).<br><br>We must be careful not to miss the hand of the Lord when it is offered, when it is his desire to assist. My daughter Mary made this point in a recent conversation, and I asked her permission to repeat it.<br><br>She was speaking of this ironic tendency to fear and avoid the very source of our help and deliverance, to retreat from rather than go toward our safety. She recalled the account in the fourteenth chapter of Matthew, when a storm arose on the Sea of Galilee and the ship containing the disciples was "tossed with waves: for the wind was contrary" (Matthew 14:24). In the midst of their anxiety, the disciples looked toward the shore and a being, a ghost, an apparition, was seen walking directly toward them.<br><br>This only increased their panic, and they began to cry out in fear. But it was Christ walking on the water toward them. "Be of good cheer," he called out. "It is I; be not afraid" (Matthew 14:27). He was coming to help in their moment of need, and they, misunderstanding, were fleeing.<br><br>"This miracle is rich in symbolism and suggestion," writes Elder James E. Talmage.<br><br><i>By what law or principle the effect of gravitation was superseded,</i>so<i>that a human body could be supported upon the watery surface, man is unable to affirm. The phenomenon is a concrete demonstration of the great truth that faith is a principle of power, whereby natural forces may be conditioned and controlled. Into every adult human life come experiences like unto the battling of the storm-tossed voyagers with contrary winds and threatening seas; ofttimes the night of struggle and danger is far advanced before succor appears; and then, too frequently the saving aid</i>is<i>mistaken for a greater terror. As came unto Peter and his terrified companions in the midst of the turbulent waters,</i>so<i>comes to all who toil in faith, the voice of the Deliverer--"It is I; be not afraid."</i>[<i>Jesus the Christ</i>(Salt Lake City: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latterday Saints, 1916), p. 337]<br><h2><b>Our Part in This Human Drama</b></h2><br>With that image of Christ again appearing in grandeur before us, let me conclude this drama where I began. We are taught that each one of us will come face-to-face with Christ to be judged of him, just as the world itself will be judged at his dramatic Second Coming.<br><br>I close with an adaptation of an account by C. S. Lewis entitled "The World's Last Night," which I have commandeered and changed for our purposes here this morning. The metaphor and most of the language is Lewis's, but the application is my own.<br><br>In King Lear (III, vii) there is a man who is such a minor character that Shakespeare has not even given him a name: he is simply called "First Servant." All the characters around him--Regan, Cornwall, and Edmund--have fine long-term plans. They think they know how the story is going to end, and they are quite wrong. The servant, however, has no such delusions. He has no notion how the play is going to go. But he understands the present scene. He sees an abomination (the blinding of old Gloucester) taking place. He will not stand for it. His sword is out and pointed at his master's breast in an instant. Then Regan stabs him dead from behind. That is his whole part: eight lines all told. But, Lewis says, if that were real life and not a play, that is the part it would be best to have acted.<br><br>The doctrine of the Second Coming teaches us that we do not and cannot know when Christ will come and the world drama will end. He may appear and the curtain may be rung down at any moment--say, before we have filed out of the devotional this morning. This kind of not knowing seems to some people intolerably frustrating. So many things would be interrupted. Perhaps you were going to get married next month. Perhaps you were to graduate this spring. Perhaps you were thinking of going on a mission or paying your tithing or denying yourself some indulgence. Surely no good and wise God would be so unreasonable as to cut all that short. Not<i>now,</i>of all moments!<br><br>But we think this way because we keep on assuming that we know the play. In fact, we don't know much of it. We believe we are on in Act II, but we know almost nothing of how Act I went or how Act III will be. We are not even sure we know who the major and who the minor characters are. The Author knows. The audience, to the extent there is an audience of angels filling the loge and the stalls, may have an inkling. But we, never seeing the play from the outside (as Sister Holland has just suggested), and meeting only the tiny minority of characters who are "on" in the same scenes as ourselves, largely ignorant of the future and very imperfectly informed about the past, cannot tell at what moment Christ will come and confront us. We will face him one day, of that we may be sure; but we waste our time in guessing when that will be. That this human drama has a meaning we may be sure, but most of it we cannot yet see. When it is over we will be told. We are led to expect that the Author will have something to say to each of us on the part that each of us has played. Playing it well, then, is what matters most. To be able to say at the final curtain "I have suffered the will of the Father in all things" is our only avenue to an ovation in the end. (See "The World's Last Night," in<i>Fern-Seed and Elephants and Other Essays on Christianity byC. S.Lewis,</i>ed. Walter Hooper [Great Britain: Fontana/Collins, 1975], pp. 76–77.)<br><br><i>The work of devils and of darkness is never more certain to be defeated than when men and women, not finding it easy or pleasant but still determined to do the Father's will, look out upon their lives from which it may seem every trace of God has vanished, and asking why they have been</i>so<i>forsaken, still bow their heads and obey.</i>[Paraphrased from C. S. Lewis, <i>The Screwtape Letters</i>(New York: Macmillan Publishing Co., 1961), p. 39]<br><br>That it may be so in your rich and beautiful and blessed young lives--faithful to the Father in all things and to the very end--I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Jeffrey R. Holland was president of Brigham Young University when this devotional was given on 17 January 1989.</i><br><br><i>© Brigham Young University. All rights reserved.</i>
<h1>pose: Filling the Measure of Your Creation - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
When my daughter, Mary, was just a small child, she was asked to perform for a PTA talent contest. This is her experience exactly as she wrote it in her seven-year-old script.<br><h2><b>"What Can I Be?"</b></h2><br>"I was practicing the piano one day, and it made me cry because it was so bad. Then I decided to practice ballet, and it made me cry more; it was bad, too. So then I decided to draw a picture because I knew I could do that good, but it was horrid. Of course it made me cry.<br><br>"Then my little three-year-old brother came up, and I said, 'Duffy, what<i>can</i>I be? What can<i>I</i>be? I can't be a piano player or an artist or a ballet girl. What can I be?' He came up to me and whispered, 'You can be my sister.'"<br><br>In an important moment, those five simple words changed the perspective and comforted the heart of a very anxious child. Life became better right on the spot, and as always, tomorrow was a brighter day.<br><br>All of us face those questions about <i>our </i>role, <i>our </i>purpose, <i>our </i>course in life--and we face them long after we are children. I visit with enough of you (and I remember our own university years well enough) to know that many of you, perhaps most of you, have occasions when you feel off-balance or defeated--at least temporarily. And we ask, 'What will I be, when will I graduate, whom will I marry, what is<i>my</i>future, how will I make a living, can I make a contribution?"--in short, "What can I be?"<br><br>Take heart if you are still asking yourselves such questions, because we all do. I do. We<i>should</i>concern ourselves with our fundamental purposes in life. Surely every philosopher past and present agrees that, important as they are, food and shelter are not enough. We want to know what's next. Where is the meaning? What is my purpose?<br><br>When asking these questions, I have found it extremely reassuring to remember that one of the most important and fundamental truths taught in the scriptures and in the temple is that "Every living thing shall fill the measure of its creation."<br><br>I must admit that when I first heard this directive, I thought it meant only procreation, having issue, bearing offspring. And I'm sure that is probably the most important part of its meaning, but much of the temple ceremony is symbolic, so surely there can be multiple meanings in this statement as well. Part of the additional meaning I now see in this commandment is that every element of creation has its own purpose and performance. Every one of us has been designed with a divine role and mission in mind. I believe that if our desires and works are directed toward what our heavenly parents have intended us to be, we will come to feel our part in their plan. We will recognize the "full measure of our creation," and nothing will give us more holy peace.<br><h2><b>Each of Us Playing Our Part</b></h2><br>I once read a wonderful analogy of the limitations our present perspective imposes on us. The message was that in the ongoing process of creation--our creation and the creation of all that surrounds us--our heavenly parents are preparing a lovely tapestry with exquisite colors and patterns and hues. They are doing so lovingly and carefully and masterfully. And each of us is playing a<i>part--our</i>part--in the creation of that magnificent, eternal piece of art.<br><br>But in doing so we have to remember that it is very difficult for us to assess our own contributions accurately. We see the rich burgundy of a neighboring thread and think, "That's the color I want to be." Then we admire yet another's soft, restful blue or beige and think, "<i>No,</i>those are better colors than mine." But in all of this we don't see<i>our</i>work the way God sees it, nor do we realize that others are wishing they had our color or position or texture in the tapestry--even as we are longing for theirs.<br><br>Perhaps most important of all to remember is that through most of the creative period we are confined to the limited view of the<i>underside</i>of the tapestry where things can seem particularly jumbled and muddled and unclear. If nothing really makes very much sense from that point of view, it is because we are still in process and unfinished. But our heavenly parents have the view from the top, and one day we will know what they know--that every part of the artistic whole is equal in importance and balance and beauty.<i>They</i>know our purpose and potential, and<i>they</i>have given us the perfect chance to make the perfect contribution in this divine design.<br><br>The Lord. has promised us in D&amp;amp;C 12:7 that the only qualification required to be a part of this magnificent plan is to "have desires to bring forth and establish this work."<br><br><i>Yea, whosoever will thrust in his sickle and reap, the same is called of God.</i><br><br><i>Therefore, if you will ask of me you shall receive; if you will knock it shall be opened unto you.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 14:4–5]<br><br>Sometimes in our sowing and reaping and sifting, it may seem that God says "no" or "not now" or "I don't think so" when what we want for him to say--what we wish our tapestry to receive--is an affirmative "yes<i>"</i>or "certainly, right now" or "of course it can be yours." I want you to know that in my life when I have had disappointments and delays, I have lived to see that if I continue to knock with unshakable faith and persist in my patience--waiting upon the Lord and his calendar--I have discovered that the Lord's "no's" are merely preludes to an even greater "yes." I have learned in the twenty-five years since I was your age that the very delays and denials we worry about most, the very differences from each other that trouble our self-esteem, are the differences and delays that are the very best for our happiness and fulfillment.<br><br>I've often wondered of the struggles that may have plagued the mind of Moses when the Lord asked him to leave his royal privileges and position in order to serve him in abject poverty and meagerness. Contrast his mission with the Lord's design for Joseph to stay in Egypt, to use his power and prestige for righteous purposes. Apparently Jeremiah was never given the blessings of marriage or children although Jacob had the comfort and companionship of four righteous women and many children. Joshua seems to have been an incredibly confident, charismatic, take-charge kind of leader, but Moses was often reluctant and tentative and sometimes had to ask the Lord twice for directions. Each had a crucial--but<i>very</i> different--role to play.<br><br>Furthermore, age seems to make little difference in the diversity of this tapestry. David was a mere child when he deftly dispatched Goliath, but Abraham was more than one hundred years old when he gave us the supreme mortal example of faith and obedience. Esther had the wealth and attention of kings, giving her the opportunity to help save a nation, whereas Ruth was a poor, unaccepted Moabite--but one whose royal blood, ironically, carried the lineage of the Son of God himself. The Lord uses us<i>because</i>of our unique personalities and differences rather than in spite of them. He needs all of us, with all our blemishes and weaknesses and limitations.<br><br>So what<i>can</i>I be? What can<i>I</i>be? We can be what heavenly parents designed us and intend us and help us to be. How does one fill the measure of his or her creation? We do so by thrusting in a sickle and reaping with all our strength--and by rejoicing in our uniqueness and our difference. To be all that you can be, your only assignment is (1) to cherish your course and savor your own distinctiveness, (2) to shut out conflicting voices and listen to the voice within, which is God telling you who you are and what you will be, and (3) to free yourself from the love of profession, position, or the approval of men by remembering that what God<i>really</i>wants us to be is someone's sister, someone's brother, and someone's friend.<br><br>I bear my testimony that each of you has a purpose. It is different, it is distinct, it is divine. God lives. God loves you. And I do, too. I say this in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Patricia T. Holland, wife of Jeffrey R. Holland, gave this devotional at Brigham Young University on 17 January 1989.</i><br><br><i>© Brigham Young University. All rights reserved.</i>
<h1>ng the Saints - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Here is a story that I would like to share with you. The closing speaker at a stake conference was a General Authority. He had talked for about ten minutes when all of a sudden, from way back in the chapel, came a five-year-old boy strolling down the aisle. The boy was all dressed up by his mother for the occasion in gray slacks, a white shirt, and a red bow tie, and his hair was sticking up in the air with a lot of "greasy kid stuff." This dapper young man came down the aisle and stopped right in front of the pulpit. He looked up at the speaker and said, "You talk too loud." Then he turned around and went back to his mother.<br><br>Now the speaker hoped there would be no further interruptions. But, lo and behold, after fifteen minutes there came the boy walking down the aisle<i>again</i>, and he stopped for the second time in front of the speaker. This time, he looked up and said, "And you talk too long."<br><br>The speaker, however, did not react and continued to finish his talk. After all, we have been trained to keep our cool under all circumstances. Then there was a beautiful congregational closing hymn and the benediction to finish the meeting, followed by the usual socializing and shaking of hands. The mother of the five-year-old boy also came to the stand and said, "Elder, I hope you did not pay too much attention to my five-year-old boy because he was only repeating what<i>other</i>people were saying."<br><br>We love the Saints and especially the mothers of five-year-old boys, because, after all, none of us is perfect.<br><h2><b>Being Worthy</b></h2><br>Today I would like to teach you about one of the aspects of the mission of the Church, namely, "perfecting the Saints." I say<i>teach</i>because I feel I am assigned to be your teacher tonight, and all of you are my students--including the ones that are sitting on the stand. Now, I also know that on this campus--and on other campuses represented here tonight--there are many<i>good</i>students, and if we talk about perfection, I want you to remember these points:<br><br>Our perfection started already in the premortal existence. It is a lifelong process while we are on earth and continues beyond the veil.<br><br>Also, most of the perfecting is done in your own home, or, if you are a student, in your own room.<br><br>Although the words<i>perfect</i>and<i>perfection</i>are used several times in the scriptures, it is easier to describe them than to define them.<br><br>If I may use the words of Father Israel in the Old Testament that he spoke to his son Reuben, I would like to describe perfection as "excellency of dignity." Let me explain. The English word<i>dignity</i>is derived from the Latin word<i>dignus</i>, which means "worthy."<i>Excellency</i>, in its original meaning, is "being superior in." So this results then in the definition of perfection as "being superior in worthiness." Now, this may raise immediately with you the next question: But what exactly is "to be worthy"? Well, we can describe worthiness as follows: 'to live in accordance with<i>all</i>the teachings of the Lord as revealed throughout the dispensations of time." We find and can read these teachings in the four standard works of the Church.<br><br>To be worthy is also to free one's mind of all ill feelings toward other people. We can add to this that worthy people have a great personal desire to renew the covenants they made during the ordinance of baptism by immersion into the restored Church. In other words, they have a great desire to attend sacrament meeting each Sunday.<br><br><i>Worthiness</i>is determined solely on the basis of personal righteousness. For instance, accountable persons who have faith in the Lord and repent of their sins are<i>worthy</i>of baptism.<br><br>Church members who have a godly walk and conversation are worthy to partake of the sacrament. And those who have proven to keep all of the standards of the Church, after one year, are<i>worthy</i>of the blessings of the temple.<br><br>Worthiness always has reference to meriting a blessing or reward because of obedience to that law upon which its receipt is predicated. Perfection is truly the crowing reward of complete worthiness.<br><h2><b>The Pathway to Perfection</b></h2><br>I also want to make it clear that there are two kinds of perfection; namely,<i>perfection during our earthly life</i>and<i>eternal perfection</i>. The latter, of course, is to a great extent the result of the former.<br><br>What is required for our earthly perfection is living a God-fearing life of devotion to the truth, of walking in complete submission to the will of the Lord, and of putting first in one's life the things of the kingdom of God.<i>Eternal perfection</i>is reserved for those who overcome all things and inherit the fullness of the Father in the mansions hereafter. It is gaining eternal life, which is the kind of life God our eternal Heavenly Father lives in the highest heaven within the celestial world.<br><br>Many scriptures exhort the Saints to be perfect in this life; this condition will lead to eternal perfection hereafter unless a departure is made from the straight and narrow path, which is also called the pathway to perfection. This is the reason why we are repeatedly encouraged to endure in faith until the end. It is interesting to note that the word<i>perfect</i>is used to refer to men in the Old Testament like Noah and Job, who, we are told, were perfect in their generations. We also find in the Doctrine and Covenants that Seth, the son of Adam, was perfect (D&amp;amp;C 107:43), and that Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob have already received their exaltation (D&amp;amp;C 132:37).<br><br>When the Lord said in Matthew 5:48, "Be ye therefore perfect,<i>even as your Father</i>which is in heaven is perfect" (emphasis added), he was speaking of ultimate, eternal perfection in his Father's kingdom. After his own resurrection, and when all power had been given to him in heaven and in earth, he amplified his exhortation by saying, "Therefore I would that ye should be perfect<i>even as I</i>, or your Father who is in heaven is perfect" (3 Nephi 12:48; emphasis added).<br><br>From what I have taught you so far, it is clear the perfection is multidimensional. It involves various aspects of an individual's life, not just overcoming one or two undesirable character traits or conquering one or two bad habits.<br><br>I would also like to point out that there is an "internal" as well as an "external" perfection. As I see it, internal perfection is persistently applying gospel thinking in our daily lives. It involves our thoughts and our attitudes. We can say that internal perfection is what people around us can<i>not</i>see.<br><br>External perfection involves our daily actions, our good deeds, and our spiritual conversations. That is what people can see and hear.<br><br>We truly have to learn to leave Babylon talk and Babylon behavior behind us and fill our lives with Zion talk and Zion behavior because Zion is where the pure in heart are. We must give heed to the loving pleadings of the Redeemer and adjust our lives accordingly.<br><br>It is also advisable to measure our progress to perfection against ourselves rather than measure it in comparison to other people. Think, for instance, how much progress we have made since we were baptized. See how much we have advanced through our near-perfect understanding of the plan of salvation.<br><br>Perfection is a subtle process, and the outcome depends much on our kinship with our Heavenly Father and his Son Jesus Christ an dour continuing relationship with worthy people, with faithful, exemplary priesthood and auxiliary leaders in the Church.<br><br>Furthermore, how is the relationship with our family members in our home, with our married children (if we have them), and with our grandchildren? These aspects we have to consider also if we want to measure our perfection.<br><br>What other practical advice will keep us on "the straight and narrow path"?<br><br>The Savior's revelations as written in the scriptures and the inspired curriculum of the Church--the handbooks, the manuals, the videotapes, the filmstrips, and the personal study guides--when acted upon correctly, will promote optimal perfection.<br><br>But there is no real perfection without the ordinances and covenants that we make in the house of the Lord, especially the sealing of husband and wife to one another and children to their parents.<br><br>I have come to the conclusion that perfection is obtained more through self-development and self-study than through listening to the teachings and reminders of others. I have also come to the realization that the average member of the Church spends only about nine hours per week because of callings that require his or her presence in church, and another three hours for other church activities.<br><br>In Holland, where I was born, I learned early in school that there are twenty-four hours in a day. And I believe that is the same in the United States. And in Holland I also learned that there are seven days in a week. I think that is the same here, too. I have calculated with my calculator that there are therefore 7 times 24, or 168 hours in every week. And of these 168 hours, on the average, we spend only 9 hours in church. That is just a little over 5 percent of the total available time each week. Do we all understand now from this simple calculation that the home is indeed the ideal place to lay a firm foundation for our own perfection?<br><br>Increased faith through prayer and study and controlled behavior through self-discipline also are excellent tools for working on our own perfection. Faith, good works, and holding on to the iron rod keep a person on the road to perfection that leads to salvation and exaltation.<br><br>Let's therefore not suffer from what Elder Neal A. Maxell calls the "escalator syndrome." Some members, after being baptized into this church, have the mistaken idea that they have stepped on an escalator that will carry them smoothly and automatically to heaven. They think that all they have to do is hang on to the iron rod, which they conceive as the handrail of the escalator that moves up and up with them to heaven. Have you ever watched people on an escalator? Have you been in the department store? Have you seen the angelic smiles on the faces of the people who move up and up and up and up? They just stand there and smile because that's where they are going. And architects always plan it this way, so that one escalator is going up and the other is going down, and they cross halfway. And you should also see the look of disdain on some of the people's faces who are going up: "<i>We</i>are going to<i>heaven</i>, and you dismal people are going in the wrong direction." That's what Elder Maxwell calls the escalator syndrome, and I thought you should be aware of that. There are no escalators in this kingdom.<br><br>When I mentioned controlled behavior through self-discipline, I thought of the scripture in the Book of Mormon where the prophet Jacob says to the multitude, "O be wise; what can I say more?" (Jacob 6:12). Now, isn't that a wonderful teaching? Maybe we should write these two words on a piece of paper, just simply, black on white for our perfection, "Be Wise." You know how I translate that, or paraphrase it? He said, "Oh, don't do dumb things. What can I say more?" I think these are marvelous teachings.<br><br>I suggest that we hang a sign like this on the door of our refrigerator in the kitchen at home because I understand that is<i>the</i>information center in most LDS homes. "Come unto Christ," "Families Are Forever," "Lengthen Your Stride," to name a few, have adorned the refrigerator door in our kitchen in years past.<br><br>If we truly understand the sacred meaning of these things, we will do everything in our power to set our lives in order. We then will accomplish the things that need to be done to make us a little bit more perfect every day.<br><br>Let us therefore strive to be 100 percent worthy so that all may be eligible to enter the temple to perform the ordinances there and make covenants with the Lord of a higher order than the covenants of baptism and confirmation.<br><br>Elder Boyd K. Packer, a member of the Council of the Twelve, expressed this idea very clearly during a training meeting of the members of the First Quorum of the Seventy with the following words about the higher covenants in the temple: "If we have our ordinances performed, and if we have made the higher covenants, what other things we might have missed in this life here on earth really do not matter. We can even be sick and we can be afflicted and we can be poor and we can be ignorant of many things, but if we have received our ordinances and covenants and keep them, we have truly lived. If we do not have these sacred things anchored in our lives, whatever else we may have achieved in morality will be of very little value in eternity."<br><h2><b>The Foundations of Perfection</b></h2><br>Because you are such good students, I want, as your teacher, to share with you six points that are really the foundation for the perfection of every member of the Church. I would call perfection a "do-it-yourself" job, and you will need these six tools when you travel on the pathway to perfection.<br><h3><b><i>1. Revelation</i></b></h3><br>The first part of the foundation of man's perfection is revelation. To be perfected, each individual must accept revelation through prophets and other priesthood leaders and seek personal revelation. By definition, revelation is communication from God to man with divine truth and divine guidance. Every devoted, obedient, and righteous person receives revelation from God. Revelation is the natural inheritance of all the faithful.<br><br>The gift of the Holy Ghost will be poured out upon all those who abide the law entitling them to that divine companionship. Speaking through the Prophet Joseph Smith,, the Lord revealed, "If thou shalt ask, thou shalt receive revelation upon revelation, knowledge upon knowledge, that thou mayest know the mysteries and peaceable things--that which bringeth joy, that which bringeth life eternal" (D&amp;amp;C 42:61). Every person who is sufficiently faithful and sufficiently spiritual has the promise that God himself will appear to him. In D&amp;amp;C 93:1 we read: "Verily, thus saith the Lord: It shall come to pass that every soul who forsaketh his sins and cometh unto me, and calleth on my name, and obeyeth my voice, and keepeth my commandments, shall see my face and know that I am."<br><br>All Saints are expected (because they have the gift of the Holy Ghost) to gain personal revelation and guidance to go through this life and be perfected and return to their Father in Heaven. As a convert to the Church, I always marvel at the sight of very young children in the Primary organization folding their arms and standing reverently to recite by heart the Articles of Faith. I always was, and I still am, impressed to hear four- or five-year olds say the ninth article of faith: "We believe all that God has revealed, all that He does now reveal, and we believe that He will yet reveal many great and important things pertaining to the Kingdom of God."<br><br>I also now understand perfectly that this ninth article of faith is for all of us, without exception. This is the divine guidance that Heavenly Father wants us to receive while traveling through our earthly journey in order to return unto him. As Latter-day Saints, we simply cannot live one day with out revelation. Therefore, it is truly the foundation of our perfection. And the Latter-day Saint father, being the spiritual leader in his own home, must see to it that<i>he</i>receives divine direction to lead his family in righteousness and to teach his family members to receive personal revelation also, that all may be perfected.<br><h3><b><i>II. The Scriptures</i></b></h3><br>The second part of the foundation of man's perfection is the scriptures. To be perfected each individual must search and obey the doctrine and commandments in the scriptures. President Ezra Taft Benson has said, "Always remember, there is no satisfactory substitute for the scriptures and the words of the living prophets. These should be your original sources." And then he said, "Read and ponder more what the Lord has said and less what others have written concerning what the Lord has said" (CES Seminar, 17 September 1976).<br><br>I testify that the book of scriptures I hold in my hand contains the revelations of God through all dispensations of time from Adam to Joseph to President Spencer W. Kimball's declaration on the priesthood.<br><br>I also testify that all the promises and blessings recorded in this book shall be fulfilled. In section 1, verse 37, of the Doctrine and Covenants we read: "Search these commandments, [It doesn't say, "<i>Read</i>these commandments," it doesn't say, "<i>Study</i>these commandments," it says, "<i>Search</i>." That includes the footnotes.] for they are true and faithful, [which means dependable or trustworthy] and the prophesies and promises which are in them shall all be fulfilled."<br><br>If we truly seek perfection through prayerful study, we should accept the following challenges in the year that has just started.<br><br>Challenge Number 1: Members and leaders of the Church carry their scriptures to<i>all</i>church meetings, plus church and religion classes.<br><br>Challenge Number 2: Members and leaders of the Church<i>mark</i>their scriptures during talks, lessons, and self-study.<br><br>Challenge Number 3: Members and leaders of the Church and their children<i>read</i>the scriptures each day at a specific time.<br><br>We are all familiar with the scripture in Luke 12:48 where it says, "For unto whomsoever much is given, of him shall be much required." We have received much in the scriptures and therefore how much is required of us? This is required: that we<i>carry</i>and<i>mark</i>and<i>search</i>the scriptures. Do you know why? So that we all may receive the Spirit of the Lord as the guiding force in our lives; so that we all may receive the power to resist the temptation that will come to all of us, without exception; so that we all may hold on to all the good things we have received and therefore find joy in this life.<br><br>I am sure the majority of you have heard about the threefold mission of the Church (1) to proclaim the gospel, (2) to perfect the Saints, and (3) to redeem the dead. This has been taught in so many church meetings since April 1981 that by now practically all have received a knowledge of it. But today I would like to share with you another important mission--namely, the mission of the scriptures. This mission also has three important points that we must become familiar with.<br><br><i>a. Place the scriptures in the hands of all the people.</i>Every member should have a copy of the four standard works of the Church in his or her own language for personal daily use. You are the first ones tonight to hear that the Council of the First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve have last week approved to translate the Book of Mormon into seventy more languages, besides thirty-four languages in which the Book of Mormon has already been translated and printed. This will make the Book of Mormon available worldwide in 104 major languages in the world, and the time given by the Brethren when it must be ready is the year 2000. In the next eleven years a group of dedicated people must find the translators and the spiritual reviewers and all the things that go into translating the Book of Mormon into seventy more languages because it is part of the mission of the scriptures.<br><br><i>b. Get the people into the scriptures.</i>The members must be obedient and willing to sacrifice their time to really become acquainted with the revelations of the Lord.<br><br><i>c. Get the Spirit of the Lord into the hearts of the people.</i>With the aid and inspiration of the scriptures all may be sanctified and perfected and all may therefore receive the spirituality and perfection required to return to their Father in Heaven.<br><br>President Ezra Taft Benson has repeatedly challenged us to reread the Book of Mormon. And I presume he will continue to do so until every member of the Church has shown obedience in this respect. There are, however, many time challenges in our lives. I have a little write-up here that I would like to share with you tonight; it makes interesting reading. It is called "The Choice is Ours." Listen carefully; it may sound very familiar to you.<br><br><i>The Choice Is Ours</i><br><i>On the table, side by side,</i><br><i>Lie the Book of Mormon and TV Guide.</i><br><i>One is well-worn and cherished with pride--</i><br><i>Alas, not the Book of Mormon, but TV Guide!</i><br><br><i>As the pages are turned, what shall they see?</i><br><i>Oh, what does it matter? Turn on the TV!</i><br><i>The word of God is rarely read--</i><br><i>A verse here and there before going to bed.</i><br><br><i>Exhausted and tired as can be,</i><br><i>Not from reading the scriptures, but watching TV.</i><br><i>The Plan of Salvation is full and free;</i><br><i>But it is found in the Book of Mormon--not on TV.</i><br><br>I like that. And you must too; you are good students. Brothers and sisters, let us be obedient to the counsel of the living prophet and study the scriptures every day for our own development and perfection.<br><h3><b><i>III. The Holy Priesthood of God</i></b></h3><br>Another important point in the foundation of man's perfection is--and we can't do without it in this kingdom--the holy priesthood of God.<br><br>If we look at the holy priesthood from an eternal perspective, we can truly say that the priesthood is the eternal power and authority of Deity by which all things exist; by which they are created, governed, and controlled; by which the universe and worlds without number have come rolling into existence; by which the great plan of creation, redemption, and exaltation operates throughout immensity. It is truly the power of God. (See Bruce R. McConkie,<i>Mormon Doctrine</i>, p. 594.)<br><br>It is proper and common in the Church to speak of the two great orders of the priesthood. As we can read in Doctrine and Covenants 107:1, "There are, in the church, two priesthoods, namely, the Melchizedek and Aaronic, including the Levitical Priesthood." These priesthoods are conferred upon worthy individuals who are then ordained to offices in the priesthood.<br><br>Once the Melchizedek Priesthood has been conferred upon a worthy man, there is no advancement from one office to the other within the Melchizedek Priesthood. Every elder holds as much priesthood as an apostle or even as the President of the Church, though these latter officers hold greater administrative assignments in the kingdom. It follows also that any holder of the Melchizedek could perform any priestly function he was appointed to do by the one holding the keys of the kingdom. Normally, a priesthood bearer works in the particular segment of the priesthood circle in which his primary responsibility lies. (See<i>Gospel Doctrine,</i>5<sup>th</sup>edition, pp. 148 –49.)<br><br>An elder in the Melchizedek Priesthood has all the priesthood he needs to qualify for exaltation in the highest heaven of the celestial world. If in a stake of Zion or on a ward level the office that is to be filled requires such, an elder in the Melchizedek Priesthood is ordained a high priest. This, however, is done only in the stakes of Zion and not in the mission field where the mission organization has only districts.<br><br>Now, let me give you an interesting thought on this. When I was still living in Holland, I was a counselor in the Netherlands Mission presidency to three different mission presidents, but I happily served in that calling as an elder. Even when, in 1972, I was called to serve as a Regional Representative, I was not ordained a high priest because I was living in a branch in the mission field, and my new calling did not require me to be ordained a high priest. I possessed all the authority of the priesthood to carry out my duties. So when I was called to the First Quorum of the Seventy in April 1976, I was holding the office of elder in the Melchizedek Priesthood, not having served as a bishop or stake president. Now, this was kind of unusual. As far as I know I am the only one in this century that was called to serve on the presiding councils of an elder in the Melchizedek Priesthood when called. President Spencer W. Kimball was the one who called me, and after I was sustained, he ordained me a seventy and a high priest at that time.<br><br>In the nineteenth century the same had happened in a few instances. Brigham Young and Heber C. Kimball and a few others after them were called to be General Authorities of the Church when they were elders in the Melchizedek Priesthood. So I feel I am in good company.<br><br>Talking about the perfecting of the Saints, I can state that every worthy man must receive and honor the oath and covenant of the Melchizedek Priesthood. And every father in the home has the great responsibility to prepare his sons to<i>receive</i>the priesthood and the other family members to<i>honor</i>the priesthood.<br><br>I testify to all of you that the holy priesthood is truly the foundation of men's perfection and exaltation.<br><h3><b><i>IV. The Holy Ordinances</i></b></h3><br>The next point to consider in the foundation of man's perfection concerns the holy ordinances. To be perfected, each individual must receive all the sacred ordinances, including the highest ordinances in the temple, and be true to the covenants that are made. For better understanding, let me give some definitions. A saving<i>ordinance</i>is a<i>sacred act</i>, prescribed by the Lord Jesus Christ, on the conditions of which we receive the purifying and exalting blessings of his atonement. A<i>covenant</i>is a sacred, binding, and solemn agreement with mutual promises between God and men. The new and everlasting covenant is the fullness of the gospel and embraces within its terms and conditions every other covenant that Deity ever has made or ever will make with men.<br><br>The terms and conditions of the new and everlasting covenant are accepted by every individual incident to baptism under the hands of a representative of the Lord who holds the proper office in the priesthood and who has been properly authorized to do so.<br><br>In effect, by baptism an individual signs his or her name to the<i>covenant of salvation.</i>If after baptism a person keeps the covenant and endures in faith until the end, his or her salvation is assured.<br><br>Ordination to office in the Melchizedek Priesthood and entering into that order of the priesthood named "the new and everlasting covenant of marriage" are both occasions when men make the<i>covenant of exaltation,</i>being promised through their faithfulness all that the Father has (D&amp;amp;C 131:2, 84:38).<br><br>The ultimate purpose of these ordinances is perfection, because we have to learn how to reach and live in the presence of our Heavenly Father. We also have to learn the laws of heaven and how to obey them so we may learn how to become exalted<br><br>I am sure that you now begin to understand why we presently have forty-one temples in operation worldwide. And it is certain that more temples will be announced by the First Presidency, built, and dedicated in the Lord's due time.<br><br><i>The temple ceremony clearly teaches the doctrine of where we came from, why we are here, and where we are going after this life. Through the knowledge gained in the temple, we can determine more quickly whether our daily behavior is right or wrong, and know of the need for repentance. Whether attending an endowment session, or witnessing the sealing ceremony of an eternal marriage, or just pondering and worshipping in the temple, we will feel close to God. The temple is God's house, where we have the privilege of learning of him and his purposes. To go through the temple, receive our endowments, and regularly attend is to receive some of the highest learning of eternity.</i>[Rulon G. Craven,<i>The Pursuit of Perfection</i>(Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1988) pp. 19–20]<br><br>It was President Harold B. Lee who expressed the thoughts as follows;<br><br><i>The temple ceremonies are designed by a wise Heavenly Father who has revealed them to us in these last days as a guide and a protection throughout our lives that you and I might not fail of an exaltation in the Celestial kingdom where God and Christ dwell.</i>[Harold B. Lee,<i>Decisions for Successful Living</i>(Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Company, 1973), p. 141]<br><br>Participating in the ordinances and truly living the higher covenants made in the temple take faith, courage, and obedience. The responsibility to be obedient to these covenants and receive those great blessings lies with each of us. We are individually responsible for keeping the covenants necessary for exaltation. Each week, as we attend sacrament meeting, we participate in renewing our covenants by partaking of the sacrament. In so doing, we covenant again and again to always remember Jesus Christ and to keep the commandments that he has given us, and then we are promised that we will always have his Spirit to be with us.<br><br>His Spirit, accepted by us and acted upon in faith, will always lead us in the path of righteousness. In Doctrine and Covenants 78:7, the Lord has revealed: "For if you will that I give unto you a place in the celestial world, you must prepare yourselves by doing the things which I have commanded you and required of you.'<br><br>I testify that there is no perfection without the holy ordinances of the gospel of Jesus Christ.<br><h3><b><i>V. Personal Talents and Gifts</i></b></h3><br>The next point of the foundation of man's perfection is the development of personal talents and gifts. We must be mindful that these gifts come from God and were acquired in the premortal existence to be used and developed after we start our mortal probation. Their purpose is to enlighten, encourage, and edify the faithful so they will be guided on the pathway to perfection.<br><br>I looked up the definition of<i>talents</i>in<i>Webster's Dictionary</i>, and this is what it says: "Talents: inborn creative abilities making for ease and dexterity in performance." Well, if this is true, then we surely have a vast reservoir of talents in the Marriott Center here tonight. And the presence of so many truly gifted people is proof of the divinity of the Lord's work.<br><br>Now, I realize that your personalities may be different--all of you have different personalities. Your temperamental makeup is different and your prevailing moods and inclinations may be different, but some things we all have in common. At one time we lived as spirit children with our Heavenly Father, we all were born through earthly parents, and we all shall leave this mortal existence in the Lord's due time. The big question is how do we live our lives between arrival and departure? All those who have been received in the kingdom of God on the earth through the covenant of God on the earth through the covenant of baptism in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints belong to the covenant people of the Lord and as such have received tremendous blessings of spiritual gifts to be led, guided, and directed.<br><br>In the scriptures we find many of the gifts mentioned by name; for instance, knowing by revelation that the Book of Mormon is truly the word of God. There is also the gift of being valiant to proclaim the gospel as well as the gift of healing, the gift of discernment, and the gift of speaking different languages. I have only time to name a few. There are, however, numerous other gifts of the Spirit. They are<i>infinite in number</i>and<i>endless in their manifestations.</i>I quote from the Book of Mormon again, Moroni 10:8:<br><br><i>And again, I exhort you, my brethren, that ye deny not the gifts of God, for they are many; and they come from the same God. And there are different ways that these gifts are administered; but it is the same God who worketh all in all; and they are given by the manifestations of</i>the Spirit of God<i>unto men, to profit them.</i>[Emphasis added]<br><br>We have to develop the divine gifts to<i>teach</i>, to<i>strengthen</i>, and to<i>serve others,</i>and in so doing we work on our own perfection also.<br><br>The duty and responsibility of the LDS father in the home is to assist his family members to develop their talents and gifts for the same purposes and to become indeed an eternal family.<br><h3><b><i>VI. Keeping the Commandments of God</i></b></h3><br>The next and last point is more or less a resume or a summing up of what I have taught you tonight: keeping the commandments of God. There is no perfection without obeying the commandments and enduring in faith until the end.<br><br>Elder Bruce R. McConkie, who is so sorely missed from our ranks, phrased it so beautifully in his book<i>Mormon Doctrine</i>under the heading "Commandments" that I would like to quote him.<br><br><i>These things which men are directed to do to attain peace in this life and gain eternal life in the world to come are collectively called the</i>commandments<i>. They are the laws, ordinances, covenants, contracts, statutes, judgments, decrees, revelations, and requirements which come to man from God. They are "the words of eternal life," with reference to which it is proclaimed:</i>"You shall live by every word that proceedeth forth from the mouth of God.<i>"</i>(D&amp;amp;C 84:43–44) [<i>MD</i>, p. 149; emphasis in original]<br><br>I think, brothers and sisters,<i>that</i>is the great challenge for each and every one of us, to live by every word that proceedeth forth from the mouth of God. And I hope that through my teachings I have been able to make this great challenge more visible and the ultimate goal more attainable. Let's simplify the challenge by accepting the invitation to live a perfect day one at a time.<br><br>Will you try to live tomorrow a perfect day? And if you fail to do so, then try again the next day. Then we truly make progress in carrying out one aspect of the mission of the Church, which is the mission of every individual member of the Church, namely, "to perfect the Saints."<br><br>I humbly pray that we may all be successful in doing so, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Jacob de Jager was a member of the First Quorum of the Seventy of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when this fireside talk was given at Brigham Young University on 5 February 1989.</i><br><br><i>© Intellectual Reserve, Inc.

<h1>he Crucible of Character - J. Richard Clarke - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
It was exactly thirty-nine years ago, about this time of the month, that I gave my best girl my South African diamond. We are delighted to be here today on this special Valentine's Day, and also at a time when we recognize our national leaders. I'm happy I brought my valentine with me. She will always be one of my very special heroes. She personifies as much as anyone some of the important principles I hope to articulate today.<br><h2><b>Our Character</b></h2><br>It is the ultimate design and purpose of our Divine Creator that we develop a Christlike character. A noble character is the product of a life well invested. While our intellect may be the gift of God or ancestral pedigree, our character is man-made and the fruit of personal exertion. In this sense we are a co-creator with our Heavenly Father. Our character is produced from the crucible of human experience. The forging process removes impurities and tempers and shapes us so that we might realize the measure of our creation. Character is the Liahona for our moral conduct.<br><br>The philosopher Immanuel Kant wrote,<br><br><i>No doubt it is a good and desirable thing to have intelligence, sagacity, judgment, and other intellectual gifts, by whatever name they may be called; it is also good and desirable in many respects to possess by nature such qualities as courage, resolution, and perseverance, but all these gifts of nature may be in the highest degree pernicious and hurtful if the will which directs them, or what is called character is not itself good.</i><sup>1</sup><br><br>Character is the power to act upon principle--the discipline to follow through with resolutions long after the spirit in which they were made has passed. As another writer states: "In the crisis of temptation, in the battle of life, when struggle comes from within or without, it is our strength, heroism, virtue and constancy--our character--which defends and secures our happiness and honor."<sup>2</sup><br><br>Life is a test, a formidable test, but one each of us can pass. As you know, blessings are predicated upon laws--laws that we must learn to obey if we are to be happy and successful. The scriptures teach us that we must be proven--to see if we will do that which the Lord commands us. To prove means "to establish or ascertain as true or genuine." We must know what is expected of us, exercise correct choices, and be responsible for the consequences of our choices.<br><h2><b>Are We Accountable?</b></h2><br>The Lord established a pattern of behavior and discipline in the Garden of Eden that is worthy of adoption. He explained the system to Father Adam and Mother Eve. Clear instruction was given. "Of every tree of the garden<i>thou mayest freely eat,</i>But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou<i>shalt not</i>eat."<br><br>Freedom of choice was emphasized. Father said, "Nevertheless,<i>thou mayest choose for thyself,</i>for it is given unto thee." Father's stand was reiterated. "But, remember that<i>I forbid it</i>."<br><br>He established the consequence. "For in the day thou eatest thereof<i>thou shalt surely die</i>" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/pgp/moses/3.16-17?lang=eng#p15">Moses 3:16–17</a>; emphasis added).<br><br>You are familiar with the events that followed. The tempter beguiled Eve with half-truths, resulting in her spiritual death and mortal change. Adam made a conscious choice with the same consequences.<br><br>The wisest and noblest of us have demonstrated from the beginning that voluntary obedience to the saving truths brings joy and peace in this life and eternal happiness hereafter. We know that consequences are set as choices are made. Obedience to divine law, then, is the highest expression of love and intelligence. Rebellion, not intelligence, has been the stumbling block of many of the talented and the proud.<br><br>Within our physical world, we have choices to exercise as we gain dominion over our environment. Some great forces of nature are beyond our power to regulate. But within our environment is the world of values; here we can be in command. I am not suggesting that all are equally advantaged or disadvantaged, but I am saying that in your world of values, you can choose what you are to be.<br><br>There is in our society a subtle and pernicious philosophy that leaves a wake of distress and makes a mockery of the divine gift of agency. I believe it to be satanic in origin and the enemy of righteousness. It can be expressed in four simple words: "I can't help myself." Dr. William Lee Wilbanks, professor of criminal justice at Florida International University, refers to this philosophy as: the new obscenity"--obscene, he says, "because it is offensive to the core concept of humanity ... [denying] the very quality that makes us human and not simply animals."<sup>3</sup><br><br>He cites examples. A rapist, who had broken into the house of a twenty-six year-old woman and raped her for the third time over a three-month period, justified his actions before the jury by claiming a hormonal defect that increased his sexual appetite to the point that he couldn't help himself. The jury bought the idea and only put him on probation.<br><br>In a more recent case, Ted Bundy confessed that, after saturating himself with pornography, he became the incarnation of his sensual appetites. This time, however, a wise judge ruled that Bundy was indeed responsible for his actions.<br><br>What about temptation, choice, appetite, habit?<i>Are</i>we accountable? As one eminent authority reported, "Temptation--resisted or indulged--has been supplanted by drives, instincts and impulses--satisfied or frustrated. Virtue and vice have been transformed into health and sickness."<sup>4</sup>This condition leads us to echo the question of the famous psychiatrist, Karl Menninger: "Whatever became of sin?"<br><br>In our world of values and choice, is deviant behavior uncontrollable or simply uncontrolled? In my opinion, we can develop any appetite, or form any habit by repetitious behavior. When we are habituated to drug dependency or other serious transgression, can we in fairness say that we are not responsible? Was there no choice involved? It is easy to blame forces outside ourselves for our own lack of self-discipline. To do so conveniently removes us from the encumbrance of accountability as we use the excuse "I can't help myself."<br><br>Dr. Wilbanks, in studying the power of human will in responsible behavior, examined the on-court activity of two professional tennis players--Bjorn Borg and John McEnroe. I quote:<br><br><i>You probably remember Borg as the Swede who rarely showed any emotion on the tennis court and who decided never to be angry at the linesmen and the umpire. But Borg's self-control was made, not born. Borg displayed an on-court temper similar to McEnroe's when he was in his early teens in Sweden when he was known for his swearing and throwing rackets. At the age of 13 he was suspended by his tennis club for six months. And his parents</i>supported that expulsion by locking up his racket and refusing to let him play at all.<br><br><i>Borg now says that he learned his lesson and simply decided from that day forward to control his temper--and he did.</i><br><br><i>By contrast, John McEnroe indicated in a recent "60 Minutes" interview that he believes he is "addicted" to his outbursts of temper.<sup>5</sup></i>[Emphasis added]<br><br>It is, however, interesting to note that McEnroe said the one time he<i>did</i>control his temper was when he played Borg because "he couldn't afford to waste one bit of energy when playing Borg." Dr. Wilbanks concludes his example by saying McEnroe's verbal obscenities on the court are a result of the obscene concept of addiction.<br><br>One final example from this interesting study.<br><br><i>Thousands of American soldiers in Vietnam became "addicted" to hard drugs but only 14 percent remained "addicted" upon their return to the United States. The 86 percent who quit simply decided that they did not want to get involved in the American drug culture. Their value system and self-discipline helped them to "Say No."</i><sup>6</sup>[Emphasis added]<br><br>News reports have recently outlined two regrettable stories regarding prominent athletes--1984 Olympic silver medalist Bruce Kimball, and Cincinnati Bengals fullback Stanley Wilson--men who have robbed themselves of brilliant sports futures by succumbing to temptation and relinquishing their self-control and self-respect to alcohol and cocaine.<br><br>Kimball, himself the past victim of a drunk driver, struggled valiantly to overcome injuries from that severe accident to contend for a place on the 1988 Olympic diving team. Now, instead of what might have been a glorious memory of standing on an Olympic platform with a medal of victory around his neck, he must live with the horrific nightmare of one evening of foolish choices that sentenced him to seventeen years in prison and the recurring guilt of having been responsible for the deaths of two teenagers.<br><br>After completing a rehabilitation program, having a terrific season, and earning a starting position in the game football players dream about most of their lives--the Super Bowl--Wilson succumbed just one more fateful time to the lure of drugs. "Cocaine," he said, "was like a slow suicide." At one point Wilson recalled doing drugs in his car with his five-year-old son watching. "My son looked at me and said, 'Daddy, why are you doing this?'" A good question, Stanley--why?<br><br>And these tragedies are not the onus of athletes alone. Movie stars, politicians, religious leaders, businessmen, students, even our neighbors and friends often surrender their integrity in exchange for one momentary thrill or passion.<br><br>Arthur Berry, the jewel thief who gained notoriety by stealing jewels from the royal family, was interviewed toward the end of his life. The reporter asked him what was his largest theft. Berry replied, "When I was young, I had all the advantages--intelligence, education, and financial means. I could have become anything I desired; I could've gone anywhere. But rather, I chose a life of crime. So when you write, don't say, 'Arthur Berry robbed the queen's jewels.' Put the biggest theft at the top. Simply say, 'Arthur Berry robbed Arthur Berry!"<br><br>Robert Benchlet said,<br><br><i>One of my fears for the future stems from the fact that in recent years some of the nation's brightest, best educated, and most richly rewarded career people have committed acts that destroy their careers and cancel all their bright promise. One interpretation is that they betrayed their values--for money, or power, or sensual pleasure. Another interpretation is that they didn't have any values to betray, that the values had been jettisoned long ago in the swift upward climb.</i><sup>7</sup><br><br>We are not without guile in the Church; but surely we ought to be, because where much is given much is expected. In matters of character, we should stand preeminent. Integrity must be our hallmark. For Latter-day Saints who have clearly stated values and standards, the compromise of personal integrity comes<i>before</i>committing a transgression. Integrity--or another word I like, veracity--is the taproot of our value system. Veracity has been defined as "habitual observance of the truth." It is not just knowing and thinking the truth, but it is<i>doing</i>the truth. It is instinctive honesty.<br><br>We have a classic example from the scriptures with which you are familiar. In the thirty-ninth chapter of Genesis we read of Joseph in Egypt. Joseph was the first role model that I remember my mother counseling me to emulate. I have loved and admired him ever since boyhood.<br><br>You will remember how the Lord blessed Joseph and how he found favor in the eyes of Potiphar, the wealthy and powerful officer of the pharaoh. He was made overseer of Potiphar's house and all that he had. And the Lord blessed the Egyptian for Joseph's sake. Potiphar left all he had in Joseph's hands and "he knew not ought he had." In other words, so great was his trust of Joseph that he didn't even know what he owned--"save the bread which he did eat" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/gen/39.6?lang=eng#p5">Genesis 39:6</a>).<br><br>Joseph was goodly and handsome. Potiphar's wife found him attractive and tried to seduce him, but he refused. He reminded her that Potiphar had entrusted everything to him. "Neither hath he kept back any thing from me but thee, because thou art his wife: how then can I do this great wickedness, and sin against God?' She persisted and her resisted. "He hearkened not unto her," and he avoided her (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/gen/39.7-10?lang=eng#p6">Genesis 39:7–10</a>.) One day she grabbed him, and the scripture records the famous clarion call of moral valor: "[He] fled, and got him out" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/gen/39.12?lang=eng#p11">Genesis 39:12</a>).<br><br>Joseph refused to compromise his integrity, his master's trust, and his covenant with the Lord. It was a matter of personal honor before even considering the enticing advances of Potiphar's wife.<br><br>Joseph Smith taught, "That person who never forsaketh his trust, should ever have the highest place of regard in our hearts" (<i>Teachings</i>, p. 31).<br><h2><b>Resisting Temptation</b></h2><br>Anciently, the Romans worshipped virtue and honor as gods. They built two temples that were so situated that none could enter the temple of Honor without passing through the temple of Virtue, thus symbolizing the truth that all honor is founded on virtue. He whose soul is set to do right finds himself more firmly bound by the principle of honor than by legal restraints. One's personal honor should exceed the norm of his society. As Seneca observed, "What the law does not forbid is forbidden in decency."<sup>8</sup><br><br>Sometimes we blame the devil for our sins. The Prophet Joseph also observed "that Satan was generally blamed for the evils which we did. ... The devil could not compel mankind to do evil; all was voluntary." Then he made this sobering statement: "Those who resisted the Spirit of God, would be liable to be led into temptation" (<i>Teachings</i>, p. 187).<br><br>We tend to resist or reject the Spirit first, then we succumb to temptation. King Benjamin taught: "After ye have known and have been taught all these things, if ye should transgress and go contrary to that which has been spoken, ... ye do<i>withdraw yourselves from the Spirit of the Lord,</i>that it may have no place in you to guide you in wisdom's paths that ye may be blessed, prospered, and preserved" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/2.36~?lang=eng#p35">Mosiah 2:36</a>; emphasis added).<br><br>We also read in the Doctrine and Covenants, "The Spirit enlighteneth every man through the world, that hearkeneth to the voice of the Spirit" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/84.46?lang=eng#p45">D&amp;amp;C 84:46</a>).<br><br>Too often we place ourselves in the wrong place at the wrong time. King David, for example, "tarried still at Jerusalem" for some R and R when it was "at the time when kings go forth to battle." In other words, he had left his post. At eventide he walked along the roof of his house and looked down at the beautiful, bathing Bathsheba. His sin began, not when he saw her, but when he lingered until a carnal appetite was quickened, uncontrolled but certainly controllable (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/2-sam/11.1-4?lang=eng#primary">2 Samuel 11:1–4</a>). The rest of the story ranks among the saddest in all of our scriptures.<br><br>We recall the profound words of Thomas Aquinas: "Perfection of moral virtue does not wholly take away the passions, but regulates them."<sup>9</sup><br><br>My young brothers and sisters, as the earth is ripening in iniquity, we must not obscure our appreciation for the beautiful and the wholesome and the godly. We plead for sustenance of the higher values and senses within us. That is character.<br><br>In Greek mythology, Ulysses was so concerned that the seductive music of the Sirens would destroy the sailors that he plugged their ears and tied them to the mast. But Orpheus, the god of music, said that the solution was to play sweeter music than that of the Sirens.<br><br>We do not deny that sin many provide fleeting pleasure or fun, but its consequent damage to the soul produces great sorrow. We have been given sweeter music in the principles and standards of the gospel of Jesus Christ. Let us play God's music; let us popularize decency. There is a better way. We have been endowed by the Lord with a spiritual power that raises us above all creatures. We are given reason and values rather than mere instinct. If we give up the reins to our impulses and passions, from that moment we surrender this higher prerogative.<br><br>Self-control is the highest form of courage. Sometimes it is necessary to stand alone against the crowd. I know that feeling. It is rarely popular. It is even more difficult to resist the pressure from members of the Church who, having compromised their own standards, apply even heavier pressure on you to surrender your own. But, as you seem to stand alone, there is another with you--even the Lord.<br><br>John, the apostle, warns of the spirit of the anti-Christ in the world and then reminds us: "Ye are of God ... greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the world" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/1-jn/4.4?lang=eng#p3">1 John 4:4</a>).<br><br>"As ye have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk ye in him," wrote Paul, and be "rooted and built up in him ... lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/col/2.6-8?lang=eng#p5">Colossians 2:6–8</a>).<br><br>What does it mean to be rooted in Christ? Several years ago I was in Jacksonville, Florida, the day after a hurricane had hit. What a mess! Uprooted trees were lying across the streets, on houses, and over automobiles. What amazed me were the tall palm trees that had been uprooted. I discovered that their roots were shallow. They had run horizontally in the sand just a few feet below the ground. When the heavy winds came, they were not anchored.<br><br>Daily, we are faced with tests that require decisions of character. "Our moral 'muscles,'" William James wrote, "grow with exercise and use. If we want them to be strong for the times of greater temptation, we must make them strong by using them to resist the ever-recurring small temptations."<sup>10</sup><br><br>Society tends to place value on the basis of cost. Preeminent then, must be the value of the human soul when we consider the incomparable price paid by our Savior through his atoning sacrifice. To the Prophet Joseph Smith, he declared:<br><br><i>Remember the worth of souls is great in the sight of God;</i><br><br><i>For behold, the Lord your Redeemer suffered death in the flesh; wherefore he suffered the pain of all men, that all men might repent and come unto him.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 18:10–11]<br><br>I believe that our conduct reflects our depth of understanding and appreciation for our Savior and his atonement. As your scriptural theme for Book of Mormon week states: "If ye have experienced a change of heart, and if ye have felt to sing the song of redeeming love, ... can ye feel so now?" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/5.26?lang=eng#p25">Alma 5:26</a>). Our love for the Lord should be our greatest motivation to live righteously. When we have a knowledge of and feeling for his suffering, how can we consciously contribute to that suffering through choosing to commit sin?<br><br>John Milton made this very incisive observation:<br><br><i>He that can apprehend and consider vice with all her baits and seeming pleasures and yet abstain, and yet distinguish, and yet prefer that which is truly better, he is the wayfaring Christian.</i><sup>11</sup><br><br>My beloved friends, may we always remember who we are. Let character prevail in all our choices. May we never forget that through the grace and mercy of our Redeemer, eternal life may be ours. Then, through the righteous, honest exercise of our free agency, may we be privileged at some future day to greet our Savior with confidence and to echo the words of the prophet Enos: "I rejoice in the day when ... [I] shall stand before him; ... [and] see his face with pleasure" (Enos, verse 27). I say this in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>J.

<h1>ith&#039;s Integrity: He Loveth That Which Is Right - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I want to talk about the significance of a special painting that hangs on a wall on the fourth floor of the Salt Lake Temple. It is where the First Presidency and the Council of the Twelve meet weekly to discuss Church affairs as they pertain to worldwide structuring and management.<br><br>On this fourth floor is the beautiful First Presidency and Council of the Twelve Room. It is approximately 30 feet wide, 50 feet long, and has a ceiling height of 12 feet. It is decorated in soft pastel colors with fixtures and furnishings that are in good taste and practical. In the front of this room and in the center are three chairs for the First Presidency to occupy. In a semicircle across the room from them are twelve seats where the members of the Twelve sit. In this setting of privacy and temple warmth, the various divisions, departments, councils, programs, and other needs of the Church are studied and reviewed and decisions are made. Worldwide areas and growth challenges are examined and supervised. Personnel needs are discussed, prayed over, and service calls determined.<br><br>On the front wall of this fourth-floor temple room are three original Harry Anderson paintings, each 40 x 34 inches. One painting, titled "Christ Calling Peter and Andrew," is of the Savior in white robes walking along a seashore. He is beckoning to Peter and Andrew, who are on a fishing boat with other fishermen, to follow him and "be fishers of men." The painting depicts Christ's calling of Peter and Andrew, later ordained as his apostles, to follow him.<br><br>Another painting, titled "The Crucifixion," is rendering of the Savior hanging on a cross at Calvary. Two thieves, also hanging on crosses, are at the left and right of Christ. Numerous observers, including Mary, the mother of Christ, Mary Magdalene, other mourners, and Roman soldiers are gathered around the crosses. Thunder clouds are gathered in the sky.<br><br>The third painting is titled "The Resurrection." Mary is the garden by the open tomb, looking up at the resurrected Christ before his ascension.<br><br>Around the other walls and parts of the room are pictures beginning with Joseph Smith and including the other twelve presidents of the Church; namely, Brigham Young, John Taylor, Wilford Woodruff, Lorenzo Snow, Joseph F. Smith, Heber J. Grant, George Albert Smith, David O. McKay, Joseph Fielding Smith, Harold B. Lee, Spencer W. Kimball, and Ezra Taft Benson. In this setting there is only one other picture in the entire room, and that is of Joseph Smith's brother Hyrum. It is not only appropriate but a genuine tribute, proper and purposeful, that the portrait of this great man is on display with the Savior and the prophets of this dispensation. Not only a faithful brother and advocate of Joseph's, but to all of us who meet there regularly he is the personification of integrity.<br><h2><b>"The Integrity of His Heart"</b></h2><br>"And again, verily I say unto you, blessed is my servant Hyrum Smith; for I, the Lord, love him because he loveth that which is right before me, saith the Lord" (D&amp;amp;C 124:15).<br><br>John Taylor said of Hyrum: "If ever there was an exemplary, honest, and virtuous man, an embodiment of all that is noble in human form, Hyrum Smith was its representative." John Taylor also said of Joseph and Hyrum Smith that they are "two of the best of Adam's race." Hyrum was an older brother, six years senior to Joseph, and stood by his side in life and death. The age differential never seemed to make much of a difference in Hyrum's attitude toward his younger brother. He was his friend, his advocate, and strength.<br><br>Joseph maintained an especially close tie to his brother Hyrum. "Never in all my life have I seen anything more beautiful than the striking example of brotherly love and devotion felt for each other by Joseph and Hyrum," recalled a friend of the Smiths, William Taylor. "I witnessed this many, many times. No matter how often or when or where they met, it was always with the same expression of supreme joy. It could not have been otherwise, when both were filled to overflowing with the gift and power of the Holy Ghost! It was kindred spirits meeting!"<br><br>In section 11 of the Doctrine and Covenants, verses 6 through 10 cover some direct revelation instructions, guidelines, and promises for Hyrum Smith.<br><br><i>Now, as you have asked, behold, I say unto you, keep my commandments, and seek to bring forth and establish the cause of Zion.</i><br><br><i>Seek not for riches but for wisdom; and behold, the mysteries of God shall be unfolded unto you, and then shall you be made rich. Behold, he that hath eternal life is rich.</i><br><br><i>Verily, verily, I say unto you, even as you desire of me so it shall be done unto you; and, if you desire, you shall be the means of doing much good in this generation.</i><br><br><i>Say nothing but repentance unto this generation. Keep my commandments, and assist to bring forth my work, according to my commandments, and you shall be blessed.</i><br><br><i>Behold, thou hast a gift, or thou shalt have a gift if thou wilt desire of me in faith, with an honest heart, believing in the power of Jesus Christ, or in my power which speaketh unto thee.</i><br><br>Also, in section 138, verse 33, the mighty ones in the spirit world are mentioned--Hyrum was one of these. "These were taught faith in God, repentance from sin, vicarious baptism for the remission of sins, the gift of the Holy Ghost by the laying on of hands."<br><br>And verse 55 reveals that Hyrum was "among the noble and great ones who were chosen in the beginning to be rulers in the Church of God."<br><br>It has been rightly said that the role of Hyrum Smith in the restoration of the gospel subsequent to the organization of the Church was second only to that of his brother Joseph. History points out to us that the Prophet Joseph Smith did nothing of importance without first counseling his brother Hyrum. Always it seemed when he was in trouble or in deep danger or heavy in burdens, he was to seek out his older brother for help and advice. Hyrum was always wise and consistent.<br><br>Joseph's faith and trust in his remarkable brother Hyrum is displayed in the beginning of the Nauvoo period. Hyrum acted as President of the Church while Joseph went to Washington, D.C., to obtain a redress for losses in Missouri. Hyrum was a peacemaker, a man of integrity, an honest individual. It was said of Hyrum that he would never knowingly offend any man. Nevertheless, he was relentless in hating wrong.<br><br>On one occasion, Joseph said that if Hyrum could not make peace between two who were in disagreement the angels themselves might not hope to accomplish the task. About the twentieth of June 1844, only seven days before the martyrdom, Joseph urged Hyrum to take his family to Cincinnati for safety. Hyrum answered simply, "Joseph, I cannot leave you."<br><br>It is not uncommon when a younger brother is highly honored for the elder brother in a family to manifest a spirit of jealousy, envy, and resentment, resulting sometimes in discontent and open opposition, but not so with Hyrum. He accepted the great vision and mission of his brother Joseph in the most sacred and loyal spirit of humility. On one occasion, when William Smith, the Prophet's younger brother, took occasion to abuse Joseph with words of violence, Hyrum came to the defense of the Prophet. This loyalty and action elicited the following expression of appreciation from Joseph: "I could pray in my heart that all my brethren were like unto my beloved brother Hyrum, who possessed a meekness and humility of Christ; and I love him with that love that is stronger than death, for I never had occasion to rebuke him, nor he me, which he declared when he left me today."<br><br>Hyrum was honest in his dealings with all of his fellow men. He was versatile and could apply himself in all situations. It is reported he could shoe an ox, plow, sell books, trade potatoes, preach a funeral sermon, try a case, administer to the sick, ordain, rebuke the wicked, give counsel, aid the poor, perform ordinances, and preach the gospel with equal effectiveness. He was trusted and believed. It is reported by one of the biographers: "When Lydia went to his home he [Hyrum]was about thirty-five or forty years of age, tall, well-framed, with a fine, handsome countenance, and blue eyes and his face was full of intelligence and spirit. His manner was dignified, but he was amiable and vivacious withal exceedingly courteous and fascinating to all with whom he ever had [a relationship]. He was really a worthy brother of the Prophet, and together they were a worthy pair" (Pearson H. Corbett,<i>Hyrum Smith--Patriarch</i>[Salt Lake City: Desert Book, 1963], p. 148).<br><br>The pride Joseph Smith, Sr., had for his two sons, Joseph and Hyrum, was a delight to behold. On one occasion the father laid his hands upon Hyrum's head and said: "My son, Hyrum, I seal upon your head your patriarchal blessing, which I placed upon your head before, for that shall be verified. In addition to this, I now give you my dying blessing. You shall have a season of peace, so that you shall have sufficient rest to accomplish the work which God has given you to do. You shall be as firm as the pillars of heaven unto the end of your days. I now seal upon your head the patriarchal power and you shall bless this people. This is my dying blessing upon your head, in the name of Jesus, . . . Amen" (Corbett,<i>Hyrum Smith,</i>p. 240).<br><br>When Oliver Cowdery lost his standing, the Lord transferred to Hyrum Smith all the power and authority that had been given to Oliver Cowdery, and Hyrum Smith became the Associate President of the Church--holding these keys jointly with his brother Joseph and standing with him at the head of the great and last dispensation. It was because of this great honor that Hyrum Smith was called to be the companion of the Prophet Joseph in martyrdom.<br><br>After sharing many persecutions and life-threatening experiences together, the Prophet wrote: "There was my brother [Hyrum] who next took me by the hand--a natural brother. Thought I to myself, Brother Hyrum, what a faithful heart you have got! Oh, may the Eternal Jehovah crown eternal blessings upon your head, and a reward for the care you have had for my soul! O how many are the sorrows we have shared together; and again we find ourselves shackled with the unrelenting hand of oppression. Hyrum, thy name shall be written in the book of the Law of the Lord, for those who come after thee to look upon that they may pattern after thy works."<br><br>During his whole life Hyrum walked uprightly before the Lord--meaning he was morally correct, honest, just, and honorable. Hyrum Smith seemed to be the embodiment of the thirteenth article of faith:<br><br><i>We believe in being honest, true, chaste, benevolent, virtuous, and in doing good to all men; indeed we may say that we follow the admonition of Paul--We believe all things, we hope all things, we have endured many things, and hope to be able to endure all things. If there is anything virtuous, lovely, or of good report, or praiseworthy, we seek after these things.</i><br><h2><b>"Better to Be Trusted Than Loved"</b></h2><br>President David O. McKay frequently said: "It is better to be trusted than to be loved." A good friend of mine learned the importance of this and the significance of being a person of integrity at a relatively young age in life.<br><br>In one of her high school classes, there was a requirement to attend a lab period before school officially began. It was early in the morning, and in order to get credit for this lab, the students would sign their names in a roll book at the beginning of the class period. This roll book was located on the teacher's desk at the front of the room. One morning, while standing in line waiting to sign the book, Roxanne, a very popular girl in school who was standing in the doorway, motioned my friend to come and talk. She did, and Roxanne asked her if she would sign her name for her so that she could get credit for attending the class even though she wouldn't actually be there. Roxanne was a student body officer and had to attend a special meeting for the student body officers. Without hesitating at all, my friend said, "Sure, I'll do that for you.' She didn't really know this girl very well. She was someone whom everyone liked and who was very popular in school, but she was only an acquaintance of hers.<br><br>Meanwhile, she went back to the desk and signed her name. Then, below her own signature she signed Roxanne's name in her handwriting. The teacher was obviously smarter than my friend and realized that there were twenty students attending class, and twenty-one students who had signed the roll. Because the handwriting was the same, she knew that my friend had signed Roxanne's name for her.<br><br>In the middle of the lab session the teacher announced that there was a discrepancy in the number of students who had signed the roll and the number who were there in class. Then she called out my friend's name and asked that she go to the back of the room while the rest of the class continued their lab assignments. This teacher then proceeded to impress upon her a most important lesson, one that she was never to forget. She can't remember most of what the teacher said to her, except that she was very embarrassed and ashamed. But the one thing she does remember was this question that the teacher asked: "Why were you willing to sacrifice your<i>integrity</i>for the sake of that girl?" You see, she was a very good student, a student who was trusted and respected in that high school, and she had let her teachers down. She was willing to sacrifice something that was most precious to her because of peer pressure, because of the fear that someone wouldn't like her if she didn't do a favor for her. My friend learned in a very significant way that it is more important to be trusted than to be loved, that a person's integrity is of supreme importance.<br><br>Never in the history of mankind or the Church as there been a greater need for honesty in personal lives--honesty with neighbors and integrity in discussions and total commitment on the basis of full trust and respect from those who are about us. Certainly we have reason to be disappointed and concerned when we see too many business and professional associates not adopting honesty as the best policy, but instead asking, What can I get away with without being caught? Or what is expedient? What will be the most profitable? What will be the most rewarding for me without regard to permanence or other people? Integrity must be the foundation of moral life. In school and in daily associations we must teach students and children, as well as adults, that honesty must be 100 percent and not treated as a convenience or escape in some situations. We must fight corruption and graft and return people to the basics of integrity, honesty, and fair play. Achievement and talent without character are hollow.<br><br>Dr. Madison Sarratt, who taught mathematics at Vanderbilt University for many years, before giving a test would admonish his class something like this: "Today I am giving two examinations--one in trigonometry and the other in honesty. I hope you will pass them both. If you must fail one, fail trigonometry. There are many people in the world who can't pass trig, but there is no one who can't pass the examination of honesty."<br><h2><b>An Example to Us Now</b></h2><br>The Lord said to Hyrum:<br><br><i>Behold, I speak unto you, Hyrum, a few words; for thou also art under no condemnation, and thy heart is opened, and thy tongue loosed; and thy calling is to exhortation, and to strengthen the church continually. Wherefore thy duty is unto the church forever, and this because of thy family.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 23:3]<br><br>Very often when we think about honesty and integrity, it is well for us to ask the question, How will I feel about my conduct today, tomorrow? Will character and integrity be the foundation of all my performances?<br><br>Jesus said, "I am the bread of life" (John 6:35). "I am the light of the world" (John 8:12). "I am the door" (John 10:9). "I am the good shepherd" (John 10:11). "I am the way, the truth, and the life" (John 14:6). Hyrum Smith made these goals and characteristics part of his life on a continuing steadfast basis.<br><br>As I look at the oil painting of Hyrum Smith as it hangs prominently in the Salt Lake Temple on the fourth floor among the pictures of other great leaders of the Church and other renditions showing events worthy of remembrance in the life of our Savior, Jesus Christ, I am impressed with Hyrum's life, his attitude, and the love that the Lord has for him. The Lord will always have a special love for those who embrace the right. May God help us to realize that in Hyrum Smith we have a man who is a worthy example today as he was in the early history of the Church--firm, steadfast, and true not only to his prophet, to his father, but to the Savior Jesus Christ and his Eternal Father. May we, when we hear of him or see his picture, recommit ourselves to the principles that he lived for and died for, May our chosen paths lead us to do what is right and let the consequences follow. The consequences of doing what is right, as did Hyrum, will bring personal victory and the love and continuing trust of the Lord.<br><br>I say these things in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Marvin J.

<h1>and Challenges: Fear Not, Little Flock - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
It's always a delight to be with you on this campus. My children and grandchildren have attended this university, and I love it very much. Thank you for your attendance today. President Holland informed me that you would probably all be sitting down, so I have decided to do the same if you will permit me.<br><h2><b>Surviving the Hard Times</b></h2><br>I know enough about your busy and hectic lives to know that you sometimes get frustrated. You might even worry a little bit from time to time. I know all about that. You're probably somewhere between midterms and final papers, and the semester seems as if it will never end. Some of you may be farther behind than you thought it was possible to be in a single semester. I've had semesters like that. They pass.<i>You</i>may not pass, but semesters do. Now you<i>know</i>I'm kidding, don't you? You're going to do just fine, even if the bank has called to offer a special tutor in balancing your checkbook.<br><br>My message to you today is to "fear not, little flock." It is to encourage you to rejoice in the great blessings of life. It is to invite you to feel the great thrill of gospel living and our Father in Heaven's love. Life is wonderful, even in the hard times, and there is happiness, joy, and peace at stops all along the way, and endless portions of them at the end of the road.<br><br>Sure, there are plenty of things to worry about--some of them very serious things--but that is why we speak in gospel terms of faith, and hope, and charity. As Latter-day Saints, ours is "the abundant life," and we try to emphasize our blessings and opportunities while we minimize our disappointments and worries. "Search diligently, pray always, and be believing," the scripture says, "and all things shall work together for your good" (D&amp;amp;C 90:24). I want to remind you of that promise.<br><br>Set aside any worries you may have long enough to go with me to Independence, Missouri, where we will observe the worries of another generation of Saints. The year is 1833; the Church is only three years old and is struggling for its very survival.<br><br>On Saturday, July twentieth of that year, a mob destroys the Church printing office in Independence, Missouri, and tars and feathers two members of the Church. Three days later, Church leaders are forced to sign a written agreement to leave Jackson County by January first of the next year. Upon learning of this from Oliver Cowdery, who was sent from Jackson County to report these unfortunate events to Joseph Smith, the prophet calls a meeting to discuss the matter. It is decided that all "measures should be immediately taken to seek redress by the laws of our country" (<i>HC</i>1:417).<br><br>Church leaders in Missouri approach the governor of the state and are advised by the state attorney general to seek redress under the provisions of the law. This does not please local nonmembers, however, and mobs destroy several Mormon homes and whip a number of men. Four days later, on 4 November 1833, one Mormon and two Missourians die in a skirmish on the Big Blue River. The violence continues, but local judges refuse again and again to issue warrants against the mobsters. You know what follows. The Church members faced death and difficulty for well over a decade before they finally fled to the Rocky Mountains.<br><br>Some survived these difficult times spiritually, and others did not. Those who survived knew and believed and did certain things--things that those who fell away did not know or do. What they knew was the reality and divinity and mission of the Lord Jesus Christ. They knew that Joseph Smith was his chosen prophet. Later, they sustained Brigham Young in that same capacity, then John Taylor, and Wilford Woodruff, and so on. What they did, knowing these things to be true, was exercise their faith, in spite of their worries and concerns. They were believers, and there was peace and joy and safety in the Church as established and led by the Lord Jesus Christ.<br><br>Please remember this one thing. If our lives and our faith are centered upon Jesus Christ and his restored gospel, nothing can ever go permanently wrong. On the other hand, if our lives are not centered on the Savior and his teachings, no other success can ever be permanently right.<br><br>I commend to you the revelations of God as the standard by which we must live our lives and by which we must measure every decision and every deed. Accordingly, when you have worries and challenges, face them by turning to the scriptures and the prophets.<br><h2><b>Academic Worries</b></h2><br>Let's begin with your academic worries. You do not need me to catalog the academic challenges of this week or this month, or to remind you how long and discouraging some days can be. You worry about papers and tests, about grades and classes and graduate school. For man of you, being here is a financial sacrifice, but you are here anyway. That's a good sign.<br><br>It might help to remember that by laboring here you are answering a divine mandate to study and learn "things both in heaven and in the earth, and under the earth; things which have been, things which are, ... things which are at home, things which are abroad; ... and a knowledge also of countries and of kingdoms" (D&amp;amp;C 88:79).<br><br>In this connection, consider the oft-quoted words of Nephi;<br><br><i>I will go and do the things which the Lord hath commanded, for I know that the Lord giveth no commandments unto the children of men, save he shall prepare a way for them that they may accomplish the thing which he commandeth them.</i>[1 Nephi 3:7]<br><br>The Lord will help you in your school work if you give your own very best academic effort and try to live worthy of his help.<br><br>The scriptures will not tell you what classes to take from which professors, or what major to choose, or what topic you should select for the paper that is due Friday morning. But what they do have to offer on the subject of your university career is infinitely more important. They tell you how and why to learn; they encourage you to prepare and grow. You recognize these words:<br><br><i>Seek ye diligently and teach one another words of wisdom; yea, seek ye out of the best books words of wisdom; seek learning, even by study and also by faith.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 88:118]<br><br>Whether the subject is scripture or sociology, you cannot ignore study or faith if you wish to succeed. At least have faith that you can succeed, that every semester eventually comes to an end, that your righteous efforts will be rewarded. Of course, no amount of faith will help you pass this afternoon's pop quiz if you haven't done the required reading. When Ernest L. Boyer was on campus last year, he said the only universal prayer offered in school was, "Dear Lord, don't let her call on me today." So work hard,<i>and</i>pray, but do not worry.<br><br>While you study the world and its many problems, resist the temptation a few have to be cynical. Do not lose sight of the divine wonder all about you. Do not give yourself cause to share the regrets expressed by the dying young man in Dostoevsky's<i>The Brothers Karamazov:</i><br><br><i>The windows of his room looked out into the garden, and</i>[the]<i>garden was a shady one, with old trees in it which were coming into bud. The first birds of springs were flitting in the branches, chirruping and singing at the windows. And looking at them and admiring them, he began suddenly begging their forgiveness ..., "Birds of heaven, happy birds, forgive me, for I have sinned against you. ... Yes," he said, "there was such a glory of God all about me; birds, trees, meadows, sky, only I ... dishonored it all and did not notice the beauty and glory."</i>[Fydor Dostoevesky,<i>The Brothers Karamazov,</i>Norton Critical Edition, rev. and ed. Ralph E. Matlaw, tr. Constance Garnett (New York: W. W. Norton, 1976), p. 268]<br><br>Remember the Lord's encouragement in these matters. Look at life and its wonders "with cheerful hearts and countenances, ... [for] the fullness of the earth is yours, ... Yea, all things which come of the earth ... are made for the benefit and use of man, both to please the eye and to gladden the heart; Yea, for food and for raiment, for taste and for smell, to strengthen the body and to enliven the soul" (D&amp;amp;C 59:15–19).<br><br>Wonder and reverence for God's handiwork is a form of worship, and the spiritually attentive soul will find such wonders in one's studies, in the sky and the mountains, and, believe it or not, in that most unique of all creations, your roommate.<br><h2><b>Financial Worries</b></h2><br>When you're not worrying about classes, you probably spend a fair amount of time trying to balance your funds between tuition and pizza and a little gasoline for the car, if you have one. Look to the scriptures. You have a lot of company if you are poor. You have read these verses;<br><br><i>And a certain scribe came, and said unto him, Master, I will follow thee withersoever thou goest.</i><br><br><i>And Jesus saith unto him, The foxes have holes, and the birds of the air have nests; but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head.</i>[Matthew 8:19–20]<br><br>You will find, as you follow Christ, that the path to him often leads through poverty. And if you are not struggling financially, your trail may be the greatest of all--prosperity. Whatever your financial circumstances may be, there are some principles that apply to you.<br><br>Pay a full tithe and be generous in your other offerings.<br><br>Acknowledge that whatever wealth you have, great or small, monetary or otherwise, belongs to the Lord and is to be used as he directs.<br><br>Do not covet what you have or what you do<i>not</i>have. Brigham Young once said, "I am more afraid of covetousness in our Elders [and sisters] than I am of the hordes of hell" (DBY, p. 306). Things eventually work out financially; hang on and have faith.<br><h2><b>Challenges of Many Kinds</b></h2><br>I mentioned roommates a moment ago and heard a few of you laugh a bit. One of the more trying aspects of student life can be living with your roommates--or even if some cases, with spouses or parents or children. There is room in every home, however humble, however temporary, for repentance and forgiveness, for charity and service. If something is wrong, it should be dealt with, but "only by persuasion, by long-suffering, by gentleness and meekness, and by love unfeigned" (D&amp;amp;C 121:41).<br><br>If you are inclined to be troubled about roommates or spouses, try to remember to worry less about your own welfare and more about that of others. If charity is what every apartment needs--and what home doesn't?--you be the one to initiate and encourage it. Read Mormon on the subject, who said, "Pray unto the Father with all the energy of heart, that ye may be filled with this love" (Moroni 7:48). Someone has to begin, to try, to reach out. Someone has to assume responsibility and make good things happen. Why not you? Why not now?<br><br>Unless I'm seriously mistaken, many of you also worry about courtship, marriage, and starting a family. You probably will not find the name of your future spouse in Nephi's vision or the book of Revelation; you probably will not be told it by an angel or even by your bishop. Some things you must work out for yourself. Have faith and be obedient, and blessings will come. Try to be patient. Try not to let what you don't have blind you to that which you do have. If you worry too much about marriage, it can canker the very possibility of it. Live fully and faithfully as one person before having undue anxiety about living as two. If you are married and struggling, your course is the same: have faith, be obedient, and trust in your covenants. All can be well and<i>will</i>be well if you build on true gospel principles.<br><br>We all struggle with health problems occasionally--others do so constantly. Illness and disease are part of the burden of mortality. Have faith and be positive. The power of the priesthood is real, and there is so much that is good in life, even if we struggle physically. It is a joy to know that there will be no injury or disease in the Resurrection.<br><br>Some of our concerns may come in the form of temptations. Others may be difficult decisions pertaining to education or career or money or marriage. Whatever your burden is, you will find the strength you need in Christ. Jesus Christ is Alpha and Omega, literally the beginning and the end. He is with us from start to finish, and as such is more than a spectator in our lives. There is hope in the testimony of Paul;<br><br><i>For we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet</i>[was]<i>without sin.</i>[Hebrews 4:15]<br><br>If the yoke under which we struggle is sin itself, the message is the same. Christ knows the full weight of our sins, for he carried it first. If our burden is not sin nor temptation, but illness or poverty or rejection, it's the same. He knows. Alma saw his day, and testified:<br><br><i>And he shall go forth, suffering pains and afflictions and temptations of every kind; ... he will take upon him the pains and the sicknesses of his people....</i><br><br><i>And he will take upon him death, that he may loose the bands of death which bind his people; and he will take upon him their infirmities.</i>[Alma 7:11–12]<br><br>He suffered so much more than our sins. He whom Isaiah called the "man of sorrows" (Isaiah 53:3; Mosiah 14:3) knows perfectly every problem through which we pass because he chose to bear the full weight of all our troubles and our pains. Why? "That [he] may be filled with mercy, according to the flesh, that he may know according to flesh how to succor his people according to their infirmities" (Alma 7:12).<br><br>Brothers and sisters, you have and will have worries and challenges of many kinds, but embrace life joyfully and full of faith. Study the scriptures regularly. Pray fervently. Obey the voice of the Spirit and the prophets. Do all that you can to help others. You will find great happiness in such a course. Some glorious day all your worries will be tuned to joys.<br><br>As Joseph Smith wrote to the struggling Saints from his cell in Liberty Jail:<br><br><i>Let us</i>cheerfully<i>do all things that lie in our power; and then may we stand still, with the utmost assurance, to see the salvation of God, and for his arm to be revealed.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 123:17; emphasis added]<br><br><i>Fear not, little flock; do good; let earth and hell combine against you, for if ye are built upon my rock, they cannot prevail....</i><br><br><i>Look unto me in every thought; doubt not, fear not.</i><br><br><i>Behold the wounds which pierced my side, and also the prints of the nails in my hands and feet; be faithful, keep my commandments, and ye shall inherit the kingdom of heaven.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 6:34–37]<br><br>I know that God is our Father, and that we are his spirit offspring. I know that Jesus Christ is his Son, the Redeemer of the world; that he came in the meridian of time to provide the example of perfect love and to perform the ultimate sacrifice. I know that he rose from the tomb on the third day with a resurrected, perfect body of flesh and bone, and that he appeared to his prophet Joseph Smith. I know that this is his Church, and it is led today by his prophet, Ezra Taft Benson.<br><br>I know that, as Nephi says, God "loveth his children," and "He doeth not anything save it be for the benefit of the world" (1 Nephi 11:17; 2 Nephi 26:24). May those words of Nephi help you to worry less and enjoy life more, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Howard W.

<h1>s and Answers - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
When I open my eyes I see a world full of color with millions of shades of green and yellow and blue. It is hard for me to imagine the world any other way. And yet my eyes don't see everything. Despite the rainbow of colors ranging from red to purple around me, honeybees can see the ultraviolet light that I can't. At night I stumble unless I turn a light on, but cats and owls see things in the dark that I can't. When I get far away from an object, I can no longer see it, but hawks and vultures can spot their prey while flying two miles overhead.<br><br>The world that seems so obvious to me is actually far from the world that really is. One goal of getting an education is to help us bridge this gap between the world that we observe and the world that actually exists--to help us see, if you will, like the bees and cats and birds. To bridge this gap, however, we must first question those perceptions that initially seem apparent and that blind us, in a sense, to a larger vision of our world and of our own possibilities.<br><br>The genius of Copernicus was not only that he correctly inferred that the earth revolves around the sun but that he first questioned the inconsistencies implied by the centuries-old notion that the sun, planets, and stars circled the earth.<br><br>The genius of America's Founding Fathers was not only that they framed the Constitution and drafted the Bill of Rights but that they first questioned how to construct a sovereign government that would ensure personal liberty.<br><br>The genius of Albert Einstein was not only that he formulated the theory of relativity that redirected the whole course of scientific thought but that he first questioned the validity of the mechanistic view of the universe that had been accepted for nearly 200 years.<br><br>And the genius of Joseph Smith was not only that he inspired men and women to build great cities and temples but that he went into a grove of trees and questioned the Father about which church was right.<br><br>Great minds conceive great questions--questions that spark imagination, questions that stimulate discovery, and questions that provoke more questions. Ignorance cannot last long when accompanied by investigation and inquiry. We tend to measure success in the world on the basis of answers but forget that the answers were each preceded in turn by someone asking the right question. After all, our physics graduates could tell you all about the theory of relativity and the music majors could surely hum Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, but we would hardly call them geniuses for doing so. Gaston Pierre Marc, duc de Lévis, said, "It is easier to judge a man by his questions rather than by his answers" (<i>Maxims and Reflections</i>[1808], maxim 17). The library has shelves of answers. The true learning process begins by asking the right kinds of questions.<br><br>Of course finding an insightful answer requires more than merely posing a question. During the Crimean War problems with sanitation accompanied by movement of men and materials from one location to another led to several outbreaks of yellow fever among the peasant population of southern Russia. The doctors attending the troops also tried to treat the peasants who had been afflicted. But the peasants, who had no previous experience with doctors, soon came to equate the doctors' visits with disease and death. They asked themselves, not surprisingly, what the cause was and answered their question by killing the doctors. The ability to ask the questions that yield illuminating answers demands a knowledge of the questions already asked and the answers already established. The questions that have transformed our conception of the world were based on education, not ignorance.<br><br>Much of our time in college has been spent building the intellectual foundation that will enable us to ask interesting questions. By reciting Shakespeare, reading Dickinson, listening to Brahms, deriving equations, and recounting history, we have come to appreciate the contributions of great men and women to our understanding of this world. But looking back over this part of our education can be depressing. Most of us graduating today would be hard-pressed right now to pass the finals we took last year--let alone to even remember all the classes we took as freshmen. Certainly we didn't all come to college so that we could learn and then promptly go out and start forgetting.<br><br>What, then, has been the greatest benefit of our education? We have learned how to question. We have learned that interpreting a poem only begins when you read the last word. Then you have to question the use of imagery, the meaning of words, and the choice of language and meter and style. Likewise, we have learned that rigorous scientific analysis requires challenging every method and assumption and control in an experiment.<br><br>Perhaps we have not yet transformed the world around us, but with the questions that have been stimulated by our careful preparation here at BYU and the questions that will arise as we confront the world that lies before us, we have the seeds of discovery within us. And with our answers we will come to see a world that has not yet even been conceived--a world that even the bees and hawks and owls cannot see.<br><br><i>Brigitte Condie Madrian spoke as the representative of her graduating class at BYU commencement on 28 April 1989.</i><br><br><i>© Brigham Young University.

<h1>e Choose Life - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
In the thirtieth chapter of Deuteronomy we read, "I have set before you life and death, blessing and cursing: therefore choose life" (19). With these words Moses challenged the children of Israel to renew their covenant with the Lord. We may have heard the same words earnestly addressed to us by parents, teachers, and church leaders. We know what they mean. Or do we? Perhaps we could gain by pondering them together one more time.<br><h2><b>Gifts from God</b></h2><br>When Moses stood before all Israel and said, "Therefore choose life," he was only repeating what had first been heard by Adam: "Thou mayest choose for thyself, for it is given unto thee" (Moses 3:17). The word<i>choose</i>is not merely a command; it also refers to a power, a gift given from God. But if the power of choice is a gift given at birth, then what was the prophet's purpose in saying, "Therefore choose life"? Just this: the gift can be kept only by being used. Choosing is like breathing. At birth we receive the breath of life. But we keep it only so long as we continually use it. In a physical sense, to stop breathing is to stop living. In a spiritual sense, to stop choosing is also to stop living, for living involves growth and development, and these can come only by means of our free choices. That is why the power to choose is so precious.<br><br>We come to earth, then, with these two gifts of breath and choice, but they are not invulnerable. Our way of using them is just as important as our act of using them. If we protect and care for them, if we use them in pursuit of wholesome and holy ends, they will be our servants. But should we neglect them, we will not endure in health or peace for long. Our generation knows better than any other the diseases caused by foolishly abusing our powers of breath. In a similar way, spiritual life may be damaged by reckless choices. How long does it take, either way, to destroy these priceless gifts of God? No one knows. But who could ever sanely wish, in his own case, to find out?<br><h2><b>Rules, Training, Discipline</b></h2><br>In the course of life we have many goals or ends. Sometimes they conflict. To find harmony in our lives, we must have an ultimate end, one for the sake of which we make all our other choices. We here today have such an end. It is eternal life. But we know that not everyone shares that end. More specifically, we know that we face an adversary whose consuming purpose is our misery and death, and whose cunning is employed daily toward that end. In the awareness of that adversary and our peril, all the prophets have echoed the words of Moses to the children of Israel, "Therefore choose life."<br><br>How, then, shall we choose life? We cannot choose it by acting on whim, rushing after every desire or appetite or passion that beckons to us. We choose life by following the right rules or laws. We first encounter rules as we seek to learn. They are given to us for our training. Following them helps us to develop discipline. In our earliest years our parents have charge of us and must teach us the rules we ought to follow. We are too young then to comprehend the full nature and purpose of the rules or the ends that following them will help us reach. We adopt the rules of our parents by imitation. Much later we come to see how rules and ends are linked and how following certain rules helps us to achieve certain ends.<br><br>Consider for a moment the three words I have used: rules, training, discipline. There are at least two areas in which many of you have learned to deal with sets of rules that are given for your training and discipline. The first area is athletics, the second is music. Those of you who have been athletes understand how rules, training, and discipline help you to achieve your end: being a successful athlete. When you are in training you are expected to follow the training rules and the discipline they involve. Suppose you stop by a friend's place and the friend offers you a certain dessert. You reply, "No, thank you, I can't eat that."<br><br>"Can't eat it?" says your friend. "It's delicious. I made it myself.'<br><br>"Oh, I don't question that," you respond. "It's just that I'm in training."<br><br>"What's that got to do with it?"<br><br>"Well, this isn't on our training table; it's not a part of our diet." This response says nothing against the particular dessert in itself. That is beside the point. But you are in training, and that means you cannot eat certain foods--not if you want to remain committed to the team and its training rules. You did not create those rules. But you did choose for your end a particular sport. The coach, knowing that sport well, told you about the rules of training and the discipline that would be required of you. You wanted to be on the team, you wanted to play well--so you accepted the rules.<br><br>I think coaches generally do not encourage a lot of debate concerning training rules. They tolerate breaking those rules even less. You ate the wrong foods? You stayed up too late? You failed to appear at practice? Fine. Your resignation from the team is accepted. Another athlete is waiting to take your place. Once again, the point here is not the intrinsic value of a given food or bedtime. The point is that when you choose the sport or the team, you also choose the corresponding rules. To violate the rules is to violate your commitment to the end they serve.<br><br>In just the same way, a music student becomes subject to the rules of the music teacher. When the teacher lays down certain rules about how to hold the bow, or how to place the fingers, or how to position the wrist, the teacher knows that the rules will lead you to form the right habits and that if you form the wrong habits, your musical development can be blocked. Here too, if you show no effort to practice the rules your teacher gives you, you may find yourself soon looking for another teacher.<br><br>These few remarks about athletics and music were designed to show one thing: to choose the end is to choose the rules that lead to it. In other words, rules have a purpose, even when we do not fully understand what it is. When we try to choose an end and at the same time reject the rules that go with it, we are really contradicting ourselves. We are trying to do what cannot be done.<br><br>I offer a final example of the union between rules and ends: the university honor code, especially the dress and grooming standards. This case resembles the two I have already given in an important way. That is, the issue does not in the first instance concern the merits of any particular rule or standard. The issue concerns only whether someone wants to be on this team or wants to study under this teacher. If the answer is yes, the answer is also yes to the corresponding rules.<br><br>If you choose to become a part of the BYU community, you choose to make the BYU rules become a part of you. And, I repeat, this choice exists quite apart from the nature of those rules. Learning the importance of rules and learning how to follow them faithfully are two of the most valuable aspects of general education because this knowledge is transferable. Once you know how rules, training, and discipline help lead you to a specific end, you can develop the proper procedure for achieving other ends. But with respect to our BYU rules of honor, there is this important difference. Not just the procedure but also the end is transferable. You may sometime stop being an active gymnast or cease playing in an orchestra, but you will never reach a point in your life when the code of honor and the goal of virtue cease to apply.<br><br>I have known a few students who looked forward to a time when they could leave at least the dress and grooming standards behind. But you should know that other institutions also concern themselves with matters of dress and grooming. For example, one of America's largest retail companies recently opened a new telecatalog center here in Provo. The employees meet their customers only on the telephone, but they are still expected to dress in a certain way, which is spelled out in detail: no denim is ever to be worn by anyone. Women wear dresses or skirts and blouses. Men wear dress slacks, dress shirts, and ties. Dozens of other large companies have similar rules. They have them because they have found that these rules help them to achieve the end for which they are working. They have found that how people dress affects how people act.<br><h2><b>Choosing the Law of Life</b></h2><br>Now some people may say that talking about rules without talking about their specific content is one-sided. Some may point out that rules change over time. This is no doubt true. But the real issue is the principle of following rules. In the words of John Silber, president of Boston University, speaking in the context of widespread campus lawlessness in the late sixties, "The law is not worth changing unless lawfulness is worth preserving" That is a profound comment, which all who note or seek change should bear in mind. If we are not, in the first place, thoroughly committed to rules or to law, it will matter little, in the end, what the specific laws happen to be. Loyalty to lawfulness is fundamental.<br><br>I have tried to make clear the reason for rules and the way rules are linked to ends. Let me now return once more to the words of Moses, "I have set before you life and death, blessing and cursing: therefore choose life." With respect to the rules or commandments of God, we know that without exception they have one fixed, unchanging purpose, and the choice that we must make is stark and clear: life or death, blessing or cursing. Through the Prophet Joseph Smith the Lord said,<br><br><i>Wherefore, verily I say unto you that all things unto me are spiritual, and not at any time have I given unto you a law which was temporal; neither any man, nor the children of men; neither Adam, your father, whom I created.</i><br><br><i>Behold, I gave unto him that he should be an agent unto himself; and I gave unto him commandment, but no temporal commandment gave I unto him, for my commandments are spiritual; they are not natural nor temporal, neither carnal nor sensual.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 29;34–35]<br><br>All the Lord's commandments or rules or laws are spiritual. We find what it means in Romans: "To be carnally minded is death; but to be spiritually minded is life" (8;6). The key to choosing rightly is to remember: To choose the end is to choose the law that leads to it. But just as truly, we now see<i>, to choose the law is to choose the end to which it leads.</i>Consider these words from section 88 of the Doctrine and Covenants:<br><br><i>And again, verily I say unto you, that which is governed by law is also preserved by law and perfected and sanctified by the same.</i><br><br><i>That which breaketh a law, and abideth not by law, but seeketh to become a law unto itself, and willeth to abide in sin, and altogether abideth in sin, cannot be sanctified by law, neither by mercy, justice, nor judgment. Therefore, they must remain filthy still.</i>[34–35]<br><br>The Lord tells us that law is the means by which he seeks to raise up to eternal life in his presence, to be sanctified and perfected as he is. But we must choose life. He will not force, for the gift of spiritual freedom is one he will not take away. If we reject the law of life, offered for our own good, if we say no, then, in the current idiom, God himself can only reply, "Have it your way."<br><br>No person can ever be better than the rule or law of his life. Find what that law is and you have found what the person is. It may not be a simple thing to discern the law of someone's life. Often it takes a long period of watching. Once in a while some crucial event reveals it dramatically. But no one can rise higher than the law of his life. How important, then, to choose that law wisely.<br><h2><b>Choosing the Master</b></h2><br>I have spoken of rules or laws as essential elements in our decision to choose life. But they themselves are not the end we seek. They are the means for helping us to achieve it. The end is eternal life, or, more fully and correctly stated, eternal life in the presence of God our eternal Father and his Son, Jesus Christ. Our highest hope can never be separated from our hope to live with them. Finally, all rules come from a ruler, all laws come from a lawgiver. They always point to a person who gave them: the parent, the coach, the teacher, and, ultimately, the Lord. To choose life is to choose the law of life. To choose the law of life is to choose the Lord of Life who gave it. "I am come," he said, "that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly" (John 10:10). The true end we seek, the true source of the eternal life we aspire to, is personal. "And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou has sent" (John 17:3).<br><br>Once we understand what eternal life is, then all the rules and laws of life can become stepping-stones that lead us safely and surely to the divine presence. In contemplating such thoughts as these, I am reminded of the title of a book O read a few years ago, a title that touched me as deeply as did its contents. It was a book by Elie Wiesel, winner of the Nobel Peace Prize. It told of some of the great teachers of eastern European Judaism. The title was<i>Somewhere a Master</i>. In those three words I seemed to feel the universal longing of the human heart for one who is better and wiser than we are, one who can be a guide, friend, teacher, one we can learn from, be like, please, follow, and love. I later was fortunate enough to meet the author. When Mr. Wiesel delivered a forum lecture at BYU, I was invited to introduce him and had the chance to talk with him before his lecture. Because I had once studied at the Jewish Theological Seminary of America in New York, we had both some interests and some friends in common.<br><br>But I never met the man of whom he spoke with the greatest affection, Rabbi Saul Lieberman, probably the most gifted Talmud scholar in the world. He was already old when I was at the seminary and could devote only limited time to teaching a few advanced students. Elie Wiesel was one of these. He told me how he traveled to New York every month to meet with his master and how he studied the sacred words of their faith with him. Listening to a man who was himself a master, speaking reverently of his own master, was a moving and unforgettable experience.<br><br>The conversation reminded me anew that all learning, all laws, all ends, and all life are finally personal. Though we grope and wander, waiting for each of us somewhere is the person who lifted the heart of Mary just by speaking her name and led her to forget the empty tomb and greet the promise of life with her answer, "Rabboni; which is to say, Master" (John 20:16).<br><br>Those few moments with one of the great human beings of our time later drew my mind to a former time and to a passage from the final words of King Benjamin, one of the most vividly personal rulers in all the Book of Mormon: "How knoweth a man the master whom he has not served, and who is a stranger unto him, and is far from the thoughts and intents of his heart?" (Mosiah 5:13). That question is the ultimate question that each one of us must ask and answer. Have we found, somewhere, the Master?<br><br>In all our comings and goings, in the midst of all our goal settings and achievements, have we known him? Have we served him? Is he near our hearts? Have we written in our memories the fervent words of Moroni as he ended his record: "Yea, come unto Christ, and be perfected in him, and deny yourselves of all ungodliness" (Moroni 10:32)? I pray that if we have not, we will, starting this very day.<br><br>When Joshua, following the pattern of Moses, gave his last counsel to Israel, he said, "Choose you this day whom ye will serve" (Joshua 24:15). What day is<i>this day?</i>Surely every day is this day. What we chose yesterday, if we chose well, we must renew again this day. And what we chose that was wrong, we must admit and amend this day.<br><br>As we strive to place Christ at the center of our lives, he has promised as our Master to make us his servants and also his friends, and to share with us the eternal life that he died to gain. There is no higher end than this, that we should choose to accept his discipline, become his disciples, and do his work throughout our lives. Nothing else, no other choice, can make of us what he can.<br><br>Let us this day choose him, knowing that as we do, we choose life. And let us then trust that we in turn shall be chosen of him, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Dennis Rasmussen was an associate professor of philosophy at BYU when this devotional talk was given on 9 May 1989.</i><br><br><i>© Brigham Young University. All rights reserved.</i>
<h1>May Prepare to Do Our Part - Ardeth G. Kapp - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
A few weeks ago I was at Dick's Market shopping for groceries as we all do. A young lady reaching for a head of lettuce just as I was looked up in surprise and said, "Do you buy groceries?" I smiled and said, "Yes, and I eat them too."<br><h2><b>On Stage for a Season</b></h2><br>We are all so ordinary, and yet each is special and unique. It is when we come to know that we are literally brothers and sisters in the same family away from our heavenly home for a time that we begin to really recognize each other--not in relation to positions, possessions, prestige, or power, but rather as brothers and sisters, heart to heart and soul to soul. And then when we meet we don't exchange just words--a wonderful exchange of the spirit takes place. We learn to share and trust and risk and become not so concerned about what we do but rather with who we are and, even more important, whose we are. We begin to reveal how we feel. We laugh together and cry together and learn how to bear one another's burdens that they may be light. At least that is what we, as covenant people, hope to do. And yet at times we fall short of the mark and feel some disappointment in ourselves because we are not always doing as well as we could or should or would given another chance. And it's so good to have friends who know you and believe in you and give you another chance.<br><br>But above all, it is important for you to know you and me to know me. As the hymn suggests, "Let each man learn to know himself; To gain that knowledge let him labor" ("Let Each Man Learn to Know Himself,"<i>Hymns</i>, 1948, no. 91).<br><br>On occasion, when we conduct a private and sometimes sobering interview with ourselves, we recognize the distance between the ideal and the real. It humbles us and increases our desire for an improved performance, given the wonderful gift of another day. We all hope for the final commendation of our performance: "Well done, thou good and faithful servant."<br><br>Prior to the opening of the fall season for the musical play<i>Annie</i>at the Promised Valley Playhouse some years ago, 320 girls auditioned for the part of Annie. Twelve dogs were brought by proud owners hoping their dog might be selected to be Annie's companion, Sandy. Not everyone who tried out got a part, and some who got parts didn't get the ones they thought they wanted.<br><br>However, following a period of intensive rehearsals, the opening night was absolutely spectacular. But as magnificent as Annie's performance was under the spotlight on the stage before a packed house, her greatest moment, I believe, was after the show. Following a standing ovation, this young girl graciously acknowledged the praises from admirers crowded in the lobby of the theater. In the corner near the door I observed an elderly gray-haired gentleman stooped with age, his eyes moist, eagerly searching the crowd. Somehow, through a small opening in the crowd, Annie caught a glimpse of the old man. Forgetting all the public acclaim and with arms outstretched, she called, "Grandpa, Grandpa." The crowd parted, leaving a narrow passageway for this precious moment. Stooped as he was, the elderly man reached out his arms like parentheses and nestled his young and precious granddaughter close to him, his gray hair falling against her curly red hair and their arms entwined around each other. He spoke softly. The audience was hushed. Although I could not hear, I think he must have said, "My dear, my dear, you played your part so very, very well."<br><br>Since that memorable occasion, I have replayed that final scene over and over in my mind a hundred times or more and contemplated the greeting we will each receive following our final performance. We are all on stage for a time. This is not the first or the final act. This is the second act. And we have been assured that we performed our first act very, very well. Concerning the second, our Father in Heaven has said,<br><br><i>And we will prove them herewith, to see if they will do all things whatsoever the Lord their God shall command them;</i><br><br><i>And they who keep their first estate shall be added upon; . . . and they who keep their second estate shall have glory added upon their heads for ever and ever.</i>[<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/pgp/abr/3.25,26?lang=eng#24">Abraham 3:25–26</a>]<br><br>As each of us participates in this great drama of earth life, we often find the parts we so much desire may not be available to us for a time. We find ourselves placed in other roles, only to discover after some years and after the trial of our faith that those "other roles" may even be the very ones we auditioned for--roles for which we received coaching and divine guidance from our Heavenly Father before we left our heavenly home to come onstage for a season.<br><br>President George Q. Cannon gives us great insight as he explains that<br><br><i>God has chosen us out of the world and has given us a great mission. I do not entertain a doubt myself that we were selected and foreordained for the mission before the world was, that we had our parts allotted to us in this mortal state of existence as our Savior had His assigned to Him.</i>[Gospel Truth, vol. 1 (Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Company, 1974), p.22]<br><br>In the production of<i>Annie</i>, Sandy, the dog, broke loose, missed his cue, entered too soon, and came in from the wings center stage. He could have spoiled the show, but Annie came to the rescue and helped him wait until it was his time to enter.<br><br>As participants on the stage of life, we too must be sensitive to the timing and must work to support each other. There are times that some will, for a brief moment, move center stage in front of the lights, then backstage or even offstage into the wings for a time, confident that the entire cast will participate in the final curtain call.<br><br>I believe the sensitivity we each have for another's part, major or minor, will have a tremendous impact on the quality of our individual and final performance. And it is often in the supportive roles that we see the finest and most magnificent examples.<br><br>This analogy of being onstage with a particular part is not intended to suggest that we perform as puppets on a string. That would violate the basic doctrine of agency that is so critical to the very purpose of this earth life. And yet many young people I talk to, and sometimes older ones, have a mistaken idea that they should wait for a prompting of the Spirit on every decision. If things go well, the Spirit prompted them to do this or that, and if things go well, the devil made them do it.<br><br>President Brigham Young gives us some great insight into our responsibility for choosing well. He said,<br><br><i>God is the author of all good; and yet, if you rightly understood yourselves, you would not directly attribute every good act you perform to our Father in heaven, nor to his Son Jesus Christ, nor to the Holy Ghost; neither would you attribute every evil act of a man or woman to the Devil or his spirits or influences; for man is organized by his Creator to act perfectly independently of all influences there are above or beneath. Those influences are always attending him, and are ready to dictate and direct--to lead him into truth or to lead him to destruction. But is he always guided by those influences in every act? He is not. It is ordained of God that we should act independently in and of ourselves, and the good is present when we need it. If we will ask for it, it is with us.</i>[JD 9:122]<br><br>We are responsible! President George Q. Cannon wrote,<br><br><i>It is true that some have greater power of resistance than others, but everyone has the power to close his heart against doubt, against darkness, against unbelief, against depression, against anger, against hatred, against jealousy, against malice, against envy. God has given this power unto all of us, and we can gain still greater power by calling upon Him for that which we lack. If it were not so, how could we be condemned for giving way to wrong influences?</i><br><br><i>There could be no condemnation for our doing what we could not help; but we can help doing these things.</i>[<i>Gospel Truth,</i>p. 19]<br><br>We are always at liberty to ad-lib and be distracted by seemingly more exciting parts. Some of us may spend too much time (which is our life) in the costume and wardrobe department selecting, designing, modeling, combining this with that, including all of the accessories, and as a result miss our cue.<br><br>For some of us, it may not be the costumes that distract us. It may be the props, the scenery, the set, the furniture--like cars and stereos, skis and VCRs--that, although important in their place, pale by comparison to the joy that comes from touching another's life in some quiet, small act of service. Would we ever let our things stand in the way of the joy that service brings when we share our lives with others?<br><h2><b>It Is Easy to Be Distracted</b></h2><br>Even as we endeavor to play our various parts in their appropriate seasons, there will continually be self-appointed stage managers who, not knowing or caring about the script, will shout from the wings, "You're playing the wrong part. You don't want the supporting role. That isn't important. Why be a supporting actor when you can be a star? Be front stage. Move in. Let them know who you are. This is your chance to win the applause."<br><br>There are those who would attempt to revise, rewrite, and restructure the script, changing the sacred roles of men and women, modifying the scenes and seasons, adjusting the morals and models where possible, and even altering the main stage, the home, in which the most important drama of life should unfold.<br><br>There are always loud voices assuming authorship while abdicating stewardship. You and I may never win an Academy Award, and society may never know us beyond the street where we live. And some of us, because of a calling or position, may be in the public eye more than others. But I am sure that when the lights have gone out and the curtain is closed on our second act, the opinions of others, the acceptance and the applause of the crowd, will be haunting echoes if our Father's approval is in question.<br><br>For many years I have carried in my wallet a copy of a statement by Leslie Weatherhead as a reminder of the perfect example:<br><br><i>When I am tempted to listen to hot, egotistic voices within my own heart; when it seems that love can never win but always loses; when it seems as though humility is ruthlessly trodden down by those who pass over it on their way to their own selfish ambitions; when it seems as though God cannot possibly triumph; when pity and love and mercy and kindness and tenderness are weakness; when it seems as though greatness is only possessed by those who know how to grab, and have the power to snatch at it, no matter what the cost to others--ah, yes, when the voices sound in my own heart which say you must play for your own hand, you must think of number one, you must not let yourself be trodden down--when I am thus tempted, my God! May I hear in imagination the tinkling of water, poured into a basin, and see, as in a vision, the Son of God washing the disciple's feet.</i>[Leslie D. Weatherhead, Eternal Voice (New York: Abingdon Press, 1940), pp. 81–82]<br><br>It won't matter if we play center stage or in the wings if our Lord and Savior is at the very center of our life. He reaches out to use with this promise: "Look unto me in every thought; doubt not, fear not. Behold the wounds which pierced my side, and also the prints of the nails in my hands and feet; be faithful, keep my commandments, and ye shall inherit the kingdom of heaven" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/6.36-37?lang=eng#p35">D&amp;amp;C 6:36–37</a>).<br><br>President Kimball has given us a guide to help keep us focused in our daily rehearsals. He said, "Since immortality and eternal life constitutes the sole purpose of life, all other interests and activities are but incidental thereto" (Spencer W. Kimball,<i>Miracle of Forgiveness</i>[Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1969], p. 2).<br><br>And Alma reminds us, "This life is the time for men to prepare to meet God: yea, behold the day of this life is the day for men to perform their labors" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/34.32?lang=eng#p31">Alma 34:32</a>). Our labors come in a variety of ways.<br><br>The other evening I was visiting with a young woman in her early twenties. She poured out her heart saying, "If I was just pretty, then I'd feel more confident." Let me say here that even if at one time you have that youthful beauty, it will fade with age. My friend gives comfort by reminding me that as your eyesight wanes, you don't look so bad when you can't see so well.<br><br>It is so easy to be distracted by vanity and pride. I believe that's one of the reasons we have over 300 references in the scriptures to the word<i>remember</i>. When we remember our parts, who we are, and whose we are, we are no longer distracted by foolish intruders. Remember Alma's question to those who would gain exaltation, "And now behold, I ask of you, my brethren [and, I might add, sisters] of the church, have ye spiritually been born of God? Have ye received his image in your countenances? Have ye experienced this mighty change in your hearts?" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/5.14?lang=eng#p13">Alma 5:14</a>). When this takes place, our beauty will be unsurpassed and assured.<br><br>Of course, it is appropriate that we look our best but before we become dazzled with the glamour of our outerwear, we might heed the words of Alma, "Yea, can ye be puffed up in the pride of your hearts; yea, will ye still persist in the wearing of costly apparel and setting your hearts upon the vain things of the world, upon your riches?" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/5.53?lang=eng#p52">Alma 5:53</a>). There are many attractive distractions that would interfere if possible with our command performance.<br><br>When we come to know who we are, something of our divine nature and our individual worth, and realize our part in the eternal plan, we will be prepared to respond as Lamoni's father did after Aaron taught him. He said, "I will give up all that I possess, yea, I will forsake my kingdom, that I may receive this great joy." Then he prayed, "And I will give away all my sins to know thee" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/22.15,18?lang=eng#p14">Alma 22:15, 18</a>).<br><br>When we let go of our sins and our eye is single to the glory of God, we are promised that our whole body shall be filled with light and that there shall be no darkness in us (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88.67?lang=eng#p66">D&amp;amp;C 88:67</a>). We will hear the still, small voice prompting us from the wings,, reminding us of our lines day by day. And even when we may question our own strength and ability, we can take comfort in the promises of the Lord when we are on his errands: "For I will go before your face. I will be on your right hand and on your left, and my Spirit shall be in your hearts, and mine angels round about you, to bear you up" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/84.88?lang=eng#p87">D&amp;amp;C 84:88</a>).<br><br>On those days when we feel we aren't doing very well, we can do as Nephi did on his challenging days: "Go into the mount oft, and . . . pray oft unto the Lord; wherefore the Lord [will show] unto [us] great things" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/18.3?lang=eng#p2">1 Nephi 18:3</a>). I know this can happen. I always thought it could, but I want to bear witness that I can and it does, and it will for each of you as you "ask with a sincere heart, with real intent, having faith in Christ' (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/moro/10.4?lang=eng#p3">Moroni 10:4</a>).<br><h2><b>Those Who Mix the Mortar</b></h2><br>As we consider our individual parts, I am impressed with the words of Ralph Waldo Emerson in his American literary essay on self-reliance;<br><br><i>There is a time in every man's education when he arrives at the conviction that envy is ignorance; that imitation is suicide; that he must take himself for better or worse as his portion; that though the wide universe is full of good, no kernel of nourishing corn can come to him but through his bestowed on that plot of ground which is given to him to till. The power which resides in him is new in nature, and none but he knows what that is which he can do, nor does he know until he has tried. . . .</i><br><br><i>What I must do is all that concerns me, not what people think. This rule, equally arduous in actual and in intellectual life, may serve for the whole distinction between greatness and meanness. It is the harder, because you will always find those who think they know what is your duty better than you know it. It is easy in the world to live after the world's opinion; it is easy in solitude to live after our own; but the great man is he who in the midst of the crowd keeps with perfect sweetness the independence of solitude.</i>[Ralph Waldo Emerson,<i>Essays; First Series (1841, rev. 1847), Self-Reliance</i>]<br><br>The plot of ground given to us to till is not always at the center of the stage.<br><br>Some years ago my husband and I arose early in the morning wanting to arrive on the grounds of the Jordan River Temple well before the crowd that would gather for the occasion of laying the cornerstone for the magnificent edifice. Our plan was ill timed. The crowd was already there when we arrived. Due to the contour of the land, I was not only stretching to see over the heads of those in front of me, but we were on the low side of the slope in front of the temple and I couldn't see what was going on. Heber, being considerably taller, tried to ease my disappointment by reporting to me the observations from his vantage point. "The choir is assembling," he reported. "The General Authorities are taking their places. The TV cameras are in place." This only added to my frustration as I faced the backs of those in front who were seeing this historic event that I was missing.<br><br>After reaching and stretching without success to catch even a glimpse of the drama, I decided to settle down, hoping to just feel the spirit of the occasion. It was when I relaxed that I changed my perspective and was attracted by an activity at the far northeast side of the temple just beyond the corner. This became the focal point of my interest. There I observed two men dressed in dark pants, white shirts and ties. They each had a shovel. They were busily engaged around a wheelbarrow. I saw them empty sacks of concrete, pour in water, and mix the contents in the wheelbarrow. In time, after hearing the choir and the impressive messages given by the presiding authorities, Heber reported to me that the cameras were now moving from center stage to the location for the placement of the cornerstone.<br><br>I watched. At that moment the men who mixed the mortar pushed the wheelbarrow to the front of the building and then quickly disappeared behind the scenes. The cornerstone was carefully anchored in place with the mortar prepared for this important event. On the news that evening I saw what the cameras saw. But they did not see what I had seen.<br><br>Now, years later, I never drive by the Jordan River Temple, especially after dark with the bright lights shining like beacons of refuge to a darkening world, without thinking of the men who mixed the mortar--those whose quiet, unsung labors played a major role in the placement of the cornerstone for the house of the Lord in a building that will stand against all of the storms of life.<br><br>Given a choice, would you be willing to serve with the men who mix the mortar?<br><br>Tonight I'd like to pay tribute to the men and women who mix the mortar, so to speak, in my life--those who so often work quietly in the wings. After twenty-seven years of continuous front-stage responsibilities in the Church, my husband was released as stake president. I wondered how life would be. Now I see him happily, joyfully, and ambitiously mixing mortar in quiet ways that help hold life together for many who need encouragement. I am constantly inspired by his private performance. I believe there is a close correlation between mixing mortar and ministering.<br><br>In the Young Women office where I spend much of my time, I see those who quietly mix mortar every day so that nothing falls between the cracks--unsung heroines, models for my life like the men who mix the mortar. The Lord tells us,<br><br><i>Be not weary in well-doing, for ye are laying the foundation of a great work. And out of small things proceedeth that which is great.</i>[<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/64.33?lang=eng#p32">D&amp;amp;C 64:33</a>]<br><br>Small acts of service, small sacrifices, small notes and calls, words of encouragement one to another--these "small things" are the mortar that help hold life together.<br><h2><b>Every Day of Our Lives</b></h2><br>Now the routine of life may sometimes seem a little humdrum, repetitious, and routine--maybe even boring on occasions. Don't let that happen, ever. It's all right to get tired, but don't ever become bored with life. I think of the words in the poem "Renascence" by Edna St. Vincent Millay. The introductory lines reveal a very limited and narrow point of view about life--a tone of boredom, I believe. The poem begins:<br><br><i>All I could see from where I stood</i><br><i>Was three long mountains and a wood;</i><br><i>I turned and looked the other way,</i><br><i>And saw three islands in a bay.</i><br><i>. . .</i><br><i>And so I looked, and, after all,</i><br><i>The sky was not so very tall.</i><br><i>. . .</i><br><i>The sky, I thought, is not so grand;</i><br><i>I 'most could touch it with my hand!</i><br><br>She is bored with life; after all, she thinks it's not so grand.<br><br>Then she dies and finds herself finally released from the routine and monotony of life. She is deep in the earth and resting, and the rain begins to fall. From the vantage point of being down and looking up she begins to see things differently.<br><i>Oh God, I cried, give me new birth,</i><br><i>And put me back upon the earth!</i><br><i>Upset each cloud's gigantic gourd</i><br><i>And let the heavy rain, down-poured</i><br><i>In one big torrent, set me free,</i><br><i>Washing my grave away from me!</i><br><br>Her earnest prayer is heard. The rain comes and washes her grave away, and she is alive again, this time with eyes to see and ears to hear--able to know and understand. She says,<br><br><i>And as I looked a quickening gust</i><br><i>Of wind blew up to me and thrust</i><br><i>Into my face a miracle</i><br><i>Of orchard-breath, and with the smell,--</i><br><i>I know not how such things can be!--</i><br><i>I breathed my soul back into me.</i><br><br><i>Ah! Up then from the ground sprang I</i><br><i>And hailed the earth with such a cry</i><br><i>As is not heard save from a man</i><br><i>Who has been dead and lives again.</i><br><br><i>About the trees my arms I wound;</i><br><i>Like one gone mad I hugged the ground;</i><br><i>I raised my quivering arms on high;</i><br><i>I laughed and laughed into the sky,</i><br><i>Till at my throat a strangling sob</i><br><i>Caught fiercely, and a great heart-throb</i><br><i>Sent instant tears into my eyes;</i><br><i>O God, I cried, no dark disguise</i><br><i>Can e'er hereafter hide from me</i><br><i>Thy radiant identity!</i><br><i>Thou canst not move across the grass</i><br><i>But my quick eyes will see Thee pass,</i><br><i>Nor speak, however silently,</i><br><i>But my hushed voice will answer Thee.</i><br><br>She concludes,<br><br><i>The world stands out on either side</i><br><i>No wider than the heart is wide;</i><br><i>Above the world is stretched the sky,--</i><br><i>No higher than the soul is high.<br>The heart can push the sea and land</i><br><i>Farther away on either hand;</i><br><i>The soul can split the sky in two,</i><br><i>And let the face of God shine through.</i><br><br><i>But East and West will pinch the heart</i><br><i>That cannot keep them pushed apart;</i><br><i>And he whose soul is flat--the sky</i><br><i>Will cave in on him by and by.</i><br>["Renascence," Edna St. Vincent Millay]<br><br>How long has it been since you have celebrated the dawn of a new day, studied the dew on a spider web, or counted the petals on a daisy? Oh, that we might remain alive as long as we live.<br><br>At times when "my part" seems difficult and when there are more demands than I can meet, I'm forced to prioritize because I can't do it all. Then I read again the words of our Savior in the New Testament that helps me as I try to separate the urgent demands from the vital virtues.<br><br><i>A new commandment I give unto you, That ye love one another; as I have loved you, that ye also love one another.</i><br><br><i>By this shall men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have loved one to another.</i>[<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/john/13.34-35?lang=eng#p33">John 13:34–35</a>]<br><br>Our greatest performance is when we take time to give of ourselves in love, one for another, often away from the crowd. Of the multitude of happenings during the past several years in my life, permit me to share with you what I would like to have recorded in some quiet note on a page of history as possibly a noteworthy performance.<br><br>A few years ago, as it was nearing Christmas, I found myself confronted with a very full schedule. The streets were crowded, my calendar was crowded, and my mind was crowded. There was so much to do and so little time. An invitation to give a brief Christmas message to the residents of a nursing home nearby was one activity I could check off rather quickly and then hurriedly move to the next appointment.<br><br>As I rushed past the receptionist at the door of the nursing home, I was ushered into a large room where I suddenly stopped. Life was moving at a different pace here, if it was moving at all. There were wheelchairs, bent shoulders, gray hair, tired eyes, and the impression of so little going on. I reviewed quickly in my mind the message I had planned to share and hoped that it would fit and lift some heart, or at least be appropriate for this occasion. It was warm in the room but, in spite of this fact, many of the elderly had knitted shawls draped over rounded shoulders and woolly slippers covering tired feet.<br><br>Following my message, one of the visitors, a granddaughter of one of the elderly, asked if I would have time to visit with her grandmother in her own private room for even a few moments. She made the comment, "She thinks she knows you," indicating perhaps that her grandmother's mind might also be tired. I agreed that I could take a few moments, and I followed behind as the younger woman helped this elderly sister down the narrow hall back to her room. This dear lady reached her bedside, then shuffled haltingly as she turned around, let go of her granddaughter, and dropped onto the side of her bed. She then raised her head so that I could look into her face. My eyes caught hers. "Sister Myrtle Dudley," I said, "you were my Primary teacher."<br><br>The wrinkles on her face formed a smile as she pulled on her granddaughter's jacket and said, "See, I told you she would know me."<br><br>I continued, "I remember when you used to lead the singing. You wore that wine-colored dress with the big sleeves that waved back and forth as you taught us the songs."<br><br>Again she pulled on her granddaughter's jacket. "I told you she would know me."<br><br>"Yes," I said, "and you made carrot juice for my mother when she was sick."<br><br>The she asked, "Did you come all the way from Canada just to see me?"<br><br>"Oh, Sister Dudley," I said, "I have come a long way. It has been over forty years." She then reached out her arms and drew me close to her. I felt like a child once again, back in Primary, in the arms of my teacher who loved me.<br><br>Then she whispered in my ear, "I knew you would know me."<br><br>There in the arms of my Primary teacher the world stood still for a moment. The busy streets were forgotten. The crowded calendar was no longer pressing on my mind. The spirit of Christmas filled my soul. A small miracle was taking place, not because of what I brought but because of what I had received.<br><br>After a time, I reluctantly and thoughtfully left the presence of my Primary teacher and walked slowly back to my car. I sat there pondering while the snowflakes of the season fell gently on the windshield that was piling high with snow. It was the season of celebration for the birth of Jesus Christ, our Lord and Savior. It was he who asked us to love one another and to serve one another. He said to each of us, "Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/matt/25.40?lang=eng#p39">Matthew 25:40</a>).<br><br>"Yes," I thought, "I knew her because she had served me, and she knew me because she had served me." And then the vision cleared before my eyes like windshield wipers removing the snow. We will know Him when we serve Him, and He will know us when we serve Him. This question filed my mind: "Can I one day say with the same conviction with which Sister Dudley spoke, 'I told you He would know me'?"<br><br>What if I hadn't taken time to do what mattered most, when in the press of the moment it seemed to matter least? I don't do those things enough, but when I do I know it is in the Lord's service that we qualify best to be called his disciples.<br><br>Let us keep ever in mind an anticipation of that glorious day when we will be with our Father again. President George Q. Cannon helps us envision that event with these words:<br><br><i>We existed with Him in the family relationship as His children . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . when we see our Father in heaven we shall know Him; and the recollection that we were once with Him and that He was our Father will come back to us, and we will fall upon His neck, and He will fall upon us, and we will kiss each other. We will know our Mother, also.</i>[<i>Gospel Truth,</i>pp. 1, 3]<br><br>We might add, "I told you he would know me."<br><br>One day, like Annie, we will leave the stage. And I am confident that having done our part, with arms outstretched, we will receive an embrace and experience the greatest commendation we could ever hope for from the only one that really matters: "You played your part so very, very well." I believe we will hear our Father and Mother say, "My son, my daughter, I have you home again." Then we will hear not with our ears, but with our spirit, the echoing applause of multitudes of heavenly hosts, our brothers and our sisters, rejoicing in our safe return to have glory added upon our heads forever and ever.<br><br>May we find our constant example in that part played by the greatest model in the greatest moment of all time when our Savior spoke these lines,<br><br><i>And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent.</i><br><br><i>I have glorified thee on the earth: I have finished the work which thou gavest me to do.</i>[<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/john/17.3-4?lang=eng#p2">John 17:3–4</a>]<br><br>May the curtain never close until our work is finished. And when it does close, I pray that we will each feel the satisfaction of having listened to the whisperings of the Spirit every day of our lives, that we may prepare to do our part. God bless you, my brothers and sisters, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Ardeth G.

<h1>al Body—A Sacred Gift - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
This is an inspiring, humbling, awesome moment for me--one that I have been anticipating for some weeks. I want to say that it is a tremendous honor to be here with you in this setting.<br><br>As I projected myself into this moment and as I prepared, I pondered what I could share with you that might in some way change your lives. What a solemn responsibility! I assume that is why you are here at this university and in this assembly--to be enlightened, enriched, and changed. I reflected on President David O. McKay's words given in an address here at BYU in 1947 that life is a constant state of radiation and absorption. To live is to radiate who we are and what we are, and to live is to absorb that radiation from others--by our life we affect, to some degree, the life of the whole world. The implication, I think, is that each of us has responsibility for and influence in this experience. I am grateful for the invocation in our behalf and the music that has invited the Spirit, and I pray that we may be edified together.<br><h2><b>The Importance of This Earth Life</b></h2><br>As a young faculty member, I was interviewed by Elder Theodore M. Burton. He counseled me to remind the choice young men and women who would come to be my students who they really were. It struck me as rather curious at the time. Of course everyone knows who they are--or do they? Over the years I have learned that there was great wisdom in his counsel.<br><br>Who are we? Where did we come from? Why are we here on this earth? Why was it necessary to come here?<br><br>Most civilizations have asked these questions since the beginning of mankind's sojourn upon this earth. The answer is not so simple--there are many divine purposes for our being here. But few in the world today seem to have a clear understanding of who we are or of the importance of this earth life and its relevance in the eternal scheme of Heavenly Father's plan.<br><br>In the beginning we were with God the Eternal Father. We are his literal spirit children (Numbers 27:16). We must have been happy there in the presence of our Eternal Father and Mother and elder brother, Jesus Christ. This was a period of testing, proving ourselves, growing, and learning--a time of probation now upon this earth. This was called our first estate. Abraham was told we had intelligence and agency to make our own choices and decisions (Abraham 3:22–28). Why then did we need to come to this second estate? Were we not able to prove our worthiness there in the premortal world?<br><br>It seems that in this perhaps very long period of premortal life we had progressed about as far as we could without a mortal, physical body. In order to continue to progress, that we might obtain immortality and eternal life, we had to have a physical body as our Heavenly Father has. The Father has a body of flesh and bones just as tangible as man's. He has allowed Joseph Smith and others to witness this and has revealed this knowledge to us in the Doctrine and Covenants (D&amp;amp;C 130:22).<br><br>The Son also has a body of flesh and bones. When Christ revealed himself to the brother of Jared, he had not yet taken a physical body. Christ said:<br><br><i>Behold, this body, which ye now behold, is the body of my spirit; and man have I created after the body of my spirit; and even as I appear unto thee to be in the spirit will I appear unto my people in the flesh.</i>[Ether 3:16]<br><br>Christ came into the world to get his mortal body and to become our Savior. After his death, he appeared in his resurrected body to his disciples in Jerusalem and to the Nephites on this continent. "Behold my hands and my feet, that it is I myself: handle me, and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me have" (Luke 24:39).<br><br>If we were to progress eternally, it was clearly necessary to gain a mortal, physical body.<br><br>The spirit and the body are the soul of man (D&amp;amp;C 88:15); neither is complete without the other. And the absence of the spirit from the body is looked upon as a bondage (D&amp;amp;C 45:17, 138:50).<br><br>The body was formed from the dust (Abraham 5:7), lifeless without the living spirit. Therefore, a major purpose for coming to this earth was to gain a physical body and become one with our spirit<br><br>Other significant purposes for coming to this earth were to gain experience, to grow, to learn, to improve our talents, to give service, and to choose an eternal marriage companion to multiply and replenish the earth. In order to fulfill these commandments we had to have a physical body. Jesus made it plain from his teachings that we are given gifts and talents to be magnified and used in the service of our fellow mortals. "For unto whomsoever much is given, of him shall be much required" (Luke 12:48). Through his parable of the talents, it is clear that there will be an accounting from each of us as to how we used our talents and the opportunities we were given (Matthew 25). He further taught his followers that "whosoever will be chief among you, let him be your servant' (Matthew 20:27).<br><br>Still another purpose of coming to this earth was to prove ourselves. Had we not had opportunity to gain experience and prove ourselves in our pre-earth life? Had we not beheld the unfolding of a most amazing plan created by a loving Heavenly Father that provided a way for us to progress beyond that spirit state and work toward our exaltation given as our Father had done before us?<br><br>Did we not have the option to accept or reject that plan? Yes, we did. In the pre-earth life there were laws established, and the spirits there had the choice of accepting or rejecting the laws and counsel given. This was our first estate. We kept this first estate by choosing to be obedient to the requirements God had set for us. And thus we qualified ourselves to come into this prepared earth to prove ourselves in our second estate (Abraham 3:24–26). The difference between the first and second estate was the acquiring of the mortal body in the second estate.<br><br>There were many who did not keep their first estate who chose to follow Satan; for doing so they were cast out with him and lost the privilege of coming to this earth to gain a body (Abraham 3:28).<br><br>It is almost impossible to understand the complete significance and privilege of receiving a body of flesh and bone. When Christ cast out the evil spirit from the man whom no man could bind with chains, he asked its name. The spirit answered, "Legion: for we are many" (Mark 5:9). Upon command to leave the body of the man who was possessed, the spirits asked permission to enter the bodies of feeding swine: "The herd ran violently down a steep place into the sea" (Mark 5:13). It is so important to have a physical body that these spirits who had forfeited the right to have bodies of their own were even anxious to enter the bodies of swine.<br><br>Each of us here kept our first estate or we wouldn't be here. We must have been an enthusiastic lot. From the book of Job (38:7) we understand that "all the sons of God shouted for joy" when the foundations of the earth were laid. Through this gospel plan that was prepared in the beginning we realized that by obedience we could progress, obtain a mortal body, and prepare ourselves for immortality and eternal life. The next step was to prepare a new environment for this probationary period.<br><br><i>And there stood one among them that was like unto God, and he said unto those who were with him: We will go down, for there is space there, and we will take of these materials, and we will make an earth whereon these may dwell;</i><br><br><i>And we will prove them herewith, to see if they will do all things whatsoever the Lord their God shall command them.</i>[Abraham 3:24–25]<br><br>We had proven ourselves in our first estate or in the spirit world; but in order to progress, we needed to prove ourselves with the physical body.<br><br>The great Book of Mormon prophet Alma indicates we will be judged according to the deeds that have been done in the mortal body (Alma 5:15). Nephi, son of Lehi, also reaffirms that the time should come that we must be judged of our works that were done by the temporal body in our days of probation (1 Nephi 15:32).<br><h2><b>The Greatest of All Creations</b></h2><br>Our mortal bodies are so consequential that they merit the creation of an earth to make it possible to fulfill the eternal gospel plan of our Heavenly Father. But let us consider the body for a moment just as a physical entity.<br><br>Depending on age and size, the body is a composite of tens of trillions of tiny cells. Each little cell is a very independent unit with is own specific function. Each is busily manufacturing who we are, how we function, and, in many ways, the quality of our lives.<br><br>There is no aspect of our existence--whether it be social, intellectual, or spiritual--that is not affected by our physical well-being or lack of it.<br><br>Each of us--whether tall or short, stout or lean, blond or brunette, young or old--is incredibly unique because we are created in a divine image: "In the image of his own body, male and female, created he them" (Moses 6:9).<br><br>What a masterpiece the human body is. What a miracle of creation. In my view, it is the greatest of all creations worlds without end.<br><br>How shall we show respect for this precious gift? How shall we care for this divine creation?<br><br>In a year's time many of the trillions of little cells and components that make us who we are will replace themselves. What are the raw materials we give those cells to work with? If we use inferior materials to work with, we will end up with an inferior product. If, however, we are willing to provide superior materials, we may end up with a superior product.<br><br>We have been given a Word of Wisdom, wise counsel in how to care for our bodies (D&amp;amp;C 89): "Strong drinks are not for the belly ... tobacco is not for the body ... hot drinks are not for the body or belly" (7–9). "Yea, ... flesh ... of beasts and of the fowls of the air, I, the Lord, have ordained for the use of man with thanksgiving; nevertheless they are to be used sparingly" (12). "All grain is good for the food of man; as also the fruit of the vine" (16).<br><br>We are given a wonderful promise if we obey:<br><br><i>And all saints who remember to keep and do these sayings, walking in obedience to the commandments, shall receive health in their navel and marrow to their bones;</i><br><br><i>And shall find wisdom and great treasures of knowledge, even hidden treasures;</i><br><br><i>And shall run and not be weary, and shall walk and not faint.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 89:18–20]<br><br>What a wonderful promise--just a few among many.<br><br>We have much scientific knowledge as to what should and should not be taken into the body. We also need to rest, exercise, refine, nurture, and perfect our bodies--for they are the vehicles that will go with us throughout the eternities.<br><br>The physicality, the self-healing power, the potential for the highest forms of personal and artistic expression make the body a monument of God's creative mastery. There is so much we have learned about this prodigious body, and we have so much more to learn.<br><br>We do know that the body will respond positively or negatively according to the care we provide or fail to provide. It will adapt to the stresses placed upon it. If we require it to sit bent over and curved for a long period of time, the muscles in the back and neck will lengthen to compensate and the muscles in front will shorten--soon it will feel just great to carry the body around with very poor alignment, which may lead to other problems. However, if we require the body to strengthen all the muscles and give the cardiovascular and respiratory systems work and experience, they will continue to function as they were meant to do. If we give each joint the opportunity to maintain its full range of motion, we can have efficient, full use of our instrument. We can accomplish our work, enjoy our play, relieve debilitating stress, and push back our fatigue threshold. If this were not so, dancers and athletes could not improve our physical condition at any age. We are not vegetables--we are living, springing, dynamic beings whose vital systems all depend upon movement and use. We rarely lose our physical capabilities in normal living, but we give them up through nonsense. Of course there are notable exceptions such as disease and injury. But we were made to move. Our bodies do adapt to the stresses placed upon them--gradually, carefully, respectfully, little by little.<br><h2><b>Turning Stumbling Blocks into Stepping-Stones</b></h2><br>As a young dancer I studied with a distinguished teacher in California, Rozelle Frey. She had been a member of the Anna Pavlova Dance Company in her youth. Her story and influence had remarkable lessons and impact for me. Initially she had trained to become a concert pianist, but when she was taken to see a classical ballet concert, she knew immediately what she wanted to do with her life. There, in her native Sweden, her family, having means, took her to study with a great ballet master teacher. After looking at her work in her audition, he told her that she should continue her career in her piano work, that she had little hope of becoming a dancer. She had a problem that in those days was called "banana legs." Her legs curved outward like bananas. This simply was not compatible with the turnout or rotation of the legs required in the positions of ballet. She pleaded with this teacher to give her a chance to study, to prove herself. She was told that his time was simply too important to work with students who had no potential. However, she could come to the classes, stand back by the piano, and satisfy herself, but she would receive no help or criticism from him and would be completely on her own. She accepted with great enthusiasm.<br><br>This was before the time of seriously practiced physical therapy, so the result was unexpected. For seven years she worked diligently--pulling, strengthening, stretching, working. At first she went unnoticed, and then gradually she was accepted into the class and finally placed as an example at the front of the class where the students had to pass the teacher's review.<br><br>Through the continued, repeated effort of working the muscles correctly and placing on them certain demands, the body responded by adapting to those demands. Because she was young and some bone was not yet solidified but cartilaginous, her legs became straight and tall. Remember I said she became a member of the Anna Pavlova Dance Company eventually. That is remarkable in itself; but even more startling to me was the fact that of the group of dancers she trained with for seven years, she was the only one who was ever chosen to dance in a professional company. Why? Perhaps the others did not have to try as hard or care so much. We all have stumbling blocks placed in our way--those are our growth-promoting experiences. If ever there was a stumbling block for a dancer, it was banana legs. But she made those stumbling blocks into stepping-stones. They caused her to have to try harder, to be more committed. So Miss Frey rose above those in the ordinary, easier paths, and she was able to reach greater heights.<br><br>In Ether 12:27 we are told that we are given weaknesses that we might be humble and that if we are humble, our weaknesses may become our strengths. We might look at our weaknesses as gifts to humble ourselves before God and pray that we can have the will to withstand temptations and weaknesses of body and spirit in whatever form.<br><br>Many temptations, testings, and challenges come through the body. There must be opposition in all things. This is part of our proving ourselves. Most of the evil and temptations in our society today are directed at the body. Satan and his followers are seeking our destruction that we may become subject to him. Pornography, physical abuse, drugs, moral transgression, perversion, abortion, suicide, and murder are all vicious designs of Satan to destroy the souls of man. All are directed at the body. Our choice of music, literature, dance, movies, videos, television, friends, etc., can lead to base thoughts and actions regarding the body or to uplifting, respectful thoughts and feelings about the body. Those choices are ours.<br><br>Can we recognize the temptations for what they are and reject them, not falling into Satan's traps? We knew there would be temptations and trials, but we knew we could meet them or we wouldn't have shouted for joy.<br><br>We have guidance and help in this life. King Benjamin spoke of the model that Christ would be: "And lo, he shall suffer temptations, and pain of body, hunger, thirst, and fatigue, even more than man can suffer, except it be unto death" (Mosiah 3:7). Even suffering as he did, he did not succumb.<br><br>If we understand the significance of the body in the eternal plan of salvation in even a small way, could we permit ourselves to be dressed immodestly, to allow our bodies to be defiled or to defile that of another, to slash or cut the body--a practice forbidden by God because it was being done in some early cultures (Leviticus 19:28)--to weaken the body with inappropriate substances, to try to strengthen the body with inappropriate substances, to allow our muscles to atrophy and become weakened through lack of movement and disuse, to deny nourishment to the point of anorexia, or allow other destructive behaviors?<br><br>There will be challenges in this life, for our bodies are subject to the natural processes of this mortal world. We are all subject to pain, disease, injury, aging, and infirmity. But the hope and understanding in this lies in the fact that these problems are part of our experience, and they are temporary. Whether young or old, we must all pass through death at the end of our days or probation upon the earth.<br><br>God formed man from the dust (Abraham 5:7), and to the dust we return. From the Doctrine and Covenants we read:<br><br><i>Their sleeping dust was to be restored unto its perfect frame, bone to his bone, and the sinews and the flesh upon them, the spirit and the body to be united never again to be divided, that they might receive a fullness of joy.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 138:17]<br><br>As a result of Christ's atonement in our behalf, his suffering of body and spirit, we will rise again. We can read his own words describing his suffering;<br><br><i>Which suffering caused myself, even God, the greatest of all, to tremble because of pain, and to bleed at every pore, and to suffer both body and spirit--and would that I might not drink the bitter cup, and shrink--</i><br><br><i>Nevertheless, glory be to the Father, and I partook and finished my preparations unto the children of men.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 19:18–19]<br><br>These preparations were for us that our bodies and spirits could be restored one to the other by the power of the resurrection of the Holy One of Israel (2 Nephi 9:12).<br><h2><b>Spirit and Body Shall Be Reunited</b></h2><br>Alma assures us that "the spirit and the body shall be reunited again in its perfect form; both limb and joint shall be restored to its proper frame" (Alma 11:43). And Nephi counseled his people on this doctrine:<br><br><i>For I know that ye have searched much, many of you, to know of things to come; wherefore I know that ye know that our flesh must waste away and die; nevertheless, in our bodies we shall see God.</i>[2 Nephi 9:4]<br><br>One last significant observation about our physical bodies is given by Paul, who warns,<br><br><i>Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?</i><br><br><i>If any man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, which temple ye are.</i>[1 Corinthians 3:16–17]<br><br>Here is a marvelous promise--one which should be particularly encouraging to all engaged in the pursuit of knowledge:<br><br><i>And if your eye be single to my glory, your whole bodies shall be filled with light, and there shall be no darkness in you; and that body which is filled with light comprehendeth all things.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 88:67]<br><br>In summary, Who are we? We are the literal offspring of God the Eternal Father. Why are we here? We are here because of the brilliant plan of salvation of a loving Heavenly Father and his Son, our Savior. The earth was prepared in our behalf that we might come (1) to get a mortal body, (2) to get experience with our body of flesh and bone, and (3) to prove ourselves in every way in keeping all of God's commandments in the flesh.<br><br>I have profound esteem for the human body as I have studied, given birth, trained, taught, and observed. Certainly our spirit and body become one--our eternal soul. In times past the body has been looked upon as evil; it was purged and punished as a way of purifying the spirit. That is not our Heavenly Father's way.<br><br>In Thessalonians we are told that all should know how to possess his vessel in sanctification and honor (1 Thessalonians 4:4) And in Romans, Paul pleads,<br><br><i>I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service.</i>[Romans 12:1]<br><br>Just as Alma asked his people, let us ponder this scenario, "Can you imagine to yourselves that ye hear the voice of the Lord, saying unto you, in that day: Come unto me ye blessed, for behold your works have been the works of righteousness upon the face of the earth?" (Alma 5:16).<br><br>Through Abraham our Lord tells us that his expressed work and his glory is to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man (Moses 1:39).<br><br>So, as I mentioned at the beginning, if we are to be changed today, let us change together. Beginning today, let each of us try harder to care for our bodies, to keep them clean and undefiled inside and out and keep our passions and appetites within the bounds the Lord has set. We will feel better and will be able to give more service. We will be able to fulfill all of those things that we desire to do here upon the earth so we might lift up our hearts and be glad (D&amp;amp;C 29:5), that we might have a fullness of joy.<br><br>Finally, to the Prophet Joseph Smith the Lord said:<br><br><i>And, if you keep my commandments and endure to the end you shall have eternal life, which gift is the greatest of all the gifts of God.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 14:7]<br><br>It is my plea and humble prayer today that each of us can recognize the sacredness of our bodies; that we can have a reverence for them and use all of the manifold information available to us to nourish and edify them, even celebrate them in righteousness; that they can facilitate all of the experiences here and in the worlds to come; that we can recognize Satan's ploys in degrading this precious gift that permits us to have eternal life.<br><br>May this be our desire and resolve, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Sara Lee Gibb was as associate professor and director of modern dance at Brigham Young University when this devotional address was given on 27 June 1989.</i><br><br><i>© Brigham Young University.

<h1>Young, Prophet of God - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
<i>And it shall come to pass in the last days, that the mountain of the Lord's house shall be established in the top of the mountains, and shall be exalted above the hills; and all nations shall flow unto it.</i><br><br><i>And many people shall go and say, Come ye, and let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, to the house of the God of Jacob; and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths: for out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem.</i>[Isaiah 2:2–3]<br><br>Each year as we celebrate the twenty-fourth of July, I reflect on this scripture and marvel at the accomplishments of the Mormon pioneers who settled here in the tops of the mountains. I have a special respect and admiration for President Brigham Young as he led the colonization of the pioneers here in the West. As we meet tonight on the campus that bears his name, it seems appropriate to remind ourselves of some of the teachings, philosophy, and vision of this great leader.<br><br>Brigham Young first saw the light of day in a rough-hewn log cabin in Whitingham, Vermont, on 1 June 1801. His arrival swelled to nine the number of John and Abigail Howe Young's children, divided unevenly with five girls and four boys. Shortly before Brigham Young was born, the family moved in the middle of winter from Hopkinton, Massachusetts, to Vermont. So Brigham Young really had his beginning in Massachusetts, but was born in Vermont, not many miles from the birthplace of the Prophet Joseph Smith.<br><br>In those days the people were surprisingly mobile. When they found farming not very productive in one place, they would migrate to another, almost on impulse. This had prompted the Young family to move from Massachusetts to Vermont to see if they could open up a greater farming potential. Survival under these conditions depended entirely on one's industry and on the weather.<br><br>The farmer is usually more susceptible to the ideas of God than are those in most other occupations--mostly because farmers are so dependent on God, and especially as they witness the recurring miracle of life and growth in the planting, nurturing, and maturing of crops. So John Young had a religious upbringing,, as did his wife. By the time he left Whitingham in 1804, he was impelled to move west to find more fertile land and more congenial surroundings.<br><br>The next stop for the Young family was Sherbourne, New York, a rural village in the Cherry Valley. The Youngs stayed here for nine years, and in this place the family was increased by the birth of the tenth and eleventh children. However, it was diminished by the death of their second child, a fourteen-year-old daughter.<br><br>From Sherbourne they migrated to Cayuga County, New York, in 1813. This was the last home that the wife of John Young would occupy. Careworn after bearing eleven children in twenty-one years and mothering them under harsh conditions, she finally gave up her life for her family.<br><br>Brigham Young was only fourteen years of age at the time of his mother's death. It was a difficult time, and he mourned her passing as any teenage child would at a time like that. The passing of his mother brought about many changes in the Young family. Marriages that occurred would have a tremendous impact on his life in future years. Rhoda, a sister, married John P. Green, and his brother John married Theodosia Kimball, a union that brought the family to the gospel of Jesus Christ. John Young, his father, later married Hannah Brown.<br><br>When Brigham was a robust sixteen-year-old, he was already learning the skills of a carpenter, joiner, painter, and glazier that gave him such a good foundation for the rest of his life. About this time there was an economic boom in the construction of the Erie Canal. Young Brigham left to work for a while in Auburn. There he applied his carpentry skills in the construction of a prison. Then he moved to Port Byron, a few miles north on the route of the Erie Canal, where he used his skill chiefly as a painter.<br><br>Here it was noticed that young Brigham was emerging into a powerful character. He was intelligent, energetic, and tough-minded, standing 5'10" tall and weighing 190 lbs. He was an imposing physical specimen with broad shoulders--a powerful man, his body developed over years of toil on his father's farm. His hair had a reddish tint and framed a high forehead. His blue eyes looked out on a world with a steady gaze that, to some, had a definite quality of strength. He had a determined jaw. On seeing Brigham for the first time, one knew instinctively that he was a man not to be trifled with. Yet he had a tender side, almost a poetic quality about him that was evidence of the loving relationship he had had with his mother.<br><br>He searched for cultural development and loved the finer things of life. In Port Byron he joined a debating society, which helped him develop his skills as a speaker. Also during this period, Brigham's first formal affiliation with a church occurred, and at twenty-two years of age he joined a church, following a pattern set by his parents and older brother. It was also about this time he began to court Miriam Works, who would soon become his bride. Miriam, like Brigham, traced her ancestry back to Hopkinton, Massachusetts.<br><br>Soon they were married, and Miriam gave birth to their first child, whom they named Elizabeth. When Elizabeth was four, Brigham and Miriam decided to move to Mendon, New York--a decision that had far-reaching consequences for their future lives. It was during this move to Mendon that Brigham came in contact with the Church. His conversion was really brought about by one of his brothers, who was an itinerant preacher. This brother had come in contact with Samuel H. Smith, who was carrying in his backpack several copies of the Book of Mormon. He was impressed with Samuel's sincerity, but he could not exercise much zeal for the story about the coming forth of the book. He decided to purchase a copy out of curiosity and intended to spend some time finding flaws and exposing it. He studied and cataloged the book, looking for errors, but soon became convinced of its truthfulness.<br><br>His father, John Young, also read the book. Then Brigham's sister Fanny, and then the Greens, the Kimballs--all had an opportunity to read it. This is a classic story of the Book of Mormon bringing to a family the light of the gospel. They soon came in contact with Solomon Chamberlin, another itinerant preacher who had been converted to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Brigham's brother, after meeting this man who believed that a man must have authority from Jesus Christ in order to baptize another into the true church, lost all of his enthusiasm for preaching and became completely converted to the message of the Book of Mormon.<br><br>Five elders showed up in Mendon and preached the gospel. Heber C. Kimball wrote:<br><br><i>As soon as I heard them, I was convinced that they taught the truth, and that I had only received a part of the ordinances in the church in which I belonged. I also saw and heard the gifts and spirits manifested by the elders.</i><br><br>Brigham Young himself also became thoroughly convinced of the message of these five elders. He said this five years after they arrived in the Salt Lake Valley;<br><br><i>When I saw a man without eloquence or talents for public speaking, who could only say, "I know by the power of the Holy Ghost that the Book of Mormon is true, and that Joseph Smith is a Prophet of the Lord," the Holy Ghost proceeded from that individual, illuminated my understanding, and light, glory, and immortality were before me. I was encircled by them, filled with them, and I knew for myself the testimony was true.</i><br><br>Brigham's brother had a powerful influence on his conversion. This brother's name was John.<br><br><b>Brigham Young</b><i>(coming forth to the stand):</i>No, no, no, it was not John! It was my brother Phineas. Let<i>me</i>tell his conversion story. In January of 1832, several months after these elders had visited Mendon, myself, Phineas, and Heber C. Kimball had thoroughly digested the spiritual fare we had received in abundance, and we decided to make a perilous midwinter trip to confirm our conclusions. We traveled through ice and snow, crossing rivers until we were almost discouraged; still, our faith was to learn more of the principles of Mormonism.<br><br>We remained with our new friend about a week, assimilating all they had to offer until we had such a conviction of the gospel of Jesus Christ that we wanted to learn more about the Prophet Joseph Smith and his ministry.<br><br>After my father, John Young, and my brothers, Phineas and Joseph, were baptized on 5 April 1832, they made the 120-mile trip to Mendon accompanied by one of the elders and their teacher, Eleazer Miller. There they found me waiting expectantly for the gospel. On April fourteenth, 1832, I was baptized into the Church by Elder Miller. It was a glorious celebration on this day of baptism. (Extracted from<i>Brigham Young, Modern Moses, Prophet of God</i>by Francis M. Gibbons [Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1981], pp. 7–20.)<br><br><b>Elder Perry:</b>Yours is a remarkable conversion story of how the Lord guides the footsteps of his servants and brings the leadership required to further his purposes here on earth. How often we see the powerful witness of the Book of Mormon in conversions with whole family units embracing the gospel of our Lord and Savior. President Young, thank you for sharing your conversion story with us. This is such a rare opportunity to have you with us this evening.<br><br>Would you allow us to take advantage of this situation by having you share with us some of the observations and instructions you would like to give these great young people who have gathered here tonight in this eighteen-stake fireside? Are there two or three special instructions you would like to leave with them?<br><br><b>Brigham Young:</b>The messages I would give you now have not changed a great deal through the generations from the time I was here. The first lesson I would like to leave with you tonight is to be obedient to the will of God.<br><br><i>It is written that God knows all things and has all power. He has the rule and command of this earth, and is the Father of all the human beings that have lived, do live and will live upon it. If any of his children become heirs to all things, they in their turn can say, by-and-by, that they know all things, and they will be called Supreme, Almighty, King of kings, Lord of lords. All this and more that cannot enter into our hears to conceive is promised to the faithful, and are but so many stages in that ceaseless progression of eternal lives. This will not detract anything from the glory and might of our Heavenly Father. For he will still remain our Father, and we shall still be subject to him, and as we progress in glory and power, the more it enhances the glory and power of our Heavenly Father. This principle holds good in either state, whether mortal or immortal.</i><br><br><i>All that the Lord requires of us is a perfect submission in our hearts to his will.</i>[DBY, p. 20]<br><br><i>Obedience is one of the plainest, most everyday and home principles that you ever thought or know anything about. . . .</i><br><br><i>I cannot save you. I can tell you how to save yourselves, but you must do the will of God.</i><br><br><i>How shall we know what to do? By being obedient to every requirement of the Gospel . . . .</i><br><br><i>Do you think that people will obey the truth because it is true, unless they love it? No, they will not. Truth is obeyed when it is loved. Strict obedience to the truth will alone enable people to dwell in the presence of the Almighty.</i><br><br><i>The Lord has sent forth his laws, commandments, and ordinances to the children of men, and requires them to be strictly obeyed, and we do not wish to transgress those laws, but to keep them. We do not wish to change his ordinances, but to observe them; we do not wish to break the everlasting covenant, but to keep that with our fathers, with Jesus, with our Father in Heaven, with holy angels, and to live according to them.</i>[DBY, p. 220]<br><br><i>Great peace have they who love the law of the Lord and abide in his commandments.</i><br><br><i>If you with to receive and enjoy the favor of our Heavenly Father, do his will.</i>[DBY, p. 223]<br><br><b>Elder Perry:</b>Your first counsel then to these great young people would be to be obedient to the will of our Eternal Father, not for reasons of constraint or compulsion, but because it brings the only true joy to be found as we progress through mortality. There is great safety in staying as far away from being disobedient as possible. We should not try to devise ways to satisfy our appetites, to see how close we can come to the line that separates obedience from disobedience. We should decide here and now to stay as far away from even the so-called gray areas between the two and be completely obedient to the will of the Lord.<br><br>What would be your second instruction to these great young people, President Young?<br><br><b>Brigham Young:</b>I am concerned with the trend I see in the social order in this great land in which we live. Suppose we had the power to take the poor and ignorant, the low and the degraded, all those who are trodden under foot by the great and powerful among earth's inhabitants, and bring them together, purify them, fill them with knowledge and understanding, and make a nation of them worthy of admiration? What would you say to this? My greatest hope in my day was to transform these people into being ambitious and to be exemplary in their communities, where dedication, cooperation, unity, and pioneer-building were sacramental rituals.<br><br>As for the women--in my day I used to say that I wished for them more than relief from domestic labor. Certainly their utility extended beyond the need to sweep houses, wash dishes, make beds, and raise babies. After breakfast they might go to work making bonnets and hats and clothing. Even though I think manual labor for women is unfitting, let the professions be opened to them. They could stand behind business counters, study law or physics, or become good bookkeepers and be able to do their business in counting houses--and all of this to enlarge their sphere of usefulness for the benefit of society at large.<br><br>I encouraged the men in my day to use the sinew of their bodies in labor, to plow fields, to harvest, to organize. I wasn't very fond of those frontier bone surgeons; I thought they generally did more harm than good. Lawyers were even a greater bane to me. I had very little use for them. They simply tried to make white black, and black white. To be sure, lawyers had their place, but I could not find it. Merchants to me in those day scored no higher. I never could, in the poorest day I ever saw in my life, descend to low as to stand behind a counter. Taking that class of man as a whole, I think that they are of extremely small caliber. The problem was several fold. Commercial profits drained Zion's precious capital resources and often placed wealth at the disposal of enemies. Moreover, merchants were always seeking a chance to buy a widow's cow for ten cents on the dollar rather than the real cash value. Then, after having made the purchase, they thanked the Lord that he had so blessed them.<br><br>The fundamental reason for my dislike for doctors, lawyers, and merchants in an ideal society in those days was that they were not producers of real wealth. I always believed that the labor of bone, sinew, nerve, and muscle was to be used to transform the natural resources into usable products--a contrast to those who live by their wits and only earn the scorn of mankind. Such a man never did a good thing to produce a morsel of bread. He never took pains to raise a goose, a duck, a lamb, or a sheep. No, he never did anything useful, but still he eats, drinks, wears, and lives in luxury. In the name of common sense, what use is such a man? My policy is to see that every man, woman, and child is busily employed, that there is no idle time for hatching mischief in the night or making plans to accomplish their own ruin. I do not believe in giving to the idler, for it is as wicked as anything else.<br><br>I recommend physical labor balanced with mental activity. Then you will enjoy health and vigor! My encouragement is to learn, learn, learn, and continue to learn, to study by observation and from all good books. Study the gospel and what it means to us in our lives. (Extracted from<i>Brigham Young on the Social Order</i>by associate professor Ronald W. Walker at Brigham Young University.)<br><br>I shall not cease learning! I did not while I lived on this earth, and I will not in the spirit world where I shall learn with greater facility. And when I again receive my body, I shall learn a thousand times more. I will never cease learning because I must continue in my research. We shall never see the time when we shall not need to be taught, or when there is not a need for an object to be gained. I never expect to see the time when there will not be a superior power or superior knowledge and, consequently, incitement for further progress and further improvement.<br><br>If I do not learn what is in this world from the first to the last, someone will be wiser than I am. I intend to know the whole of it, both the good and the bad. Shall I practice evil? No, neither have I told you to practice it, but to learn by the light of truth every principle that exists in the world. We need constant instruction, and our great Heavenly Father requires of us to be diligent pupils in school, that we may in time reach his glorified presence. If we will not lay to heart the rules of education that our Teacher gives us to study, and continue to advance from one branch of learning to another, we can never be scholars of the first class and become endowed with the science, power, excellency, brightness, and glory of the heavenly hosts; and unless we are educated as they are, we cannot associate with them. (See<i>DBY</i>, chapter 22, Education.)<br><br><b>Elder Perry:</b>Let me see if I can understand what you are saying to us of this generation. It is all right to be a doctor, lawyer, merchant, or chief, or homemaker, but do not allow our society to shift entirely into service-oriented occupations. Man cannot exist on service only. The majority of our efforts must be directed toward taking the raw materials the Lord has blessed his children with in such abundance and fashioning this material into something productive for the use of mankind.<br><br>It would be true whether it be a nation, a region, or a household. We cannot rely on the microwave and the frozen food section of the grocery store to supply all of the nourishment we need to support life. We cannot allow all of our basic industries to go to foreign shores and still remain independent and free. We must retain our ability to use our hands and our heads to fashion and produce finished goods required for our wants and our needs. Certainly as individuals we need to learn how to cook, to sew, to build, repair, plant, and harvest. We need to experience the fulfillment that comes from producing a product fashioned of the labor or our own hands. This is an essential part of our education, along with the preparation for our chosen professions. Now, President Young, are there any other words of counsel you would like to leave with us here tonight?<br><br><b>Brigham Young:</b>Oh, there are many things I would like to say to this great group of young people here tonight. Perhaps I could take time to counsel you on just one more subject.<br><br>Beauty must be sought in the expression of the countenance, combined with neatness and cleanliness and graceful manners. Anything is ridiculous, more or less, that is not comely.<br><br>Create your own fashions. Make your own clothes to please yourselves, independent of outside influences. Make your hats and your bonnets to shade you. I wish you sisters would take this counsel. Place yourself in the condition of using your own hands and your own talents to create the clothing that you wear.<br><br>The Lord instructs us in a revelation to let our clothing be plain. "Let all thy garments be plain, and their beauty the beauty of the work of thine own hands" (D&amp;amp;C 42:40). He never said to us, "Do not make a silk or satin ribbon, or fine broadcloth." But he has said to us, "Make the articles of clothing that you wear." If you do not, you shall find by and by that you will not be able to get them.<br><br>If my mother and her grandmother got one silk dress, and they lived to a hundred years old, it was all that they wanted. I think my grandmother's silk dress came down to her children. She put her silk dress on when I went to see her. It was, I think, her wedding dress, and she had been married some seventy years. That which is convenient should be beautiful.<br><br>As for fashion, it does not trouble me. My fashion is convenience and comfort. (See<i>DBY</i>, chapter 18, Some Womanly Duties.)<br><br>The "ding-dong" fashions of my day were a bane to me. I would rather see an Indian maiden go through the street with very little on than to see clothing piled up until it reaches, perhaps, the top of a hedge or a fence as the wearer is passing by. In my feeling, it is positively ridiculous, and these fashions are useless and unbecoming. Do you recall the fashions of my day when a woman could not walk through the street without holding her clothing two feet in front of her if her arms were long enough? I wondered if some of those skirts did not, in fact, conceal a six-horse team with a dozen dogs under the wagon. Then it changed. Then they had humps on their backs. And some of the men were just as bad--one-half of their hats covered with feathers and the other half with a cockade, and frills up and down the sleeves of their coats and the legs of their pantaloons!<br><br>Keep your clothing so that it is comfortable, useful, and becoming to you. Follow the fashions that are appropriate for sons and daughters of the Lord. (Extracted from<i>Brigham Young on the Social Order</i>by Ronald W. Walker.)<br><br><b>Elder Perry:</b>President Young, I know that our appearance has always been important to our Eternal Father. It seems to me a true statement that we act the way we dress. People are quick to form first impressions of us as a great result of our dress and grooming standards. When we came up out of the waters of baptism, we made a visible statement of the world that we are followers of our Lord and Savior. Our very appearance should carry that message. Immodest, revealing clothing is not appropriate before the Lord, whether it be for dancing, for swimming, for school, or for work. Improper grooming and dressing immediately sends forth a signal of our being cheap, careless, or slothful. A modest, well-groomed, properly dressed person sends forth a signal that commands respect, admiration, regard, and esteem.<br><br>There is really only one image we should show to the world after we become members of the Lord's church, and that is an image of modesty with proper grooming and dress. Let us have the courage to have a proper style of our own and not be persuaded to adopt worldly fashions of this day.<br><br>President Young, now I think it would be proper for you to leave your testimony with us as we conclude this meeting tonight.<br><br><b>Brigham Young:</b><i>My testimony is positive. I know that there are such cities as London, Paris, and New York--from my own experience or from that of others; I know that the sun shines, I know that I exist and have a being, and I testify that there is a God, and that Jesus Christ lives, and that he is the Savior of the world. Have you been to heaven and learned to the contrary? I know that Joseph Smith was a Prophet of God, and that he had many revelations. Who can disprove this testimony? Any one may dispute it, but there is no one in the world who can disprove it. I have had many revelations; I have seen and heard for myself, and know these things are true, and nobody on earth can disprove them. The eye, the ear, the hand, all the senses may be deceived, but the Spirit of God cannot be deceived; and when inspired with that Spirit, the whole man is filled with knowledge, he can see with a spiritual eye, and he knows that which is beyond the power of man to controvert. What I know concerning God, concerning the earth, concerning government, I have received from the heavens, not alone through my natural ability, and I give God the glory and the praise. Men talk about what has been accomplished under my direction, and attribute it to my wisdom and ability; but it is all by the power of God, and by intelligence received from him. I say to the whole world, receive the truth, no matter who presents it to you.</i>[<i>DBY</i>, pp. 433–434]<br><br><b>Elder Perry:</b>Thank you for that testimony, Brother Brigham.<br><br>In our mind's eye we can see Brigham Young here tonight stepping to the pulpit. His presence was always dominating. When he spoke women would arouse themselves in expectation, men stopped their noisemaking. Typically, his first words were almost inaudible, but warming to the subject he soon achieved fluency and control. His manner was effective, but impromptu, spoken rather than preached. The scene was produced hundreds, perhaps thousands of times, as the Saints gathered in the West.<br><br>Ralph Rogers, thank you for taking the part of Brigham Young for us here tonight. Your great talent has been enjoyed by the Saints in so many different places. It is good to have you back in Utah after your outstanding direction of the Polynesian Cultural Center in Hawaii for the past few years. We are looking forward to seeing you many, many times as we have the opportunity to have you back in our great and noble state.<br><br>Please accept my sincere appreciation for your assistance in this eighteen-stake fireside.<br><br>Now, to the testimony of Brigham Young, I humbly add mine. God lives! Jesus is the Christ, the Savor of the world! We are engaged in his work as members of his Church. May God bless us to have the courage and the will to build his kingdom here on earth, I humbly pray in the name of our Lord and Savior, Jesus the Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>L.

<h1>ip—Jesus was the Perfect Leader - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
The first time I was asked to speak in the tabernacle some twelve years ago, Elder Paul Dunn told me that if I could just get rid of the little cotton man, the one who puts cotton balls in your mouth when you get up to speak in the tabernacle, I'd be okay. I'm still struggling with him, and I pray for your faith and prayers this morning.<br><br>It is an awesome responsibility to be here. I've told many today, as I've told many over the years, that I prefer a smaller setting. I enjoy being in a classroom situation with a smaller group where interaction can take place.<br><br>With leadership in attendance here from outlying areas, I would like to thank you all, on behalf of all the Brethren, for the things you do for us when we attend your conferences--your gentleness, your accepting us, your spirit. We come home every weekend feeling the Spirit of our Father in Heaven. Someone once asked us how we get recharged. We say, "By going into the field and bonding with the Latter-day Saints wherever they are. We come back filled with the Spirit." We thank you this day.<br><br>The subject I would like to talk about today is sacred and central to all we do. A little story about President Spencer W. Kimball illustrates the point. President Kimball was being wheeled into an operating room for one of his many operations, and one of the orderlies took the name of the Lord Jesus Christ in vain. Even though President Kimball was under sedation, he rose up and told the orderly not to take the name of his Savior in vain, for he was his<br><br>friend and the Savior of the world.<br><br>I would like to say a few words today about the Lord Jesus Christ, the perfect leader. In 1968 at a general conference, President David O. McKay said this about Christ's example of leadership:<br><br><i>Now a word to you officers and leaders in the stakes and wards, in missions, and in temples. It was the divine character of Jesus that drew the women of Palestine to him, that drew as a magnet the little children to him. It was the divine personality which attracted men, honest men, pure men. It was also that divine personality which antagonized the impure, the evil men and women.</i><br><br><i>In the realm of personality, and in the kingdom of character, Christ was supreme. By personality, I mean all that may be included in individuality. Personality is a gift from God; it is indeed a "pearl of great price," an eternal blessing.</i>[<i>CR,</i>October 1968, pp. 143–44; or "Spirituality in Leading and Teaching the Gospel,"<i>Ensign,</i>December 1968, p. 108]<br><h2><b>The Cosmic View</b></h2><br>Jesus Christ was the supreme leader about whom not enough can ever be said. His task was to lead all people back to their Father in Heaven, to give us all the unlimited potential of eternal life and its blessings. We almost walk on sacred ground as we approach any phase of his life, his character, his personality, his atonement for us, and his leadership in bringing it all about. Not enough can ever be said or done about this Elder Brother of ours, the Holy One of Israel. His majesty and leadership transcend the loftiest of our thoughts and actions. He was, and is, the central figure in the creation of this earth, our placement upon it, and all the things that involve us. He was not just a manager of all of this, but was the leader, the initiator. By inspiration and direction from his Heavenly Father, he has led us.<br><br>Imagine the problem first and then the painstaking plan to affect all the children of God--the plan of God. Life would be divided into three essential parts:<br><br>1. A premortal life when we were in the presence of our Father in Heaven and his Son and would progress as far as we could go there.<br><br>2. An earth life when the children of God would come to earth to work out their probation, looking for a model along the way, an example, the sure way.<br><br>3. Then the postmortal life, where eternal opportunities, accountability, and blessings would be given.<br><br>Imagine the logistics and the principles involved in guiding the billions of his sons and daughters through the process from having them shout for joy just to come to earth to making the actual move. Many of us have a hard time moving from one residence to another, let alone building a habitation in which to live, establishing eternal truths to guide the earthly family, managing and handling the trillions and trillions of actions that would run counter to the plan of God and that would frustrate nearly every righteous human effort, and then providing absolute justice and mercy for all (not always immediate, but always certain).<br><br>Think of the plan of God in its review and acceptance by us in the council in heaven (of course, God knew of its value and efficacy before it was ever presented). It was accepted. Jesus our Brother was accepted. This same Jesus knew what his part would be: the Creator of this mortal habitation, the Lamb, the Redeemer, the Mediator between all the children of God and their Father in Heaven, the One who would atone for us, the sure Guide--absolute in every way, and the Leader in all dimensions. Now contemplate his leadership over the centuries: the creation of the earth and all things thereon, even man and woman; his counsel and communication with the Old Testament and Book of Mormon prophets; his prophecies about his own coming forth to be the Firstborn of God; his leadership among the people; his example; his establishment of truth; his church; and the ordinances. Any one of these would be overwhelming to contemplate with the mortal mind--his great service for all humankind, his atonement for all the children of God.<br><br>All through the centuries he was involved in preparing everything to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of all men and women, living and dead. Those years were spent in leading behind the scenes and also in preparing to lead personally.<br><br>I would like to share with you an experience I had with one small dimension of his efforts to lead a wayward son. A year and a half ago, I was assigned to go to a stake conference in New Mexico. The normal route would have been to fly to Albuquerque, rent a car, and drive to Grants, where the conference was to be held. But for some reason I was impressed that I must go to Gallup and get a car there. It had meant taking a little tiny plane. I was the only passenger on the plane with two pilots. It was a terribly windy day, and I wasn't sure we were going to arrive.<br><br>When we arrived safely at Gallup, I was very, very happy to land. I went into the airport, took out my driver's license, and put it on the desk to pick up my car. The gentleman there said, "Mr. Paramore, I'm sorry, I can't let you have a car."<br><br>"Why not?" I asked.<br><br>"Your driver's license has expired."<br><br>It had expired a week earlier on my birthday! What was I going to do? I picked up the phone and called the local bishop. He was on his way out the door to perform a marriage ceremony. I told him I was Elder Paramore, and he said, "Who?"<br><br>I told him again and I'm not sure he believed it.<br><br>He replied, "I'll see what I can do."<br><br>But I knew he didn't believe that I was there because he said, "We don't have a conference here today. What are you doing in Gallup?" I was out of my pattern; I was out of the route that I should have taken.<br><br>Sitting over in the corner of the room was a young man with his teenage son. He was dressed in tank top and construction clothes and had long clean hair. He came over to the desk, and he said, "I understand you are in a little trouble. I just came by to get some applications to take flying lessons, and I couldn't help hearing that you need help. Could I take you somewhere?"<br><br>I said, "You would be a great Christian if you could." I explained my dilemma.<br><br>"You buy my gas," he said, "and I'll drive you over." We had sixty miles to go. So we got in his old, old worn-out car, filled with junk, and we started toward Grants, New Mexico.<br><br>On the way, I asked what every Latter-day Saint would ask:<br><br>"What do you know about the Mormons?"<br><br>"Have you ever been to Salt Lake City?"<br><br>"Have you ever read the Book of Mormon?"<br><br>To all of them the answers were affirmative.<br><br>When I asked him if he knew the Book of Mormon was true, there was a long, long pause. Finally he responded by saying, "I'm an elder in the Church, and two years ago my wife left me and my two children for another man. I was a member of the branch presidency where I live. The members of my branch cut me off and blamed me for the departure of my wife. We've never been able to go back to church because of those feelings.<br><br>"Do I know if the Book of Mormon is true, Brother Paramore? (I knew who you were.) I've read the Book of Mormon many times, and I know it's as true as anything on this earth."<br><br>In the hour and a half that passed as I rode with him to Grants, I began to see that I was sitting in the presence of a great man of God; that he knew the gospel is just as true as I did; that he had been deeply hurt by some of the members, and he hadn't been back among them. We had a wonderful conversation, including a discussion of his son some day going on a mission. I've written him every week, sent him copies of the<i>Church News</i>every week, and given him other things to read. He is making great progress. Now, think about it. There are five billion people upon the earth, and here was one man out in the wilderness about whom the Lord was concerned. So he sent a General Authority, all unknowing, out of his way, redirecting his path. It could have been anyone, but it happened to be me. And when I came home that day, I knew that God loves all his children.<br><h2><b>Jesus Christ, the Perfect Leader</b></h2><br>Jesus is the perfect leader. How he does all that he does, I don't know. But he is the perfect leader. Jesus taught us that good leaders show us what we should do and then create an environment in which we can do it. Let me read you a scripture from Nephi's record of the Savior's words:<br><br><i>And as I have prayed among you even so shall ye pray in my church, among my people who do repent and are baptized in my name. Behold I am the light; I have set an example for you.</i>[3 Nephi 18:16]<br><br>And in Matthew:<br><br><i>And he saith unto them, Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men.</i>[Matthew 4:19]<br><br>I've been on hand several times when prophets have been sustained. When President Lee and President Kimball were sustained, I was the recorder, and I was sitting on the stand watching them. I watched President Benson also. I remember their words: "Jesus Christ is at the helm in this church; he is the head of this church. Yes, I know I am the prophet, but Jesus of Nazareth leads this church; he is at the helm; he presides."<br><br>There are several characteristics of leadership that the Savior demonstrated that I would like to talk about, but I will just mention a few.<br><h2><b>Jesus Loves His Father and Each of Us</b></h2><br>Jesus Christ was motivated by love, love of God and a love for us, his brothers and sisters. You remember the classic statement in Matthew that lays this attribute as the cornerstone for everything:<br><br><i>Then one of them, which was a lawyer, asked him a question, tempting him, and saying,</i><br><br><i>Master, which is the great commandment in the law?</i><br><br><i>Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind.</i><br><br><i>This is the first and great commandment.</i><br><br><i>And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.</i><br><br><i>On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.</i>[Matthew 22:35–40]<br><br>That love is cardinal, and it is in first place among all the things that he, as our leader, would have us know. God sent Jesus to the earth as an expression of his love. Jesus' atonement for all of us was motivated by love: "Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends" (John 15:13).<br><br>Can anyone of us imagine the feelings of God in those last hours of Jesus' life, when this beloved Son was going through agonizing pain beyond anything anyone had ever experienced before? Jesus seeks to lead us to this kind of love, as recorded in John:<br><br><i>A new commandment I give unto you, That ye love one another; as I have loved you, that ye also love one another.</i>[John 13:34]<br><br>We love each other in this kingdom. A Latter-day Saint should never be a trial to another Latter-day Saint. A Latter-day Saint is one who makes goodness look attractive, makes love an integral part of every thought, word, and action.<br><h2><b>Jesus Carried Out His Father's Will</b></h2><br>Next, Jesus did the will of his Father:<br><br><i>But, behold, my Beloved Son, which was my Beloved and Chosen from the beginning, said unto me--Father, thy will be done, and the glory be thine forever.</i>[Moses 4:2]<br><br>Unlike Satan, he wanted to do the will of his Father. It's important to focus on that point because there are many implications. For those who want to do the Father's will, it is easy to be led by a prophet. It is easy to be led by a righteous father or mother or by a bishop who is doing everything he can do to help build the kingdom. Jesus further declared, "My doctrine is not mine, but his that sent me" (John 7:16), and much later, in his extremity, "he went a little further, and fell on his face, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless not as I will, but as thou wilt" (Matthew 26:39).<br><br>There is an example from the life of one of our latter-day prophets that I would like to share with you today, an example of following the will of our Heavenly Father. How many times do we have the opportunity to make that kind of decision, to determine whether we will follow God or mammon? It is cardinal to our progression. It is cardinal to having the Spirit with us. It is cardinal to personal righteousness. It is cardinal to becoming of one mind and one heart in this kingdom.<br><br><i>"On Sunday the 4th day of June 1837," says Heber C. Kimball, "the Prophet Joseph came to me, while I was seated in front of the stand, above the sacrament table, on the Melchizedek side of the Temple, in Kirtland, and whispering to me, said, 'Brother Heber, the Spirit of the Lord has whispered to me: "Let my servant Heber go to England and proclaim my Gospel, and open the door of salvation to that nation."'"</i><br><br>Imagine what happened after this prompting by the Lord.<br><br><i>The day of departure came; Tuesday, June 13, 1837. The solemn scene of Heber's parting with his family cannot be more tenderly or graphically told than in the words of Elder Robert B. Thompson, who thus describes it:</i><br><br><i>"The day appointed for the departure of the Elders to England having arrived, I stepped into the house of Brother Kimball to ascertain when he would start, as I expected to accompany him two or three hundred miles, intending to spend my labors in Canada that season.</i><br><br><i>"The door being partly opened, I entered and felt struck with the sight which presented itself to my view. I would have retired, thinking that I was intruding, but I felt riveted to the spot. The father was pouring out his soul to that 'God who rules on high, Who all the earth surveys: That rides upon the stormy sky, And calms the roaring seas,' that he would grant him a prosperous voyage across the mighty ocean, and make him useful wherever his lot should be cast, and that He who 'careth for sparrows, and feedeth the young ravens when they cry' would supply the wants of his wife and the little ones in his absence. He then, like the patriarchs, and by virtue of his office, laid his hands upon their heads individually, leaving a father's blessing upon them, and commending them to the care and protection of God, while he should be engaged preaching the Gospel in a foreign land. While thus engaged his voice was almost lost in the sobs of those around, who tried in vain to suppress them. The idea of being separated from their protector and father for so long a time was indeed painful. He proceeded, but his heart was too much affected to do so regularly. His emotions were great, and he was obliged to stop at intervals, while the big tears rolled down his cheeks, an index to the feelings which reigned in his bosom. My heart was not stout enough to refrain; in spite of myself I wept, and mingled my tears with theirs. At the same time I felt thankful that I had the privilege of contemplating such a scene. I realized that nothing could induce that man to tear himself from so affectionate a family group, from his partner and children who were so dear to him--nothing but a sense of duty and love to God and attachment to His cause."</i>[Orson F. Whitney,<i>Life of Heber C</i>.<i>Kimball</i>(Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1967), pp. 103, 108–9]<br><h2><b>Jesus Taught with Authority</b></h2><br>Jesus taught his followers "as one having authority, and not as the scribes" (Matthew 7:29). Mark tells us:<br><br><i>Now after that John was put in prison, Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God,</i><br><br><i>And saying, The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand: repent ye, and believe the gospel.</i>. . .<br><br><i>And they went into Capernaum; and straightway on the sabbath day he entered into the synagogue, and taught.</i>[Mark 1:14–15, 21]<br><br>And he taught through stories and examples. He matched the illustrations to the needs of the people and built his lessons upon things they knew and understood.<br><br>Think of Luke 15. It is a short chapter, but in it Luke records three wonderful parables used by the Savior--the prodigal son, the lost sheep, and the lost coin--to describe how important it is to bring someone back into the arms of God.<br><br>President David O. McKay stated:<br><br><i>No matter how attractive the personality may be, that leader or teacher fails in the work assigned if the leader or teacher directs the love of the member only to the personality of the leader or teacher. It is the leader's duty, or the teacher's duty, to teach the member to love-- not the leader or teacher, but the truth of the gospel. Always, everywhere, we find Christ losing himself for his Father's will; and so also should our leaders and teachers, so far as their personalities are concerned, lose themselves for the truth he desires to have them teach.</i><br><br><i>When the people came to Jesus and asked for bread, or the truth, he never turned them away with a stone. He always had truth to give. He understood it. It radiated from his being. He understood how to use illustrations, the natural things around him, to impress that truth upon his hearers. In other words, he was filled with his subject and then was enabled to give that subject to his hearers.</i>[<i>CR,</i>October 1968, p. 143; or "Spirituality,"<i>Ensign,</i>December 1968, pp. 108–9]<br><br>Now look at our current prophet, President Ezra Taft Benson, and how he has taught us to know, use, and give the blessings of the Book of Mormon to the world. I'll never forget his first remarks to the General Authorities after he was called as prophet. He said to us: "Brethren, I've read many of your talks again, and they are wonderful, but you don't use the Book of Mormon enough. May I ask you to know it and use it more, to testify of it to the world, and to have it go into every corner of the world." His words and counsel were profound and needed as he did his Father's will. We walked back from that temple meeting sobered.<br><br>I remember who I was walking with, and I remember what I was thinking. I remember that, as director over audiovisuals in the Church, I needed to do something about putting the Book of Mormon on tape into the lives of people. They needed to understand the blessings of the Book of Mormon. Thus began a two-year experience that ended in a great video that we have in our libraries today.<br><br>Today, ten times as many copies of the Book of Mormon are sent to the world every year than ever before. And today, instead of having the Book of Mormon and other scriptures translated into thirty-five languages, President Benson has set an objective to have them translated into all the major languages by the year 2000. So there are translators around the country doing the work of translation in about eighty languages. He is a prophet of God, not afraid to tell the truth, not afraid to challenge the people, not afraid to teach what he has been called to teach in his gentle, loving, supportive way.<br><h2><b>Jesus Used Leadership Skills</b></h2><br>Yes, Jesus taught his followers personally. But he also used leadership skills. No coercion, but gentleness, meekness, kindness--just a simple "Come, follow me." He listened. Remember the story of the adulterous woman?<br><br><i>They say unto him, Master, this woman was taken in adultery, in the very act.</i><br><br><i>Now Moses in the law commanded us, that such should be stoned: but what sayest thou?</i><br><br><i>This they said, tempting him, that they might have to accuse him. But Jesus stooped down, and with his finger wrote on the ground, as though he heard them not.</i><br><br><i>So when they continued asking him, he lifted up himself, and said unto them, He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her.</i>[John 8:4–7]<br><br>President Kimball has left us some wonderful thoughts about Christ's leadership:<br><br><i>Jesus knew who he was and why he was here on this planet. That meant he could lead from strength rather than from uncertainty or weakness.</i><br><br><i>Jesus operated from a base of fixed principles or truths rather than making up the rules as he went along. Thus, his leadership style was not only correct but constant.</i>. . .<br><br><i>Jesus said several times, "Come, follow me." His was a program of "do what I do," rather than "do what I say." His innate brilliance would have permitted him to put on a dazzling display, but that would have left his followers far behind. He walked and worked with those he was to serve. His was not a long-distance leadership. He was not afraid of close friendships; he was not afraid that proximity to him would disappoint his followers. The leaven of true leadership cannot lift others unless we are with and serve those to be led.</i>. . .<br><br><i>Jesus was a listening leader. Because he loved others with a perfect love, he listened without being condescending.</i>. . .<br><br><i>Because Jesus loved his followers, he was able to level with them, to be candid and forthright with them.</i>. . .<br><br><i>Jesus saw sin as wrong but also was able to see sin as springing from deep and unmet needs on the part of the sinner. This permitted him to condemn the sin without condemning the individual. We can show forth our love for others even when we are called upon to correct them. We need to be able to look deeply enough into the lives of others to see the basic causes for their failures and shortcomings.</i>[<i>TSWK,</i>pp. 481–82]<br><br>President Kimball has given us many other thoughts. Let me just read one or two others.<br><br><i>Jesus trusts his followers enough to share his work with them so that they can grow.</i>. . .<br><br><i>Jesus was not afraid to make demands of those he led. His leadership was not condescending or soft.</i>[<i>TSWK,</i>p. 482]<br><br>I remember an experience President Kimball had with the navy chief of chaplains a few years ago. We invite military chiefs of chaplains to visit Church headquarters so we can continue our wonderful relationship with them and maintain our chaplaincies throughout the services. It was this chaplain's first trip to the Church. He came, and Elder Hanks was with him. They saw the various leaders, they came to BYU, they went to Temple Square. They saw what we were doing with the chaplaincy, and finally they were to meet with the prophet, Spencer W. Kimball. At that time we were trying desperately to get more navy chaplains. President Kimball had been trying for years, and so had the other Brethren, without success. The two of them had a wonderful talk; it went on for about an hour. Four or five times during the conversation this navy chief of chaplains said, "President, is there anything we can do for you?"<br><br>President Kimball said, "No, I don't think so. We just love our servicemen and women so much we want to do everything we can for them."<br><br>The chaplain went on talking and then asked again, "Well, isn't there something I can do?"<br><br>Finally, the chief of chaplains said, "Well, would it be of any help if we let you have more chaplains in the United States Navy?"<br><br>President Kimball replied, "I think that would be just wonderful if that is what you would like to do."<br><br>A perfect example of never demanding, but inviting. And when he walked out of that building with Elder Hanks that day and stopped on the front steps of the Church Office Building, this man, who would be a counterpart to an archbishop in his Catholic church, looked at Elder Hanks and said, "There is a holy man of God."<br><br>Elder Hanks said, "He is a wonderful man."<br><br>And he replied, "Elder Hanks, that is not what I said. He is a holy man of God."<br><h2><b>Jesus Set an Example of Personal Righteousness</b></h2><br>Think about Christ's leadership style and all the things he did--his being with the people constantly. He set an example of personal righteousness. His righteousness was the thing that drew people to him. He was ever a minister to his people. He said these words:<br><br><i>Ye know that the princes of the Gentiles exercise dominion over them, and they that are great exercise authority upon them.</i><br><br><i>But it shall not be so among you: but whosoever will be great among you, let him be your minister.</i>[Matthew 20:25–26]<br><br>And the Savior said to Paul on the road to Damascus:<br><br><i>But rise, and stand upon thy feet: for I have appeared unto thee for this purpose, to make thee a minister and a witness both of these things which thou hast seen, and of those things in the which I shall appear unto thee.</i>[Acts 26:16]<br><h2><b>An Example of His Loving Leadership</b></h2><br>Jesus, the perfect leader! We could conduct seminars about Jesus in all the classes that you are attending during this week--about each of these dimensions and hundreds of others. I would just say in closing, he loved the Lord, he loved his fellowmen, he loved being with them. It was never a strain for him to be with them.<br><br>When you read 3 Nephi 17:3, 5–18, you find that, after a long day, Jesus finally exhorted the people, "Go ye unto your homes, and ponder upon the things which I have said, and ask of the Father, in my name, that ye may understand, and prepare your minds for the morrow, and I come unto you again." But the people didn't want to leave, and he sensed that they didn't. And so he said, "Bring all your sick to me." And so all the sick, the lame, the infirm were brought, and each one was healed. After that he asked, "Where are your little children?" They brought all the little children to him, and after awhile he set them on the ground. Then he knelt down on the ground by them and talked to them and ministered unto them. It was such a wonderful day that the heavens were parted, and the angels came out of heaven, blessing this day, giving acknowledgment to this super-wonderful Elder Brother of ours.<br><h2><b>Another Example of Christlike Leadership</b></h2><br>In conclusion, I'd like to tell you about a man I've met who lives in the Magna Central Stake. About a year ago I went to his stake conference, and in an evening meeting on Saturday they had a video about this man, John Cash. It was a video about a man who is paralyzed from the neck down, a quadriplegic. I could not believe what I was seeing. He was a man who, at age 27, just recently out of military service, had gone to work for Kennecott Copper. He was working up in one of the high areas and fell thirty-five feet. Because of that fall he became paralyzed. For thirty-one years he has lived in his bed. His legs and his hands are so malformed now that it tears you apart when you visit him.<br><br>He knew nothing about Christ, he knew nothing about the Church, and he knew nothing about righteousness when he had that fall. But little by little he began to study the words of his great Leader, his great Teacher. He began to take them into his life, think about them, and pray about them. He became active in the Church. In the early years they were able to take him in a wheelchair to the house of the Lord.<br><br>For twenty-seven years, beloved brothers and sisters, a paralyzed man has been doing his home teaching to six families every month. He does it over the phone. He has a woman who rings the number, and on the first or second day of every month he calls up his six families: "John, how are you? How is your wife? How are the kiddies? Is there anything I can do for you? I have a little message I would like to leave with you tonight that the prophet has asked us to share with you." While the family listens through their phone receivers, he delivers his message.<br><br>I went over to see him after the conference, I was so touched. I saw his wall. He has a great, big, long wall in the basement where he lives with pictures of missionaries, couples who have been married in the house of the Lord, former Speaker of the House of Representatives "Tip" O'Neill, and many, many others. I learned that every month he writes to every serviceman in the stake. Every month he writes to every missionary. He tells them how Magna is doing in their ball games and all about the community and about the gospel.<br><br>The bishop told me that when they want people to go to the temple, they have John Cash call to invite them to go to the temple. When they want someone to work on the welfare farm, they have Brother John Cash call. Beloved brothers and sisters, he has followed the mandate, the example, of Jesus of Nazareth. He has become a lot like him. He is blessed and accepted by thousands of people who have known him over those twenty-seven years that he has been exercising leadership that is unbelievable.<br><br>May God bless us who have all our faculties and the Spirit. May he bless us to love more, serve more, minister more, teach more, help more than we do. That is the message I would like to leave. I think it is the message that Jesus lived and left and that all the prophets I have known have emulated in their lives. May God bless us. I leave you my personal testimony that I know Jesus is the Savior of the world. I know he loves me and that he loves each of his children. I know he cares about me even when I'm estranged and far away from his immediate watchcare. May God bless us to think about this, this day and always, I humbly pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>James M.

<h1>ome to BYU - Janet G. Lee - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
You cannot imagine how happy I am to be here with you. Rex and I both feel that we have come "home"--that this is where we belong. It is about feeling at home and belonging that I would like to speak today.<br><br>Throughout your lives, you will probably live in many homes. I have lived in twenty. However, I will tell you about only three of them--the places I lived during my four years at BYU. My memories of that period of time were awakened by an experience I had Friday morning as I jogged with Rex across parts of this campus.<br><br>It was a beautiful, crisp morning, with the sun just peeking over the mountains. I was full of energy and determined to run past three destinations-my BYU student homes: Heritage Halls, Knight Mangum Hall, and an apartment on 800 East, just a block or so from Alexander's Print Shop, which was, for years, a popular snack shop called Rowley's.<br><br>My run down memory lane was in reverse of the chronological order I just listed. Passing the site of the apartment where Rex and I lived as newlyweds, I was saddened to see that it had been torn down to make way for a condominium. Nevertheless, my nostalgia was undaunted. Dozens of feelings flooded over me as I remembered what it felt like to worry about getting good grades, writing papers, preparing dinners on a very small budget, and helping Rex decide to which law schools he should apply.<br><br>At that point in our run, Rex had to leave me to attend an early morning meeting, so I continued alone. A short distance from where our apartment had been, I came to the old Knight Mangum Hall, known to you as the math lab, which was my home for two years. It seemed such a short time ago that Rex picked me up there for our very first date. (I can remember thinking that it would also be our last, but that is another story for a different talk.)<br><br>Now I was running slightly uphill, and as I approached Heritage Halls, I watched students rushing, almost frantically, to get to their eight o'clock classes on time. For some reason, watching you at that moment unlocked the floodgates for me. All of my emotions came pouring out; I could remember just how it felt to be a student during those first weeks of school. I could remember feelings of apprehension, inadequacy, frustration, and homesickness, mixed with feelings of excitement, anticipation, eagerness, and joy. You see, I was a freshman when I lived at Heritage Halls.<br><br>As I passed by Elsie Carroll Hall, my eyes swelled with warm tears. I could remember trying to adjust to roommates, attempting to manage my time, forcing myself to study in between classes instead of staying up late at night, and worrying about whether I would have dates on weekends.<br><br>Thinking about all of this filled me with a strong desire to stop and hug you in your rush to class--to share some of my thoughts with you and maybe offer a little advice. Can you imagine how you would have felt if this tearful, middle-aged woman in sweats and running shoes had done just that?<br><br>I resisted the urge, but today, now that I have showered, dried my tears, and am standing here with your full attention, I am going to tell you what I would have said then about home and belonging.<br><br>In your quest to complete each semester, to get that degree, to find that perfect someone to love, to prepare for whatever is ahead, savor the rightness of this time in your life. Do what is right for you now, feel at home and at peace along the path in your struggle to get where you are going.<br><br>At times in my life I have spent too much time longing for things I did not have. I wonder what it was I was homesick for as a freshman. Was it my house or my backyard patio? Was it my comfortable bed or my very own closet? Was it my friends and family? I was probably missing all of these things, but what has taken me some time to realize is that my longing was for the comfort that comes from being in the right place at the right time, of knowing that I am where my Father in Heaven wants me to be.<br><br>Our physical surroundings change many times in our lifetimes, and with each change comes a feeling of being off balance until we find our way again--until we feel at home with our new surroundings. If we are listening to the Spirit, we will surround ourselves with truth and goodness in each of our earthly homes, making the pathway to our ultimate heavenly home more direct and attainable.<br><br>In section 84 of the Doctrine and Covenants, verses 46 and 47, the Lord promises:<br><br><i>And the Spirit giveth light to every man that cometh into the world; and the Spirit enlighteneth every man through the world, that hearkeneth to the voice of the Spirit.</i><br><br><i>And everyone that hearkeneth to the voice of the Spirit cometh unto God, even the Father.</i><br><br>Why is it so important for us to feel at home with that which is good and right? Our most important pursuit in this life is to live so that we may return to our heavenly home, to once again live with our Heavenly Father. President Spencer W. Kimball told us that our first responsibility in this mortal life is to prepare to meet God.<br><br>Why is it that we have warm feelings of "home" when we are in the right place at the right time? Perhaps this can best be explained by one of my favorite quotes from C. S. Lewis in<i>Weight of Glory.</i>He wrote, "If we are made in Heaven, the desire for our proper place will be already in us."<br><br>Rex and I feel once again that we have come home. This is not what we had planned, and for the first time in my life a drastic change has not been accompanied by a major move to a faraway place. Thank goodness we will not be moving to home number twenty-one. However, this could possibly be the most important change of our lives. And once again, as during my days in Carroll Hall, Knight Mangum, or on 800 East--and so many times between then and now--it is important to feel at home in the sense we have been talking about: that what we are doing is right. And I know it<i>is</i>right. Not planned, nor anticipated, but right.<br><br>Soon after Rex was asked to be president of BYU, we attended our first eighteen-stake fireside, where we were invited to sit on the stand. As I sat there looking out at the thousands of students before us, the most overwhelming feeling of peace came over me. It seemed to whisper, "This is where you should be. This is where your Father in Heaven wants you to be." All of my doubts fled. I knew Rex felt this, too, as he reached over and took my hand, and in the silent language of soul mates, our hearts were one.<br><br>At that very moment I wished that each one of you could feel what we were feeling, that in the rightness of your own moment in time you would feel the reassuring whisperings of the Spirit, that<i>your</i>spirit would feel that you had come "home" to do what you were meant to do.<br><br>It is my prayer that we will all strive to be in the right place at the right time, that we will live in harmony with the Spirit, which will take us step by step back to our ultimate home with our Heavenly Father. I say this in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Janet G. Lee, wife of Rex E. Lee, gave this devotional address at Brigham Young University on 12 September 1989.</i><br><br><i>© Intellectual Reserve, Inc. All rights reserved.</i>

<h1>ch Is Given: Some Thoughts on Appreciation - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Like you, I rejoice at the beginning of this school year. From the time I began the first grade (Arizona didn't have kindergarten in those days), late August and early September have always been among my favorite times of year, precisely because that is when school starts. Every year since that time, I have always felt the same way, and I feel it in even extra measure this year because for me, as for almost 5,000 of you, the fall of 1989 marks a new chapter in my own educational experience. I have been involved in this school in four different capacities over a period of thirty-six years, but this year, as for thousands of you, I am starting something new and exciting at BYU.<br><h2><b>Appreciating What We Have</b></h2><br>I want to talk to you today about appreciation, about understanding what we have, and about what we ought to do and be because we have it. I will begin by talking to you about two people, neither of whom is here today. One is a member of your generation, and the other belongs to mine.<br><br>A BYU security officer called Thursday evening, August 31, with news that I know I will periodically receive as president of BYU, but which I will always dread--the news of the death of one of our students. As the officer began to give me some of the details, my mind flashed back to my student days. I remembered how President Wilkinson used to agonize over such tragedies--how he and his successors had implored students to drive carefully as they went home for Christmas or for other reasons. And now it was happening to me--the death of a student on my watch. I tried to imagine how some family--father and mother, brothers and sisters--might be feeling at that moment. Where does the family live, I wondered: Roanoke, Virginia; Youngstown, Ohio; Spokane, Washington; Fillmore, Utah; where? As the security officer finished her report, I rather perfunctorily asked the student's name. I was not prepared for the answer: Chris Felsted.<br><br>At that moment my agony turned from general to specific. I no longer had to think about hypothetical parents. I know them: Peter and Karen Felsted--caring, loving parents--devoted Latter-day Saints who have been friends of Janet's and mine for fourteen years. Three hours earlier their oldest son was alive, seemingly robust, and starting BYU with a big head start on a lifetime of future happiness with twenty-four hours of AP credit and $8,000 saved for his mission. But now no more. In a brief, terrible moment all of that was snuffed out. The middle phase of Christian Daniel Felsted's eternal existence had lasted just slightly less than eighteen years.<br><br>The second story is about Terry Crapo, who for twenty-four years, from 1958 to 1982, was one of my closest friends. We graduated from Brigham Young University at the same time and in the same major. We thought alike, we worked in student government together, we had the same long-range career objectives, and most people said we even looked alike.<br><br>Terry was a brilliant lawyer, a remarkably successful father and stake president. Whenever I was involved in something really important, I wanted Terry on my team. When I was the student body president here, he was my executive assistant. Fifteen years later, I recruited him for the Law School faculty, where he was voted professor of the year. And in the summer of 1982, after I had been the solicitor general for about a year, I was making arrangements to bring Terry to Washington to work as my deputy.<br><br>But then, another phone call--seven years earlier than the one I received twelve days ago. It was from Elder Hugh Pinnock, informing me that Terry had cancer. Cancer. A dreadful word. My conversation with Terry right after I received that phone call was our last in this life. Less than two weeks later, he was dead.<br><br>For days I could not accept that it had really happened. This was Terry Crapo. He was my height, my weight, we looked alike, our families were about the same age, we were both lawyers, both loved life, our families, the gospel, and each other. I have had other friends to whom I have felt as close as Terry, but none with whom I personally identified quite so completely. He just couldn't be dead. For several days I kept hoping that somehow, as my friend Lisa Hawkins said in a poem composed for Terry's funeral, he would, Tom Sawyer-like, come back and surprise us all. But he didn't. He had forty-four very good years in this mortal existence, but that was all.<br><br>I have had another reaction to Terry's passing that, unlike the first, has endured and had a rather profound influence on me. Terry is gone and I am not. This spiritual, philosophical, and emotional twin of mine had only forty-four years here. Every year that I have beyond that number is a bonus. So make the most of everyone of those. No point asking why those bonus years were given to me rather than to Terry. The fact is they were, so I must do something with them.<br><br>The same is true, of course, for you. Most of you were not as close to your classmate, Chris Felsted, as I was to Terry Crapo, but that does not diminish the point. Leave aside for now why it is that bad things happen to good people, or why it is that you and I are still here while Terry Crapo and Chris Felsted are not. (Aspects of those issues, incidentally, are what Janet and I intend jointly to discuss with you next January.) But for today, the point is that you and I are still here, living our lives and experiencing the joys of this existence while one of the choicest people in my generation and one of the best in yours are not. What message does that fact carry for you and for me?<br><br>It is one of the sad ironies of human behavior that we really don't appreciate some of life's advantages like we should unless and until we are forced to spend some time without them. Recall Nephi's profound statement: "For it must needs be, that there is an opposition in all things" (2 Nephi 2:11). I doubt that very many of you wake up each morning full of gratitude for electricity. But occasionally we are without it for a couple of hours, as we were on this campus one cold morning last February. When that happens, we appreciate electricity much more. For maybe the rest of the day.<br><br>About twelve years ago I became a runner, and since that time it has been one of the truly pleasurable and positive aspects of my life. But my appreciation of that activity has been increased immeasurably because on three separate occasions over those twelve years, twice because of ankle injuries and once because of cancer, I have had to go without it for rather extended periods.<br><br>Some variant of that basic experience pattern has occurred in every one of your lives. When you have an illness, even something as simple as a cold, you find yourselves longing for the times when you were healthy, and wondering why you didn't appreciate those times more fully. Your appreciation for food is never quite as high as it is on the first Sunday of each month. For many of us, reading assignments are a pain. Do you suppose we would look at them a little differently if we were blind?<br><br>Sometimes, temporary deprivations can change those attitudes, and sometimes they don't. A cold or some other fairly short-range, minor illness is the classic example. Time after time, during one of those down periods, I remind myself what a contrast there is between good health and bad health, and I vow that once the good times come back, I will appreciate them for what they are. But those good intentions usually don't last very long.<br><br>As I have observed these cycles, I have thought often of the ten lepers whom the Savior cured, only one of whom even took the time to go back and express his gratitude. I am fearful that one out of ten is probably a fairly accurate measurement of our human gratitude quotient.<br><br>I also believe that the probability of our likely appreciation for anything of which we have once been deprived is directly proportionate to the magnitude and gravity of that deprivation, as well as to the imminence of its being permanent. The extremes are illustrative. At the one end, not one of my seven children has ever been impressed with the argument that they should eat their broccoli because people are starving in Cambodia. And I have already alluded to my own inability to sustain an appreciation for freedom from the common cold. If, by contrast, my friend Terry Crapo had recovered from cancer, he would have spent the rest of his years with an appreciation for life that he never would have had if cancer had not come into his life.<br><br>You ask how I am so confident about that fact, and I will answer your question. I know someone--very much like Terry Crapo--who also had cancer, came very close to death, but, unlike Terry, survived. I may not always be as appreciative as I should of the fact that I don't currently have a cold, or that the electricity is working, or that four years have passed since I had a broken ankle. But an appreciation for life itself, and the fact that at the end of October 1987 I was able to take Janet's hand and walk out of that hospital--bald, nauseated, and weak, but nevertheless alive--is in an entirely different category. Literally, never a day goes by--not one--without something happening (and usually it happens several times each day) that serves as a pointed reminder of how grateful I am to be alive, to have a range of mobility greater than four feet from an I.V. pole, and the freedom to go where I want to go, do what I want to do, associate with the people of my choice, run with my friends, live with my family, watch them grow, and, generally, to participate in the joys of this earthly experience.<br><br>But the focus of today's discussion is not me; it is you. I am not the one who needs motivation for an appreciation of life and the things that can be done with it. Cancer followed by chemotherapy will do that very nicely. Today's objective is to provide a shortcut for you to reach that same end without having to go through the same process, which I really do not recommend.<br><br>The fact of the matter is, my fellow students, you are alive, and Chris Felsted is not--just as I am alive and Terry Crapo is not. Does that mean anything?<br><br>Had he lived, Chris Felsted would have been a student at BYU. He will not now have that experience. But you do. What will you do with it?<br><br>The Doctrine and Covenants tells us that where much is given, much is required. Not expected, but required. What you have been given is life, and what is required of you is to live it to the fullest. The phase of your lives that is immediately before you, and the one on which you need to concentrate right now, is a BYU education.<br><h2><b>A Unique Opportunity</b></h2><br>A BYU education is unique--not just different, not just distinctive, but unique. Unique means literally "one of a kind," and there is no other university in the world that offers the combination of educational opportunities and advantages available here. If you do the job right--if you fulfill your "required" part for what you have been given--then you will be as well prepared in the things that the world expects from a college education as if you had taken your training at any other great university. At other institutions of higher learning, undergraduate college education consists of general education and major, or focused education. Those you will get here, also. But what makes BYU unique is the bonus, the third element--your religious education, which consists not only of what happens in the classroom, but also the entire environment in which we study and learn--an environment that not only recognizes the reality of the restored gospel, but attempts to incorporate its principles as an integral part of our total educational effort. In short, college education here includes everything that other good universities offer, plus something that you could find at no university except this one.<br><br>What you have been given is an educational opportunity that, judged by the world's standards, is one of the very best, and judged by our own unique standards, is in a class by itself. What is required of you is to take full advantage of all aspects of that opportunity. First and foremost, you are students. You are here to study and to learn. There are other opportunities here that make that process more enjoyable and more full--things like dances, plays, and athletic events. I urge you to take full advantage of them, particularly the forums and devotionals, the eighteen-stake firesides, and your various ward and stake activities. Equally important, you should see them not in isolation, but as part of the broader learning process.<br><br>You have more freedom, more leeway to exercise your own choices now that you are in college than you ever previously enjoyed. That kind of freedom of choice is an important part of becoming an adult. It is also an important part of the Lord's eternal plan. Use that new freedom like an adult. Use it wisely and for its intended purpose, to study and to learn. Our school song, entitled "The College Song," has some pretty good advice in that respect. It reminds us that we have come "to work, to live, to do." I urge you to do all three of those. BYU can be an enjoyable place, even a fun place, but what you are engaged in here is not a game. It involves nothing less than laying the foundation stones not only for this life, but for the eternities.<br><br>Another aspect of what is required because of what you have been given concerns your BYU citizenship. You are citizens of this university, and citizenship here, as elsewhere, carries a corresponding commitment not only to the values, traditions, and goals that you have set for yourselves, but also those of the institution of which you are members. At most universities, those citizenship obligations include academic commitments such as I have just discussed. We are no different in that respect. But citizenship at BYU goes beyond academics. It includes our code of honor.<br><br>Our code of honor involves some issues that are rooted in policy rather than doctrine, such as our dress and grooming standards. It also embraces other values solidly anchored in doctrine, such as our requirements for honesty in the classroom, in the examination room, and all other places, as well as our standards of sexual morality. Unlike other good universities, sexual promiscuity, involving either homosexual relations or heterosexual relations outside the bonds of marriage, is not simply the concern of the participants. BYU's moral standard is a condition of admission, well understood and accepted at the time of admission, and is also a condition for continuing enrollment.<br><br>One element of our honor code, avoidance of drug abuse, is based not only on policy and doctrine; it is also President Bush's major domestic policy initiative. As a university we fully support the president's program, and our board of trustees has formally adopted a resolution to this effect. Drug abuse has literally become an international cancer. We will not tolerate it in any form on this campus, and on behalf of all members of the university family, I pledge our efforts to help stamp it out. Whatever standards and practices may be legally enforced, our own are very clear. Drug abuse in any form and in any quantity has no place here and will not be tolerated.<br><br>At one level, we may not all be in agreement on every aspect of the Honor Code. That is certainly true of the dress and grooming standards. I have no doubt that if given the opportunity, each of you would have some sage advice as to parts of those requirements that might be changed.<br><br>I would hope there would be virtually no disagreement as to those matters that are doctrinally based. Ponder with me if you will on this fact, which is highly relevant to our general subject of appreciating what we have and making the most of it: with all of mankind's magnificent scientific accomplishments, including advances in the field of medical science, the one thing that man has never even come close to achieving is the creation of life. We have made remarkable progress in our ability to preserve life. But we cannot create it. Not even in its most elementary forms. That power belongs to our Heavenly Father. He has shared it with us. Thus, he has given to us, his children, this most mysterious and in a very real sense the greatest of all powers, the power to create life. He has given us one accompanying commandment, which has existed over the millennia of recorded civilization. It is that the urge to use the processes by which we create life be confined within the bounds the Lord himself has set. The sexual relationship between husband and wife is one of the cornerstones of a good marriage, and the process by which life itself is created. Each of us has a commitment to confine those relationships within the marriage context, and that is also a central part of our honor code and what it means to be a BYU citizen.<br><br>There is, of course, a temptation to say, "Of course I recognize the importance of moral cleanliness. It is one of the foundation stones of my religion, and whether I am at BYU or anywhere else, I will observe it. But the length of my hair, if I'm a man, or the length of my skirt, if I'm a woman, is in an entirely different category."<br><br>The sense in which those two are in different categories is, as already observed, that the one is based on policy and the other on doctrine. But for citizens of BYU, faculty and students alike, all parts of our honor code rise to the level of moral principles. The reason is that each of us, prior to and as a condition of our employment or enrollment here, made a promise, a covenant, to keep and obey those standards. The moral principle, therefore, rises above and exists apart from the intrinsic merit of skirt lengths, or hair lengths, or shorts, or beards. It is a matter of integrity, of complying with what we promised to do. And whether we agree or disagree with given aspects of the dress and grooming standards is irrelevant to that commitment.<br><br>All of the constituent elements of our honor code are important to this university, and are important to me personally. Unlike other things that are important, I hope this is one that will need little attention because it will take care of itself. It really ought to require little attention, because it should be self-enforced by all of us who have agreed to it. I remember Elder Oaks' statement in his very first devotional address to this student body eighteen years ago that he hoped the razor and the tape measure would not become the symbols of his administration. I share that hope. I would like to ask each of you to help me bring that hope to reality.<br><br>What I have tried to do today is bring all of us to a greater appreciation of what we have here at BYU. Two weeks ago, from this pulpit, Elder Maxwell gave another perspective to this same theme by pointing out that attendance at Brigham Young University is becoming an ever more scarce, and therefore more valuable, resource. He pointed out that "estimates of the Church's Young Adult population show that of 1,080,000 young adults worldwide, only 2.4 percent attend BYU. Focusing on just young adults in the U.S. and Canada, barely over 7 percent can attend BYU."<br><br>We are so pleased that you are here. We rejoice with you and your parents at our<br><br>opportunity to share with you this rare and valuable experience that we call a BYU education. Let us make the most of it.<br><br>Let me conclude by reading to you one of the most touching statements that I have heard or read. It is part of a letter from a mother to her son. The mother is my friend, Karen Felsted. The letter was written to her son, Christian Daniel Felsted, four days after his death, and read to him at his funeral.<br><br><i>When I sent you off, I thought I was sending you to BYU. How excited and happy you were to go! And because you were happy, I was happy for you to go, too, because we had reached that sweet/sad crossroads in our family life when it was time for you to be on your own, and for us to step more into the background of your life. Well, it seems that we have sent you to an even greater experience, and that we will be even deeper in the background of your life than we had thought, and that the happy re-associations I had looked forward to will not be the Christmas and summer vacations, but will be in the Own Due Time of the Lord. That's a little harder to wait for--but I will wait, and I will look forward to it. . . . We'll leave your body here close to BYU--this is where you came to be.</i><br><br>May I say to you, as Karen Felsted said to her son, this is also where each of you came to be. May you take full advantage of it. May you and I, every year, every month, and every day, appreciate the fact that we are alive and able to take advantage of the BYU experience, and may we through the things that we do manifest our gratitude to our Heavenly Father for the fact we are alive and have the opportunities that life offers. This I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Rex E. Lee was president of Brigham Young University when this devotional address was given on 12 September 1989.</i><br><br><i>© Brigham Young University. All rights reserved.</i>

<h1> the Church? In Our Hearts - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
<h2></h2><br>I never come to this pulpit without being subdued and humbled, and I invite your faith and prayers.<br><br>Some time ago I was walking in the center of Salt Lake City, on my way to City Creek Canyon, where I usually walk every day. A car with an out-of-state license plate was driving by. It pulled over and stopped. The driver asked, "Where is the church of the Mormons?" I assumed that they were thinking of some place or building. I took time to point out the Church Office Building and the Church Administration Building and the magnificent temple and the historic tabernacle, most of which were visible from our vantage point. They thanked me and went on their way.<br><h2><b>Is It in Our Buildings?</b></h2><br>May I now ask you the same question: "Where is the Church?" Is the Church our beautiful chapels, most of which are well maintained, neat, and clean, of which we are justly proud? Church cannot be just our chapels because for several years in the beginning of the Church, there were no chapels. We had only a temple. So if you were asked, "Where is the Church?" would you answer, "The temples"?<br><br>A few years ago, on a beautiful Halloween evening, my wife and I were in the temple in Kirtland, Ohio. In the late fall afternoon the sun was streaking through the old, wavy, hand-blown windowpanes. The building was light and airy and magnificent. Since some of my forebears were involved in its construction, I was humbled and honored to be under its roof. Within its walls and under its spell, I was enchanted by its beauty. I was so impressed with the building that I came back to Church headquarters and told the Brethren that it would be wonderful if that building were still operating as one of our temples. Elder Packer corrected my thinking when he said, "We do not have the building, but, when our people left, they took with them that which was important. They preserved the keys of the ordinances, the covenants, the endowment, and the sealing power. They took with them all the essentials which we have today." So the Church cannot, in and of itself, be the temples, magnificent as they are, because the temple buildings alone do not bless. They are the exquisite containers for the pearls of great price administered therein by the priesthood of God.<br><br>For the past several years I have assisted President Howard W. Hunter, who was assigned by the First Presidency to acquire land in Jerusalem and direct the building of the BYU Jerusalem Center for Near Eastern Studies. We worked very closely with President Jeffrey R. Holland, David Galbraith, Robert Taylor, Fred Schwendiman, and many, many others in this great endeavor. Through a series of miracles, a center came into being and is now being used by students of this university. The building is magnificent. It is a veritable jewel. None of us who have been involved can explain what we feel in our souls regarding that wonderful edifice. The building is close to some of the places made sacred by the presence of the Savior. It is worthy of the Holy City. It is worthy of this great university and its sponsoring institution, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. But the building alone does not bless. Now our great challenge is to use the building so that it somehow, someway, influences the lives of those who study there, who pray there, who worship there--and who change and become more worthy. The magnificence of the center alone may inspire, but our many educational facilities and activities on this campus and elsewhere will get no one into the kingdom of God. So, where is the Church then?<br><br>Thanks to my wonderful wife, the Spirit of the Lord has often been in our various dwelling places. While we have lived within them, each has been a holy place for me. In our married life we have lived in single rooms with bathrooms down the hall and small apartments, and we have owned three houses. In a sense the Church has been in each, but I would not want to go back and live in our other houses even though we spent much of our happy lives in them. The kingdom of God is not there.<br><h2><b>Is It in Our Families?</b></h2><br>Is the Church then in our families? We are getting close to the correct answer here. In a sense a family can foster the teachings of the Savior better than any other institution. In large measure the Church exists to strengthen families. I wish to define<i>family</i>very broadly. In the Church we have traditional families and single-parent families. Each single is considered in a sense to be a Church family. We also have ward families in which the bishop is a spiritual father. Because of the erosion of family life and family values, we frequently hear urgent pleas requesting the Church to take over as an organization more activities that were formerly looked upon as family activities. An example of this are the super youth activities, some of which have taken the youth at great expense and considerable risk to far distant places. I fear that in more than a few instances the cost of local Church sponsored teenage and single adult activities may have prevented some families from having vacations or other activities together.<br><br>We also hear requests for a new program for that group or a new organization for this group or a new activity for the other group. We already have the new program. It is called the family. It includes family prayer, family scripture study, family home evening, and family loyalty. I wonder if our maturing youth can hold everything together without daily prayer and daily scripture study. The family is the best environment to encourage both. It is my opinion that many Church-sponsored activities could yield to family activities when there is a conflict. I believe parents have the right to decide in those conflicts. I say this because I am persuaded that family activities can be more effective in fostering the eternal values of love, honesty, chastity, industry, self-worth, and personal integrity than any other institution.<br><br>Lou Holtz, a successful football coach from Notre Dame, recently stated:<br><br><i>The family is where our healthy values are formed and shaped. I know no greater challenge or more important role in life than in preparing our children to take their places as contributing citizens. We cannot relinquish this most important responsibility to gang leaders, drug leaders or even our own government. Nothing can destroy individuals or our country as quickly as drugs. It is not confined to a segment of our society, and it has created more damage than anything else I have witnessed in my lifetime. I have never heard a successful man or woman get up and say, "I owe my success to drugs and alcohol." Yet I know thousands of people who have said publicly or in the press that they have ruined their lives because of drugs and alcohol. Suffice it to say government can't stop it, police can't</i>,<i>but the family can.</i><br><br>Because of the complexity of the drug/alcohol problem, some may feel that it is an oversimplification to say strong family leadership can solve the problem. Certainly not all families can, but I am persuaded that families with enough internal caring, discipline, commitment, and love, somehow, someway, can handle the majority of their problems. However strong or weak the family may be, it can usually provide a better solution to most challenges than can any other institution in society or the government no matter how well intentioned they may be. I believe the principle reason a caring family is the best antidote for drug and alcohol abuse and other problems is that unqualified love can flow from kinship relationships. In successful families there is usually a strong caring head. Ideally this would be a holder of the priesthood whose power and influence is maintained by "persuasion, by long-suffering, by gentleness and meekness, and by love unfeigned" (D&amp;amp;C 121:41).<br><br>The home priesthood is desirable because whomsoever is blessed by this power, God will bless. But there have been many successful caring heads of families who are mothers, grandmothers, and others. What seems to distinguish a successful family is that the members of the family continue to care. They just don't give up. They never quit. They hang together through hardships and death and other problems.<br><br>We know of a large close-knit family that is wonderfully successful in holding everything together. When the parents feel they are losing influence with teenagers, the help of cousins is enlisted to exert some counter peer pressure.<br><br>I would urge members of extended families, grandparents, uncles, aunts, nephews, nieces, cousins, to reach out in concern, to succor. Mostly what is needed from grandparents, aunts, and uncles is unreserved love manifest as interest and concern. It builds confidence, self-esteem, and self-worth. Reproving and chastening of adult family members should be rare indeed. We are told that it should happen only when a person is moved upon by the Holy Ghost. But I have been grateful for those in my family who have loved me enough to give me both the gentle and strong reproof on occasion as needed. We read in Proverbs: "He that refuseth reproof erreth" (Proverbs 10:17).<br><br>The fact that some do not have functioning traditional families is no reason to move further in the direction of diminishing or abandoning family activities for those who can and should foster them. With the increased onslaught of forces that cause families to disintegrate, we ought to dig in our heels to preserve all that is great and good in the family. We are reminded that in times of tribulations, the Nephites were not fighting for a political cause, such as monarchy or power; rather, they "were inspired by a better cause." For "they were fighting for their homes and their liberties, their wives and their children, and their all, yea, for their rites of worship and their church" (Alma 43:45).<br><br>Some may find it strong doctrine, but I quote again from Alma in the Book of Mormon: "And again, the Lord has said that: Ye shall defend your families even unto bloodshed" (Alma 43:47).<br><br>As a corollary to the defending of the family, there is a duty to teach family members that the commandments of God may not be broken without drawing a penalty. President Stephen L Richards said: "I want this taught to the youth so that they may comprehend it. It is their due and their right to have these things given to them without dilution or apology. This is justice and mercy. Neither shall rob the other." President Richards went on to state that "It is no kindness to any youth to whitewash various sins such as lying and deceit which are so prevalent today." "And perhaps the greatest of all is that robbery which steals virtue from either man or woman" (<i>CR,</i>April 1957, p. 99).<br><h2><b>Is It in Our Hearts?</b></h2><br>So the family is and must always be an important part of the Church. But the Lord's kingdom ultimately must be found in our own hearts before it can be anywhere else. Paul gave us a key when he said to the Romans: "He that searcheth the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the Spirit" (Romans 8:27). He also said, "The love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us" (Romans 5:5).<br><br>In the story of David, who was called in his youth to be the future king of Israel, we learn how much the Lord judges by what is in the heart. We all remember how the Lord sent the prophet Samuel to the house of Jesse, saying, "For I have provided me a king among his sons" (1 Samuel 16:1). One by one, Jesse had his sons pass before Samuel as he looked for the future king of Israel. Samuel's instructions from the Lord were, "Look not on his countenance, or on the height of his stature; ... for the Lord seeth not as man seeth; for man looketh on the outward appearance, but the Lord looketh on the heart" (1 Samuel 16:7). As the seven sons passed before him, Samuel said to Jesse, "The Lord hath not chosen these."<br><br><i>And Samuel said unto Jesse, Are here all thy children? And he said, There remaineth yet the youngest, and, behold, he keepeth the sheep. And Samuel said unto Jesse, Send and fetch him: for we will not sit down till he come hither.</i><br><br><i>And he sent, and brought him in. Now he was ruddy, and withal of a beautiful countenance, and goodly to look to. And the Lord said, Arise, anoint him: for this is he.</i><br><br><i>Then Samuel took the horn of oil, and anointed him in the midst of his brethren: and the Spirit of the Lord came upon David from that day forward.</i>[1 Samuel 16:10–13]<br><br>Like Daniel of old, what we do and do not do in life originates in our hearts. As he stood in the court of Nebuchadnezzar, the great king of Babylon who captured Jerusalem, "Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the portion of the king's meat, nor with the wine which he drank" (Daniel 1:8).<br><br>The greatness of Willard Richard's heart was manifest just before the martyrdom of the Prophet.<br><br><i>Joseph said to Dr. Richards, "If we go into the cell, will you go in with us?" The Doctor answered, "Brother Joseph you did not ask me to cross the river with you--you did not ask me to come to Carthage--you did not ask me to come to jail with you--and do you think I would forsake you now? But I will tell you what I will do; if you are condemned to be hung for treason, I will be hung in your stead, and you shall go free." Joseph said, "You cannot." The doctor replied, "I will."</i>[<i>HC</i>6:616]<br><br>Alma teaches us the necessity for having the good seed planted in our hearts:<br><br><i>Now, we will compare the word unto a seed. Now, if ye give place, that a seed may be planted in your heart, behold, if it be a true seed, or a good seed, if ye do not cast it out by your unbelief, that ye will resist the Spirit of the Lord, behold, it will begin to swell within your breasts; and when you feel these swelling motions, ye will begin to say within yourselves--It must needs be that this is a good seed, or that the word is good, for it beginneth to enlarge my soul; yea, it beginneth to enlighten my understanding, yea, it beginneth to be delicious to me.</i>[Alma 32:28]<br><br>Revelation comes to us in our minds, but it also comes in our hearts. In a revelation to Oliver Cowdery in Doctrine and Covenants, section 8, verse 2, the Lord says, "Yea, behold, I will tell you in your mind and in your heart, by the Holy Ghost, which shall come upon you and which shall dwell in your heart." To me it is very interesting that the dwelling place of the Holy Ghost is in our hearts.<br><br>What if the Lord appeared to each of us as he did to Solomon and said, "Ask what I shall give thee"? How would you answer? Would you ask for a new car? A new home? A blessing of health? Or a station in life? Solomon asked for none of these. He did not ask for fame or for fortune. He asked: "Give therefore thy servant an understanding heart." This reply pleased the Lord.<br><br><i>And God said unto him, Because thou hast asked this thing, and hast not asked for thyself long life; neither hast asked riches for thyself, nor hast asked the life of thine enemies; but hast asked for thyself understanding to discern judgment;</i><br><br><i>Behold, I have done according to thy words: lo, I have given thee a wise and an understanding heart; so that there was none like thee before thee, neither after thee shall any arise like unto thee.</i><br><br><i>And I have also given thee that which thou hast not asked, both riches, and honour: so that there shall not be any among the kings like unto thee all thy days.</i>[1 Kings 3:11–13]<br><br>And Paul's prayer was that Christ might dwell in our hearts by faith.<br><br>There is some strong language in section 64 of the Doctrine and Covenants regarding who has claim upon our hearts. "I, the Lord, require the hearts of the children of men" (D&amp;amp;C 64:22).<br><br>So when the inquirers in the car with the out-of-state license asked, "Where is the church of the Mormons?" how should I have answered? It has bothered me ever since. If I had pointed to my chest and said that the Church should be first and foremost in my heart, the inquiring travelers surely would have gone away somewhat bewildered. But would I have been more accurate than I was by directing them to our beloved, magnificent, sky-piercing spires, the great majestic dome, and the other world-famous monuments and edifices, wonderful and unique and great as they are? I would have been more correct because the Lord said, "The kingdom of God cometh not with observation: Neither shall they say, Lo here! or, lo there! for, behold, the kingdom of God is within you" (Luke 17:20–21).<br><br>So The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is in our heart of hearts, and, when it is in our hearts as individuals, it will also be in our great buildings of worship, in our great educational institutions, in our magnificent temples, and it will also be in our homes and families.<br><br>Mostly, what I want you to remember this evening is that this humble servant has a testimony of the divinity of this holy work to which we have all been called. And I testify as one of the special witnesses, like Peter when some of the early Saints had begun to fall away, and the Savior was troubled. The Savior said to the Twelve, "Will ye also go away?" Peter responded for the Twelve and said, "Lord, to whom shall we go? thou hast the words of eternal life. And we believe and are sure that thou art that Christ, the Son of the living God" (John 6:67–69). To this I testify in his sacred name, even Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>James E.

Those feelings may be triggered by seeing a person or a family living in a way that lifts your heart with a yearning to live that way, too. The longing to be better may come from reading the words of a book or even from hearing a few bars of music. For me, it has come in all those ways, and more.<br><h2><b>A Future Home</b></h2><br>One of my early memories is reading the scriptures in a school room. The law of the land did not yet forbid it, so the Princeton, New Jersey, public schools began each school day with a standard ritual. I can't remember the sequence, but I remember the content. In our classroom, we pledged allegiance to the flag--in unison, standing hand over heart. One student, a different one each school day, read verses he or she had chosen from the Bible, and then we recited aloud together the Lord's Prayer.<br><br>So about every twenty-five school days, my turn came to choose the scripture. I always chose the same one, so my classmates must have known what was coming when it was my day. I don't remember when I first heard the words; that is lost in the mists of childhood. But I can recite them to you now, and with them the feelings come back. It happened every time, and it still does:<br><br><i>Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not charity, I am become as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal.</i><br><br><i>And though I have the gift of prophecy, and understand all mysteries, and all knowledge; and though I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing.</i>[1 Corinthians 13:1–2]<br><br>You remember the rest, through that thirteenth chapter of 1 Corinthians. By the time I read the first few words, the feeling would come back. The feeling was not just that the words were true, but that they were about some better world I wanted with all my heart to live in. For me, the feeling was even more specific, and I knew it did not come from within me. It was that there would or could be some better life, and that it would be in a family I would someday have. In that then-distant future, I would be able to live with people in some better, kinder way, beyond even the best and the kindest world I had known as a boy.<br><br>Now, little boys don't talk about such things, not to anyone. You might confide in someone that you wanted to play big league baseball someday. But you wouldn't say that you knew someday you'd have a home where you would feel the way you felt when you heard the thirteenth chapter of 1 Corinthians. So I never talked with anyone about those feelings.<br><br>When I was eleven, my parents dropped me off at the Salt Lake City home of my great uncle Gaskell Romney. He was a patriarch and, because he was my father's uncle, he could give me, a boy from the mission field, a patriarchal blessing. I don't think he even sat down to visit with me. He didn't know me except as my father's son. He just led me through the house to a room where a recording device was on a table. He sat me down facing a fireplace, put his hands on my head, and began to give first my lineage and then a blessing.<br><br>He began to tell me about the home in which I would someday be the father. That's when I opened my eyes. I know the stones in the fireplace were there because I began to stare at them. I wondered, "How can this man know what is only in my heart?" He described in concrete detail what had been only a yearning; but I could recognize it. It was the desire of my heart, that future home and family that I thought was secret. But it was not secret, because God knew.<br><br>Now your impressions will not have been quite like mine, but you have felt a tug, maybe many tugs, to be someone better. And what sets those yearnings apart from all your daydreams is that they were not about being richer, or smarter, or more attractive, but about being better. I am sure you have had such moments, not just from my experience, but because of what President David O. McKay once said. Listen very carefully:<br><br><i>Man is a spiritual being, a soul, and at some period of his life everyone is possessed with an irresistible desire to know his relationship to the Infinite. ... There is something within him which urges him to rise above himself, to control his environment, to master the body and all things physical and live in a higher and more beautiful world.</i>[David O. McKay,<i>True to the Faith,</i>comp. Llewelyn R. McKay (Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1966), p. 244]<br><br>That pull upward is far beyond what you would call a desire for self-improvement. When I felt it, I knew I was being urged to live so far above myself that I could never do it on my own. President McKay had it right. You feel an urging to rise above your natural self. What you have felt is an urging from your Heavenly Father to accept this invitation:<br><br><i>O, come unto Christ, and be perfected in him, and deny yourselves of all ungodliness; and if ye shall deny yourselves of all ungodliness, and love God with all your might, mind and strength, then is his grace sufficient for you, that by his grace ye may be perfect in Christ; and if by the grace of God ye are perfect in Christ, ye can in nowise deny the power of God.</i><br><br><i>And again, if ye by the grace of God are perfect in Christ, and deny not his power, then are ye sanctified in Christ by the grace of God, through the shedding of the blood of Christ, which is in the covenant of the Father unto the remission of your sins, that ye become holy, without spot.</i>[Moroni 10:32–33]<br><br>That urge to rise above yourself is a recognition of your need for the Atonement to work in your life, and your need to be sure that it is working. After all you can do, after all your effort, you need confidence that the Atonement is working for you and on you.<br><h2><b>Something Better Drawing Us Up</b></h2><br>You may feel that upward pull tonight. I did one afternoon when I came to understand, as I hadn't before, how much I need the Atonement, what I could do to make it work in my life, and what evidence I could have that it was working.<br><br>It was in a place like this, but not so large. It was the hour of a devotional at Ricks College. I wasn't the speaker; I was sitting there, just behind and to the right of the speaker. I've still got the book, here in my hand, that I held that day. It still has the words in the margins that I wrote then, although the page and the book show signs of use.<br><br>In my memory, the room that afternoon was almost as light as the sunshine, and as warm. The speaker was Elder A. Theodore Tuttle. I suppose there was a spotlight on his face. Stages always seem light when you're on them. But the brightness was in more than what I saw. It was inside me that day. I think it happened because I walked into that room with the yearning President McKay says will come to everyone. And for me that day it was irresistible; I was in the right place with the right preparation.<br><br>I had been trying hard, and yet I wanted to know: "Isn't there something more I can do?" And Elder Tuttle told me there was and that I would need the Atonement of Jesus Christ working in my life to go where I wanted to go. And so that afternoon lives on the pages of this book, and in my life. In case you're having one of the days President McKay said you would, I thought I ought to pass it on.<br><br>That's how Elder Tuttle began. He talked about how someone had passed it to him. He said he had taken a trip to South America on assignment with Joseph Fielding Smith, then a member of the Council of the Twelve. That was in the days when you went to South America by ship. Elder Smith could have used the time to rest. And he could have let Elder Tuttle rest. But he didn't. He organized daily scripture study, sitting on the deck in those wooden slat chairs most of you have only seen in old movies. They read their scriptures together, and they discussed them, and they marked them. And so what I have written on this page, in the margins, was written by Elder Tuttle in his Doctrine and Covenants on the ship's deck as Elder Smith taught it to him. I can only imagine who passed it to Elder Smith. And now I'm passing it on to you.<br><br>This page is the second sheet in the old edition of the triple combination, section nineteen of the Doctrine and Covenants. On the bottom, in capital letters, is written: REPENTANCE. And then an arrow leads to a notation that reads: "Greek word. To have a new mind."<br><br>In the very back of my book I had already written a list of words, gospel concepts, and then, for each, a key scripture. Doctrine and Covenants section 19 became the scripture where I would ever after turn to find the network of scriptures on repentance I got from Elder Tuttle's days of being tutored on the deck, sailing south. This was before the invention of the topical guide, which I suppose is why I don't build those networks anymore. But he did it for me, and so around the margins of that second page of the nineteenth section I have written ten scriptural references I got that afternoon with his brief description of why they matter. Somehow he got them all taught in less than an hour, and into my heart. He was a master teacher. I won't try that. But I will give you the few scriptures that have made the most difference--all the difference for me--in knowing how to reach for that something better you and I sometimes feel drawing us up.<br><br>The first is not in the margin but is from the section itself. I heard it that day with new meaning. It begins with the fifteenth verse.<br><br><i>Therefore I command you to repent--repent, lest I smite you by the rod of my mouth, and by my wrath, and by my anger, and your sufferings be sore--how sore you know not, how exquisite you know not, yea, how hard to bear you know not.</i><br><br><i>For behold, I, God, have suffered these things for all, that they might not suffer if they would repent;</i><br><br><i>But if they would not repent they must suffer even as I.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 19: 15–17]<br><br>As he read those words that day, I felt the overwhelming suffering of the Savior. And then two things dawned on me. First, if I could not repent to qualify for his atonement for my sins, I must suffer to the limit of my power to suffer. And, second, with all the requisite suffering of my own, with all I could bear, it would still not be enough. I would still be forever shut out of the only place where there will be the warmth of family, the family of my Heavenly Father whom I have loved and whom I miss, and that of my family here. Somehow I had gotten the idea that the choice was between repenting or not. And then I realized that whatever pain repentance might bring in this life, it was certainly no more than the pain I would face if I did not repent here, and yet that later pain could not lift me home. It could not bring the mercy I needed.<br><br>A determination flowed into me both to stay as far as I could from sin and to gain a confidence that my sins were being remitted. In that moment, the penalty for taking chances with sin or with forgiveness loomed larger than I had ever imagined it could. I wanted with all my heart to know both that the Atonement was curing the effects of sin in me and that I was being strengthened against future sin. I wanted confidence whereas before I had been content with hope.<br><br>What I wanted, then, was to know what I could do to gain assurance that I was on the path home. Specific steps to assure that the Atonement is at work in your life will not always be the same. For some, at one point, it would be to see a bishop, a judge in Israel, to confess serious sin and to seek help. For another, it would be to accept baptism. But for everyone, at every stage of purification, there are constants. One is this: reception of the Holy Ghost is the cleansing agent as the Atonement purifies you.<br><br>President Marion G. Romney taught it this way: "Receiving the Holy Ghost is the therapy which effects forgiveness and heals the sin-sick soul" (<i>Ensign,</i>May 1974, p. 92). The Savior said it this way: "Now this is the commandment: Repent, all ye ends of the earth, and come unto me and be baptized in my name, that ye may be sanctified by the reception of the Holy Ghost, that ye may stand spotless before me at the last day" (3 Nephi 27:20). Moroni also spoke of being wrought upon and cleansed by the power of the Holy Ghost after baptism.<br><br>Now that is a fact you can act on with confidence. You can invite the Holy Ghost's companionship in your life. And you can know when he is there, and when he withdraws. And when he is your companion, you can have confidence that the Atonement is working in your life.<br><br>You can make some choices tonight that will bring the Holy Ghost to you as your companion.<br><br>You are all called of God to serve his children. You may be called as a clerk or a home teacher or a visiting teacher. You all are a son or daughter or a brother or sister. None of those are accidental calls. And each places you in service to invite someone to choose the right, to come unto Christ. None of the people for whom you are responsible can be truly served without your bearing testimony, in some way, of the mission of Jesus Christ.<br><br>Now you know that the mission of the Holy Ghost is to bear testimony of the Savior. When in faith and under assignment you go forth to do that, the Holy Ghost is your ally. The Savior said: "But when the Comforter is come, whom I will send unto you from the Father, even the Spirit of truth, which proceedeth from the Father, he shall testify of me" (John 15:26).<br><br>You could, this moment, begin to think of those for whom you bear responsibility. If you do, and do it with the intent to serve them, a face or a name will come to you. If you do something tonight and make some attempt to help that person come unto Christ, I cannot promise you a miracle, but I can promise you this: you will feel the influence of the Holy Ghost helping you, and you will feel approval. And you will know that, for at least those minutes, the power of the Holy Ghost was with you. And you will know that some healing came into your soul, for the Spirit will not dwell in an unclean tabernacle. His influence cleanses.<br><br>Not only is your feeling the influence of the Holy Ghost a sign that the Atonement, the cure for sin, is working in your life, but you will also know that a preventative against sin is working.<br><h2><b>Protection Against Sin</b></h2><br>The effects of the Atonement--the lack of pride, of envy, of malice--are a shield against temptation. The Savior taught that in another of those references written in the margin around my copy of the nineteenth section of the Doctrine and Covenants. It directs me to the first verse in section 95 of the Doctrine and Covenants. The first verse reads this way:<br><br><i>Verily, thus saith the Lord unto you whom I love, and whom I love I also chasten that their sins may be forgiven, for with the chastisement I prepare a way for their deliverance in all things out of temptation, and I have loved you.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 95:1]<br><br>I bear you my testimony that God loves you and that he has prepared a way for your deliverance in all things out of temptation. In that verse the Lord was announcing a chastisement because his people had not built his house as he had commanded. He called that a grievous sin. But the Lord taught that the chastisement that would prepare them to be forgiven would also produce a shield against temptation.<br><br>I bear you my testimony that the broken heart and contrite spirit that are the requirements for forgiveness are also its fruits. The very humility that is the sign of having been forgiven is protection against future sin. And it is by avoiding future sin that we retain a remission of the sins of the past.<br><br>You may not know when you have been fully baptized with fire and with the Holy Ghost, but you can know you are inviting his presence. And you know when you are making his presence impossible. Although you may leave this hall determined to serve the Savior tonight and thus invite the Spirit, some of you will be tempted by some thought like this: "Look, as long as you don't commit great sin, repentance isn't that hard. You just confess, take a little embarrassment, and you are clean again." That is a lie in at least two ways.<br><br>First, I have never forgotten the voice of Elder Tuttle after he read this description of suffering for sin from section 19 of the Doctrine and Covenants:<br><br><i>Which suffering caused myself, even God, the greatest of all, to tremble because of pain, and to bleed at every pore, and to suffer both body and spirit--and would that I might not drink the bitter cup, and shrink.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 19:18]<br><br>It was about there where I wrote these words, "Teach the people repentance hurts." I bear you my testimony that you must never believe the lie that there is no pain from sin. You can be forgiven. The Atonement is real. But President Kimball taught: "If a person hasn't suffered, he hasn't repented" (<i>TSWK,</i>p. 99). So, true faith in the Atonement of Jesus Christ, rather than leading you to try a little sin, will lead you to stay as far away from it as you can.<br><br>That brings me to a second falsehood. It is this: as the world grows more wicked, it is only reasonable to expect to be overcome by temptation. That is not true either. We do not face so bleak a prospect. Here is what President George Albert Smith taught. He said it more than fifty years ago, but it is still true in our time, and will be in the future, however dark it becomes. He said:<br><br><i>There are two influences ever present in the world. One is constructive and elevating and comes from our Heavenly Father; and the other is destructive and debasing and comes from Lucifer. We have our agency and make our own choice in life subject to these unseen powers. There is a division line well defined that separates the Lord's territory from Lucifer's. If we live on the Lord's side of the line, Lucifer cannot come there to influence us, but if we cross the line into his territory, we are in his power. By keeping the commandments of the Lord we are safe on His side of the line, but if we disobey His teachings we voluntarily cross into the zone of temptation and invite the destruction that is ever present there. Knowing this, how anxious we should always be to live on the Lord's side of the line.</i>[George Albert Smith,<i>Improvement Era,</i>May 1935, p. 278]<br><br>The increasing wickedness in the world should not make you more inclined to take chances but less. By choice of what you will do tonight, and what you won't do, you can place yourself in that territory where the Holy Ghost can be your companion.<br><h2><b>How Do You Know?</b></h2><br>Now you may feel that I have given you only modest hope. You and everyone want to know, to be sure--if possible, by some clear sign--that your sins are remitted. So do I. But you and I know that President Benson, in his article from which many of you have already home taught, was telling the truth when he said:<br><br><i>For every Paul, for every Enos, and for every King Lamoni, there are hundreds and thousands of people who find the process of repentance much more subtle, much more imperceptible. Day by day they move closer to the Lord, little realizing they are building a godlike life. They live quiet lives of goodness, service, and commitment. They are like the Lamanites, who the Lord said "were baptized with fire and with the Holy Ghost, and they knew it not" (3 Nephi 9:20).</i>["A Mighty Change of Heart,"<i>Ensign,</i>October 1989, p. 5]<br><br>As if he knew my concern, and yours, to discern whether we were moving toward Christ, Elder Tuttle took me to a scripture. The reference is written in the margin next to the beginning of the fifteenth verse. Here is all it says: "Alma 5:14, 15, 26–31." And then these words, written very small: "Born again and retaining remission. How do you know?"<br><br>"How do you know?" That was whispered to me by a woman after a stake conference, with tears running down her cheeks, when she said: "I've tried so long. I've done everything I know how. Why don't I feel the peace of forgiveness? I want to feel forgiven. I want to feel clean again. I want to feel I can stay that way. How do I know?" It was asked in a letter that came to my desk recently. It was asked the other night on the phone in what began as a call about business. And with tears in his voice, a young man asked, "Well, how will I know? How do you know?"<br><br>Alma the high priest raised that very question, and he answered it as he taught the people in Zarahemla. Here is the reference, starting with Alma 5:14:<br><br><i>And now behold, I ask of you, my brethren of the church, have ye spiritually been born of God? Have ye received his image in your countenances? Have ye experienced this mighty change in your hearts?</i><br><br><i>Do ye exercise faith in the redemption of him who created you? Do you look forward with an eye of faith, and view this mortal body raised in immortality, and this corruption raised in incorruption, to stand before God to be judged according to the deeds which have been done in the mortal body?</i>[Alma 5:14–15]<br><br>As Elder Tuttle read those words that day, I knew what I wanted. I wanted the Master's image in my countenance, perhaps not visible to others, but so that I might look forward with the eye of faith to that grand reunion. I wanted to have confidence that I would someday and somewhere hear the words: "Come unto me ye blessed, for behold, your works have been the works of righteousness upon the face of the earth" (Alma 5:16).<br><br>Now, sometimes when you read scriptures, your mind may wander. In fact, I have been watching some of you. I realize I have been testing you. You have heard a lot of scripture. My mind didn't wander that day as Elder Tuttle moved over a page to read the twenty-sixth verse. I wanted to hear how I would know that the Atonement was working in my life. I wanted to know how to retain a remission of my sins. Here is what he began to read:<br><br><i>And now behold, I say unto you, my brethren, if ye have experienced a change of heart, and if ye have felt to sing the song of redeeming love, I would ask, can ye feel so now?</i><br><br><i>Have ye walked, keeping yourselves blameless before God? Could ye say, if ye were called to die at this time, within yourselves, that ye have been sufficiently humble? That your garments have been cleansed and made white through the blood of Christ, who will come to redeem his people from their sins?</i><br><br><i>Behold, are ye stripped of pride? I say unto you, if ye are not ye are not prepared to meet God. Behold ye must prepare quickly; for the kingdom of heaven is soon at hand, and such an one hath not eternal life.</i><br><br><i>Behold, I say, is there one among you who is not stripped of envy? I say unto you that such an one is not prepared; and I would that he should prepare quickly, for the hour is close at hand, and he knoweth not when the time shall come; for such an one is not found guiltless.</i><br><br><i>And again I say unto you, is there one among you that doth make a mock of his brother, or that heapeth upon him persecutions?</i><br><br><i>Wo unto such an one, for he is not prepared, and the time is at hand that he must repent or he cannot be saved!</i>[Alma 5:26–31]<br><br>Think of those words: Humble, stripped of pride, stripped of envy, not making a mock of my brother, garments cleansed. Have you experienced the change of heart?<br><br>I learned a long time ago that it is hard to know how you are doing in being born again and why it is not easy. Once, as a bishop of a ward, I worked with a young man not much older than many of you. He'd made great mistakes and had been moved by faith in the Lord Jesus Christ to make long and painful repentance. We were down to the weeks before he was to be married in the temple. I had long before forgiven him in the name of the Church and had given him his temple recommend. Yet he remembered that I had said, "The Lord will forgive you in his own time and in his own way." But now he was deeply concerned. He came to my office and he said: "You told me that the Lord would someday let me know that I was forgiven. But I am going to the temple to marry a wonderful girl. I want to be the best I can be for her. I need to know that I am forgiven. And I need to know now. Tell me how to find out." I said I would try.<br><br>He gave me a deadline. My memory is that it was within less than two weeks. Fortunately, I already had a trip scheduled. During that period of time I went to Salt Lake City, and there I found myself seeing Elder Spencer W. Kimball, then a member of the Quorum of the Twelve, at a social function. It was crowded, and yet he somehow found me. He walked up to me in that crowd and said, "Hal, I understand that you are now a bishop. Do you have anything you would like to ask me?"<br><br>I said that I did, but I didn't think that was the place to talk about it. He thought it was. It was an outdoor party. My memory is that we went behind a shrub and there had our interview. Without breaking confidences, as I have not with you, I outlined the concerns and the question of this young man in my ward. Then I asked Elder Kimball, "How can he get that revelation? How can he know whether his sins are remitted?"<br><br>I thought Elder Kimball would talk to me about fasting or prayer or listening for the still small voice. But he surprised me. Instead he said, "Tell me something about the young man."<br><br>I said, "What would you like to know?"<br><br>And then he began a series of the most simple questions. Some of the ones I remember were:<br><br>"Does he come to his priesthood meetings?"<br><br>I said, after a moment of thought, "Yes."<br><br>"Does he come early?"<br><br>"Yes."<br><br>"Does he sit down front?"<br><br>I thought for a moment and then realized, to my amazement, that he did.<br><br>"Does he home teach?"<br><br>"Yes."<br><br>"Does he go early in the month?"<br><br>"Yes, he does."<br><br>"Does he go more than once?"<br><br>"Yes."<br><br>I can't remember the other questions. But they were all like that--little things, simple acts of obedience, of submission. And for each question I was surprised that my answer was always yes. Yes, he wasn't just at all his meetings: he was early; he was smiling; he was there not only with his whole heart, but with the broken heart of a little child, as he was every time the Lord asked anything of him. And after I had said yes to each of his questions, Elder Kimball looked at me, paused, and then very quietly said, "There is your revelation."<br><br>Sufficiently humble. Stripped of pride. Stripped of envy. Never making a mock of his brother.<br><br>When I went back to the young man and told him what I then knew, he accepted it. But he may have simply had to take my word for it. You see, it's hard to feel that you are sufficiently humble. If you did, you might not be. He went forward with his marriage. I've seen him since. To me he still looks as he did on the front bench before a priesthood meeting.<br><br>My guess is that he has retained a remission of his sins. I don't know if he knew then or if he knows now with the certainty he wanted, but I am sure of something. When that change of heart comes to me and to you, when we are cleansed and blameless before God, it will be because we have been made pure by the blood of Christ. And I know what I can and must do. I must be baptized by a servant of God holding the true priesthood, I must have received the gift of the Holy Ghost by that same power, and then I must have exercised faith in the Savior long enough and carefully enough that his grace will be sufficient for me. And I know at least one way to know that is happening in your life, or in mine. You will have put yourself so often in the Master's service, bringing the cleansing companionship of the Holy Ghost, that you will be on the front row, early, whenever and wherever the Master calls. It will be gradual enough that you may not notice. You will be humble enough that you may be reluctant to believe it is happening. But those with spiritual discernment who love you will know. And the Savior and our Heavenly Father will know. And that is enough.<br><h2><b>Invite the Holy Ghost into Your Life</b></h2><br>Here is another of those scriptures from Elder Tuttle, marked in the margin. It describes an evidence you and I can have that we are on the way to that better, higher life:<br><br><i>For the natural man is an enemy to God, and has been from the fall of Adam, and will be, forever and ever, unless he yields to the enticings of the Holy Spirit, and putteth off the natural man and becometh a saint through the atonement of Christ the Lord, and becometh as a child, submissive, meek, humble, patient, full of love, willing to submit to all things which the Lord seeth fit to inflict upon him, even as a child doth submit to his father.</i>[Mosiah 3:19]<br><br>When I read that scripture I see the face of that young man on the front row, early to his meeting.<br><br>I bear you my testimony that you can invite the Holy Ghost into your life, and because you have been promised that gift by authorized servants of God, he will come. I bear testimony to you that you can be cleansed by the power of the Atonement of Jesus Christ. I bear testimony that the yearning you've felt for something better is a yearning to come unto Christ. And I bear testimony that this promise is true in the twenty-third verse of the nineteenth section of the Doctrine and Covenants: "Learn of me, and listen to my words; walk in the meekness of my Spirit, and you shall have peace in me."<br><br>I pray that you and I will make the choices tonight and tomorrow and as long as we live that will bring the influence of the Holy Ghost into our lives in the service of the Master. I testify that as we do, we will feel the cleansing that comes through the Atonement of Jesus Christ, and with it the confidence that we are coming unto him. And when we are there, with him and sanctified, we shall never hunger nor thirst again.<br><br>My hope is that you will put yourself in the way tonight where the Holy Ghost will go with you. A telephone call, a visit, or a letter you could write to someone God has asked you to serve would do that. I've promised you one miracle: you will feel the companionship of the Holy Ghost. But I have to warn you about expecting another miracle. Even with that help, the help of the Holy Ghost, you may not say the words or give the service that will bring a mighty change in their lives. Remember that President McKay said that at "sometime" in their lives there is an irresistible desire to rise to a higher, more beautiful world.<br><br>That sometime may not be tonight. But go anyway. And go again. And then when the sometime comes, you will be there, and you will be their friend, and then you can testify to them that the longing they feel for something better is to come unto Christ. You can tell them how. And you will have been showing them how.<br><br>I have one other plea, one other hope for you: don't ignore the impulses that come to you to rise above yourself into a higher and more beautiful world. Growing up, getting educated, seeing the world, and almost everything that happens to you will push you toward saying to yourself: "Oh, that was just a dream. That's not possible. I could never change that much."<br><br>You can. The Savior promised: "Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest" (Matthew 11:28).<br><br>He can and he will. I bear you my testimony that God lives. He is your Father. You want to go home. You want to be with him. The only way you can be with him in the way you want to be is to become clean and spotless. I bear you my testimony that Jesus is the Christ. The Atonement is real. I bear you my testimony that the Holy Ghost will come to you in the service of our Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ as you bear testimony.<br><br>I bear you my testimony that Joseph Smith was a prophet of God. I bear testimony that the priesthood is on the earth. The keys are here. President Benson is a prophet of God. I pray that you may without fear and with confidence go forward to serve. And I pray for this in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Henry B.

<br>
Two weeks ago, President Dean L. Larsen and I returned from South America, where we visited with members and missionaries in Bolivia, Peru, and Colombia. I am happy to report that the work continues to go forward in spite of the current violence present there.<br><br>Many of you served your missions in those countries, and I know you are concerned about what is happening in South America. For many years we have enjoyed relative peace while doing missionary work in the world. However, in some places today we find it necessary to teach members and missionaries how to protect themselves in a world of increasing violence. The Prophet Joseph Smith saw the challenges of doing missionary work in this dispensation.<br><h2><b>From Small Beginnings</b></h2><br>May I share with you this morning the remarkable growth of the Church, as prophesied by the Prophet Joseph Smith. One hundred eighty-three years have now passed since the Prophet's birth. We must never forget his perseverance in the face of incredible hardships and opposition to bring forth the priesthood, new scriptures, complete doctrines, full ordinances, and covenants to exalt men and women through membership in the restored Church of Jesus Christ.<br><br>In the earliest years of the development of the Church, at a time when its enemies already were making great efforts to stop the work, the Prophet knew that no enemy present or future would have sufficient power to frustrate and stop the purposes of God. Even Joseph's closest associates in those early years did not understand that the Church would roll forth from small beginnings to fill the entire world as prophesied by the Old Testament prophet Daniel (see Daniel 1).<br><br>At age twenty-seven, Wilford Woodruff was present at a meeting called by the Prophet Joseph in Kirtland, Ohio, early in 1834. At this time, the Saints who had gathered in Missouri were suffering great persecutions. Mobs had driven them from their homes in Jackson County. Some had tried to establish themselves in neighboring counties, but persecutions followed them. The Prophet had announced the intention to go to Missouri and had enlisted a number of volunteers to go as Zion's Camp to rescue the Saints there. Wilford Woodruff gives a vivid description of the Prophet's message to the elders who met in preparation for the Zion's Camp march:<br><br><i>On Sunday night the Prophet called on all who held the Priesthood to gather into the little log school house they had there. It was a small house, perhaps 14 feet square. But it held the whole of the Priesthood of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints who were then in the town of Kirtland, and who had gathered together to go off in Zion's camp. That was the first time I ever saw Oliver Cowdery, or heard him speak; the first time I ever saw Brigham Young or Heber</i>C.<i>Kimball, and the two Pratts, and Orson Hyde and many others. There were no Apostles in the Church except Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery. When we got together the Prophet called upon the Elders of Israel with him to bear testimony of this work. Those that I have named spoke, and a good many that I have not named, bore their testimonies. When they got through the Prophet said, "Brethren, I have been very much edified and instructed in your testimonies here tonight, but I want to say to you before the Lord, that you know no more concerning the destinies of this Church and the kingdom than a babe upon its mother's lap. You don't comprehend it." I was rather surprised. Then the prophet said, "It is only a little handful of Priesthood you see here tonight, but this Church will fill North and South America--it will fill the world."</i>[<i>CR,</i>April 1898, p. 57]<br><br>You will detect in this statement by Joseph Smith no element of cautious forecasting. He certainly did not predict future growth based on past trends. He gave a bold statement, a prophecy--given by the Spirit of the Lord.<br><br>You may remember that the Articles of Faith first appeared in a letter that Joseph Smith wrote to Mr. John Wentworth, the editor of a Chicago newspaper. In the Wentworth letter, which was dated 1 March 1842, Joseph Smith wrote a vision of the destiny of the Church in a profound prophecy. He wrote:<br><br><i>The Standard of Truth has been erected; no unhallowed hand can stop the work from progressing; persecutions may rage, mobs may combine, armies may assemble, calumny may defame, but the truth of God will go forth boldly, nobly, and independent, till it has penetrated every continent, visited every clime, swept every country, and sounded in every ear, till the purposes of God shall be accomplished, and the Great Jehovah shall say the work is done.</i>[<i>HC</i>4:540]<br><br>Since the organization of the Church in 1830, nearly sixteen decades have passed. We have had 158 years to observe what has happened in the fulfillment of his prophecy. Together, let us see how the truth of God has swept the nations despite persecutions and opposition. Let us see how continents and countries have been penetrated and what peoples of the world have heard the gospel sound in their ears. Let us also review selected examples of opposing efforts of the "unhallowed hands" of the enemy: how persecutions have raged, how mobs have combined, how armies have assembled, and how calumny has defamed. (In case you are not familiar with the term calumny, it is a false charge or misrepresentation given maliciously to damage another person's reputation.)<br><h2><b>In the Face of Opposition</b></h2><br>Although the Church began its first decade with only six members, "unhallowed hands" made every effort to stop the spread of the gospel and destroy the Church in its infancy. Joseph Smith soon learned how mobs may combine. From Church history we read:<br><br><i>Certain residents of Hiram, Ohio, vented their personal feelings with mob action directed against the Prophet and Sidney Rigdon. Stimulated by whiskey and hidden behind blackened faces, a gang of more than two dozen men dragged Joseph from his bed during the night of March 24, 1832. Choking him into submission, they stripped him naked, scratched his skin with their fingernails, tore his hair, and then smeared his body with tar and feathers. A vial of nitric acid forced against his teeth splashed on his face; a front tooth was broken. Meanwhile other members of the mob dragged Rigdon by the heels from his home, bumping his head on the frozen ground, which left him delirious for days. The Prophet's friends spent the night removing the tar to help him keep a Sunday morning appointment. He addressed a congregation that included Simonds Ryder, organizer of the mob.</i>[James B. Allen and Glen M. Leonard,<i>The Story of the Latter-day Saints</i>(Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1976), p. 71]<br><br>Ryder was a convert who disaffected because the Prophet Joseph misspelled his name.<br><br>A year later, another mob destroyed the<i>Evening and Morning Star</i>printing office, interrupting the publication of the Book of Commandments, a collection of divine revelations received through Joseph Smith.<br><br>Joseph Smith also learned how calumny may defame. In 1834, Eber D. Howe published<i>Mormonism Unvailed,</i>the first anti-Mormon book. It included a variety of old and new charges against Joseph Smith's credibility and tried to undermine the veracity of the Book of Mormon.<br><br>The Saints in Missouri found out in a tragic manner how the armies of the enemy may assemble. In 1838, Governor Lilburn W. Boggs of Missouri issued the infamous "Order of Extermination," and our history records the tragedy at Haun's Mill.<br><br>Despite intense opposition against all efforts to erect the standard of truth, 597 missionaries were set apart during the 1830s, and nearly 20,000 converts joined the restored Church during that first decade. Missionaries taught and baptized people in most of the states then in the Union, and both Canada and Great Britain were opened to the preaching of the gospel. The gospel message penetrated two continents and began to sweep across three nations.<br><br>Heber C. Kimball was one of the great missionaries in the early years of the Church. He was a friend of the Prophet Joseph Smith and a relative of Brigham Young. He was tall and he was bald even when he was young. People liked to tease him about his baldness, and he one time gave the following explanation of how he lost his hair. Shortly after joining the Church, Heber was called as a very young man to serve a mission to Nova Scotia. He traveled the entire 1,500 miles from his home in New York on foot, with his valise on his back. Heber said of this mission:<br><br><i>Soon after I started I found that I was rather unlearned, though I knew that before, but I knew it better after I started.</i><br><br><i>I began to study the Scriptures, . . . and I had so little knowledge that the exercise of study began to swell my head and open my pores insomuch that the hairs dropped out; and if you will let your minds expand as mine did you will have no hair on your heads.</i>[<i>JD</i>4:107; quoted in Leonard J. Arrington's<i>Church History and the Achievement of Identity</i>]<br><br>Heber C. Kimball was a man of great faith and good humor. I hope for those of you whose hair is thinning that it is for the same reason.<br><br>These early missionaries succeeded in the face of all opposition because they had the unwavering faith to open their mouths and declare the truth and because they took with them the mighty sword of the Lord's Spirit (see D&amp;amp;C 27:16–17). They remembered the baptismal covenant to "stand as witnesses of God at all times and in all things, and in all places . . . even until death" (Mosiah 18:9).<br><br>The same year that Lorenzo Snow set out on his first mission, the Prophet Joseph Smith gave Heber C. Kimball a very significant missionary assignment. The Prophet Joseph approached Heber while the latter was seated in the Kirtland Temple. Joseph said:<br><br><i>Brother Heber, the Spirit of the Lord has whispered to me: "Let my servant Heber go to England and proclaim my Gospel, and open the door of salvation to that nation."</i>[Orson F. Whitney,<i>Life of Heber C. Kimball, an Apostle</i>(Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, Inc., 1967), p. 103]<br><br>The First Presidency and the Twelve hold the keys for opening the nations to missionary work (see D&amp;amp;C 107:35). When the pattern has been followed of calling an apostle to open a land to the preaching of the gospel, great success has resulted. Heber C. Kimball baptized more than one thousand converts in the western part of England during his mission. He and his companions laid the foundation for future growth in that great nation. Of this early work, Joseph Smith said:<br><br><i>The work in which we are unitedly engaged is one of no ordinary kind. The enemies we have to contend against are subtle and well skilled in manoeuvering; it behooves us to be on the alert to concentrate our energies, and that the best feelings should exist in our midst; and then, by the help of the Almight</i>[y]<i>, we shall go on from victory to victory, and from conquest to conquest; our evil passions will be subdued, our prejudices depart; we shall find no room in our bosoms for hatred; vice will hide its deformed head, and we shall stand approved in the sight of heaven, and be acknowledged the sons of God.</i>[<i>HC</i>4:231]<br><br>During the 1840s, persecutions continued to rage, especially against the Prophet Joseph Smith. In 1841 he was arrested in Illinois on a fugitive warrant issued by Governor Boggs of Missouri, but Judge Stephen A. Douglas of Quincy, Illinois, ruled the writ ineffective and released the prisoner. A year later, John C. Bennett, mayor of Nauvoo, plotted to assassinate the Prophet. After the plot failed, Bennett resigned as mayor, was expelled from the Church, and later wrote a scandalous account entitled<i>The History of the Saints; or an Exposé of Joe Smith and the Mormons.</i>The persecutions culminated on 27 June 1844. Joseph and Hyrum were killed by a mob that rushed Carthage Jail.<br><br>In the midst of all these difficulties, 1,454 missionaries were set apart during the 1840s. Church membership grew to more than 48,000. Missionaries made initial visits to Australia, India, Jamaica, South America, and Germany. Although the early work in these countries was limited and resulted in only a few scattered conversions, the servants of the Lord began learning valuable lessons about how to reach out to people of different cultures. In 1841, Orson Hyde visited and dedicated Israel for the gathering of the Jews. Despite the great difficulty of travel, the restored gospel penetrated three more continents.<br><br>During the 1840s Wilford Woodruff, who had been tutored by the Prophet Joseph and later ordained an apostle, was sent as a missionary to England. The success of his missionary work in southern England in 1840 may be unparalleled. Because of the great faith of Wilford Woodruff, Heber C. Kimball, and other missionaries and their ability to follow the promptings of the Spirit, the truth of God began to sweep a nation and sound in many ears.<br><br>Although much of the energy of the Saints in the 1850s was devoted to the migration to Utah and the development of a new home, missionary work continued, as did the persecutions. In May 1857, Elder Parley P. Pratt of the Council of the Twelve was assassinated while on a mission in Arkansas. In the same month, United States President Buchanan issued orders for an army to assemble at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, to march to Utah on false assumptions that the people of Utah were in rebellion against the United States. This was the beginning of the so-called "Utah War." Two months later, in July, Brigham Young received word that an American army, under the command of General Albert Johnston, was approaching Utah. Church leaders took the position that they had violated no laws and decided to allow no military "invasion" to drive them from their homes. In June 1858, after having been stopped for the winter by delaying tactics of the Mormons, General Johnston's army finally entered the Salt Lake Valley, but did so peacefully.<br><br>In the 1850s, 705 missionaries were set apart. Missions of the Church were opened in Scandinavia, France, Italy, Switzerland, and Hawaii. Initial missionary work began also in such parts of the world as India, Hong Kong, Thailand, Burma, South Africa, and the West Indies. Many of these efforts were discontinued after a few years. However, the Scandinavian Mission, organized in 1850, baptized about a thousand converts each year during the decade, mostly in Denmark. Missionaries in Britain baptized more than 15,000 converts, who then left for Utah between 1849 and 1857. At the end of the decade, missionaries were teaching the gospel in fifteen nations and two territories. Worldwide Church membership numbered more than 57,000.<br><br>Members of the Church enjoyed little public favor in the early years of our history. However, "attitudes improved somewhat during the 1860s, partly because the Civil War diverted attention elsewhere, and partly because of Mormon cooperation in building the transcontinental railroad. But that didn't last. Polygamy debates led to the Edmunds-Tucker Act, bringing the Church in the 1880s to a low point in terms of public contempt" (William B. Smart, "Changing Attitudes,"<i>Church News,</i>5 January 1980).<br><br>President John Taylor and the Saints of his day certainly experienced how persecutions may rage. The Edmunds-Tucker Act of 1887 "seemed designed to destroy the Church itself, eliminating both polygamy and the influence of the Church on Utah's political life" (Allen and Leonard,<i>The Story of the Latter-day Saints,</i>p. 404). Among other stringent provisions, the law disincorporated the Church, abolished female suffrage, and ordered the confiscation of practically all Church property.<br><br>Outside of Utah, unhallowed hands continued to oppose the work. In Georgia, Joseph Standing and his missionary companions were walking on a public road near the county line of Catoosa and Whitfield counties when they were compelled by a mob to go to an isolated spot in the woods. Elder Standing was shot by a mob member when he put up some resistance to move to another spot.<br><br>Notwithstanding this and other acts of persecution, in the three decades from 1860 to 1890, 4,458 missionaries were set apart. Worldwide membership grew from 57,000 to 183,000. Four stakes developed into twenty-two stakes. At the end of the 1880s, missionaries were serving in twenty nations and three territories. During this decade, doors were opened, and sustained missionary efforts began in the Netherlands, Iceland, Finland, Belgium, and Samoa. For varying periods, from a few months to twenty-five years, missionaries labored also in Armenia, Syria, Israel, Egypt, Turkey, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Burma, and India.<br><br>The forty-year period from 1890 to 1930 brought some improvement in public attitudes toward the Church:<br><br><i>The Manifesto disclaiming polygamy in 1890 helped reverse the trend. So did an active public relations campaign for statehood, ushering in a period of less-bitter but still generally hostile attitudes, running from 1890 to the late 1920s. The Church and its doctrine were still disliked during this period, but</i>[news]<i>articles began to speak of the people themselves as basically good with high potential. This was the period during which B. H. Roberts and Reed Smoot were elected to Congress but Reed Smoot had to fight to be seated. . . . The national debate hurt the Church image badly, but it gradually improved during a long career in which Reed Smoot became one of the country's leading senators.</i>[Smart, "Changing Attitudes"]<br><br>Opposition to the Church heated up in early 1922, owing in some part to the influence of the movie entitled<i>Trapped by the Mormons.</i>The uneventful days of tracting in the British Mission were a thing of the past. On 10 January 1922, Ezra Taft Benson mentioned in his journal, without elaboration, the movie's author: "Winnifred Graham on our track again." The next day Elder Benson was evicted from one house, and a week later still "more stories of the terrible Mormons were being circulated." On Sunday, January 29, someone attempted to break up one of their meetings. A week later he wrote, "Tracting in South Street, women rather excited, afraid they're going to be taken to Utah."<br><h2><b>Moving This Great Work Forward</b></h2><br>Persecutions still raged in the twentieth century. But the truth of God continued to go forth boldly as Joseph Smith had prophesied. On 3 September 1925, President Heber J. Grant announced that the First Presidency had decided to open missionary work in South America. Following the Lord's pattern for unlocking the doors of the kingdom in all nations, the First Presidency called Elder Melvin J. Ballard, a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles and my own grandfather, along with Rulon S. Wells and Rey L. Pratt of the First Council of the Seventy to go to South America. They were called to dedicate the land for the preaching of the gospel, to open a mission there, and to lay the foundation for establishing the Church in that vast continent. After a three-week journey by ship, covering more than seven thousand miles, the three missionaries arrived in Buenos Aires in December 1925.<br><br>On Christmas morning of 1925, at 7:00 a.m., Elder Ballard dedicated the land. The missionary work was very slow and difficult in those early months. Of the sixteen people attending the first Church meeting, almost all were German immigrants. In the first ten months while grandfather was there, the missionaries saw only a small handful of converts join the Church; perhaps only one or two of them were native Latin people. However, before leaving South America on 4 July 1926, Elder Ballard prophesied:<br><br><i>The work of the Lord will grow slowly for a time here just as an oak grows slowly from an acorn. It will not shoot up in a day as does the sunflower that grows quickly and then dies. But thousands will join the Church here. It will be divided into more than one mission and will be one of the strongest in the Church. The work here is the smallest that it will ever be. The day will come when the Lamanites in this land will be given a chance. The South American Mission will be a power in the Church.</i>[Melvin J. Ballard,<i>Crusader for Righteousness</i>(Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1966), p. 84]<br><br>Brothers and sisters, many of you are aware of the remarkable growth of the Church in South America.<br><br>During the forty years from 1890 to 1930, 31,449 missionaries were set apart for fulltime missions. Worldwide Church membership more than tripled from 183,000 to 663,000. Thirty-two stakes developed into 104 stakes. By the end of the 1920s, missionaries were serving in twenty-seven nations and three territories. Significant new missionary efforts were begun in Japan, Bolivia, Brazil, and the island country of Tonga, in addition to the new efforts in Argentina and South America that I have just described.<br><br>Beginning in 1930, national attitudes toward members of the Church entered a new stage:<br><br><i>Several factors brought it on. Radio began carrying throughout the country broadcasts of the remarkable Mormon Tabernacle Choir. The Church's care-for-our-own teachings that led to a new vigor in the Welfare system during the depths of the depression conveyed an impression of character and independence. For the first time, the balance of magazine articles about the Church became, in the mid-30s, more positive than negative.</i><br><br>[President]<i>Heber J. Grant did much to lift the image of the Church with national business and political leaders. Attitudes improved steadily during the following years as the Church's patriotism and loyalty were demonstrated during World War II, as Mormons became prominent in government, business, sports, and other fields, and as a growing missionary system and membership brought Mormons into neighborly contact with much of the population.</i>[Smart, "Changing Attitudes"]<br><br>During the four decades from 1930 to 1970, 106,799 full-time missionaries were set apart. Worldwide Church membership increased fourfold from 663,000 to 2,807,456. More than one million new members were added just in the decade of the 1960s. One hundred and four stakes developed into 630 stakes. By 1970, missionaries were serving in forty-three nations and nine territories. During this forty-year period, the South American nations of Uruguay, Paraguay, Ecuador, Colombia, Peru, and Venezuela were opened to missionary work. Church leaders reopened missionary work in Chile. In Central America, servants of the Lord unlocked the nations of Panama, Costa Rica, Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, and Nicaragua. In Asia, major new efforts began to bear fruit in Korea, Taiwan, Singapore, and the Philippines.<br><br>Of course, persecutions will always be with us, just as the Prophet Joseph prophesied. In recent years, the Church has been attacked openly by the producers of the film<i>The Godmakers.</i>A concerted effort by this band of enemies of the Church is underway at this very hour. During recent media coverage of forged documents related to Church history, Elder Dallin H. Oaks detailed instances of blatant misrepresentation and distortion (remember how calumny may defame) and how corrective information was ignored by prominent newspapers such as the<i>New York Times</i>and the<i>Los Angeles Times.</i>Malicious charges leveled against prominent leaders of the Church have not ended. The adversary has not ceased to work. Today we continue to face opposition, and we can expect it to continue as we endeavor to move this great work forward.<br><h2><b>The Challenges of Continuing Growth</b></h2><br>Nevertheless, we are now seeing a great acceleration in the fulfillment of Joseph Smith's prophecy that the "Truth of God will penetrate every continent, visit every clime, sweep every country, and sound in every ear."<br><br>President Spencer W. Kimball led the Church to new heights in carrying the gospel to the people of the world. The Church called many more missionaries, and a greatly increased number of missionaries from their native lands were enlisted into the work. President Kimball called for a widened vision of the work and asked members of the Church to lengthen their stride in moving the gospel across the face of the earth. He called upon the Church to use all of the media--newspapers, magazines, television, radio--in their greatest power to convey the gospel message to the unreached millions throughout the earth.<br><br>During the fifteen years from 1970 to the end of 1985 when President Kimball died, 230,195 missionaries were set apart to serve full-time missions, more than double the number set apart in the preceding forty years. Worldwide Church membership grew from 2,807,456 to 5,919,481--three million additional members. The number of stakes increased from 630 to 1,582. Missionary work was opened or reopened in many countries including India, Sri Lanka, Malaysia, the Dominican Republic, Haiti, Micronesia, Kiribati, and other island nations in the Caribbean and the Pacific. Conversion miracles were happening in many lands. I give an example from my own ministry.<br><br>During the last week of January 1988, the First Presidency sent me to Lima, Peru, where we had eleven stakes of the Church. Because of the rapid and healthy growth of the Church in that city, I and the Area Presidency had the privilege of organizing seven additional stakes in one weekend to make a total of eighteen stakes. I truly saw my grandfather's and Joseph Smith's prophecies fulfilled. A miracle had been accomplished there by the power of the Lord's Spirit working through his authorized servants, the missionaries.<br><br>In the continent of South America, the one mission organized in 1925 has now been divided into thirty-eight. The sixteen people present at the original Church meeting now have multiplied many times over into a Church membership in South America of more than 900,000 people organized into more than 200 stakes of Zion. The three missionaries who arrived in Buenos Aires in 1925 have swelled into an army of 5,650. Four temples are now in operation, with more to be constructed in the future.<br><br>We now are led by another great prophet-leader, President Ezra Taft Benson. During the three years that he has presided over the Church, fulfillment of prophecy is apparent to every spiritually attuned observer. During the short period, almost four years now, 90,000 missionaries have been set apart and sent into the world to proclaim the glad tidings of the Restoration. Worldwide Church membership has now increased to more than 7,000,000. We now have 1,736 stakes of Zion. Our current force of 40,000 missionaries, serving in 226 missions in eighty-eight nations and twenty-two territories, has brought by the power of the Spirit more than 256,000 convert baptisms in 1988. Converts for 1989 will likely exceed 300,000. The Book of Mormon is being distributed and read as never before in our history.<br><br>The day of 50,000 to 60,000 full-time missionaries is not far off; the work will continue to grow and prosper throughout the world. You probably have read about the near-miraculous approval given to the Church by the government of the German Democratic Republic to allow foreign missionaries to teach in the German Democratic Republic and to allow their youth to serve outside their country. In recent years, the Lord's servants have unlocked the door and opened the work in Poland, Hungary, and Yugoslavia as well. They have opened many nations of Africa, including Zimbabwe, Nigeria, Ghana, Zaire, Liberia, Sierra Leone, Swaziland, and the Ivory Coast. Twenty-two nations and territories have been opened in just the last five years. Many others have been opened and will be opened to the preaching of the gospel.<br><br>I feel the same as Orson Pratt when he said in 1859:<br><br><i>How could a young man, inexperienced as Joseph Smith was, have had all this foreknowledge of future events, unless he was inspired of God?</i>. . .<i>How could he know, if a church should arise, that it would have any influence beyond his own neighbourhood? How did he know it would extend through the State of New York, where it was first raised? How could he know that it would extend over the United States, and much more, that it would go to all nations and kingdoms of the Gentiles?</i>. . .<br><br><i>To prophesy that a church would arise and have place in all the nations and kingdoms of the Gentiles, and then to prophesy that the "mother of harlots" would gather together vast multitudes among all these nations and fight against the Saints, is taking a step far beyond what an imposter would undertake, if he were disposed to successfully impose upon mankind.</i>[<i>JD</i>7:182–83]<br><br>I wonder what Brother Pratt would add if he saw the growth of the Church in our day. This review of Church growth from the Prophet's time to ours is one more reason we know without question that Joseph Smith was a prophet of God.<br><br>When Elder Larsen and I witnessed firsthand the profound growth of the Church in the face of the current violence and challenges in South America, my testimony was expanded greatly. My testimony to you students is that this is the Church of Jesus Christ, and the Savior's work will continue to roll forth in the world. Those of you who are preparing to serve the Lord as missionaries, I call upon you to prepare well. Your day in Church history is yet to be written. It will be what you make of it. To those of you who have returned from your missionary service, remain true and faithful, for you will lead the Church in the coming years with the challenges of continued growth.<br><br>Oh, that I would have the power to open your eyes and cause you to see the vision of what yet lies ahead. Many of you sitting here as students of Brigham Young University will carry a remarkable role in fulfilling the prophecies of the Prophet Joseph Smith until that day does come when the great Jehovah shall say, "It is enough."<br><br>God bless you my beloved young people that your faith may be strong and powerful, that you will be up to that responsibility that will surely be yours. I testify to you that I know Jesus Christ is the Son of God. He presides over this work. He is directing it through his prophets and his apostles here upon the earth. To this I testify, leaving my witness and blessing with you that we will not shrink from our responsibility in writing the future history of 1989 until the great Jehovah comes once again. For this I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>M.
